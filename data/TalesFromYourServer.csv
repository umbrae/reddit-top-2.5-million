Got a 3 top last night.  Mom, dad, and tween daughter.  It's slow so I bring the parents a few samples of our specialty beers we make ourselves.  Dad orders a large beer, mom a diet and daughter? No peep out of her.  She doesn't look up from her phone.  Mom says to her, ""Sweety, put your phone down, look the girl in the eye and order a drink.""  She looks up at me, apologizes, then asks for a water. 

I bring them their drinks, give them a few minutes, then go over to take their order.  Mom orders a salad, dad orders a french dip, and daughter? Again, no peep.  I repeat myself and say, ""Miss?  What would you like?"" No response.  Staring at phone.

Without missing a beat, mom looks at me and says, ""She's not going to eat.  If she can't look at you and order her food, she's not eating.""

Alrightythen!  

When I bring the food to their table, the tween looks up at me and says ""What? Why didn't you guys order for me??""  Mom looks over at her and says ""If you had manners, you would have gotten food, but you decided to ignore the lady, who is just trying to do her job, and now you can wait until we get home before you eat.""

1360603937.0,348,self.TalesFromYourServer,18bh1f,Absolutely worst super racist table of 20 I've had in 6 years of serving.  I hugged every co-worker when they left.  I'm not even a big hugger.  ,392,44,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/18bh1f/absolutely_worst_super_racist_table_of_20_ive_had/,"Let me start by saying I usually never rant about tables.  Bad tables happen.  I've been doing this for six years at the same place and in line to start managing at a high volume casual dining restaurant.  I rarely have issues with my tables.  I can charm the pants off of preeeeetty much anybody.  

But, this.  This table.  

Last night, party of 20 at 4:30.  It was made up of about 7 teenage girls celebrating a 17th birthday and their parents.  I make it an absolute point not to judge a table on socioeconomic or racial basis.  That just reinforces a terrible tip.  We add gratuity on parties of that size, so I'm not worried.  I'm sharing the party with a space cadet new server and am in a huge closing section.  

Party trickles in.  Not a big deal.  Had to tell a few guests how much alcoholic drinks were (not listed in our menu.) Gladly checked.  Drink ordering took a hot minute because of all the questions.  Fine with it.  I get it.  Finally they all show up at 5:30 and want to order.

Four people tell me their order at once.  FOUR.  Majority of party didn't even open the menu to read and had a multitude of questions.  My favorite:

Guest: ""You got potatoes?""  
Me: ""Yes ma'am.  Here is the page with the potatoes.""  
Guest: ""You ain't got no shrimp potatoes?""  
Me: ""No ma'am.  I can add a side of shrimp to anything.""  
Guest: ""So you ain't got no shrimp potatoes?""    
Me: "".....no.""  After taking an incredible amount of complicated and special orders, I Stepford-wife smiled and said, ""What do you envision eating?  Let me know what you'd like to eat, and I'll figure out how to get the kitchen to make it.""
Guest: ""How much would that be?""
Me: ""I'll have to go run a quote for you, but you'll have to give me a little while."" (She wanted a potato with bacon, cheese, alfredo, and fried shrimp on the potato with a side of broccoli.  Because, you know, restaurants serve that delicacy all the time.)  
Guest: ""I'll just get the grilled chicken potato.""  
NERDS!

I had to repeat soups of the day (listed in the menu) seven times.  SEVEN TIMES.  It took me about 20-30 minutes to get 20 orders. I'm still unshaken.  It's happened to me before.  I get it.  Some people don't go to restaurants often, and when they do they want what they want.  

At this point, I've given up any chance to make any money.  I've given away all of my other tables to concentrate on this one.  I send space cadet sever to get refills and just take my other tables.  She was a speed bump and the table hated her already.  I knew she'd crack. 

They had extremely complicated separate checks, but I diligently took note.  Despite talking over each other, having people on checks on opposite ends of tables, playing musical chairs, and changing their minds on who to pay for, I had it down. 

Food comes out.  Kitchen did mess up an order and gave a vegetarian teenage girl a turkey burger instead of a garden burger.  Our food runner was super new and grabbed the wrong item.  She took a bite.  She was rightfully upset, I do my due diligence and get a manager.  We only had a manager in training who was comp happy.  Not only did they comp her food, he comp'd the food *of the girl sitting next to her who had no problem with the food* because her friend was upset about the service.  She had the gall to say *I had an attitude*.  I was Mary-effin-sunshine despite being abused!  She ate her food.  All of it.  

The only chance I had to make money was in the gratuity. She had the gall to complain about the *service* after I was running my ass off.

After they realized that could happen, the well done rib eye was sent back for being...well done.  Shrimp skewers were sent back for being cold.  Desserts were purchased on the house.  Chowder loaf was sent back for being ""sour.""  She got a free sandwich instead with dessert.  Once one of the girls ordered dessert (who had no issue with her food) realized she had to pay for her dessert, she canceled it after it was at the table.  

The teenage side of the table started plain abusing me.  Every second I heard, ""Miss.  Miss.  Can we get another side of ranch?  Today?  Please?""   I was *running*.  Extra sides, extra napkins, chugging drinks.  It happens.  I'm plenty annoyed by the comps, but life goes on.  

I happened to hear one of the teenagers laugh and say, *""Haha, we're making this cracker girl run so hard!""* 

That.  That's when I lost it.  

I sat in the beer cooler, shaking.  If you're going to abuse me, you have to pay me.  I'd rather take five dollars a head and have them knee me in my hoo-hah.  That would have felt better than serving a table whose only purpose was to get free stuff and make my life hell because I'm white.    

Their tab was $450.  The comps were $150.  That's $25 out of my pocket, and my area director (who would be the dude that I have an interview with for management next week) will be asking management why comps were so high.  

Checks came out.  They saw the gratuity.  Complained.  Some got the grat off. I got stiffed by a few tabs.  One guest had two separate cards decline.  I get it.  I'm scraping by too.  She gave me at attitude like I did something wrong.  

Then, after seeing the check totals, they decided to re-separate the checks so they could afford the bills after I perfectly split according to their wishes at the beginning of the meal.  It took another 20 minutes.  

I had the table for 3 and a half hours during our rush.  I made $40 because some didn't want to pay the gratuity.  

Moreover, I got written up for the guest complaint.  It's our policy to have a written documentation of guest complaints despite if the guests are belligerent or not.  (We're a big restaurant with six dining room managers.  If a server has multiple complaints, it's probably not the guest.)  Usually, managers let it slide if the guests are obviously turds, but we only had over-zealous manager in training.

If my GM doesn't throw it out, I may not be able to get promoted because of a teenage girl who wanted free food.  (He will though.  Oh, he will.) If not, this girl may have cost me $20,000-$30,000. (Base pay for dining managers dances around 50k.)       

Once they left, I hugged EVERYBODY.  I'm not a huge fan of hugs.  I hugged my line cooks, every server, EVERYONE...even my creepy MIT who screwed me over yet still offers to take me for drinks.  I was SO happy that table was out of my life.  

Sorry about the length.  I don't even care if people read it! I just needed to write it.  Lord Jesus I hate working Sundays.  

**tl;dr Despite chipper attitude and best service I could offer, stereotypical African American party of 20 laughed and said, ""We're running this cracker girl so hard,"" had over $150 in comps for no reason, most refused to pay gratuity, and a teenager complained about me having an attitude to get free meal and I may not be promoted to management because of it.**

1370273409.0,339,self.TalesFromYourServer,1fl2y1,Your gluten allergy is fake and I hate you,458,119,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1fl2y1/your_gluten_allergy_is_fake_and_i_hate_you/,"A server will never say this to your face but we all know your gluten allergy is fake. You are not allergic to gluten. You are just on a gluten-free diet and want attention. There are plenty of people who are truly allergic to gluten, or sensitive, or intolerant, and you are not one of them. We can tell. You’re on nothing more than a high-powered Atkins diet, and while it’s great that you’re feeling healthier, it’s not great that you blame the discrepancy between your previous and current state of health on a fictional allergy. Feel free to adopt a gluten free diet, but don’t throw the word ‘allergy’ around like you have a medical problem. Especially in a restaurant, the word ‘allergy’ means that the whole restaurant is going to need to do extra work and take special care to keep you safe, healthy, and happy. If your ‘allergy’ is really just a diet with no medical basis, you are being a selfish ass. The world does not revolve around you, the restaurant does not revolve around you, and we all know your allergy is fake.

Your gluten allergy is fake because you discuss it at parties. Your gluten allergy is fake because it ‘comes and goes.’ Your gluten allergy is fake because you will eat at an Italian restaurant but walk away fine because you ordered the gluten free pasta. Your gluten allergy is fake because after reminding your server ten times that you’re highly allergic, you complain to a manager that you were never brought a basket of bread. Your gluten allergy is fake because you asked your server for gluten free biscuits, but extra gravy, please. Your gluten allergy is fake because you didn’t spend months or years in crippling pain and constant digestive distress before cutting gluten from your diet. Your gluten allergy is fake because you only realized you had the allergy after spending a day sick watching daytime television and hearing about the allergy on The View, shrieked at you by a dozen airheaded harpies who have latched on to gluten as the current ‘Number One Threat to Americans and Their Children.’ 

If you’re sure your gluten allergy is real because you cut out gluten and suddenly felt better, congratulations, you’re on a diet. Improved diet usually results in feeling refreshed and renewed. If you’re the kind of talk-show health nut that takes medical advice from Dr. Oz or Oprah, then don’t be surprised when you cut out pasta, processed bread products, and most desserts and are rewarded with a feeling of better health. You’re not dealing with an allergy, you’re on a diet. The Atkins and Paleo diet are both nearly gluten-free, and both are great diet options for people with weight and health issues. However, a change in health doesn’t mean there was an allergy involved. Real gluten allergies and Celiac disease cause vomiting, migraines, and crippling pain, not a vague malaise otherwise known as being a daytime TV couch potato with nothing to live for besides keeping up with the Kardashians and complaining about the woman next door who is clearly an unfit mother, just look at what her kids are wearing to school these days. Saying ‘I cut gluten from my diet, now I feel better, I was allergic to gluten!’ is like saying ‘I stopped watching television sixteen hours a day, I don’t have headaches anymore, I was allergic to television!’ It’s a casual way of trivializing the actual issues of those who physically cannot watch television due to brain tumors or chronic migraines. It’s fine to cut television from your life, just like it’s fine to cut gluten from your diet, but it’s very important to know where ‘lifestyle change’ ends and ‘medical condition’ begins.

If you have a real gluten allergy, you won’t just “feel better” after cutting out gluten, you will be in almost constant discomfort before you figure out what’s wrong. Gluten conditions affect approximately five percent of people, and range from a slight sensitivity to a severe allergy, and both can be controlled by limiting, and sometimes completely cutting out gluten intake. Some gluten sensitivities are so negligible that they might go completely unnoticed; some are so severe that even a few crumbs can cause serious discomfort for weeks. The most severe gluten-related condition is Celiac disease. The condition affects less than one percent of people, and while there is no cure, can be controlled by a strictly gluten-free diet and strict sanitation protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Living with Celiac disease is time and labor intensive, and no one suffering from the condition would be happy to hear about other faking the same symptoms. There’s nothing fun or trendy about having a medical condition that severely limits your diet. Tracie, a friend of mine living with a gluten intolerance, told me that she couldn’t “understand why anyone would think this is fun, or cool. It’s miserable. I would trade out in a second, and they all want to trade in?” No one would claim a peanut allergy just for fun, yet so many are describing their new diets in terms of allergies. While people with real gluten-related conditions exist, they number perhaps one in a hundred people, yet up to one in ten will claim to have the condition to some extent. 

Having a gluten allergy is just another item on the list of trendy and socially acceptable disorders and diseases such as OCD and bipolar disorder. It’s common to see Facebook status updates along the lines of ‘cleaned my room today, my ocd is so bad lol’ or ‘I woke up in such a good mood but now I’m mad, why am i so bipolar.’ This “trend” of being proud of chemical imbalances and collecting them like Pokemon cards has resulted in a wave of misinformation and inaccurate self-diagnoses that both invalidate the troubles of those with actual problems and make it more difficult for those with real medical problems to get treatment and be respected, especially in a restaurant.

People with true gluten allergies or Celiac disease don’t go to an Italian restaurant and order the fettuccine alfredo with gluten free pasta, because those with real allergies can’t take such a risk of cross-contamination. If someone has a severe allergy, ordering the salad without croutons won’t always solve the problem. Every knife, every plate, every surface their food comes in contact with will need to be sanitized, and in a gluten-heavy environment, it’s impossible to guarantee such sterilization on a moment’s notice. Those with severe medical issues are acutely aware of how difficult it is to keep food sterile, and won’t take the chance. Those with sensitivities or tolerances might have no issue ordering a gluten-free version of a dish, because cutting out 95% of the gluten puts it within their realms of comfort. Even so, unless specifically advertised as gluten-, peanut-, or shellfish-free, no restaurant is capable of maintaining a cross-contamination-free kitchen. It would take an hour to make a single burger if that were so, and there would have to be ten dishwashers working around the clock just to keep up. All restaurants have some basic cross-contamination, but this doesn’t mean restaurant kitchens are dirty. Restaurant kitchens are cleaner than residential kitchens. Restaurant kitchens follow a lot of strict guidelines and constantly seek to maintain an ‘A’ health code rating. Even the cleanest residential kitchen might merit a C at best. However, even at the height of hygiene in any restaurant, knives get used for more than one task, cutting boards get washed periodically, not constantly, and cookware isn’t scoured and deep cleaned every few minutes. Commercial kitchens crank out hundreds of meals in a few hours, and it is impossible to devote an entire freshly cleaned facility to one meal. So while a restaurant kitchen can certainly guarantee that they will not put any egg in a salad, they can’t guarantee that every single ingredient and prep surface never touched an egg for any period of time. You’ll never see someone with a severe peanut allergy in a Thai restaurant. It’s not worth the risk. Those with severe peanut allergies take care to personally steer clear of risky situations. 

However, in the age of the helicopter mom and worldwide safety zone, entire grade schools are now peanut-free to protect the one child on campus with a moderate peanut allergy, teaching him that the entire world revolves around his little need, and he has no personal obligation to educate himself on and avoid one of the world’s most popular agricultural products, being produced in excess of 30 million tons per year. And when that boy’s mother orders in a restaurant, she doesn’t take a moment to consider the menu, the venue, or any degree of reason when selecting her entree. She orders whatever she likes, and if it doesn’t fit within her dietary restrictions, she just asks for it to be modified. ‘Biscuits and gravy MOD: GLUTEN FREE’ printing out of the ticket printer can send the most seasoned chef into conniptions. Every ingredient in biscuits and gravy contains gluten, and unless specifically advertised as available, should not be considered within the realm of reasonable gluten modifications. Feel free to order a burger without a bun, or replace the garlic bread with a cup of soup, but remember that if you’re not in a gluten free restaurant, gluten-related requests shouldn’t compromise every ingredient of a dish to the point of being utterly unrecognizable. If you want something that isn’t on the menu, eat somewhere else.

Allergies are taken very seriously to ensure the safety of customers, and the protocols involved in creating an allergen-free dish are not to be taken lightly, or bandied about by fools merely seeking special attention. Having an allergy means that you must constantly guard yourself, all day every day, and one slip-up might cause discomfort, severe pain, or hospitalization. In the case of a genuine allergy, most kitchens are willing to work very hard to ensure your safety. Wasting that much time and effort of an entire restaurant’s staff might seem unthinkable, but some customers think nothing of it as they announce their allergy to their server within the first thirty seconds of being seated. Dealing with an allergy throws an entire kitchen out of its rhythm, requiring fresh gloves, fresh knives, fresh dishes, fresh prep bins, fresh cutting boards, and fresh cookware, all to meet the needs of one self-entitled attention whore whose dietary needs are dictated to her by a panel of vapid, aging, moronic twats whose optimistically described “talk show” contains a smaller proportion of genuine content than each hosts’ facial structure.

**OKAY HERE WE** ***GO!!***


So a slightly larger table came in and it was a few adults, a mother and her kid, about 5. I'm not sure that any other kids were present. Well the kid starts doing what kids do when their parents don't give a fuck, which is running around and getting in the way. 

After the kid finally fits and sits, he turns his attention to the wall. Now, keep in mind, the cook (my boss) can see EVERYTHING this kid is doing. He has some things hanging on the behind the table they were sitting at. Hand-painted stuff, shelves, pictures. Some of the stuff were gifts from good customers. Well, the kid starts touching the stuff on the wall.

The cook notices, and he says nicely, but a little assertively, with some authority through the window:

""Hey, please do not touch the stuff hanging on the walls.""

The mother gives him this WTF-are-you-doing-talking-to-my-kid-like-that look, you know, the one where their ""speshul snowflake"" can do no wrong, how dare you?

she fires back ""Excuse me, but we do NOT yell at our children."" In a very entitled bitchy voice.

Without missing a beat, the cook fires back with:

""Then maybe you ought to. I'm okay with kids being kids and running around the restaurant, but I will not tolerate them touching the stuff on the walls that's not theirs to touch. Your child is no more special than my own children, and they were brought up to behave in a restaurant."" And he went back to cooking. The other people in her party were holding back snickers and tried to keep from laughing.

The lady SNATCHED her oh so special snowflake of a heathen child, and whisked him out the door, never to be seen again. The rest of the table seemed to relax a little, and it seemed that they had the most peaceful dinner without the entitled lady, and her special snowflake, in a while.

I explain that Applebees is a chain restaurant and I have no idea exactly what they want us to serve them. I'm hoping they mean a particular type of salad, ie caesar, that they remember getting at Applebees and will be able to clarify. I watch as she goes back over to the table, where the following conversation occurs. 

Her: Do you remember what was in this salad?
Customer: APPLEBEES salad! Why don't you understand this!?
Her: Well sir, this isn't an Applebees, so our kitchen won't know what they put in their salads. And I'm sure they serve several types of salad. But if you can remember what was-
Customer: APPLEBEES SALAD! How do you not know what that is? Do they not have food in China or something? Every time I get some damn mail-order bride waiting on me they screw it up. 
Her: (almost in tears) I'm sorry, I'm just not sure what you want.
Customer: It doesn't matter what restaurant this is, you should know what's in an Applebees salad! I guess you have no life and never eat out!

So I was hosting last Saturday, and it was going pretty well. we were on a medium-sized wait (graduation day for colleges in my city) so we had a lot of 10+ parties coming in, leading to a 30+ minute wait time for pretty much any big party. we had a lot of guests that day, and i even managed to strike up a conversation with a cool guy in a 12-top by the name of Dave(relevant later). It was around 12 that I encountered a 11-top party that was (apparently) celebrating a daughter's graduation from nursing school. The mother of the girl (let's call her bitchmom) came up to me to check in, and I informed them that it would be about a 30 to 45-minute wait, since we had 3 large parties on the wait in front of them. The bitch stare she gave me could melt steel as she begrudgingly took a pager and sat down with her party. 

I was chatting with dave for a short while when 20 minutes later, bitchmom comes up and asks me what her place in line is. I told her that her party moved up one spot(Dave's party was about to be sat), and that it might be another 20-35 minutes. At this point, they call up Dave's party and seat them. Bitchmom gets pissed and asks me why they would seat a bigger party than theirs when she and her party were ""obviously here first."" I informed her than Dave's party had been patiently waiting for almost 50 minutes. Bitchmom obviously didn't believe me, so in the snottiest tone, she said ""You know what? Lemme speak to y'all's manager. I ain't happy with this shit"".  As I'm calling over my manager, she proceeds to bitch me out on my ""shitty service"" when around this time, Dave passes by on his way to the restroom and happens to catch the process. He walks up to her straight up, and asks her what her problem is with me. Her death stare while she bitched him out about me was so evil, it would make Satan cringe. My manager (finally) arrives, and bitchmom outright LIES about me (saying I had seated parties that had just gotten here, giving her 8 different quote times, etc) and Dave stops her halfway through her rant, stating that the wait is absolutely NOT my fault and that I've been the most courteous, polite employee he's had the chance of meeting. He went on to say that he was next to her while I was giving her the quote times, and that she was lying about the quote times I had supposedly given her. Her face almost went supernova red with rage. She looked like she was about to try and lay a beating on him, but she just scoffed loudly, and left the restaurant with her party. My manager was about to call her back into the restaurant, but Dave grabbed him by the shoulder and said ""Don't bother. I know her. That's my brother's sister in law. She's like this at every single restaurant when she doesn't get her way. And she tips like shit, so I wouldn't bother."" So he watched as the angry woman bursted out of the doors and walked out.

I thought my manager was gonna fire me when he pulled me aside, but i was relieved to hear he was astounded by my control of the situation, and basically told me good job on handling myself under pressure.

 I saw Dave again as he was leaving, and told him, ""Hey, thanks so much for sticking up for me back there. I cant  believe a woman like that is part of your family."" To which he said, ""Oh the angry chick? Oh that's not my bro's sis in law, I just didn't appreciate her talking shit to you. Have an awesome night, man!"" And he left.

It was a slower night, Sunday or Monday maybe?  About 25 or so people in the bar.  The owner would hang out/work most nights and everyone knew him.  About 10:30 or so, a gentleman politely pulls the owner aside and tells him there is a couple in the men's room having sex.  The owner being the nice guy he is decides to be nice, and he goes and opens the door, gives a little cough(the hey cut it out cough) turns off the light and closes the door thinking that will let them know to cut it the fuck out and get out.  A couple minutes go by and the light comes back on and no one comes out.  So the owner tries one more time to be polite, but this time he makes the cough completely obvious in the fact that I could hear it in the bar, and it was definitely a ""this is fucking rude, cut it the fuck out"" cough.  Wait another couple minutes, the light comes back on and still no one comes out.  Now the owner is pissed, he takes this opportunity and stands up at the end of the bar and gets everyone's attention(about 25 people) and says ""Well, I just felt I should inform everyone not to use the men's room for a little bit.  We have a couple in there that felt they couldn't wait to get home to show their affection for one another.  On that note, I thought it would be really nice of us to congratulate them on being the couple of the year, so if everyone wants to line up on both sides of the bathroom door, we'll give them a big round of applause when they come out.  Also, if you come help us out, we will give you a free beer for interrupting your otherwise pleasant evening.""  People line up on both sides of the door forming a path for the couple to exit from and he takes bottles of bud light and distributes them down the line of people.  Needless to say, hilarity ensued.  The couple finally came out, the woman ducked her head and bolted for the door, and the guy came out and did a little bow and proceeded to walk to the bar for another drink.  The owner walked over to him and said, ""you better go find your girl, cause you sure as hell ain't getting another drink here.""",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_180doy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/180doy/sex_in_the_bathroom/,

Great place, amazing food, incredible wine selection.  You see a LOT of money flow through this place, black titanium AMEX cards passed over to me on a regular basis.

A few months back, I look over and see a new table in my section.  5 men, looked straight out of a Mafia movie.  Big Italians, nice suits, intimidating to say the least.

They're having a great time, ordering expensive wine ($200+ a bottle), talking ""business"".  One of those tables where I cut the chit chat, mainly just serve them, making a joke here or there.  Out comes dessert.  They wanted to try all of the desserts so I had the kitchen put them all on a platter for the middle of the table.  I go to drop the platter off, clear space in the middle and am about to put it down.

Big Guy Enforcer Type: ""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" He practically yelled this, in the deepest booming voice I could ever imagine. He's scowling at me.  

All I can think is ""Oh shit. I'm going to get killed.  The last night of my life was spent serving the mob, and I know I'm wearing ridiculous underwear that the mortician will probably make fun of!"" That was seriously my thoughts at the time.

Me (stammering): ""Uhh, just dropping off your dessert.  Is there a problem with the platter?""

Big Guy Enforcer Type: ""Yeah.  You're putting it in the middle of the table.  Those goons don't need any dessert.  Look at me, I'm a big guy here!""

They all start laughing... so do I.  Hey! I'm not getting murdered! Yay!

Big Guy Enforcer Type: ""You're a good kid! I like you! Gino, leave this guy a good tip.  He deserves it.""

They finish up, pay in cash (of course).  I check out the billfold and $300 left on top of the total of their bill.  I am over the top happy.  Didn't die, and made $300 extra dollars that night.

I lived to serve another day.

Background on me: I'm a burly dude with tattoos and a giant beard, sometimes it's intimidating, but not purposely so, I'm not an ass.  Due to the fact that at this point of my life I was a recent veteran and just didn't have time for stupid customer BS there wasn't a lot I put up with. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. My deal is this; part of the respect I'm giving you is assuming you're an adult and holding you to that standard. This means I expect you to treat people with decency and do right.  Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. 

Now on to the tale:

I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says ""hello, nice to meet you"" quite as eloquently as ""I'll have a diet, she'll have a diet, and he wants an iced tea"". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight.

When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, ""This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two""

In my head I said, ""I'm not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar""

What I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, ""Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave."" And before he could respond I added ""Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?""

I could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly (that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit) gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous.

At the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20%.

She's been a flight attendant for the last 35 years, and she definitely considers herself an employee in the service industry. While a 737 isn't a restaurant and my mother isn't technically a server, quite a few passengers have trouble making that distinction.

My mom was working first class on a morning flight to Maui, one of her favorites. Three younger men board in a cheerful and rowdy mood, but they were polite enough. They took their seats in first class and immediately ordered drinks, nothing unusual.

Two to three hours into the flight, after his third drink, one of the three is obviously wasted. He's cackling and yelling loudly across the aisle to his friends, punctuating his speech with profanity, and overall disrupting the whole cabin. He asks my mom for another drink, and she decides to cut him off. When my mom kindly tells him she's not serving him any more alcohol, he shits the bed.

Not many flight attendants cut people off these days, most thinking it's not worth the hassle, but my mom's been flying since the days when kowtowing to drunk, disrespectful businessmen was part of the job description, and she isn't having it. This dude starts throwing a fit, berating my mom for refusing to serve him, much to the shock of the entire cabin. My mom can take it and is prepared to stand her ground, when suddenly the older woman seated next to the drunk passenger pipes up.

""EXCUSE ME,"" she shouts angrily to the drunk guy. ""Do you hear yourself? You have been nothing but a disruption this entire flight. It is quite clear that you possess neither the self-control nor the common decency for air travel, let alone for first class. You should be ashamed. If your dependency on booze is so strong that you can't go without for another two hours, why not have some straight from the source?""

With that, she takes a travel-size bottle of hand sanitizer from her purse and squirts the entire bottle into the man's empty drink glass. His two buddies (neither of whom had been particularly disruptive) start laughing uncontrollably at their friend, who finally realizes it's best to cut his losses. The drunk passenger gets up to use the lav and doesn't come out for at least 15 minutes. His friends apologize for his behavior, and after he emerges he spends the rest of the flight in silence on his laptop, headphones on. The woman next to him goes back to her book.

The older woman stayed behind after deplaning, as she'd requested a wheelchair. Upon leaving, she hands my mom a feedback form commending her service and thanks her. My mom gave her a bottle of wine.

People would come in often to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, proms, and I loved being able to share momentous occasions with such happy, complete strangers.  

One night, two cute older ladies came in, and asked to sit in the back of the restaurant, ""away from the noise"".  It happened to be in my section.  I approached the table with the usual small talk, and asked if they were celebrating anything.  They laughed and said no, just out for a nice meal.  They were super nice the entire time, and I got to have some fun, short conversations with them while they were between courses.  While I was clearing their plates from their main course, one of them grabbed my arm and looked at me with tears in her eyes.  She said, ""We actually are celebrating something tonight.  It's our 25th anniversary.""  I was surprised they declined to share that with me, and congratulated them on such a wonderful milestone--I experience so many 1 year, 5 year, 6 year anniversaries, but rarely anything longer than 20.  I offered them the standard celebratory dessert, but again they declined.

She went on to tell me that this is the first night for a very long time that they've gone out in public together.  They usually celebrate birthdays and anniversaries by ordering delivery and staying in over some wine and a movie, or else one of them will go out to grab food and bring it back home for the other.  They told me about the awful experiences they had 20 years ago, the way people would treat them and their relationship anytime they were publicly affectionate.  It apparently traumatized them enough to be afraid to go out together for the next 20 years.  They decided that tonight, being such a big deal to both of them, they would suck it up and face the world.  

The other one took my hand too, and all three of us were crying by this point.  They thanked me for making them feel so special, for treating them like human beings, and for sharing their special night with them.  I brought out a quiet dessert, and instead of a candle, the chefs in the back wrote them a sweet, subtle note in chocolate.  More crying.

At the time I was working at a mid to upper scale family owed Mediterranean restaurant. The back of the place is a patio. It's dimly lit and is easily a good place for a nice, romantic evening. 

On this particular day, I was placed in the busiest section of the place. Six tables inside plus a big top outside. Since it's family owned, there isn't much regulation on the amount of tables one server can have at a time. 

I was waiting on two women. They were clearly good friends meeting up for dinner. On the patio, I had a couple. The man was older and his, from what I had gathered, date was noticeably younger. The meal was about midway through when I notice one woman at the table inside looking distraught and feverishly talking to her friend. Suddenly, she stands up to get a better look outside to the patio. She marches out to the patio, obviously furious, and I hear some screaming. The woman comes marching back into the restaurant and runs out of the front door. Following her tail, the man from the patio follows her out. 

I tell a couple of co-workers what I had just witnessed and we look outside to see a full fledges screaming match between the two in the parking lot. Surely enough, the second woman at the table inside gets a phone call and I am prompted for the check. She pays for her and her friends meal and leaves immediately. As for the date outside.. the man never comes back. She is embarrassingly forced to pay for the rather expensive meal and leaves shortly after.

This story is one from my younger sister, who has actually made quite an impressive career out of food and beverage service. She is easily one of the hardest workers I have ever seen, regularly walking upwards of 5 miles per day at the high end resort/spa that she is bar-tending at now. Knowing how physically demanding her work is, stories like the one that follow absolutely infuriate me.

This was from about 7 years ago when she was a fresh from high-school grad working at a national chain of sit-down restaurants that isn't exactly a high-class joint, but none the less, 15% gratuity or higher was the norm for this part of town/restaurant.

Over the years, and especially during our time apart while stationed in California, I have heard many tales of well-intentioned customers that just don't understand how food service wages work. This is not a story of the average parochial penny pincher, it is the horrific tale of a group of the cheapest, most self-entitled people she has ever met.

There was a particular group of regulars that would come in every 3rd or 4th Sunday at 12:15pm on the nose. They knew it all; how to sit (spreading out over 3-4 tables at times) and divide their checks to avoid paying the automatically included gratuity for large parties, often ordering nothing but lunch-specials and never anything but water or tea to drink, she's even fairly certain that they started bringing their own containers to put the salsa in, and even caught one of them (see below). There's no way 12-15 people can go through an entire gallon, yes, gallon, of salsa with appropriate amount of chips and still be hungry for an actual meal. Well, that's the trick, 1/2 of them didn't ever order, just munched on free chips and sipped their free water. They would sit and talk about who-knows-what for an hour before the first person even ordered. And of course, none of them ever ordered together, its like they just waited until the mornings donuts and coffee completely cleared their system until they would look at a menu.

This continued, every 3 or 4 weeks for about a year until one day, the day my sister damn near ended up in the fiery pits of fuckitiquits-ville.

They had came in with their usual routine, asking for two tables for 5 guests each, even though there were only 3 guests present, total. My awesome sister (A.S.) was used to the routine, and so had 5 glasses of water on each table and enough chips and salsa to satisfy a herd of angry water buffalo, all before the 4th person, much less 5-10 had shown up.

The moment she saw what happened next she knew she was in for some fun. She had made it almost a game at this point, as the only way to keep from actually flipping shit and inevitably losing her job.

The head honcho, we'll call him Pastor Jeff (PJ), leans over to his child (maybe 4 or 5 she guessed) and reaches in the child's back pack, pulls out a 1 gallon zipper bag, and DUMPS a basket of chips into the bag. A.S. must have startled him as he jerked back quickly, spilling about a third of the contents of the basket onto the floor directly under, you guessed it, his kid's feet.

This could get long(er) if I continue through the many more details she shared with me about this group, but I'll fast forward to the best part.

About 2 hours after PJ, his wife, and their shitty kid originally show up, the party decides for the first time ever, that they all want to leave together. A.S., being her usual well prepared but glass-half-empty self, has their individual checks printed and ready for them to GTFO. That is when all hell broke loose.

The GM of the store, after hearing about these people for the last year, and regular reports of low single digit tipping ($.50-$1 per about $25 seemed to be the norm, not to mention frequent non-monetary tips), had decided that they could no longer skate around the automatic 6+ guest gratuity.

Well this was a NOOOOO GOOOOO for PJ, and the 2 other paying patriarchs.

Their individual checks, for 3, 3, and 4 people respectively, were (about) $30, $35, and $45, INCLUDING the 15% gratuity. Not a huge deal right? I mean, it's like $4, on a $26 check. This was NOT going to happen. Without saying a word to A.S. about it, PJ demanded, not requested, but actually used the phrase, ""I demand"" to speak with a manager.

My sister knew what was up, even though PJ had made it obvious that he wants nothing to do with the lowly woman that serves his food, and has not told her anything with regards to why he wants to see the manager. She heads straight to GM's office, who was already on his way up front after seeing the commotion on the security cameras.

PJ then demands, as both a faithful Christian and customer, that the gratuity be removed so that each party is free to tip as they are individually ""capable"". After about 10 minutes of the GM not budging and even calling the DM for the customer on the GM's personal cell phone and the DM telling the customer how it is, PJ and his posse of padres finally give in a pay their bills and quickly leave, vowing to never return. Good riddance.

That's the end right? Nope, not yet. In all the huff, PJ had forgotten that he had already left his usual tip on the table, a pocket bible with a played out inspirational quote on the inside cover and a fresh crisp $1 bill! Oh wow, a whole dollar!

Needless to say, PJ proudly saunters back in not 5 minutes later, just long enough to have cleaned up the chip crumbs and two hundred empty water glasses (they would request a new glass with ""fresh"" ice every 3rd or 4th refill). He immediately spotted AS from across the restaurant and with almost feminine poise increased his pace in her direction. Before even fully approaching her, he demands that she return his fresh crisp $1 bill, reasoning out loud that she'll ""need the pocket bible to read on your trip to hell.""

What.. The.. FUCK?!?!

My sister, being the A.S. she is, doesn't skip a beat and pulled a wad of sweaty but neatly folded bills from her cleavage and fans out about 6 single bills and says, ""Which one was yours again?""

She said she thought he was going to hit her for a moment, but he just stood there, fists clenched, sweat pouring off his eyebrow from the pure unadulterated rage he was experiencing for what appeared to be the first time ever and just turned and walked out. In case you don't know one personally, it takes quite a show to render a southern baptist preacher speechless.

1374093761.0,224,self.TalesFromYourServer,1iif1n,Flight attendants mean business.,255,31,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1iif1n/flight_attendants_mean_business/,"Hey guys! I hope flight attendant stories fit in here!

This is my mom's story. She's been a flight attendant for almost 35 years now and has earned numerous accolades from her airline and high-level frequent fliers for her phenomenal service. I've never met anyone who works harder or who loves his/her job more.

She is an extremely patient person as well, and can usually diffuse a tough situation and calm folks down (her thinking being hey, everyone just wants to take off and get to Boston/Anchorage/Honolulu on time). Technically, however, post-9/11 the FAA granted flight attendants a lot more jurisdiction over whether P.A.L.D.s (Passengers Acting Like Dicks) fly or not. My mom hardly ever exercises this authority (certainly not as much as other flight attendants), but the douche canoe in this story earned it.

My mom was working her favorite trip - Portland to Maui - and was greeting passengers on a Thursday morning flight boarding in PDX. The airline had recently begun flying to Hawaii, so things were festive (Hawaiian music playing, free Mai Tais, even new Hawaii-themed uniforms for the flight crew). Everyone was in a great mood, passengers and crew, until this guy boards.

He's immediately rude, loud, crude, and obviously drunk off his ass. Behind him is his exasperated young wife, towing a horse-sized diaper bag and their two young, tired-looking kids. The guy remarks to my mom ""You gonna get those drinks comin', hun?"" and laughs like a loon as soon as he steps foot on the plane.

Once they get seated (the guy refuses to sit down or help his wife get their two kids situated), this guy will not shut up. He begins calling friend after friend and has the ""Yo bro, guess where I am right now?"" conversation with each, complete with LOUD profanity. There are a lot of families and young children on this flight, including his own.

All his antics so far are annoying, yet no reason to kick him off the plane. That comes when the guy refuses to put away his phone, meaning my mom can't close the door, meaning a delay, meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel (this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling). Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times, the third request receiving a ""Jesus, calm the fuck down!""

Oh heeeeeelllll no. My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying she's booting him. This guy will only get drunker, and any aggression towards flight crew is not fucking tolerated. She prepares to go into the cockpit to get approval from the pilot to deplane the guy. Pilots can be notoriously uncaring about what happens behind the cockpit door -- ""just take care of it"" is a common response to complaints -- so my mom was prepared to have to argue her case.

But she remembers this flight's captain is Steve, a seasoned pilot who's flown with my mom for 30+ years and has always been famously protective of his flight crews (he always buys dinner for the crew at the hotel, he gives my mom a Christmas present every year, and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job). Awesome guy who won't let anyone do anything to ""his girls"" -- and says so again to my mom. She heads back to deal with Asshat McGee.

She informs him, simply and quietly, that his behavior has thus far been unacceptable, that the captain has deemed him a security risk, and that he must deplane. This guy naturally goes apeshit, screaming things like ""So you're gonna ruin my kids' vacation? What the FUCK!"" My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight, provided he deplanes peacefully (without security) and sobers up.

The guy continues his tirade, when my mom sees his now crying wife starting to pack up the toys around her kids who had finally calmed down. Seeing the distraught look on her face, she tells her, ""Ma'am, there is no need for you or your children to deplane. Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evening's flight."" The wife looks a bit torn for a second, then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice. ""Don't ruin this.""

My mom's been divorced, so she and plenty of other women know that look. They also know that the ""this"" could mean anything from that flight to their entire marriage. My mom also lives fully to the mantra ""Don't you dare fuck shit over for your wife."" Whatever it was, it worked; the guy grabbed his carry-on, muttered ""Man, this is bullshit"", but deplaned. They were able to take off only 10 minutes behind schedule.

While the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving, they soon settled down. My mom ended up talking to that woman quite a bit, and comped meals for her and the kids. The wife was embarrassed and extremely apologetic, but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her. My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landed.

A few weeks later, my mom got a call from her supervisor. Two separate high-level frequent fliers on that flight had written to the airline commending her for how she handled the situation. My mom got a congratulatory letter from corporate and a small bonus (almost unheard of for flight attendants nowadays).

**TL;DR** my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucher.

1373143340.0,224,self.TalesFromYourServer,1hrldh,I did that thing we all think about doing. NSFW-ish,271,47,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hrldh/i_did_that_thing_we_all_think_about_doing_nsfwish/,"I know this is somewhat controversial, and not everyone is going to understand or agree.  But a few of you asked, so I will deliver.  Mildly NSFW because of language.

First and foremost, this is not something I condone, and looking back I wish I hadn't.  I still feel guilty that I stooped that low, but I guess everyone has a limit.

This happened at the same location of [Pasta Nipples](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hes2z/pasta_nipples_nsfw/), as most of my stories are.

This place was a late nite bar, and we also had a full kitchen.  The GM decided that on Friday and Saturday nights, he would rotate the waitresses, and one would be a ""shot girl.""  This night it was me.  Yippee.

A shot girl walked around with this crappy plastic tray, with a set of tube shots that were usually incredibly weak and pre-mixed at the bar, along with stacks of jell-o shots in little plastic to-go ramekins usually used for ranch and stuff.  All of these were cash-only, which I later learned because the GM was pocketing all the cash from the sales.  OH, and you weren't allowed to clock in if you were shot girl, and you only made tip money.  You can imagine how much people love to tip you when all you're doing is walking around with a tray and begging people to buy some.  

ANYWAY.  I was the shot girl, and we were SLAMMED.  You could barely walk through this place.  I was selling hardly any at all, much to the chagrin of my boss.  It starts getting later into the night, and then SHE walks in.

She is the boss' best friend.  She looks to be about 55, but is only about 37, I imagine due to the meth.  Every time she comes in, she announces her arrival, never orders just says ""the usual,"" even though ""the usual"" is a different drink every night.  She's been known for starting fights, stealing, breaking dishes, assaulting employees, NEVER tips, etc.  But since she's the GM's best friend, she gets away with ALL of it.

So tonight I was her target.  It started off with her grabbing me by the ear and dragging me to her table.  Yes, the ear.  She demands a bunch of jell-o shots, I give them to her, and tell her the total.  She tells me to stop being a ""fucking sloppy cunt and buzz off.""  Nope, need cash.  Now.  She continues.  I go grab the bouncer and let him know, he says talk to the boss.  I do, he tells me to give her whatever she wants, just keep track of how many.  Cool.  I go back to work.

Over the course of the night, she manages to break a pint glass, and attempt to stab me with a shard of glass from it when I'm out of the cherry jell-o.  She tripped me twice, causing me to spill my tray both times, for shits and giggles I assume.  She even spit on me while I was on the floor cleaning up the mess she caused.

Enough was enough.  I couldn't take it.  The boss thought she was funny, the bouncers thought she was funny, but all of us girls were sick of her shit.  I said fuck it, took a smoke break outside and decided to plot my revenge.  Then, I remembered.  At about 1:30, the kitchen would give me some tacos and salsa to throw on the tray to try to sell at the end of the night, along with the shots.  The salsa was in the exact same type of ramekin as the jell-o shots.  And it was red, like her favorite flavor of cherry.  So I grabbed a salsa, threw some tabasco, Rumplemintz, pepper, pickle juice, sugar, and plenty of other nasty foodstuffs into it, mixed it up, and put it back together.  I decided I wouldn't give it to her, unless she provoked me one more time.  

Aaaaaand she did.  She yelled ""HEY SHOT CUNT!""

I looked over, smiled gleefully, resisted a maniacal cackle and said ""Hey!  I found one more cherry jell-o shot!  You want it?""

She growls with a grin that would scare a shark, and grabs it.  Doesn't even look at it, and scarfs it down.  I ran outside with my coworkers and we giggled for a good five minutes as she coughed and spat and cursed.

Be prepared for a wall of text.


Keep in mind, I've been in the industry for over 5 years now (4 as a server), so I know how things go. However, I took the last 2 months off because I had broken my shoulder (and of course, it had to be my tray arm). So I can't carry as much as I used to be able to, which makes me slow.


So last night the new girl just didn't show up for her shift. We were already understaffed as it is in FOH, but now we have only 3 servers to cover a restaurant that seats about 120. And of course the restaurant fills up in a matter of minutes, which fucks up the kitchen and makes every order take about 25+ minutes. 
I already am getting death glares from all of my tables because of the wait, and as much as I apologize and explain that the kitchen is behind, these people just don't get it. 


Halfway through the rush, I get seated this couple at the end of my section, lets call them Evil Lady and Evil Man. The table across from them had to leave in a hurry so I thought I would deal with them first and then go deal with Evil Lady &amp; Man. So as I'm ringing up their card, I feel that my pants are starting to slide down. Confused, I turn around and see that Evil Lady is tugging on my pants trying to get my attention. I kindly ask for her to stop, and that I would be with her in a minute. During this process, my credit card machine timed out, so I had to redo everything again. While I am doing this, I feel the Evil Lady tugging on my pants again, just as I am about to turn around and tell her off again all of a sudden my pants just dropped to the ground. To make matters worse, I was wearing a G-string, and I had a bunch of families in my section with little kids. I quickly pulled my pants up and whipped around to this Evil Lady, ready to just tell her off. This was our conversation

Me: Excuse me?!?!

EL: I want to order.

Me: I'm very sorry but you are going to have to wait.

EL: But I want to order.

*(I've had enough of this bitch by now.)*

Me: Ma'am I'm going to have to ask you to switch sections. 

EM: What?! You can't make me and my wife move!

Me: Sir, your wife just pulled off my pants. I can claim that as sexual harassment. I will go get a host to move you as soon as possible.

EL: Well what if I don't want to move?

Me: Then you're just going to have to wait a very long time.

*Evil Lady and Evil Man gasp*

Once they moved, they both glared at me from across the restaurant, and demanded that they get their meal for free for my rudeness. Thankfully my manager didn't care and didn't give them any discount.

I work regularly with one girl who has been closing for 2 years. And shes terrible. On an average night you can expect the following behavior from her:

*refusing to stay in rotation if she doesn't feel like taking tables, or if the guests are black, indian or hispanic.

*pulling herself off the floor early so she can clock out at close with her sidework complete and go smoke. 

*screaming racial slurs and swearing across the expo to her ex working in the kitchen

*on nights the manager she sleeps with is on, basically doing whatever the fuck she pleases

*leaving early, complaining about not feeling well, refusing to pay for her food on any night, using the manager code to get her food free. 

*when questioned about her treatment of guests and fellow servers, loses her shit and screams at whoever is trying to talk to her reasonably. 

*being paid by servers to complete their sidework/silverware so they can leave early, only to assign it to another server and keep the money for herself, causing 3 fights in the last 2 weeks.

*continuously receives negative comment cards that her girlfriend/manager throws out for her. 

*a few weeks ago her name was specifically mentioned on a yelp review, she accused me of being the 'other server' who talked to the guest, went to another manager and attempted to have me reprimanded. Luckily my work record stood for itself and he didn't believe it was me. 

There was a mandatory meeting monday that she didn't attend, so after the meeting I spent 20 minutes in the office confirming coworkers complaints and how scared I was for even having the discussion with them. The owner wasn't even aware of the yelp review. 

Last week, the manager she is sleeping with had to return items to an ex, so my coworker took them over, and without ever meeting the ex, keyed the word bitch into both of her cars. She slipped at one point and needed 16 stitches in her arm as a result. She then called out the next day saying she couldn't leave her house because the ex was outside waiting to beat her up. 

I am legitimately scared to work with her tonight. I'm scared she knows I told the manager everything Monday, I'm scared she will cut my brake lines, or scream at me, or try to get me fired again. The owner said to report and document for the next week so he has grounds to fire her. A coworker informed me she was continuing her old tricks lastnight, so she may be unaware she is being watched. Of course, her girlfriend was the manager on lastnight.  

TL;DR: coworker is crazy, useless, but sleeping with a manager. Turned her into the owner and now worried she may hear and take revenge on me.

It was a busy Friday night over the summer and my friend and co-worker had a family of 4 who according to her were pretty normal, didn't look especially wealthy or anything. She said they were very friendly, but since we were so busy she wasn't able to give them as much attention as she would have liked. Their bill was about $50 and when they left, my friend went to pick up their credit card slip and saw that they had left a $200 tip and a note about how God had a plan for her and they felt like he told them that she needed the money more than they did. We were all shocked and she was in tears. 

Two hours later, I was sitting down, eating dinner. My friend came up to me and handed me an envelope. I opened it and there was $200 in cash inside with a note on the back of a grocery store receipt. I was 8 months pregnant at the time and the note said that God had a plan for me and the baby, that the baby was special, and that we would do good things for the world. I was making an adoption plan, so this note really touched me. Me and my friend were both crying and unfortunately the woman had already left. My friend told me that she had gone to the bathroom and the woman saw her in there and told her to give the envelope to the pregnant girl. I didn't take care of them once, I hadn't even noticed their table, so I was stunned. What I guess is that they left, went to the bank to withdraw more money, and come back just to give it to me. 

As much as the Applebees story pisses me off, there are good Christians in the world as well, and those are the people I can respect for living the teachings of their religion. I'm not saying every Christian should go around giving every server $200, or even leaving super generous tips, but this story should be an example for people like that pastor on the true teachings of their religion, like generosity and love for your neighbor.

A little background:  I worked for a supper club in a small town in the Midwest for a few years and it being a small town, just about everybody knew the owner who I will call Bob.  My biggest peeve working there was customers stating the moment they walked in, ""I'm a friend of Bob's"", and then demand me to bend over backwards and treat them like a king.

One night about 5 minutes before closing, two women came into the dining room, a redhead (RH) and a brunette, and wanted to order dinner.  Ok, no big deal, this sort of thing happens all the time.  Then RH said those magic words ""I'm a close and personal friend of Bob's"".  

Fantastic, It's just about the end of my shift, it's been a long day, I'm cranky, and now you're going to be a giant pain in my butt, I can feel it.

Anyways, so I get them their drinks and then RH starts nitpicking her food order.  She demands that her entree be made to ridiculous specifications and wanted substitutions for everything, much to the Chef's displeasure.  I ran my butt off for her and made sure her dining experience was stellar only for her to leave $2.00 on a $50.00 check.  I was less than thrilled by this.

Fast forward 6 months and we had introduced a brand new menu with several new choices, and a whole new section labeled ""Bob's Favorites"" as a hat-off to the owner.  One night, about 5-10 minutes before closing, who should come in but RH herself and her brunette-haired friend.  Great.  So I go through my shpeel (schpeel? speel? whatever) and as RH is looking over the menu she notices ""Bob's Favorites"" and asks ""Who is Bob?""

Oh, fan-freaking-tastic, she doesn't actually know who the owner is and is just another person who ""claims"" to know the owner just to get special treatment.  I replied ""Oh, Bob?  Yeah, he's the owner.  You know, your close, personal friend?""

The look on her face when I said that was priceless.

TL;DR:  Readhead claims to know owner of restaurant and expects me to bend over backwards to accommodate to her ridiculous needs, later asks who Bob (the owner) is, gets called out on her bullshit.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1hydwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hydwt/im_a_close_friend_of_the_owner/,

   On a slow night a guy comes in and orders a sandwich to go. No problem, he's in then out. Sometime later a woman calls on the phone.
Woman: Hey Yeah, (sounds like eating noises) I got a sandwich (munch munch munching) and I took one bite their was a LONG BLACK HAIR IN IT!
 Me: I'm sorry ma'am, if you bring back the sandwich I'd be happy to replace it for you. 
Woman: I have to bring it back??!?!!
Me: Yes ma'am. So the cook can remake it.
Woman: You got YOUR WEAVE in MY FOOD! I have to bring it back?!!
Me: I can assure you, that's not my weave ma'am, but if you bring it back we'll fix it for you.
   Sometime later the woman comes in with the guy slowly staggering behind and on his phone of course. She realizes immediately she might of spoke to soon about the weave. The cook and I take the box and open it up. It's empty, just a bunch of opened ketchup packets and a long black hair strategically placed across the box.
Woman: I want another sandwich. FOR FREE AND my money back. This is DISGUSTING!
Me: I'm not doing that. The damage of your sandwich clearly did nor come from us.
 I put down the box in plain sight of everyone, refunded the money to the woman and told her to go somewhere else.
Woman: I want a new sandwich! THIS ISN'T FAIR! 
The guy finally chimes in with, ""Just give us two more sandwiches, without the fries. We'll call it even and go."" 
Me: That's not happening. You already had a sandwich and you have your money back. We're done here.
   I pick out the two foot plastic hair strand from the box and wrap it around my fingers really tight.
Me: This isn't my weave ma'am.
  My cooks start backing me up and the couple storms off feeling out numbered and defeated. 

A Bonus Revenge Story:
Just recently, the woman came back and wanted to place a to go order. I told my manager who she was and he said he'd take care of it.  He hands her the bag of food and in front of all the guests in the restaurant he very loudly tells her she must check the quality of her food before she leaves the store. He makes her take out every box and open it. Loudly made the woman poke under it, and take off the buns so she could check the inside. Then after everything was put back  in the bag he asks her again very loudly, ""IS EVERYTHING PERFECT ON YOUR ORDER?!!  I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO COME BACK!""

Sooo... Generally, when just working a single for lunch, we get cut promptly at 4pm when the dinner servers start to arrive. 

Of course, it never fails.. I seem to always get sat at 5 of. Like clockwork.

And, as if to taunt me, it's usually ""Ummm... water with lemon, and... We're gonna make it easy for you and just get soup and salad.""

First thing's first. Soup, Salad and Bread sticks is $7 a head and (usually) involves multiple refills. It's not that big of a deal, but a 2 top with S&amp;S while drinking water is $15.24. That's a $3 tip @20% with a LOT of running.""Making it easy"" is not what they've done for me.

4 waters.
4 Soup/Salad/Breadsticks.
Ugh.

$28 check. They'll be here for an hour and a half... FML.

I mailed it in. I don't usually... But it was like I saw the $2 tip from a mile away. I wasn't rude, I smiled. I went through the motions, but without my usual ""flair"".

They got a couple of refills, nothing serious. They were kinda nice... But I was on autopilot. I didn't even wait for the 2 bite checkback to drop off their check. I actually dropped it with the goods...

The place is a small family owned restaurant and it's owned by some friends of mine. I have many more stories, but I'm on my phone so today it's just a short one. This is your typical sit down place, but the servers don't handle any of the money. We have a cashier for that, and even though I normally serve, sometimes cashiering is a break from the norm. 

So I'm standing at the register and I hear this strange, weird music. I assume it's Pandora (what we use at work) so I skip the song. The thing is, I keep hearing it. It's loud and tinny sounding. I finally figure it out-its coming from a table. This guy and his wife have pulled out their phone and proceeded to play their own music, louder than the music I'm playing. So after a minute, and several other customers asking me kindly to please say something to them, I went over there. I asked them if they could please turn it down. The wife gives me this look (the I'm inconveniencing her look) and tells me she doesn't like the music we're playing. I told her we could turn our music down, but that others in the restaurant were asking me to have her turn it down. She told me she hadn't heard anyone complain about it and proceeded to turn away from me. This is where I'm glad this place is family owned. The owners are nice, but they don't put up with shit like this. So, I smiled, and told her she and her husband weren't the only people in the building, and that they could turn it off or take their food to go.

This story is about a very recent Saturday night, when we have 10 servers, 3-6 tables each, and live music.  From 4pm to the time we close at 1 am, we're swamped.  I opened at 11am with a whole section, 12 tables.  Everything was fine.  Second shift: I had 6 tables. 

Every past Saturday I've worked, I've been given 4 tables - the same 4 tables every Saturday - 2 of which never get sat because they are right in front of the door where there's a terrible draft.  So, I had 6 tables.  The girl next to my section had 4 tables, and she normally had 6.  The two tables we swapped were the two that NEVER got sat.  

We slowly built up with customers until the climax of this tale, which was around 7:30pm.  I only had 3 tables sat, so I was doing fine.  I was ringing in a re-order of someone's Sangria and my manager came up and said, ""How far in the weeds are you?""  I was like ""Uhh...I'm doing fine.  I just have 3 tables and they just got appetizers and alcohol, so it's pretty easy.""  Then, he lays a bomb on me, ""Well, table 54 said you took their drink order an hour ago and they haven't got anything yet.""  My heart sank.  I remembered them instantly.  And I remembered that, for some retarded reason, I told myself I was just greeting* them for Vanessa because they were in her section (and why I took their order is beyond me) and I immediately realized it was in my section, at one of the drafty tables, where no one EVER sits.  I nearly shit myself in shame...cuz I remember they had 2 kids with them.  I RAN full-speed over to them, apologized from my ice-cold heart and told them that I would do whatever it took to make sure they leave at least not livid and still want to come back.  The guy looks up at me and says, ""Bahh no worries...we all make mistakes.""  I said, out loud, very questionably, to his face, in front of his kids, ""What the fuck??""  I slammed my hand over my mouth, apologized again, and said ""I imagined you were gonna rip my head off!""  He said, ""Nah it's ok.  We're just enjoying the music, but our kids are literally chewing on their sleeves, so if you could bring something out real quick just to tide them over, that'd be great...applesauce, chips, anything.""  ""YOU GOT IT!""  I took their whole order, appetizers and all, ran to the back, got them all drinks and a huge thing of chips and salsa, and took everything out.  When I came back, the guy and I had a rather long conversation about different things, mostly about what I did in college since we were both Purdue fans.  I told my manager Tammy about everything and she was like, ""They...weren't upset??""  I was like ""Nope...they didn't seem phased at all, other than their kids being starved.""  She went out, had a chat, came back and told me to let her know if they order dessert, cuz it's on us.  That normally my manager does when something goes wrong.  So, their food comes out, they eat, everything is going great, and I ask if they want some dessert since it's on us.  They ordered two $1 items to go.  Surprising since we have some amazing desserts for like $10 and up.  Anyway, I went to the POS to ring them up and I saw their order list was all in red and their balance said $0.00.  ""Dafuq?""  I called over Tammy and said something is wrong with the POS.  She told me dinner was on us.  All excited to tell them, I rang in dessert, printed their ticket, and dropped it off.  I started walking away and the guy said, ""Hey I think you gave us the wrong bill.""  -- ""Nope...dinner's on us tonight, since I made such a big goof, plus the fact that you two were SO, SO nice and forgiving about what happened.  I've never messed up so bad, and even for much less stuff, people have blown up...I was really expecting you to talk out when I first came over.""  I almost got teary at this point, no idea why lol.   ""All you gotta pay for are this two little desserts.""  He handed me his credit card, I went and charged it, gave him the receipt, filled their drinks one last time, grabbed their desserts, and bid them a good night as they were leaving.  I went back to the table not expecting much as a tip, but he left me a $50 bill on the receipt tray and a note written on scrap paper (I can't remember exactly what it said, but the general idea I do remember): ""I know it's not much, but I know what it's like having a degree and not finding your dream job.  Take this and follow your dreams.""  I got REALLY teary at that point.  As I was clearing off the table, I grab the receipt tray and saw something underneath the bottom receipt.  I stuffed it in my apron, cleared the rest of the table, and took everything back.  I'm standing by the dish washer as I pulled the receipt tray back out of my apron to see what else was there..I thought he'd left his card.  So, I pull the receipts and other slips back and I froze...it was 2 $100 bills with another piece of scrap paper behind them: ""I'd rather be broke and happy, knowing you're an inch closer to your dreams, than rich and bored knowing you're gonna be stuck here forever.""  I broke down so hard....I cried so hard for a good 10 minutes...it had been a real stressful hour and a half making sure they were gonna leave happy and not pissed and I just let it all out.  Luckily, my other tables were already gone and my shift was cut 30 minutes before and that table was my last.  I cleaned all my tables, swept my area, rolled some silverware, told everyone the story along the way, and felt good about how everything went.  

So, this place does pooled tips.  All tips are pooled and split among servers at the end of each shift.  We're all turning our money over to our manager at the end of the night...I'm the only male server at this place, btw...which is awesome because I've always been good at making girls feel comfortable around me.  So, I reach into my apron to pull out my cash and all of the other servers started turning their heads towards me -- I was assuming out of excitement for a bit of extra cash that night.  One of them gave me this dirty look and said, ""I don't know about the rest of these servers, but I don't ever remember you getting a $250 tip.""  I knew what she was going right away.  One by one, the other girls started saying, ""Yeah, if you turn over a $250 tip, we're gonna be pissed.""  I started getting teary again and they swarmed me with hugs lol...I was laughing and crying and was just so happy.  

I really do work with a bunch of awesome girls.  I could not be happier with this crazy bunch :)



* * ""Greeting"" at this place means saying hello to the table, and taking their drink order.  Usually, the server who has that table does it, but sometimes, people get double-sat in the bar, or a huge party comes in, and a server can't, so another picks it up.  (I don't know if this is common or not, since I haven't been waiting tables long, so I don't want this definition to come off as condescending)

As their food comes out, Lady1 asked for a side of bernaise with her steak. Now, I'm still fairly new (to this place) and apparently remoulade and bernaise look similar. Also, I don't really have any control over the food presentation, our manager/owner does. I had assumed the little ramekin on their plate was bernaise, not remoulade; they needed the remoulade for their shrimp anyway, so it was supposed to be on the plate. So food gets to their table and Lady1 immediately complains that it is not bernaise and is ""too orange."" I say, ""I'm honestly not entirely sure if that's bernaise or not. Lemme go check for you."" (Smiling, I have to add.)

As I'm coming back to check on them after a minute, Lady1, instead of responding to my ""Is everything going well for you ladies?"",    
Lady1: Hey, can't you see the difference between *this* and *bernaise*?        
Me: Yes, of course they're different. I'm sorry about that; the mixup was all my fault.    
Lady1: Yeah. It was your fault.    
Me: If there's anything else y'all would like, just let me know. :)    
Lady1: Whatever.    
And as I was walking away, I heard her loudly say, ""How can you not tell the difference? Seriously!""

They then apparently complained to the manager that their ""server was extremely rude"" and they'd like their meal for free. My manager knew what was going on, so she told me not to go over there anymore and she'd transfer to another server. Apparently the neighboring tables (one not even mine) actively pulled said manager aside and told her how my table was acting towards me.

It all worked out and my neighboring table ended up leaving me a ridiculous 80% tip as well as telling the managers how great my service was. 

tl;dr - I don't write very eloquent stories.

Edit: And apparently one of the managers who was there thought the situation was so funny, she kept joking with me last night about ""which sauce is bernaise?"" and that it's probably going to be my nickname.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1372096439.0,,,True,t3_1gw200,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1gw200/you_mean_that_guy_who_sat_us_isnt_getting_us_our/,
1365608727.0,173,self.TalesFromYourServer,1c2h9v,I Should Have Been Fired For This,214,41,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1c2h9v/i_should_have_been_fired_for_this/,"There are many reasons that I should have been fired from the Oldest Beer Bar in DC (Now Reopened Under New Owners), but this is my favorite:

It was a hot summer Saturday, and of course the AC was out because the owners never fixed anything, they just had their handyman tinker with the broken shit in this old restaurant.  The place had been open since 1952, and most of the equipment looked like it had been there since then.  There are almost no windows in the restaurant, so we couldn't even get a breeze.  The menu listed over 1200 beers, but we likely only had about 400 different types on a good day.  Heat, outlying menu, and crowded conditions combined to wreck a lot of customers fun, but we tried to help everyone have a good time.  For the most part, we succeeded by knowing what was in stock, and knowing beer like goddam experts.

In DC in the summer, if you don't have a deck or a waterfront, you don't have many customers.  So on this particular Saturday, I've had a whole three tables, but I can't be cut until 3 am due to management stupidity.  One of my fellow waitrons has a table of 12 that has been there for a few hours, and is in the process of dividing their tab, paying, and leaving.  We are not allowed to auto-grat anyone, so she is in the process of making about 10% in tips thanks to stupid college students.  The kids are telling each other that Craig and Trixie will handle tip because they bought some of his/her beers, which ends up with Craig and Trixie leaving a tip on only Craig and Trixie's portion.  Of course.

So the final three people are still sitting there, two girls and guy drinking water, forty minutes after their friends all leave.  They are now the only people in the restaurant besides the staff.  We are cleaning and getting ready to lock the door and run out to last call as soon as these people are gone.  Their tab is at 100 bucks, and they haven't ordered anything but water now for an hour and a half.  My coworker asks for advice, and I suggest she stop giving them water.  Just disappear, and we'll have the manager go over and ask if they need anything besides the bill.  This works, and the dude magnanimously offers to pay for the whole remaining bill.  So Coworker brings his credit slip back, and the dude tips her $5 on 100...she again asks for advice because she can't even think straight.  That table had run her so ragged, and it was so hot in the restaurant, she is just done.  

We pep her up and suggest that she follow the established, STUPID, protocol from the employee handbook and go back to the customer and ask why he tipped so poorly, maybe she had done something he didn't like?  He explains that he thought everyone else tipped her.  She explains that she was tipped on their portions of the bill, and that this is his portion to tip on.  I'm two tables away, refilling salt shakers or something, and I see him turn beet red.  The two girls with him look around awkwardly.  He says that he'll take care of it, and Coworker returns to the front of the restaurant.  

The three students leave saying, ""thanks, we had such a great time, you were so nice and helpful...blahblahblah""  The verbal tip...shit.  Coworker comes back from the table with the credit slip in hand, and looks at it, and says ""Oh my god, I can't believe this.""  The little shit had crossed out the tip and written on the back, ""SO RUDE INAPPRORAPE""  Spelling mistake as in the original.

At this point, I am furious.  I am hot, I am tired, I am going to make sure that fucker never comes back.  I stand up, and hear the manager saying, ""No, don't!"" as I walk out the door.  I probably had MURDER all over my face.  I catch up to the students down the street at a corner which is a hang out spot for older gay men and people who are probably dressing in drag from the nearby gay bar.  The kids are laughing about my Coworker, saying ""What a stupid bitch!""  And ""What part of tipping is optional did you not understand?""  I walk right up to customers, and yell, ""I HOPE YOU FUCKERS NEVER PLAN ON COMING BACK!  NEVER, EVER DO THAT TO ANOTHER SERVER, OR I WILL FIND YOU!""  My accusing finger is about an inch away from the dude's nose, and he looks at me like he just shit himself.  All of the laughing and street conversation stops, while I stare at these kids, debating on whether to say anything else.  One of the people hanging out on the corner yells, ""Oh shit! He's gonna kill you, white boy!""  Which is doubly funny to me later because I am white, but whatevs.  This snaps me back to reality, and I turn and walk back to the restaurant.

My coworkers are all standing on the steps, looking at me like I am both completely insane, and the raddest fucking dude on the planet.  I ask my manager, ""so am I fired?""

""No, but don't let the owners find out.""

I was recently moved up to an evening closer and sunday night was my first night. (I've closed a few times, but was covering for others) I was pretty excited because I expcted to make a ton of money. Get to work and find out I have the best section! Kick ass! The evening gets going and we end up getting pretty busy. My section fills up quick but I'm happy because I'm making money. 

I get a 2 top (husband and wife) and go to greet them. The wife immediately asks for our gluten free menu. We don't and never have had one. She argues with me that the hosts told her that we had one. Again, I tell her we don't and she keeps arguing with me. I tell her our menu is pretty straight forward, no hidden gluten and I would personally double check before she ordered anything. She tells me she will get ""very, very sick"" if she has any. I figured that a 40+ yr old woman with a severe allergy could handle herself. 

Before I can even get a drink order, the husband places his food order. Ok, no problem, I ask what they would like to drink. Wife asks me if any of our beers are gluten free. I wasn't 100% sure so I went to find out. Of course they aren't and so I go back and tell her so. It's not a problem but she needs a few mins with the menu so I go get them waters. 

I come back a few minutes later and ask if she has any questions or anything. She tells me she's not going to order because there's nothing she can eat. By now I'm extremely busy and a little annoyed. I open the menu and start pointing out things that are obviously gluten free, steaks, salads, things that someone with a ""severe gluten allergy"" would order. She then tells me she's a vegetarian. 

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU EAT.

Alright, I start showing her other stuff. By God we're going to get you something. She insists that she's not eating, but her husband would like a beer. I'm busy, so whatever, I don't have time to argue with her. He gets his beer, they're happy. 

I'm keeping an eye on them and when he's about done with his beer I ask if he would like another or if he's ready for his check. He asks me about his food. WHAAAAAAT. Turns out he was still going to eat. I was under the impression that they both weren't eating. Shit fuck. I explain that to him and tell him I'll get his stuff out right away. Fortunately what he ordered was pretty quick, plus he wanted a soup as an app. I go get his soup immediately and apologize again. He's not mad and said that they had been confusing and that it was their fault. I still felt pretty bad but they were really nice and were having a good time. If they're happy then I'm happy.

Things clear out a bit and I'm cleaning up my section. I'm wiping down the table next to them and glance over to see how they're doing. Apparently, wifeys gluten allergy cleared up because lo and behold she was DRINKING HIS BEER.

Sorry this was so long.

I was reasonably busy, and was making pretty good tips all day. Then a 5-top walked in. It was an older gentleman with 4 older ladies. They chatted with me, complimented the food, ordered lots of dessert, and in general had a really good time. When it came time to pay their $87 bill, the ladies all left to go wait in the car and the gentleman handed me his credit card. I ran it and brought it back. He thanked me and told me I did a great job. I smiled and walked away. After he left, I picked up the book and saw he left me $8. On an $87. I was pretty pissed because they gave me no reason to think that I only deserved a &lt;10% tip.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I had forgotten all about it, because I had a bunch more tables who all tipped me quite nicely. The bartender flagged me down and told me I had a call on the restaurant phone and that it was one of my customers from today. 

""Hi, this is BeccaMonster.""
-""Hello, this is [Older Gentleman]. I just wanted to call and apologize for the dreadful tip I left you earlier. I don't know where my mind was at when I signed the credit card slip, and you were so wonderful, you deserved better than that.""
""...oh. It's ok, sir, there's no need to apologize...""
-""Yes there is, I feel awful. When do you work next? Because I am going to come in and give you the rest of your tip.""
""Tuesday, but you really don't have to-""
-""Yes I do. You deserve it. Goodbye!""

This absolutely made my day. I really hope he shows up, but even if he doesn't, the fact that he had the guts to call and apologize for a crappy tip was very neat.

I work at a take-n-bake pizza store; we make your pizza then you take it home and cook it., it's a small store in a tiny outlet mall. Normally, we don't have many complaints about customers, but last night was the most I've ever experienced.

It starts with a call in order. I took the call personally. They ask for a cheese pizza and 2 vegetarian pizzas. (We have 3 different vegetarians, so I check to make sure I have the right one by asking for the toppings.

20 minutes later, the customer comes in. We hand her her pizzas and think it's the end of story. It's not. ""These are the wrong pizzas!"" she shouts. I come over. ""What were your pizzas supposed to be?"" ""The vegetarians! she exclaims"". I explain to her that we have 3 different vegetarians and that we might have made her the incorrect one. I ask her what her pizza was supposed to have on it and that we would re-make those for her right away. The pizza order that followed wasn't even close to her original order. Not only did it have different vegetables entirely, but it also contained 3 meats. Even though it was $10 dollars more than her original order, I made it for her as compensation for messing up her original orders.

I hand her the 2 new pizzas, and she exclaims that these are wrong also. ""Excuse me?"" I ask. ""There was supposed to be no cheese on these! (This was new fucking information to me), however, I give her a free desert, and remake her pizzas a second time.

While all of this is happening, mind you; new customers are piling up in the store all held up by this woman. I finish her new set of pizzas and she asks the following verbatim: ""can I get beef instead?"" ""Instead of what?"" I ask. ""Mushrooms"" she answers. I remake her pizzas a third time and finally get this annoyance out of my store.

Later that night, the phone rings. It's her. Complaining about her pizza.
""I got 2 vegetarians! One of them was supposed to be beef and mushroom"" she shouts into the phone. ""Ma'am, that was not what you told me in the store."" I reply. ""Yes it was!"" she answers. ""Alright, what would you like me to do about this?"" ""I would like a free fucking pizza!"" she shouts into the phone. I reply with the following.

""Ma'am, I can tell you right now that that is not going to happen. I took your order 3 times tonight, I know exactly what you ordered, and I was more than happy to compensate for a pizza that might have been wrong, but I can tell you right now, you have been given more than your fair share of ""free pizzas"" tonight. Not only did I have to re-make your pizzas not once, not twice, but three times, but I also had to waste the 2 original pizzas, the 2 re-makes, and the 2 re-re-makes.""

(And I don't do, ""TL;DR""s in subs about sharing stories, lol.)

Given the wonderful horror stories we all read on this sub, I figured I'd share not one, but two awesome anecdotes that restored just a titch of my faith in humanity, both involving grandparents and their granddaughters. 

* * *
A few weeks back, I was serving this elderly couple who were out dining with their two grandchildren. The grandson was fine.  Gracious, polite, and always said, ""Please,"" and, ""Thank you.""  The granddaughter, however, was quite the stuck up little brat. Always on her cell phone, always curt and dismissive of me, and always demanding her refills - not asking. Every single time she did this, the grandmother would give me an apologetic look, and grandfather would sharply exhale - his temper clearly rising. 

Well, towards the end of the meal, I dropped the check, was handed a credit card from the grandfather, and processed it. After I returned it him, I began to pre-bus the table. As I was doing so, the gentleman discreetly filled out the tip receipt for me. I never pay attention to when customers do this out fear that they might be uncomfortable with me watching. So I was in my own little ""Get the dishes and go"" world and just about to step away from the table when the granddaughter says, rather loudly, ""Are you really leaving THAT MUCH of a tip?! Seriously?!""

That's when grandpa lost it. 

He looked at her dead in the eye, and full of controlled anger, sternly said to her (matching her obnoxious volume), ""Why, yes, I AM. This is what a fifteen percent tip looks like. You go to school, don't you? You learned math, did you not?""  Stunned at grandpa's sudden snap, an awkward silence followed from her.

""Answer me when I speak to you, girl!""

She had barely replied a meek, ""Yes, sir,"" when he continued on.

""I know your momma taught you social graces, so I know that you know that fifteen percent is what you provide when you are given good service. So break out your fancy little phone with the calculator in it and tell me if this is right.""  She took a second, did it, and showed it to him. 

""Just what I thought. Now: This man has given us good service. Every single time he came to this table, you made a demand that he met right away, and you couldn't even be bothered to thank him for it. And if I knew you had any income about you, I'd make you pay this tip. But you don't. So don't you ever question my generosity on behalf of *your behavior* again. 

""When a man works hard to give you good service, you pay the man what he's worth. Now apologize to him.""

The girl, shyly looked over to me and offered a rather quiet, ""I'm sorry,"" which I accepted as politely as I could. After he handed me the tip slip, I excused myself from the table. As I was walking away, I overheard the grandfather also force this girl to apologize to her grandmother and her brother for ""embarrassing them.""

Instead of walking away, what I really wanted to do was high five and/or shake that man's hand, but he was too busy teaching an awesome lesson.
* * *
This second one provides a great moment from a lady (and I do mean 'lady' in every positive, classy sense of the word) who had enough of eating dinner with family while staring at the back of their cell phone cases, lol:

I had three women at my table tonight, two of them older (and, as I later learned though conversation, sisters), and the other one was the granddaughter of one of them.

Throughout the night the older ladies and I had a great banter going between us, sassy and hilarious, but always respectful and polite (it's weird how the Southern mentality that exists in some people where I live - which is not the south - can be like that). 

Needless to say, the granddaughter wasn't too talkative, as she was too preoccupied by her smartphone. Where I work, soup and salad are as endless as man's ignorance, and I frequently have to check with my guests to know if they would like any more. 

So, towards the end of the meal, I swing by one more time and ask, ""More soup or salad, ladies?""  The grandmother replies, ""Oh, I don't know about these two, but I'm fine."" The other elder lady says, ""No more for me, thanks."" And this awkward moment passes as they both look at the teenage granddaughter, who is bent over and staring into her lap beneath the table. 

Without warning, and with surprisingly sharp speed, the grandmother slammed her palm onto the table. The girl shot straight up in her chair, spine rigid. I jumped half-an-inch in my shoes and every other adjacent table snapped their heads to this woman. She, as if the world around her did not exist, looked at this girl as a Sargent would a Private about to receive a dressing down.

""I will not tell you again, child. I don't care *what* you do with your friends, with your momma, or even with your daddy. When you sit at *my* table and *my* money is what is putting food in *your* belly, you will not *TOUCH* your cellular phone. Do you understand me?""

(*a beat passes*)

""Do. You. Understand me?""

""Yes, grandma,"" was her scared reply. The grandmother nodded with her head to table. The girl pulled her phone out of her lap from under it, set it down, and slid it ever so gently across to grandma, who promptly took it, and put it her purse.

""Now. The man asked you a question. Answer him.""

This teenaged girl looked to me with this pleading look in her eye, and I knew instantly she had no idea what I had asked her. 

So did grandma. 

""Oh? You mean you can't answer him because you can't talk to, and interact with, the world around you while your head's buried in your phone? That's what I thought. He wanted to know if you wanted any more soup. But now, you don't get any.""  She then looked to me, and - I swear - gave me a sly wink and a smile, and said, ""We are fine, sir. Thank you for your continued service.""

I smiled inside and out, nodded my head, and walked away, trying my best not to beam.

I was a busser for one, now I am an expeditor. This is my worst customer experience. I still cannot believe it happened. 

This incident happened when I was bussing tables. It was a slow start to a Friday night. One of my tables consisted of an elderly man (around 70, I'd say) and two women, in their 50s or 60s. The women never talked, but the man referred to them as his ""first wife"" and ""second wife."" This restaurant is in a very urban area of the southwest, and this alone was baffling to me. 

So the three of them were having salads. The two ladies finished first, so I took their salad plates. I would generally take appetizer plates before the whole table finished, but wait until everyone was done to take entree plates. This is standard in our restaurant. The man seemed to be lecturing the ladies about something, and was thus taking a good half-hour on his salad. 

He set the salad to the edge of the table. There was maybe 4 bites left. When I swung by to pick up the salad, I asked him if he was finished enjoying just to be sure. He looked at me as if I had just ran over his dog. He stared at me for a good 10-15 seconds, and then I said ""ok I'll give you some more time,"" and walked away. 

The next time I made my rounds, I did not approach the table. Instead, the man grabs me by the arm (I'm a measly 100 pound girl, and this grab was too much for me.) And says: ""Do NOT ask me if I have finished enjoying my salad. I PAID for this salad, it is MINE. I will tell YOU when I'm done."" 

""Sir, I was not trying to rush you. I am only trying to do my job, which is to get appetizer plates out of the way before the entrees come."" 

""WRONG. I tell YOU what to do and when, not your trainer. YOU are here to serve ME."" 

I was completely dumbfounded.  My arm was still in this guy's hand. The women were hanging their heads in silence. 

I came to my senses about what was happening and ripped my arm away. I informed him ""No sir, I am a busser, NOT a servant. And you may NOT touch me."" I stormed right over to my manager and told him the situation. I was fuming and could barely get my words out

My manager, being awesome, told the man that he may not grab the staff and we would not be serving him today. I got to tell him to have a nice day with a big smile as he sauntered out the front door.

Tonight, at the Malaysian restaurant I work at, it was just me and the manager (who also serves) up front, and we got a decent bump around 6 tonight, with each of us getting 4 tables in ~30 minutes.  The last table I got from that bump was a couple who was super nice right off the bat, asking me how I was, and telling me they'd never had Malaysian food before.  I gave them a few recommendations, and they ordered a bottle of wine, which is pretty uncommon for us.  When I came back, they had several questions, and the rest of my section was either chowing down, or waiting on their food, so I had plenty of time to help this couple.  They ordered my recommendations, plus an appetizer they already had in mind, and as I was about to walk away, the gentleman said ""Hey, I really appreciate the wine presentation you did when you brought the bottle.  Not that many servers are trained on that anymore.""  I doubt that is true, but at that moment, I knew they were going to be awesome.

So, ~10 minutes later, I brought their appetizer, just some wok-fried pot stickers, and after they had their first bite, they were already heaping complements on the food.  If there's one thing my restaurant does right, it's the quality of the food.  Right as they finished the pot-stickers, their entrees rolled out.  I poured more wine, served the entrees, and when I went back for the touchback, the woman just burst out telling me how amazing the food I had recommended was.  They honestly heaped praise on me for my descriptions and how I ""couldn't have pointed [them] towards something more delicious.""  Every time I checked back with them, they were super appreciative and would ask me interesting questions, both professional and personal, that I was more than happy to answer.

It ended up being an early night and they were my last table.  They'd devoured every bite in front of them, and were totally stuffed, and really happy with how every thing went.  And as an added bonus, when I was pulling their plates, I heard them talking about ""Pollos Hermanos"" and we all got in a 10 minute discussion about Breaking Bad, which made them even happier about having me as their server. When I brought their bill ($75.06), the guy didn't even look at it and handed me a $100, and said ""I think the bill is about $75, we're not super rich, but keep the change.  You really deserve it more than we do.""

It wasn't one of those incredible 300% tips, but the respect and kindness that they treated me with, plus their generosity and appreciation for how I guided them through their meal, plus the 33% tip meant more to me than a 300% tip.  The final best thing they did was tell me as I thanked them for coming was saying ""We'll absolutely be back here for sure.  What nights do you work, so we can make sure you're our server again?""

**TL;DR:**  Had a table that was super appreciative of every thing I did, and gave me a 33% tip, which while not incredible, when paired with the respect they treated me with, meant the world to me.

Yesterday was a slow day, and as such, I seem to pay even less attention to what I do than when we are busy.

Anyway, I got double-sat which was fine since I could run both tables at the same time. The first table got an appitizer as their meal and split it. The second table got almost the same appitizer and a soup and salad dealie.

After ringing everything in and doing a pretty decent job of bringing salad and refilling drinks etc, the food is ready. I brought out both appitizers and set them at their tables. At this point I'm thinking that I did a pretty good job and go on my way to continue hopelessly hitting on all of the servers who enter the kitchen.

Some time passes and I go to check on the tables. Table one is fine, they are the cool kind of 50 year olds. Table two is looking at me like I'm retarded. I ask them how their meal is and they say it is fine. As I am turing to walk away, it hits me. I never brought the lady her soup.

I immediately appologize and sprint to the back to get it. As I am getting it ready, I grab a breadstick bag and go to the cooler where we store the mints. I fill the bag about 3/4 full and bring it out with the soup. I continue apologizing and place the bag next to the lady of the forgotten soup.

By the end of the meal, they had realized that the bag actually had no bread in it and instead contained a ton of chocolatey-minty forgiveness. They ended up leaving me almost 40% tip.

Mints are that which bring healing to the wounds caused by my errors.

This is about two years ago in the middle of summer.

At the current restaurant I was working at we were open until 12 midnight, but the kitchen closed at 11 therefore we could only sell drinks.
This was mostly because we weren't really known for our alcoholic drinks and during the summer management wanted to emphasize our alcohol sales.

On to the story.

So a couple comes in at about 10pm, orders a late dinner, drinks, the works. At about quarter to eleven they tell me that the lady's mom was going to be joining them in about half an hour. Sure no problem I say, and I let them know that the kitchen is closed at 11, therefore if she would like to order anything I would be more than happy to punch something in before she gets here, that way she can eat if she wants too.
So the woman calls her mom and let's her know the deal, the mom says that she is fine and had already ate, she didn't want anything, she just wanted to come in and have a few drinks.
Awesome.

So it's about 11:20 by now and the mom shows up, she orders a Bellini or something and then asks for the menu. I panic for a second, thinking that maybe I heard wrong and that she did want to order something before last call and I never punched it in. I ask her if she had asked her daughter to order something for her, and she says no, she wants to order something now. 

""Ahhhh shit""
I politely inform her that the kitchen closed 20 minutes go and unfortunately she can't order food anymore. Cue the shit storm.
She begins to go off on me. ""Well what do you mean I can't order food, this is a restaurant, of course I can order food!""

Again I tell her that while we are open until 12, the kitchen closes at 11. I let her know that I was under the impression that her daughter told her this and that she was fine, that she just wanted a drink.

She then tells me me that when her daughter told her that the kitchen closes at 11, she didn't think that that meant she couldn't order any food. (What?!?) 

""I don't want anything big, all I want is a quick pasta bowl or even a chicken Caesar salad. Just something you can heat up and throw together!""

At this point I'm getting annoyed, and the original couple is now giving me a combined death glare.

""I'm really sorry, but the kitchen is completely closed. There are no more kitchen staff in the building, we closed at 11 and its now almost 11:30"" 

Now she is visibly pissed.
""Well it's not hard to heat something up, you work here can't you just make me something? Just something quick?""

I go on to tell her that even if I was allowed to make food (Hint: I'm not) the grills and pans would take up to 20 minutes just to heat up, let alone cook anything. I may add now that I'm also the only one on the floor, I can't just walk off and forget every one else just to make you some stupid chicken/pasta.

Then the kicker, the line that made me go over the edge.
""Then why did you let me in if you can't even make me food?! This is ridiculous, if you or anyone else won't make me food I guess I'll just tell your higher ups how awful you are and that you refused to serve me.""

I snap. 
""Look, I'm sorry if there was a miscommunication, but there is no one. Noooo one here to make you food. I've told you, and your acquaintances multiple times that the kitchen closes at 11. It says on the door. If you want food the only things I can offer you are drink garnishes. If you want a spicy bean or maraschino cherry, with a side of limes then you are in luck because that's all I've got.""


They paid and left after that, never heard about it again. 



TL;DR: it feels so good to tell people off sometimes.

**A BIT OF BACKGROUND**
So, normal busy as all living hell friday night shift. Nothing major happening, just bussing tables, the standard 60 minute wait time, everyone shows up at the same time, everyone leaves at the same time, I'm the only busser... but y'all already know that stuff. 

**STORY TIME**
Now, I know it's a friday night, people like to drink, no big deal. Well, as I'm cleaning a table so that we can seat some people, I see some lady waving me over to her. So, I head over there to see if there is anything i can help her with. About 3 tables before I reach her booth, I notice multiple Long Island Iced Tea glasses at her booth. Then, this little thing happens. 

 * Drunk Woman: ""Are you my server?""
 * Me: ""No Ma'am, but I can get your server for you.""
 * Drunk: ""No, I always remember who my server is. You are my server.""
 * Me: ""I'll be right back Ma'am.""

I walk into the kitchen and ask who the server for table ###. Well, their server couldn't be any different from me. Allow me to clearify. I am a tall white guy, late teens, military haircut. Their server... A tall black (no racism intended) girl, late teens, somewhat long hair. Still confused? Well, the ladies at the table still were. 

 * Me: ""Ma'am, Abby (name changed because I have to) here is your server.""
 * Drunk: ""Oh, sorry about that. You two look so much alike.""
 * Me and Abby: (in our minda: *Wut...*)
 * Abby: ""Ma'am, is there anything I can help you with?""
 * Drunk: ""Another Long Island Iced Tea.""
 * Abby: ""One moment please.""

Now, I'm curious as to what she would do about this, since we are not allowed to sell any behind the counter drinks to anyone who is drunk. 

 * Abby: ""Hey, Tom (AKA Good Guy Manager), I have a couple ladies who are drunk, but want more Long Island Iced Teas. What do you want me to do?""
 * Tom: ""I'll handle this.""

Now, at this point, I had more tables to do, so I have no idea what he said to them. All i know is that he walked away, the lady who thought I was a skinny black girl, got up, took two steps... and fell on her face. I was cut about 5 minutes later, and leave right before they do. Being that I was hit by a drunk driver and messed up my back a few years ago, I was not about to let them drive away drunk. So... I did what any right minded person would do. I got in my car, saw them get into theirs, and pulled infront of them. I had already punched 911 into my phone and all I had to do was hit call. Once their car started up, with one of the drunk women behind the wheel, I called. 

About 5 minutes later, a cop pulled into the parking lot, I backed out of the way of the ladies car, and they started driving... and crashed into the cop car. The officer was already out, so he was fine. The ladies were arrested for drunk driving, the officer asked if anything happened to me, and thanked me for calling in. 


Moral of the story: If i see you get behind the wheel drunk, I will block you in, call the cops, and wait for you to get arrested. Especally if you get not only my gender wrong, but also my skin color.

I know it's not very professional to sit and talk but I enjoyed it.

We close for brunch at 2:30, so of course at 2:20 a couple of customers walk in.  Lets call them ""Angry Couple"" or ""AC"" for short.

To start off, I have NO problem letting customers in until we close. Hell, more money for my pocket.  I take them to a nice patio table and immediately can tell something is off about them.  A younger couple, he's smiley, she's scowling.

I take their order, grab their drinks and the food was up pretty quick (they had no competition in the kitchen).  A smoked salmon, ricotta fritatta and this ridiculously good truffles and mushroom pasta (its the sole reason I need to hit up the gym now... stupid tasty pasta...)

I bring the food out to them and notice the female side of AC is not there.

Me: ""Oh, will she be gone long? I can go keep this (fritatta) warm in the kitchen until she gets back.

Angry Couple Male: ""No, we got in a fight.  Just leave it. I don't even know if she's coming back.""

Me: ""Alright.. sounds good... do you want any fresh cracked pepper blah blah blah?""

I go back inside, at this point they are my last customers.  Cool! I can leave soon!  All my side duties are done, not much else I can do.  I wait a few minutes and head back outside to quality control them.  Angry Couple Girl still isn't back.  He's texting on his phone, still hasn't touched his pasta.  I again offer to keep it warm in the kitchen to which he snarls something at me and I leave.  Fine, whatever, I have a nice big ass tv in the bar I can watch while I wait.

25... seriously, 25 minutes later, she comes back.  So keep in mind, thats a good 30 minutes their food has been out.  I give it a minute then head out.

Me: ""How's everything tasting?""

Angry Couple Girl: ""My fritatta is overcooked, cold and tastes like shit.  I wouldn't feed it to my dog.""

I just stare at her. Confused. Of course it tastes like shit. It's eggs and salmon. Sitting out. In hot weather. For 30 minutes.

ACG: ""I want a new one. (Slides plate across the table) Tell them not to overcook it this time, and it would help if it was hot too.""

Again, I just stare at her.  Rage builds in my system. But I think ""Fuck it. I'll get her a new one, keep the stupid customer happy and get the fuck out of here.""  

I take it back, explain it to the kitchen (luckily our head chef was in a good mood) and got her a new one.  I drop it off, tell her to enjoy and start to walk off.  That's when I hear a finger snap.  Yes, she fucking snapped her finger at me.  I hold in my rage, and turn around.  She's not even looking at me, points to at her coffee cup and rolls her eyes to her boyfriend.  I stand there in shock.

Me: (full sarcasm put in to my voice at this point) ""I'm sorry, you snapped? What can I do for you?""

ACG: ""Well I'm pointing at my coffee cup. You draw your own conclusions. (another eye roll)

Me: ""Oh, is it taking up room on the table? Here, let me get that away for you.""

ACG: (Huge audible sigh) ""I. Want. More. Coffee. Leave the cup and get me more coffee.""

Me: ""Sure! IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE! Oh, before I go, I just want to point something out to you.  In all fairness to the kitchen, you were gone for about a half hour, and your food sat at the table.  Eggs don't sit well.  They cook themselves after sitting for a bit. Not to mention that you complained it was cold and tasted bad, and well, obviously it would be sitting out for 30 minutes.""

ACG: ""How about I just sit here for another 30 minutes and see if it tastes the same? Take your smug attitude and get me coffee.""

At this point I couldn't take anymore.  I can't even make this stuff up.  I just walked away. I went and sat at the bar.  I contemplated kicking them out (I wouldn't have gotten in trouble at all for it, the owner is a great guy). I decided the best thing to do was piss her off more.  I didn't get her coffee.  I didn't get them more water. I occasionally glanced outside, but that was the extent of it. I waited 5 minutes, printed their bill, walked up to their table, dropped it off, and started to walk off.

ACG: ""Excuse me! My coffee!""

Annnd I kept walking. Right to the bar and sat my ass down again.  I waited another minute, brought out the debit machine and stood by their table.  He got out his card and paid while she ranted about my shitty service and how she was going to get me fired.  I got her the owners card, explained that I wrote my name on the back and told her to contact him and please relay their dining experience to him. She stormed off, he followed behind. No tip. Wasn't expecting one. Don't care.

She hasn't called or emailed yet. My boss found it hilarious.

This situation happened exactly as I told it.  No exaggeration, nothing made up in the slightest.  I am the most calm guy you can ever possibly imagine.  It takes A LOT to even remotely make me flicker from absolute professional service.  Sunday was the day I finally did and it felt fucking great.

You deserve at least 30%!,186,31,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1in33d/thank_you_so_much_you_deserve_at_least_30/,"So, I'm a head waitress at a sit down Kosher Sushi restaurant, that seats about 70 people total. We are never more than 3 servers and we count heads to keep things even. Things usually get a little crazy when we fill up, but our loyal clientele are usually quite understanding (I think partially due to the fact that there are, like 5 kosher places they can go to in the city, so even if they're unhappy, they are very likely to come back). 

Anyways, last night I was working on the terrace which is a nice size, but not too big for one person at around 20-25 seats. You don't have to share it with anyone, so all the tables out there are all for 1 waitress. I had a couple come in who come on average about once a month, who sat down last in the middle of my rush. Last time they were in, they were pretty unhappy as the service as the waitress was slammed with about 10 other tables to tend to. Furthermore, they tend to complain about little things and make a big deal out of them when they can be easily fixed or attended to once brought up. This being said, I wanted to make sure everything was in perfect order for their visit. I saw them right away, beer never empty, water never empty, got their sushi plates out quite fast and all. 

I go by to see them a couple times throughout my rush, but try not to disturb their eating (everything was fine throughout most of the meal). So I go by once more when they are near done their plate (about 6 rolls of sushi), to ensure they still have enough sauce, things are still good, etc. 
So, the guys wife says to me ""You know what, we are actually quite unhappy with the sushi tonight... it seems, I dunno, soggy and mushy and not rolled tightly enough"" 
Me: ""Hmm, well I can take it to the chef to look at and everything, but I thought everything was pretty well fine up until now?""
Her: ""Yeah, it seemed fine at first, but the more we kept eating, we realized it just wasn't up the standard that we expect here"" 
Me: ""Well, you don't have to finish it if you don't want to and I can have the chef prepare you something else?""
Her: ""No, no, it's fine, I just thought I would let you know""
Me: ""Ok, well if there is anything else I can do for you two, please do not hesitate to let me know, I would be glad to have something remade""
Me (in my head): ""So the sushi is so crappy that you had to try nearly all of it but waited to complain to me at the end when I could have had it remade and all?? UGH.""

So they finish every single piece to the point that they are beyond stuffed. I clear everything, and bring them the dessert menu, letting them know that I would like to offer them dessert on the house, since they were ""dissatisfied"" with their food. They eventually take 2 desserts, enjoy them slowly and thank  me repeatedly for my wonderful service and attentiveness to their concerns. 

I bring them the bill, and as the husband is doing his thing on the credit machine he says ""Thank you so so much PinkyJ, your service was by far the best we've had here, and you really deserve a 30% tip!""
Me: ""Thank you so much, blah blah blah"" (in my head: WAHOOOOO!!! 30%).
I take the receipt and all, to see that they tipped me 5%... on a bill well over $100.. 
What gives?! Don't say to a server that they deserve X% of a tip and then shaft them! Not cool.. Just don't say anything at all.

I preferred my day shifts, because the people weren't piss-drunk and were generally more polite.

I sat this 5-top who were all very polite and nice. They were my only table at the time, so I just chatted them up and since they knew a lot about sushi and Japan, we had an interesting and engaging conversation. I thought it was going pretty well. They requested separate checks; okay, no problem. Brought out the checks, ran their cards, bid them farewell and have a nice day'd them.

I usually get really anxious before I look at the tip line, mostly because I live in a lower-middle-class city and people rarely tip (and if they do, they leave shitty tips). First bill had a pretty decent tip, so did the second bill, and so on. But the last guy. His bill was $19.68, and he left a $0.32 tip JUST TO EVEN IT OUT TO $20. He probably would have left $0.05 if it was $19.95. I was tempted to just put in $0 in the POS just to mess with his statement, but I decided to just grudgingly put the $0.32 in. 

As I was cleaning up their table quite slowly since I was still pretty peeved, I found a cell phone. LO AND BEHOLD, it was the $0.32 tipper's phone (I saw him using it earlier, so I knew it was his). My first thought was to ""accidentally"" drop it on the ground and stomp on it and light it on fire, but I just put it in my apron and continued cleaning. He came back in an hour later to pick it up, and I smiled my fakest smile and gave it back and wished him a pleasant day.

It was the beginning of the shift so it was fairly slow. I had a couple get sat, I go through the spiel and the song and dance and just out of curiosity just made made small talk for no good reason, probably to avoid doing any sort of sidework or restocking. 

It turned out that they were on the way to hospital because she was in labor but the contractions were far enough apart that they figured they'd have a good meal before the baby came. It was their first child so they were pretty stoked and our restaurant was where they had their first date so it was an even more special occasion. 

I decided to do something special for them and talked to the manager about it and he agreed to comp half of their check and give them a free dessert. We were super into customer service and stories like that make it even better for us. 

When they were finishing up, I asked them if they were having a boy or a girl and they said a boy and I asked what they were thinking about naming him and they couldn't figure out a name. I jokingly said ""you should name him Edward after me."" We laughed about it and they went on their way and tipped me 75% of the check BEFORE the comp. AWESOME!!!

About two months later, I show up for my shift and my first table was them with their son, who they had named Edward because I had left such a mark on them and treated them so well that they really did it. I was really shocked by it and I made sure that we hooked them up again because I never thought there would be a child named after me in the world. 

I lost touch with them but I hope that they're doing well and that Edward is doing well.

I worked fine dining in NY for a while in my late teens. I was a server at a fairly swank place. The clientele wasn't too terrible and I enjoyed what I did. Then there were the Hendersons. (name changed to protect the rude.)

They were a couple in their mid-thirties, both professionals, always dropped a good chunk of change on Friday night dinners. However, they would NEVER get a babysitter. They had two girls aged 6 and 4 who would run off as soon and Mum and Dad's asses hit their seats. Let me just say first: I detest children. But they love me, and these girls were no exception. They would follow me around the restaurant, chattering at me about school and their friends and their family life. A couple of times I caught them taking tips off of empty tables but they cut that shit out when I scolded them. If I told them to return to their parents, the parents would literally shoo them back to me. The FM did nothing to help me since the parents were big weekly spenders. So Friday nights were babysitting nights in my section.

A couple weeks before I left the restaurant to move west, the Hendersons came in as usual. The girls ran up to me and hugged me (yuck) and immediately started being my shadows. The parents usually stayed two hours at most but tonight I guess they were trying extra hard to salvage their shambles of a marriage and they were drinking like fish. So I had my ""little helpers"" for three and a half hours. I had instructed them to stay out of my way as much as possible and to NEVER FOLLOW ME INTO THE KITCHEN. So what does the four year old do? Follow me into the goddamn kitchen. There was a hotel pan full of scalding hot apple compote on the garnish station (which doubled as desserts) and she dipped her finger in it. Cue ear-splitting screams. Chef, this morbidly obese Italian guy, comes barreling down the line, scoops up the little girl and takes her to the dish tank where he runs cold water over her finger. I was apologizing to him but he wasn't angry with me. He asked the little girl's sister where her parents were and took the kids over there while I ran food. He was very polite to the parents, telling them that the restaurant was no place for children to run wild, and the mother (who was fucking wasted) tore into him for a) touching her child and b) telling her how to parent. Chef's face was purple at this point. He hated customers. He just set the kid down and left and my FM had to go over and calm Mrs down. Gave them a discount and they stiffed me on the tip.

I left and FM called me a couple months later with some news. Since I left, the family came back once. Once they learned I had left, the girls started crying (which made me a little sad. I didn't like them hanging around me but they were essentially good kids who were ignored by their parents and wanted SOMEONE's attention) and the parents were a little put-out. After weeks of seeing me deal with it,  no other server would allow the kids to follow them, and the family had to eat...wait for it...TOGETHER.

When I took their orders, the guy just got a small appetizer and the woman ordered a regular meal. They explained to me that they had been to an Indian restaurant before this and the woman was not a big fan of Indian food. 

As the meal went on, I began to see all the signs of an awkward first date. They weren't talking a whole bunch, the guy seemed ready to leave (had his jacket on the whole time), and the woman seemed glad to see me every time I came back to check on the meal, like I was a welcome distraction from the awkward conversation.

My previous experiences serving religious people (mainly Christian and branches of Christianity) have been very bad. They were bossy, stingy, cheap and rude. They treated us waitresses as slaves, never said thank you, and acted like they were better than us because we didn't openly display our religious beliefs. 

So you can see why I'd be a bit sour when I found out that this entire weekend, and every weekend for the rest of the month, a Jehovah's Witness convention was being held at the centre next to the restaurant I work in. Work has been extremely stressful for me lately (see previous stories) so I was preparing myself for a busy night with snobby, ungrateful and cheap people who would try to force me into their religion.

Boy, was I wrong! Yes, we were very busy but the Jehovah's Witness people were not what I expected. They never once mentioned their religion save for a small name tag they all wore that said ""god is now"" or something. They were all extremely polite, made eye contact, and smiled at me. My section was full to the brim and I even had some people on the patio but I did not feel like I was in the weeds even once. The JW were content and not demanding. They thanked me for the complimentary bread and when I brought their food. They raved about how delicious the food was and even helped stack the empty plates. And to top it all off, they were amazing tippers!

The tipping part didn't even matter to me. The way they treated me with kindness and respect was enough to fill my heart with joy. I learned my lesson about never judging people before you really know them. 

The next night we weren't as busy but a large group of JW did come in. There was about 30 of them at one table and they did whatever they could to accommodate us and make our jobs easier.

Lady: ""Oh, that doesn't sound very good.""

Lady: ""I'll take the tuna burger please, and just make it how you usually do."" 

Me: ""Are you sure? If you don't like sushi you might not like it."" 

Lady: ""Yes, I want that my sister said it was great and I'm in the mood for tuna.""

Me: ""Can I help you?"" 

Lady: ""This tuna burger is really gross. It is like *raw* in the middle. I simply can't eat this."" 

Me: ""....*are you fucking kidding me*.......""   ""Okay we can cook it longer for you if you'd like?"" 

Lady: ""No, I can't eat this tuna. Can you give me store credit or make me a normal burger or something?""

(Tipping not discussed),173,24,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19j8gx/the_top_10_behaviors_servers_love_tipping_not/,"Okay, now for the top 10 things servers LOVE. (None of these are things you HAVE to do, but if you do them, we love you all the more for it.)
  
1. People with manners. Please and thank you aren't dead. And if your children have manners? My goodness, you are a rarity and are to be held on a pedestal.  Eye contact, don't mumble, enunciate... if you do all of those? Thank you.
  

2. People who are understanding. Honestly, we're all human. Things go wrong. If your order comes out wrong, or if you want Diet Coke, but I accidentally get you a refill of regular Coke. If you wait is 15 minutes longer than what they quoted you.... THANK YOU for being understanding and not biting my head off about it.  Thank you for being calm, kind and generally a good person who knows that sometimes stuff happens.  Also, people who don't get mad when we don't have something. ""You're out of filet medallions? Okay, no big deal, I'll have blah blah blah..."" Thank you for that. Really.
  

3. People who let our managers know when they've had a good dining experience. This is a big one. Managers get complaints ALL the time, every single night. It really wears them out. They really don't get to see firsthand how much people enjoy eating at their establishment. Honestly, if you had a good experience, whether I gave you great service, your food was fantastic, the atmosphere was wonderful.. whatever it is. If it was better than what you were expecting (and especially if it was better than your previous visit) ask your server for a manager and tell them. It's fantastic feedback.  
  

4. If you remember my name, I like you more. Simple as that.   And if after I ask you how you're doing, you ask me in return? Oh my goodness... you'd be surprised how rare that is.  Thank you, really.  Even if you're only doing it to be polite...it makes up for the person before you who almost made me cry because they were so rude.  
  
5. Guests who SEE me.  I don't know, this is a rough one to explain, but guests who actually see me are wonderful. A guest who I know sees me for what I am. A happy, helpful woman doing my job. Not a mindless robot programmed to bring your food and drinks and vanish into the scenery.  
  
6. People who honestly let me know if something isn't right with their meal.  I really DO care that you have a good experience. Honestly.  If your applesauce isn't cold enough, tell me. I'll get a fresh bowl for you. If your chicken doesn't taste right, I'll happily fix it.  I seriously do want you to leave happy. It has nothing to do with hoping for a better tip, I just know that if it were me, I'd want the food I'm paying for to be right.  I just want the same for you. So if you're honest? Thank you! :)
  
7. Polite teenagers. Oh my goodness... if you are a teenager and you look me in the eye and have manners??? You are also a rarity and to be held up as an example. Thank you so much and please, thank your parents/guardians from all of us.   
  
8. People who give credit where credit is due.  As I pointed out in the previous 10, servers don't make your food. We're not responsible when it's bad, and we're not responsible when it's good either. So, people who ask me to pass their compliments on to the chefs? You rock.  
  
9. People who make me laugh are awesome. It definitely breaks up the monotony. If you're creative or say something off the wall, it will throw me off (and I'll probably mess with you right back.) and it makes my day so much better.   Some people hate when guests make stupid jokes.  I love it.  
  
10. I write ""Thank you"" on all of my checks. If it's a widely recognized day like St. Patty's Day or something, I write ""Happy St. Patrick's Day!"" On the bottom of checks.  Just a nice little note.   If you are a customer who does stuff like that, you're awesome.  You really have NO idea how much those little notes brighten a server's WEEK.  If you write something like ""You are awesome!"" or ""great service!"" at the bottom of your credit card receipt, we love you.   
  

Once, I had a table that was so rude to me, it was the one and only time I've ever come close to crying at work. (I'm pretty tough though. I see guests make a server cry about once a week.) It was bad. THEN they complained to the manager that I was the rude one, and I got reprimanded for it.  Another guest saw all of this. Not only did they pull the manager aside and tell them what really happened (the manager apologized to me) they also left me $30.00 on like a $10.00 bill. On the back of the check, they wrote ""I'm sorry that there are people who treat you that way. You are a very sweet young lady and I can't understand why anyone would be motivated to behave in such a manner. I know money doesn't buy happiness, and I know this isn't much but I hope this helps a little bit. Keep your head up and keep that lovely smile on your face. It brightens up this entire place.""  
Luckily, they wrote that note on the back of their bill, not their credit card receipt... I keep that note on my at all times as a constant reminder of how awesome people can be.

They say it happens to everyone. That something like nine out of ten severs have or will drop plates or spill drinks or whatever sometime in their career. But it still sucks ass when it happens.

I was the only waitress on tonight, my restaurant being a relatively small one. Normally it's okay on Monday nights but today was pretty hoppin for whatever reason; I was juggling 10 tables and a stupid amount of take out orders that all seemed to happen at the same time.

Our beer comes in bottles, so we serve them along with a frosted glass to be poured into at the guest's leisure. They're notorious for tipping off of trays, so I've gotten into the habit of setting my tray down on adjacent empty tables to hand off drinks. Well, tonight my safety net back fired.

The tray hit the edge of the table and six beers and six frosted glasses went flying, then falling, onto the tile floor. Boom. Broken glass and beer was everywhere: all over the seats, table and the tiles. I didn't know what to do for a couple seconds so I just stood there, until the cogs start turning and I realize what just happened. I awkwardly apologized to the surrounding tables and ran to the back to get a broom and mop.

I'm proud to say I did not cry, despite annoyingly getting teary eyed. My angel of the evening was a middle aged woman in the table next to the beer-soaked one. Immediately after it happened she asked what she could do to help. I said I was fine (my voice was shaking so nice try making that believable), but she took the broom from me anyway and started sweeping up glass. I wiped down the tables and chairs, picking up the bigger chunks of glass with my hands (ow).

After things stabilized and I had got the restaurant back under control(ish), I tried to comp their bill. The lady would have none of it, so I added on a 50% discount (she still objected), but there was no way I was making them pay any more than that. She ended up giving me some kind words (they felt like a hug) and a good tip as well, the latter of which I am baffled by.

An older woman in the family asked me a few questions about the menu, what items I would suggest, etc.
Yesterday, the family returned to the restaurant. The same woman came up to me and asked about our house specialty burger sauce (I don't want to say what it is as it may give away where I work). She wanted to know if we would sell her some, but unfortunately, we do not sell our sauce. I told her so, but offered to get her a to-go container of the sauce and told her how to make it at home.

As she and her family were leaving, she asked my boss if she could speak to me. When I came out, she was all smiles.
""I just wanted to thank you so much. My grandson loved your burger yesterday so I brought him back again today for lunch."" She made small talk about her teenage grandson, and explained that the family has trouble getting him to eat. She told me that he is over 6ft tall but weighs less than 100lbs and can go days without eating a proper meal.

At this point, she shook my hand, and as she did so, she slipped 5 bucks into my hand. ""Thank you so much for the sauce and the recipe.

This may not be unusual to some of you servers, but as a busser, I do not get tipped out by guests. At first, I was worried that she had mistakenly given me the server's tip, but when I checked with the server, she confirmed that she had gotten a really good tip from them.

We tend to get lots of large family parties; therefore, we boast a pretty large kid's menu for all the little guys. However, some people always want more...

This family walks in and sits in my large booth - mom and dad, two younger girls, and a grandmother. They instantly reek of angry. You know that table - you can feel the energy of your section shift and your stomach drops.

I know for a fact they had no wait at the door or anything of our fault at this point to make them angry, so I decide to put on my best server face and give them great service. 

I go to get their drink orders, and the grandmother refuses to order, much less speak to me. In fact, getting the entire table to say the word ""water"" was probably the hardest thing I've done all week. But grandma refuses to tell me anything, so she gets nothing. I make a point of telling her that I will give her another moment to think on her drink order.

When I come back for the orders, the mother immediately orders the ""Kids Chicken Teriyaki sandwich"". Now, I know for a fact that this does not exist - it's an adult sandwich. We do a kid's Chicken sandwich, but not the specialty versions.

As I begin to explain that, she snaps ""well, she's gotten it before, so she'll *have it*.""

So I smile and decide to ask the manager howto do it. At the end of the orders, the grandmother snidely comments ""And, if you manage a *second*, I'd like a lemonade. I'm thirsty.""

OK, whatever. Act like I didn't try to get a drink for you before.

So I talk to my manager, and she gives me the same answer. What must have happened before is a massive alteration to the basic Kid's chicken sandwich, which costs us TONS of money. That gives you the same sized chicken breast, plus free cheese, pineapple, tomato, mayo, and teriyaki sauce. 

In the end, we decided it was best to appease the crazy lady because we were busy, and - to be honest - didn't want to deal with her. I bring the Lemonade back to the table, and let it go. 

As I see the food start to pop up in the window, I go to notify the table - since they are antsy, I figure they'd lik to hear that I was expecting the food soon. Instead, I got a ""KAY."" with a head bob and a glare from Mom. 

Someone else runs my food, and when I come to check, I cannot fucking believe it - someone, somehow, managed to let the kid's sandwich come out with a burger patty instead of a chicken breast. So that's a red ticket, and now the table has a reason to be upset. We remake the food and my manager runs it out, and I go fume that the tray went through three people and still made it out like that.

I go on being ignored, and get $4 on $55. But, I still call it a victory. I refused to take the kid's meal off of the bill. They already threw a fit and got an adult sandwich for a kid's price - and with that attitude? Nope, not happening. I'll take the hit on a tip for the satisfaction, once in a while.

1374187124.0,149,self.TalesFromYourServer,1ilc5k,The greatest tip I've ever received...,182,33,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1ilc5k/the_greatest_tip_ive_ever_received/,"In the Summer before I went off to college, which would have been 1999, I was working two jobs at restaurants in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. One was a terrible job at an all you can eat place with an outdoors theme to it. The second job was much better money-wise and more professional environment. It was a 1920s-style place that was a tourist place, complete with a flapper-style bar and the dining room in the 20s-30s motif. There were only three people on the waitstaff for about twenty tables and we were only open for five hours every night and we were out by 10pm, meaning I had plenty of time to go home and rest before going to the second job in the morning the next day.

It was at the second job where I ended up getting the greatest tip ever from a customer.

It was a Saturday night, usually a really good night for tips. There hadn't been a night other than a Tuesday where I didn't earn at least $75 for five hours of work. This night was not going nearly as well, though. I had been stiffed on my first table with a $50 tab and only been tipped 10% on two other tables that were well over that same amount. Our head waitress, we'll call her Tara, who was a really good looking brunette in her late 20s, saw the lack of money I was getting from these tables and threw me a bone at 7pm, two hours before close.

**Tara: I've got a special table for you. It will be your only table for the rest of the night.**

*Me: Okay...what is it?*

**Tara: It's a table full of businessmen. They all had at least one cocktail in the bar before coming in. They're going to spend a lot of money.**

*Me: Alright...but shouldn't you take it?*

It's worth noting at this point that I'm a guy, and usually, businessmen want to be waited on good looking women. However, it became pretty clear that they weren't there for fun. It was two companies out of the Twin Cities that were trying to strike up some kind of deal. We had roped off the section they were in so there weren't many distractions. I came by and took their orders, with each of them ordering either prime rib or porterhouse steak, each plate going at about $20 a clip, so the food bill was about $300 alone. All of them were drinking top shelf liquor, so the costs there varied based on what they were getting, but it was obvious not a single one of them cared about the cost. I did find it strange that an important business deal was being struck and every single one of them was drinking, but being 32 years old now, I understand why they did that. Being an adult sucks sometimes, but I digress.

The man who was put in charge of organizing everything told me to stay close but they needed to be left alone. I told them if any of them needed anything, just raise a hand to me and I would help them. It was the easiest way and I could see them from our station. No one had empty water glasses or were without a cocktail for more than necessary.

Closing time rolls around and they were about wrapped up, but the gentleman in charge requested some extra time. I told them not to worry about it and that we would just be going through our closing duties. He said it wouldn't be more than about fifteen minutes and that he wanted the check anyways.

The final bill was over $600, so I brought it over to him like he requested. It was at this point that I saw my first ever American Express Centurion Card. That was the first year that they were introduced, and if you've never seen one, they are black and gold (or silver, depending on the region I've been told), are made of titanium, and basically have no credit limit. You have to pay a one time fee of $7,500 and an annual fee of $5,000 just to have it. I've read that a Gulfstream V private jetliner was purchased with a Centurion Card once.

I took the card from him and walked it over to our bar area, where our bartender was cashing out. She saw the card, smiled, and said to me: You are about to get a big tip.

I kind of laughed it off, thinking it would be like 10% of the bill, which would have been just fine by me with how the night went. I brought the check back to him and thanked them all for being there, leaving them be to wrap up their deal. They left laughing, so I have to assume that some deal was struck.

The gentleman who was in charge came up to me as he was leaving and handed the check back to me that was in the standard black holder you see at every restaurant.

**You did a great job tonight. I hope you do well in college.**

He left and I didn't even check how much he tipped me as I was finishing up stocking our silverware. Tara came back over to me after he had left with a smile on her face.

**Tara: Well? How much did he tip you?**

I opened it up and about fell over.

*Me: ....he rounded it up to $1000. The bill was just over $600.*

**Tara: You owe me a drink.**

*Me: Probably more than that.*

The tip itself was about $375. Needless to say, it blew away every other tip I ever received while working there.

Really creepy. Brings candy for the servers. Totally pervy &amp; flirty. The girls typically deal with it because he tips absurdly well. This story is from about 3 months ago.

One night I'm talking to one of my tables. It is a rectangular high-top table against a wall, and I'm standing at the other end of the rectangle. I am taking their order. LITERALLY in the middle of speaking to them and getting their food order. All of a sudden I feel a fat pot belly against my back, and hands on my hips. Who else, but creepy old regular!

He. Is. All. Up. On. Me.

He whispers ""you look really cute"" in my ear. So close that I could feel his breath on my ear. Then he walks away.

I must have looked really horrified because my customers (you know, the ones who I was IN THE MIDDLE OF TAKING THEIR ORDER) say to me ""uh... do you know that guy?""

Fucking mortifying. Objectifying. Gross. I saw red.

The regular is sitting at his normal table with his wife. Right near service bar. As I'm walking towards him, he is giving me this goofy smile.

I get reeeeeal close into his ear, and I say, ""How fucking rude are you? Don't you EVER pull that shit again with me, especially not when I'm working. It's fucking unprofessional, and you don't touch a person like without their permission, especially since I hardly even know you. You are disgusting.""

Feels good, man. I had half a mind to just say it in front of his wife, but I didn't really want to blow up his spot. I just wanted him to never fucking touch me ever again.

He looked at me really horrified. He thinks he's really cute &amp; that all the servers love him.... but really, they just put up with him because he tips well. If more of the girls said something to him maybe he'd cut it out entirely. But whatever. I'm just glad he hasn't come near me much since, other than the cordial ""hi how are you?"".

Ever.",183,39,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1bfmue/seriously_if_you_let_your_teen_behave_like_this/,"So this table from Friday night *really* got me going.  I had this family of five come in, two parents and three teens.  Usually, I cringe when I see teens because they're really poorly behaved (they mouth off, give shitty looks to their parents, etc.) but these guys seemed great. There were two girls and a boy. I have a teenage brother myself and thought this boy was about his age (16.)  My brother happens to work with me as a busser, and Bingo.. I was right. He went to school with this kid. 
  
I greet them as usual and everyone but the boy is nice, friendly, etc. (I even let the girls order kid's meals because they were so polite.  I wasn't supposed to because they were over 12, but they were awesome and it's at our discretion if we want to bend the rules or not.)   The dad orders a tall beer and everyone else gets soda.  I run the drinks and they order an appetizer. So, I ring in the appetizer and bring them more rolls, giving them time to chat.  As the night goes on, the boy's soda and the dad's beer slowly edge toward the middle of the table (they're sitting across one another) and by the time the app arrives and I take their dinner order, the beer and soda are side by side. 
 
  
This makes it pretty obvious.  The beer has only had a few ounces sipped from it (it's a tall 23 oz. mug) and it's in the middle of the table... I'm now watching for this boy sipping Daddy's beer.   As they clearly aren't going to do it while I'm there, I ask a couple of bussers nearby to help keep an eye on them.   They see him mess with the beer while I'm gone, but nothing. 
  
Finally, as I bring their food and am dropping it off, the boy picks up the beer and takes a big gulp right in front of me.  Sweet... makes it easy for me. 
  
Immediately, I ask him ""Excuse me, do you have an I.D. on you?""  He acts all confused and goes, ""No.. but I'm *her* son."" and points to his mother.  I said, ""I'm sorry, but unless you're 21 with an I.D. you can't drink alcohol here.""   He gets pissed right away. ""Wait, even though I'm *HER* son?!"" 
 
Long story short, he gets pissy and the family doesn't say a word. The parents just look at me like I have two heads.  The Dad, like the son, steadily gets more and more pissed as I explain the rule (because the son kept questioning me.)  
  
Problem number 2.  Idiot boy ordered chicken tenders, grilled. Where I work, they're called ""critters."" Everyone calls them ""tenders"" though because it's the same thing.  So, before all of this, when they're ordering, he says he wants ""Chicken tenders with no crispy stuff on em. Just chicken.""  I confirmed ""So you'd like the chicken critters, grilled?""  He said yes.. done deal, right?   

 

Wrong. 

  
After being pissed about his lack of beer, he complained that his chicken strips were too small. (Well duh, they have no breading or ""crispy stuff.) and insisted that I rang the wrong item in.  He even whipped out the menu to show me ""Chicken tenders"" on the menu, saying that what was on the plate was something else.   
  
When he can't even find ""chicken tenders"" (because that doesn't exist) he points to the item he's now claiming he wanted.  
  
Country Fried Chicken - A tender chicken breast, breaded in blah blah blah.  
  
A ""tender chicken breast"".. not ""fried chicken tenders"" I point this out to him, but he insists it says ""chicken tenders""  
  
*THE WORDS ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM ON THE MENU AND HE STILL INSISTS I'M WRONG* saying he's reading ""chicken tenders* right there.  At this point, this kid is almost yelling at me and being a COMPLETE dick, even though I've already offered to have his meal changed/fixed several times.  He wasn't having any of it.  He was just yelling about the menu.  Finally, I gave up.  I asked a FINAL time if he wanted his meal fixed, and he said no.  He just sat there and pouted like the child he was for a few minutes, then begrudgingly ate the chicken he ordered.  
  
I'd had enough. I went and got my manager (who is also the owner) and asked him to speak with them because the boy was pissed.  I explained about the beer, the attitude he gave me, and the apparent miscommunication about the chicken he wanted.  
  
The brat then proceeds to yell at my manager about my stupidity and how I was rude about his beer and how I ordered his food wrong.  My manager explained that being rude wasn't necessary, and that he'd happily comp the kid's meal.  (queue internal flip-the-fuck-out moment.)  
   
  
The bill went from 75.00 down to 60.00... and they stiffed me.
  
It did make me feel a little better when the manager comped the meal at the computer by me and said, ""that kid's a fucking idiot. You didn't do anything wrong, don't sweat it."" and gave me a paper for a free meal.  
  
  
   
  
*TL;DR* Teenager and Dad try to swap a beer and soda and get pissed when I won't allow it.  Kid can't even read the menu right, and apparently didn't listen to me read his order back to him. So, he bitched about EVERYTHING because he was pissed at not having a beer.

**Background**
I'm not a server now, but I spent several summers and winter breaks as a server at a movie theater/restaurant joint.  You know the type, waiters bustle around in the dark while you get to eat and drink during a movie.  Cool.  

Anyway,  we would run through the theater about 45 minutes before the end of the movie and do ""last call"".  If the guest didn't want any more food or drink, we'd drop their tab, and scurry back by in about 10 minutes to pick up payment.  Some people were slow as hell and waited til the very last credit rolled before they paid, but most paid the first pass through.

**Weird Server Story here**
After dropping tabs, I was passing back through the theater to pick up payments.  I stopped to peer at one group, and the man handed me a scrap of paper.  It was a piece of the paper we give to the guests to write their orders on.  I was about to whisper that we already did last call and he couldn't order any more, when I actually looked at the paper and noticed it had **$20** written on it.  

I stopped and kind of chuckled but said, ""Can I grab payment from you, sir?""

Man: ""There it is.""  (Gesturing to the paper)
Me: ""...""
Man: ""That's $20.""
Me: ""Sir...this is a piece of paper you wrote on.  You have to pay...with money.""
Man: ""That's good for $20.""
Me: ""...you have to PAY.  With MONEY.  I need a credit card, cash...""
Man: ""There you go."" (still gesturing to the paper)

I was completely flummoxed.  Keep in mind all of this is whispered conversation in the dark.  I finally had to get my manager and the guy still refused to pay.  Eventually they called the cops.  I can't remember now if he ever paid or not.  It was really weird.  I had spoken to that group before the movie started and they *seemed* normal, and weren't foreign/language barrier.  He wasn't joking, so either he was crazy or...crazy.  

Sorry for such a long thing.  It was a very strange thing.    

**tl;dr:** guest gives me a piece of paper with $20 written on it and tries to pay with it.

Yesterday I was offered a waitressing position at the nicest restaurant in town. Working there would allow me to work less and focus more on school. Another bonus would be the fact that the majority of customers are going to be a lot more.. refined?... Basically I'm tired of white trash coming in, eating buckets of chips and salsa, and then getting stiffed on a $65 ticket. 

So yesterday I go in on my day off to put in a full two weeks notice. I wait almost an hour for my manger to get out of a meeting and follow her into her office just long enough for her to verbally berate me. I tell her how much I really have enjoyed working there but that financially it's an opportunity I can't pass up. She tosses a whatever at me and tells me I have to put in a written notice. I go back up front and write up said notice and give it to her. She then comes back and starts yelling at me at the bar infront of everyone. This is when another waitress (who in no way is my superior) gets in on the action and I now have two people basically telling me what an idiot I am. They both keep asking why i'm doing it and I tell me my financial opportunity line again when my boss finally goes ""No, you won't make more money there, you just don't want to tell me! It's something else!"" I am so flustered and embarrassed that after I manage to escape, I sat in my car crying for at least 10 minutes. 

I now get to go back in in an hour, so I guess we'll see how that goes. What bothers me the most about it is that I came in to do the right thing and put in a full notice, when we have people just stop showing up all the time, and that's how she treated me. I have been a great employee, I always go above and beyond what is asked of me, take extra shifts, and close several times a week, but she can't appreciate that I need to be able to focus on school. 

Bonus point that I don't know how else to work in, my FOH manager that I have been talking about is married to the General/Head of our restaurant, and there's a 90% chance they'll both be working today.

TL;DR- My boss acted like an unprofessional ass clown when I tried to put my two weeks in.

Kitchen was cranking out a ton of food. Bartenders were on point. We had no complaints. It was a beautiful, busy evening. Everyone was making money. Bussers were staying busy. Hostesses were doing an amazing job keeping servers from getting in the weeds. It was one of those nights where you're thrilled to be working in a restaurant. 

I go up to one of my tables. ""Hi, welcome to Here, I'm bowa and I'm looking forward to taking care of you folks tonight."" A mother and her son were having a date night. All was going well. I brought drinks and appetizers. The usual, ""And here is your martini, ma'am. Here is your coke, sir. Do you have any questions about the menu?"" Everyone is getting on fine. The son is kind of quiet but he's probably 17 or so and it wasn't out of the ordinary. 

I drop the food and come back to check on them. ""Ma'am, is your steak cooked to your liking? Sir, do you need any extra condiments?"" Mother is happy, son says he doesn't need anything. 

I go back a short while later and see the son's coke is getting low. ""Sir, may I bring you another coke?"" He nods and says, ""Sure."" Still no smile but, again, teenagers are often like this. 

 We get to the dessert time and I go through my spiel. Finally the mother says, ""Pardon me, bowa, I just wanted to let you know this is my daughter.""

I desperately and fervently wished for a hole to fall in. I (and I'm RARELY, if ever, speechless) just stammer out an, ""Oh my goodness. I am so very sorry."" Then kind of slink away to recover. 

I tell the kitchen what happened and, of course, they're dying. Their favorite (according to them...they were probably lying) manager, who is always good at keeping shit together, is beet red and mortified.

I go back up and ask, ""Ladies, did we decide on dessert?"" They both answered no and asked for the check. 

To be honest, I can't remember what type of tip it was. Which means it was at least standard. I would have remembered (and probably understood) if they had tipped below industry standard. 

I switched up my sir/ma'am spiel after that. Most folks were just ""folks"" from them on. Unless, of course, it was SUPER SUPER SUPER obvious. 

In my defense, this girl looked EXACTLY like a boy. From the shaved head, to the clothing (I assume she had on a sports bra or even taped her boobs down) to the timbre of her voice. God....those were the days. 

Also, before y'all ask, I'm in the South. EVERYONE is sir or ma'am. Kids, old people, teenagers, moms, dads, middle age...doesn't matter. It's just what we do. :) ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1jqtbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1jqtbj/the_case_of_mistaken_identity/,

(x-post r/PettyRevenge),166,26,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1ey1lw/revenge_on_bitchy_waitress_xpost_rpettyrevenge/,"My husband and I had gotten a gift card for Olive Garden, a couple months go by and we finally decided to use it. We were seated and our waitress introduced herself, she seemed really nice, she also seem relatively new. She gets us our menus and asks us if we want anything to drink, I ordered a glass of wine, she carded me (I'm 24) and she goes off to get it. In comes in the bitchy waitress (now referred to as BW); she demands to know, from me, if our waitress carded me, I told her she had and she stalks off. Our waitress is trying to bring my wine when BW stops her within earshot of our table and demands to know from her as well if she had carded me because 'that girl looks 17, are you sure her ID isn't fake?' She assured her it wasn't and that I was indeed old enough to drink. From that moment on BW wanted to complain about everything she thought our waitress was doing wrong. Side note; I've been a waitress, I know it can be stressful at times but it was pretty slow when we were there and I thought our waitress did a great job. BW complained about everything he could; I personally overheard her say our waitress was going fast enough (she was), she didn't talk to us (she talked plenty, I don't go out to eat to converse with the staff all night), she said she put to much wine in my glass (subjective, but I wasn't complaining:D) and had told her on multiple occasions that she could do better. It seemed as though she just wanted to tear her down. That became aggravating because I thought she was doing really well, regardless of her being new or not.

The revenge:

When we finished our dinner we had tipped our waitress 30% because she did very well and we thought she deserved it. On the way out I stopped at the hostess stand and asked for the manager. It took him awhile to get up front but by the time he did BW was near enough so she could listen in (assumedly, of course). I told him, in a voice loud enough for BW to hear, our waitress had done an amazing job and deserved to be recognized for her great work. The look on BW face as we left smiling at her was priceless.

A few years ago, I was working as a server at this establishment that was mostly a huge room, deck, sectioned off area for the bar, and a small restaurant dining room on the side. Served food, but was mostly about the drinks.

So I'm working the restaurant side, when this family of 4 sits down. Two kids, mom, and the father was a very large man. Talking 6'3"", looked about 240 of almost pure muscle that hasn't aged well, but still a very imposing guy (VIG). Go to greet and get drinks, and dad orders our largest strawberry margarita. No problem, or so I thought, so I put it in and get the drink from the bar. As I'm passing out drinks from my tray, I get all the little ones out of the way first. But then physics acts against me: the condensation on the bottom of the big margarita glass became too much, and the whole drink just slides on the tray. I couldn't catch it in time, and the whole thing just tips over the edge, all over VIG. He was, of course, livid, demanded to see the manager, all that business. He comped their meal and I apologized and said it was only an accident. They left and that was that.

But a month and a half later, I'm working the bar side. It's a busy Sunday during the height of crawfish season, and we're packed. My section is on the patio taking care of a large party of 12+. They order another round, one of the drinks is again our largest strawberry 'rita. As I'm trying to navigate my way through the crowd, some guy at one of the high-top tables bumps my tray with his elbow. I catch all the drinks except the big 'rita. Who does it happen to spill on but VIG, all down the back of his shirt. He stands up and looks like he's about to kill whoever spilled it, and recognizes me as the same server who spilled on him last time. I turned white and started stammering apologies while he gets up in my face. I was seriously fearing for my well-being at this point. The guy who bumped my tray turns around and tries to calm him down, but VIG is raging. I run to grab the same manager and explain things to him. They end up talking to him for over an hour trying to calm him down, comped his tab again, and he swore he was never coming back there again. Probably for the best.

Okay, not really. I've been a server for about 10 years. My various locations include slaving away at a chain restaurant, a family-owned diner, and a tapas restaurant in one of the wealthier counties in the U.S. in my ""short"" stint in the restaurant industry. 

I've seen a lot. Honestly, more than I can even remember in specific instances, but I've built up a pretty thick skin and a pretty good professionalism. At least in my opinion. I've had some horror stories, but I'm saving those for later. This one is nice, and fresh in my mind.

I hate waiting on families. Well, families with little kids. I really don't like small children. Okay, not true. I REALLY don't like most parents of small children. Entitled, demanding, and everything has to be about their precious little crotchfruit (I believe I stole that term from someone on Reddit). 

And then came last Sunday (a day ago, or two shifts ago, depending on how you term your time). A table of four--two adults, a five year old, and a toddler with Down's Syndrome. That little tyke was the best part of my night. They weren't even my table, but they were great even from a distance. The little boy was so excited about everything going on around him, and was a little loud, but as most of you can testify, there's a major difference between attentive parents and the joyful sounds of a child. He loved saying hello to everyone, was more excited about the food than most adults (we don't really offer a kid's menu), and he was great entertainment to one of my tables. 

My table was a very friendly and jovial mother and aunt that took out about five kids with her. They were having great conversations, the children ALWAYS said thank you, and we all were joking around.

Well, the little boy from the table directly across from them took special interest in them. He adored them, and was so happy that they returned his happy advances. When the family of four got up to leave, their toddler HAD to say good-bye to everyone, and he asked,

""Can I have a hug?!""

His mother instructed him that it wasn't really okay to ask that of people, but the mother/aunt from my table told her it was okay, and if it was okay with her, they would all love a hug.

And every single one of those kids from my table---ages ranging from six to at least fourteen, hugged that little boy while the mother/aunt talked with the toddler's mother. 

They were in the way, yeah, but everyone was so....happy....and glad that they all had this moment. It was crazy...the kind of situation that only seems to happen in restaurants. Strangers get together, they eat at separate tables, and judge each other based on...well, whatever. Or they just don't care. These ten people completely clicked with each other; they connected, they laughed, they hugged, and...

I really couldn't hate any of them. It was nice; it's kind of the best part of what we all do every day.

It started raining which happened to slightly inconvenience one table outside. The place was packed, so they couldn't be immediately sat somewhere else. They were somewhat drunk and making quite a big stink about it. Obviously we are doing everything we can to get them sat inside somewhere, moving tables inside etc. 

We will call the leader of the mad table Grumps. Grumps told John how they were really good friends with Ralph and how he would definitely be hearing about their bad experience and what a let down this was, how they should be moved right away etc. Well John wasted no time (he rarely takes shit from anyone.) letting Grumps know that Ralph was seated right on the other side of the restaurant. He was brought right over.

I've never had a job to be a server, heck even work at a food joint. Yet, after having loads of friends who have served in the food industry, or were a server specifically, I have learned a fair amount about what you folks put up with, and have become incredibly aware of what I do or others do in these establishments.

Second, I wanted to take my time to thank each and every one of you. I've worked in the Retail industry for some time, but I have yet to put up with the kind of utter crap that waiters and waitresses have had to put up with. Thank you, seriously. You make the night/day/visit all the more enjoyable. :) 

I did want to take some time to also describe a story. See, there's a sit-down restaurant chain that has a specific kind of noodle in its name, and it works.

I jaunted in with my room mate, and sat down for lunch (I paid, even.). 

The next 40 minutes had some of the best, most thoughtful service I have ever encountered. By a man who had to be no more than the age of 21. 

Everything was taken care of splendidly, and took care of the overly-sody soda my friend ordered (It was ""too selser""), and replaced it in a small frame of time. I was absolutely over joyed at the level of service we received, so much so that it became part of our regular lunch conversation. His attentiveness to not just our needs, but his other tables was well beyond what I've encountered before. I probably blew through about 6 refills of soda (I love the shit out of Dr. Pepper) before we even received our lunch. Heck, even before I finished my salad. 

Now, I am a penny-pincher by nature. I mean nothing by it, and I admit that the most I've ever usually tipped was 25-30% for good service. I don't mean to be a dick by it, and I am trying to get better at tipping more for good service. Old habits die hard, though. :\ 

I made sure to tip this man at least 60%, and after our lunch was done, and the bill paid, I waited at the front for the waiter to come by again, and requested his manager. 

Manager came by, and I probably couldn't have been more bright about this guys service. Manager left all smiles, and the waiter tapped me on my way out to say this:

Waiter:""Dude, I wanted to thank you for that. I'm currently being considered for a management position here, and you have no idea how   awesome I feel right now.""

Me:""You're very welcome man. And good luck!"" 

Waiter:""Thanks!"" *grin*

Feels good man. I honestly hoped the waiter was a redditor, too. Part of the reason I'm posting this. I was the bald guy, bit overweight fellow, with a taller, longer haired fellow with glasses with me. This happened about two weeks ago. :)

I will reluctantly admit that some reviews have some helpful constructive criticism. (Josh C., you were right.  Our cheese plate did look small so we added a giant hunk of a cheaper cheese and threw a shit ton more fruit on there.  It looks better and we can even charge another two dollars.  Thanks buddy.)  

It infuriates me when I read a review from someone who is unsatisfied, but never brings it up at the restaurant when we can fix whatever is bothering them.  It is our job to ensure you have the best experience possible.  It is hard to do that when you don’t communicate with us.

We had a review posted a few days ago that started off complimenting our atmosphere, the food, the cocktails, etc.  The one star came from their server.  They said their server, “Ashley"" was obviously hungover and smelled of alcohol.  They were not impressed with the service and wanted to tip 10%, but left 15% anyway.  When they checked their bank account, the restaurant had overcharged them by $20.  Like any good Yelper, they advised everyone else to boycott the restaurant and form a pitchfork mob and march to the chef’s house.

As a diner, I would be upset if my server had bloodshot eyes, looked like they were going to throw up for the third time that day, and was sweating Rumplemintz.  You know what I would do in that situation?  Ask to speak to a manager.  Then I could have a different server.

I would be even more upset if someone altered my credit card receipt.  But you know what I would do?  Call the restaurant.  Do you know why?  Because I am a grown ass adult woman, and the restaurant can refund my money, and will probably give me a gift certificate or something.  Yelp cannot refund my money.

Obviously the negative review sucks.  We fired the server.  It was his first week and no one liked him anyway.  I just wish they had brought it up during their meal, so that we could avoid that passive aggressive one star and they could have had service that deserved a 25% tip. 

Their visit warranted a phone call to the restaurant or a conversation with the manager, not a review.  Reviews are for problems with the restaurant as a whole, not just “Ashley.”  I immediately disregard reviews I read that call out a single person by name.  It feels very middle school to me.  When my boyfriend falls asleep with a beer in hand while he is watching Netflix and I have to try and get another PBR stain out of the couch, I complain to him about it.  I don’t go on Facebook to humiliate his drunk ass in front of the entire Internet.  I am not 13 years old.

When I asked if he wanted an extra shot, he said ""Of course! I don't care how it tastes, I just want something strong."" Something strong, blended with peaches, I guess.
They ordered from the more expensive items on our menu, and they were very friendly and fun to talk to. At the end, Flamebrows paid for the meal and left me a 35% tip including a $20 bill, on which he'd written with a red felt-tip pen: ""-Name-, Always pee before and after sex.

So I bring the ""salad"" to the child, and after checking back on him, I realize that there is a small argument going on at the table.

So I've been working at a brewery for a few months now and I really love it. I however can't understand what people have against craft beer. Prime example happened Friday night. It was my universities graduation this weekend, and I had a private banquet that night. It was supposed to be super easy cash, the family (about 20 or so) were going to come in at 7 and eat off of the menu, and then there were catered off menu appetizers at 8 for guests coming in and out. Grat on private banquets is 20%, but it's the only party I take that night. Regardless, I'm excited. 

6:30 rolls around and the grad comes in to set up. She lets me know that they need appetizers at 7 instead of 8 and no one is eating off the menu. First of all, you let us know half an hour in advanced, and secondly, there goes my money for the night. All right whatever.  There's a couple other problems (that I can go into if you'd like) but I'll leave them out and get to the point. Our brewery is extremely popular, and we have won national awards on several of our drafts. That being said, the only other beers we have are bottled bud light and miller light, plus we have a full bar.

In comes what I'm assuming is grads mom (maybe aunt? idk she was a bit older). Well call her Old bitch, OB for short. She's sitting next to another man, we'll call him dick, D for short. 

OB: Can I have a coors light and two shirley temples?

Me: Sorry mam, we don't carry coors light, we have several light beers on draft, and we have bud light and miller light.

OB: You don't have coors light? What do you mean?

Me: well, this is a brewery. We have a wheat beer and a pale ale that are comparable to coors light.
 
OB: So you don't have coors light?

Me: No. We have a pale ale and a wheat beer, we also have a hefe, which is the unfiltered wheat. (By now I'm getting agitated)

OB: Do you have any of those mikes hard or anything?

Me: No, but we have a raspberry wheat and a lemon ale if you want a sweeter fruity beer, those are a lot like summer shandys and stuff like that, a lot of women like them.

OB: oh, well... I need a minute to decide....

(In chimes Dick)

D: Do you have any wheat beer?

Me: (basically shitting my pants at the question)

OB: They have a raspberry wheat!

D: I don't want no damn raspberry beer!

Me: We have a wheat beer (pointing at the fucking beer on the list)

D: No I don't want raspberry

Me: Sir, we have a raspberry wheat, and a normal wheat. We also have an unfiltered version, the hefe.

D:Oh, you have a wheat? I'll take that then.

(back to old bitch)

OB: Which one of these is like coors light?

Me: The pale ale.

OB: ok, I'll take that. 

They get their beers and I check on them a few minutes later and ask how they like them. OB rolls her eyes, scoffs, and goes ""well I wouldn't order it again"" and turns around

Will it make you feel better if I tell you about when I was a server at a national chain diner, many, many moons ago? 

O.K, here goes:  Since I was the only one who could successfully ride herd over the teenage kids who hung out there 24/7, I was always assigned to the smoking section (where the delinquent kids parked themselves).  This means that 9 out of 10 tables I'd get were broke ass kids.

Some days, I wouldn't get any ""real"" customers at all, because no adult wants to sit in the Teenage Zone, smoking section or no.  If the actual paying customers wanted to smoke, they'd head to the bar.

These kids liked and respected me, for some reason (which may or may not have had anything to do with the fact that I took no crap from anyone), so they would always try to find ways to tip me, even when they had spent all of their hard earned allowance money on coffee and nachos.

So what did I get large piles of, in lieu of cash?  **Camel Bucks**.  That's right.  In the 8 months I stuck around that hell hole, I accumulated bags and bags of those things.

One kid even told me that he preferred another brand, but he ""sucked it up"" and smoked Camel so that he could tip me.  Gee, thanks.

It wasn't so bad, though.  That's how I got my cool poker table, and my boom box (I *said* it was a long time ago!).

Anyway, one of the waitresses resigns, and Stavros (not the real name) hires a new guy. Well, one day the new guy is taking a smoke break out back and Stavros goes to tell him he was just seated. Apparently the guy was smoking crack out back. S is such a nice guy that he actually asks him not to smoke crack anymore and come back inside and wait tables. So he does. Couple days later, and the same thing happens. Stavros, visibly upset at having to do this, sits him down and says, ""well, Newguy, I really like you and you're a great server, but we just really can't have you smoking crack outside the back of der Deutsch-haus.

I just about lost it yesterday. I work in a touristic beach on the coast of Florida. The restaurant is semi-casual breakfasts/lunch/dinner restaurant. We are busy all shifts, every day. It's ridiculous. Anyways back to the story. 


Yesterday I am working the breakfast shift and my section is on our covered outside patio.. And it's raining cats and dogs because well...Florida. So I have no tables ( who the hell wants to sit in the rain? )I finally get sat with a table of four after like 2 hours of no tables. Awesome, right? WRONG.  Table of four middle easterners who barely speak English. 


Whatever I'm middle easterner too, I'll just roll with it. 3 guys and 1 girl. The guy and the girl order coffee, other guy A orders a mimosa, other guy B chimes in and advises he wants one too. I request to see both of their ID's. (in the last 2 weeks 5 restaurants/bars have received huge fines because they were caught serving minors or were set up in a sting.) Guy A complies (Pennsylvania ID by the way so they aren't so fresh off the boat) , guy B says he doesn't have his, I advise him I can serve him alcohol. He tells me "" what you mean you can't give me alcohol, this is America the land of the free give me my damn drink"" I tell him "" sir it's state law, you have to look 45 or older or I need your ID"" ( he looked 19!!!) so I go get their drinks and take their orders.  Guy B decides he's going to order a clubhouse panini( ham, salami, turkey, bacon- this is important remember this) off of our lunch menu( which we aren't serving at 10am it says it right on the menu) I say "" sorry sir the lunch menu is not available right now"" he says "" why? Do I need an ID for that too? "" 


I calmly advise that we don't serve lunch until noon on weekdays. He then proceeds to go on a rant about how he can't eat anything on the breakfast menu because and I quote "" all this shit has filthy pork meat on it that you Americans love "" which is bullshit, I do not eat pork either and there is PLENTY to eat, not to mention the panini he wanted was Porks' R' Us!!! Anyways he finally chooses something and I go to ring it in. 


I come back to refill the coffees and what do I see? An extra mimosa on the table!!! They ordered from the bar!! He is sipping it while giving me the dirtiest look in the world. 


I tell my manager and he just says "" meh, he looks old enough."" I am fuming at this point. I finally bring out their food, and as I am setting his plate down he says "" you don't need ID for that?"" So I turn around and say "" if you keep pushing it you will."" So goes on the rest of their time spent there. Every time I come up to the table the guy says the same line. I damn near hit him with a coffee pot. I give them the check finally, and they ask for it to be split up, he says his remark and I go split the check. I come to pick up the credit slips after they have left, and lose it!! 


The couples bill was $58.00 they left me a tip of $3.00. Guy A and Doucheholio's bill was $78.00 and they left me a $2.50 tip!!


It gets better! Dick bag decides he's going to write me a letter on the receipt saying "" you ruined my fucking day, thank you for a horrible experience next time I will give you my ID and you can fuck yourself with it you cunt I hope you get fired."" 

TL;DR
19 yr. old looking guy gets mad at me because he doesn't have an ID so I refuse him alcohol, tortures me about it for the rest of breakfast service, writes me a letter on the credit slip calling me a cunt and telling me how I ruined his day.

I work/live in a bigger city and we unfortunately are a hot spot for a religious convention once a year. You know the type... they decide to ""not be gluttonous"" so they split a lunch between two people at dinner time. The ones that tip 5% or nothing at all. Or the ones that want YOU to find THEIR ""god"".

I was the last closer at the restaurant and was cleaning up my section 10 minutes before close. There was another person that had already been cut, but their table was camping out for the last 30 minutes. There were literally two tables seated in the entire restaurant. The other table was my own, and while they did come in pretty late, they were cool as hell so I didn't mind... I had to be there anyways, so no use in getting huffy.

I was crossing my fingers and toes as hard as I could because I was the only person that was still on the clock and was the only one that could or would be sat. Then came the family of assholes. Apparently when you're *this* religious you can't be bothered with common sense. They came in and ordered a moderately expensive meal, and split it between two adults. Meanwhile their brat children ground crap into the carpets, colored on the freaking table, and threw drawn butter all over the place. I knew this was going to be a freaking TREAT to clean up, but whatever.

The other table I had was at the salad stage, but the table of assholes would not leave me alone. I ended up giving ""ok"" service to the nice people because the other table would not stop talking for 10-15 minutes at a time. Whenever I'd try the, ""Oh I need to get something for them"" he'd CONTINUE TALKING. Take a freaking social queue and STFU!

The good table left a fair / moderate tip for the service they should have gotten, and left. I started cleaning my section as I needed to get as ahead as I possibly could. All the while asshole table kept chatting it up and demanding that I look at him while he's talking. The problem was he possessed the eye contact intensity that gets awkward when it's prolonged. I kept cleaning and talking because there was nothing else I had to do before I left.

After being in the restaurant for over TWO HOURS he decided he wanted to give me the ""tip"", but he left it out in his car. It's completely against restaurant policy to open the door for ANY reason after they've been locked. He demanded to go to his car and bring back my tip, so I asked the manager and she allowed it (I JUST WANT TO GO HOME I HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW AND ITS FREAKING MIDNIGHT!). 

He brought back the cheapest looking ""blessed"" trinket I've ever seen. This was my f***ing tip for a $70-80 ticket and MORE TALKING. I ended up being as nice as I could, but once he and his douchebag family left I literally could do nothing else but let out the most frustrated scream I've ever let loose in my life. Not only did I have 8am classes the next day, but I also had to work the night after I get out of class as well, so I                                                 made sh*t for money, had school the next night, and get to rinse and repeat all over again.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1dhlx6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1dhlx6/oh_so_i_get_to_stay_for_an_extra_two_hours_oh/,

But nonetheless, you will all relate and realize how frustrating this would be. To the story:

It was a Friday night, around 10:55. We close at 11:00, and as I'm sure you guessed, here comes a party of seven walking in to the restaurant. No call or notice, just seven walk-ins. Now I'm the fortunate one to take these lovely people, because ya know, we can't refuse them. I was already upset at the time they came in, but not only that, but because there was seven of them (the restaurant requires eight in the party for automatic gratuity). So, I'm thinking well  if they came in this late and don't give a shit, then well fuck me they must not give a shit to tip either. Whatever. I felt extra diligent and hard-working that night so I decided to treat them as if they were regulars.

I won't spare you what happened during the course of the meal, just your standard send-backs and complaining about the food in general. Whatever. That was kind of expected. It's what happened after the meal is why this is post worthy.

So the main guy (I assume this because he was the loudest and actually decided to pick up the whole bill at the end) shouts at me and asks in a unnecessarily boisterous voice, ""Say man, I know y'all do birthday songs and sing to people, but do you have any wedding songs? Ya see, my daughter is getting married in a couple days and I was wondering if you could do that for her.""

Now. Not only was I completely befuddled because I had no idea that a 'wedding song' would even be considered to be a normal thing to do at a restaurant. But the restaurant was empty (remember they strolled in at 10:55, so it would just be me singing to them with no appreciation by anyone but themselves. BUT. I felt extremely generous and thought maybe if I went above and beyond, I could squeeze a $40 tip. MAYBE.

Despite my confusion, I said, ""Ya know what, sir, we don't, but give me a minute and I'll go back in the kitchen and write something for the bride."" The party was elated and started giving me praise and such.

So I legitimately went back into the kitchen and wrote some words down and put some thought into it to make it creative. Admittedly, I based it around our standard ""Happy happy birthday from all of us to you, we wish it was our birthday, so we could party too, hey!"". I don't really remember the exact wording, but it was clever, I thought.

Now the other server (there are two closers, I am one of them), is off doing her thing and I can't find her. So I walk to the table and *acapella* sing this new song I made for them. I didn't really pay attention to the table at the time, but all I knew was that they loved it. Clapping, praise, handshakes, etc. Their reaction kind of relieved me a LITTLE bit. But then, one of the guys states, ""hey, can you do that again, we're gonna put it on YouTube, AND (insert name here) didn't see it!"" Here comes one of their party's people I didn't notice was gone , who was in the bathroom during all this. Beyond pissed.

Despite anger and questionably non-moralistic thoughts, I sing the song again. Yay yay everyone is happy (but me).

Time for the check.

That one loud guy I mentioned earlier took the check. $140. He had his card waiting (unexpectedly). I went to go run it. I came back and dropped it off, and did my usual ""Bye thanks for coming blah blah blah.""

They leave about twenty minutes later (so it's now about midnight) and I go to the table and face the inevitable.

Amount: $140.00
Tip: $2.00
Total: $142.00

Just in time for the after church lunch rush. It's now 2:15. How much have I made today, you ask? 10.00? 15.00? Nope nope! Not a penny. However, I'm proud to say I now have three shiny new folded church fliers.   


I've had two large parties so far. Everyone has shown up at random times. Did everyone wait for the full party to be present to order food? Of course not. They all order the moment they sit down, but then complain when the food comes out when it was ordered. (Sorry. You can't have someone join your party 30 minutes after you have ordered and expect their meal to come out with yours. It doesn't work that way.). Now I'm on my phone, so I'll probably have to edit the later, but bear in mind that I'm ordering food when they tell me to. I have even warned them that if they don't order together, the food won't come out together. ""Oh that's fine."" They've said. And then they bitch when they have to wait and everyone else is chowing down. 

  
So far everyone has been rude, snippy, short with me... And completely stiffed me because leaving a church flier telling me how Jesus hates me because I wasn't in church this morning (because I was preparing to come in and serve your grumpy asses) is apparently acceptable.

No offense intended to anyone who works within the Golden Arches, but... anyway this is something I witnessed at a cafe that I absolutely love in my hometown, and though the event didn't last very long at all... I think it brought most of us present a little closer together. 

So, among many other things, this cafe makes higher-end breakfast bagel sandwiches on these huge, awesome bagels, everything cooked to order, organic, cage-free, etc. It was a moderately busy weekday and there were a couple people standing around waiting for their food. I was about two people behind a woman who orders a bacon, egg and cheese, who I'll call BEC, and then moves off to the side to wait. The person in front of me orders a latte, and the barista makes it, latte art and all. This girl knows what she's doing, she's fast and efficient, so by the time she gets to me, probably 2 minutes or less has passed. I'm up, she smiles at me and says ""hey, what's u-"" before she's interrupted by a VERY LOUD **""EXCUSE ME!""** exploding out of BEC's now twisted mouth. BEC looks pissed. Everyone else looks like ""WTF?"" 

Badass Barista (BB): Uh... (to me) sorry about that, hold on just one sec. (to BEC) Sorry, did you need something else?

BEC: WHERE is my sandwich? This is ridiculous!

BB: It'll be up in a just a few minutes, I-

BEC: Well, can you go CHECK ON IT?

BB: I'm sorry, but it's only been a couple minutes since I put your order back. The bagel takes time to toast, the eggs and bacon take time to cook. We don't use a conveyer belt oven or pre-made egg patties, and on top of that, I know the cook is working on several orders at once. I promise, it won't be much longer, but there's no way it's done yet. 

(Just as a note, this whole speech was delivered in a clearly no-nonsense, but still pretty polite and even friendly way-- much like at my cafe, the way most of the people at this cafe work is that they'll level with you, remain friendly, but they're not going to be like YES MA'AM, OF COURSE MA'AM, like I always had to in fine dining. Kind of like bartenders, minus the booze.)

BEC: *GRUMBLE GRUMBLE* What the HELL IS THIS? *Frantically looking at her watch, the clock on the wall, then at everybody around as if to rally their incredulity and rage, when they all either don't give a shit or look like they want to slap her*

Me: Yikes... anyway, can I have a double cappuccino, super dry please, in an eigh-

BEC: MISS. Can you CHECK ON MY SANDWICH NOW? THIS IS CRAZY! How LONG can it POSSIBLY take to make a BACON, EGG AND CHEESE??? *Again, looking around at everybody like, ""can you believe this?"" and ""why isn't this bitch running to fetch my sandwich??""*

BB: (to me) I'm really sorry... (to BEC) Ma'am, not 30 seconds ago I explained--

Awesome 40-something Guy a few places in line behind me: **LADY.** ***SERIOUSLY.*** This is **NOT** McDonalds. **STOP.**

She shut the hell up and let me order my drink, the people already waiting got their food and left, same thing with her mere minutes later-- just before she stomped out of the cafe like a petulant child.

We went to an Italian restaurant last night and as the title says, sat in my friends section. She came up to us and said ""What do you want to drink?"" just kind of like ""you're my friends so IDGAF how this is going to go."" This is before we had menus or anything. She kept trying to push the wine or liquor, despite me telling her that I had taken Vicodin (which can cause a fatal reaction), when she finally realized she wasn't going to get us to buy alcohol she switched to the non-alcoholic mixed drinks. I drink water. That's it. I don't like lemonade and I reallllllllllllly don't like peach-raspberry lemonade iced tea. Gross. Anyways, she finally settles on the water, comes back and says ""what do you want to eat? Oh, I should probably get you menus, huh? Do you want bread?""

After a while we get our bread and such, order our food, she comes over to chat, burps at our table, blah blah blah.

Food comes out and the shrimp fettuccine alfredo BF ordered is BAD. He said the sauce was completely bland and the like...4 shrimp that are in there are so overcooked they are inedible. She comes by to check on us and I mention the problem with his shrimp, I ask if he could get new, non overcooked shrimp. She said ""not really...unless I charge you for them. The kitchen has been overcooking the shrimp all night."" And that was that. We weren't going to pay for them to try again on the shrimp. BF said after she walked away that he wasn't going to pay for the shrimp, it was an extra $3 for them. When she comes back I ask if the shrimp can be taken off the check since he wasn't able to eat them. She said ""well, my manager will have to do it and she's busy now so it'll take a while."" and walks away.

The manager took off $7 from the total instead of the $3 the shrimp cost so that was nice. 

From looking at Facebook, she had a table before us that was $170 and had stuff comped down to $117 and they stiffed her on a tip.

I'm going to take a detour for a second, I make more than BF does, especially since he's out on workers comp from work having just had surgery from an injury. He had just gotten paid and wanted to treat me to dinner. Ok, back on track. So the check comes and he puts his card in the folder thing while she's still standing there talking to us. She says ""oh, you're paying??"" sounding COMPLETELY shocked. 

What. The. Fuck.

I'm not too happy with her right now. Apart from the issues with the service, that comment was like a direct blow to his masculinity. I plan on talking to her about that when I see her next but I wanted to bring up the issues with her service as well...what suggestions would you have that I can mention?

BF was saying that even though our table was a bit different, we're friends and such, other tables can see her interacting with us like that. That's definitely something I'll mention.

Wednesday is buy a burger, get a burger free. All specials are dine in only. Bob comes in daily and knows this. Me and one other girl are working this Wednesday. The way our restaurant/bar works is both servers tend to the bar and rotate every other table on the floor.

It's great, because you can get quadruple sat at any time, and it's horrible because you can get quadruple sat at any time. I was closing the lunch shift, so I had a side of the restaurant and the patio. 

I think I can handle 5 tables at once, 6 is pushing it. I had 8 at the time. I was somehow doing a good job of keeping up, and my tables were all friendly and understanding. One lady in particular kept telling me to take my time.

Two girls that work at my restaurant came in to sit on the patio, as they just finished their finals. We always joke around with each other, so we say mean things all the time. They decided to pretend to be somewhat rude, which I didn't mind, because we were friends. After somewhat ignoring getting their drinks (they'd understand, I had 8 tables) in favor of cashing out 3 other tables, one of them called out ""PARCHED"", in a fake whispered voice. The understanding lady loudly followed up with ""WHO GIVES A SHIT?!?!"" Most of the tables on the patio gawked, and I finished grabbing checkbooks and went inside.

I decided on my next trip out (with their drinks), I'd explain to her that we're friends, and they're just pretending to be rude. When I did, she said she knew (I presume they talked when I went inside), but that she was very protective of servers, as it's how she got through her Masters and Doctorate degrees. She left me 20% and a huge smiley face on the receipt.

I should've told her that she can sit in my section any time lol.

They were courteous and called ahead of time to reserve a table, and showed up on time. For whatever reason, it was decided that I was to be their only server. I was okay with this, because I can usually handle a 20 top with ease. I can always ask the other servers to catch refills and what not.

However, it was a 20 top with nothing but 20-something females who were all drinking martinis. And as luck would have it, we have no bartender on Thursday nights so I had to make all the drinks myself. The whole time I was bringing drinks to the table, they were asking if they could order appetizers, and I kept telling them I'd get to it in a minute. So I come back after making the drinks, and take their appetizer order, then a few minutes later I take their dinner order. Everything went smooth after that, except for when it came time to pay.

They were all on separate checks, and about half paid cash, and the other half with cards. So I had to make change for all the cash customers. Then after swiping all the cards and giving them back, I realized I DIDN'T INCLUDE GRATUITY. Their bill was close to $300, and hardly any of them tipped, even though I made an announcement that gratuity was NOT included. 

Then to top it all off, after they left, I realized that one of the girls who said she was going to pay in cash actually didn't pay me at all. Her check was $25, so that had to come out of my pocket since it was my fault that I didn't collect her payment. Although I should have made around $55 tip from the table, I only made $10, minus the $25...so I ended up paying $15 to serve them. 

So that was my night. Thanks for letting me vent ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1astw6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1astw6/well_last_night_sucked/,

What made this double even better was that I had to come in earlier than usual. This made for a solid 13 hour shift of non-stop busting my ass. 

The day started off somewhat calm. Me and the other server had an hour to prep for a buffet party of 40 guests. We have no busser and whoever cleaned this morning neglected to do a few of his responsibilities. My manager is giving me this laundry list of things to get ready and I feel confident that I can get the important stuff done by the time people show up. After she tells me this, she leaves the restaurant to pick up more stuff for the party.

Five minutes go by. I get a phone call.

Surprise! Through some miscommunication, the people are under the impression that the party starts a half hour earlier than what the reservation in the book says. At this point I have about 14 minutes to get shit done. Manager is hurring back. Unlike most every other party, I have guests begin to arrive around 6 minutes early. 

So now I have to greet them, take drink orders, talk to the person in charge of the event, etc. etc. etc. All on top of doing almost everything else imaginable.

My manager returns and is woefully unsympathetic. 

""Why isn't 4 pots of coffee made?""

""Why isn't all the food brought up?""

""Why aren't all the glasses filled with water and ice?""

""Why does the server station look like a mess?""

""Why isn't the buffet set up?""

""Why didn't you re-clean the 30 coffe mugs?""

""Where are all the impossible to find special utensils?""

""Where's all the juice/milk/tea etc. ?""

""Did you even take a drink order yet?""

""Why aren't you 10 places at once?""

UUUUUUGH! Despite all this nonsense, we were able to pull through. The party went well any they were relaxed people anyway. I am simply amazed that she cannot understand how l can only accomplish one GD thing at a time, and that it make take more than zero seconds to achieve.

I'm tipsy, and home alone, so apologies for the wall of text below.

I moved to Dallas from California about 18 months ago, and the first job I got was as a cocktail waitress at the crappiest, dirtiest, shadiest bar I've ever been to.  Whoopee.  Normal work days were the entire time the bar was open, so some shifts went well past 12 hours, with no breaks.  This was also a bar that allowed smokers, so that's fun.  ANYWAY, the point is, it was a total shithole, and it was by far the worst job I've had in my life.  BUT I earned some fantastic stories.  Like this one.

It was a normal Thursday night, the ebb and flow of creeps and rednecks as usual.  Most of the patrons were male, and loved to grope, make sexist ""jokes,"" and walk tabs.  I was having a particularly bad night, as I was in the hole $50-ish since servers were responsible for all walked tabs.  I had already survived a table of 40-something Limbaugh fans who grabbed my boobs so hard that they still were sore, so when this guy walked in, I was ecstatic.  

He was the epitome of normal.  White polo shirt, tucked into his worked-in khakis, somewhat beaten leather shoes, flip-phone in a belt clip, and the most average face ever--not ugly, not attractive.  He said ""please"" and ""thank you,"" made eye-contact, smiled, and silently ate his wings, drank his Curz Laht, and watched the Rangers.  He never once gave me any reason to think he was anything odd, at all.  But as I'm handing him his closed tab and card back, he reaches out and touches my hand, and very politely says:

Him: ""Ma'am, this may sound forward, but I have something I've been dying to ask you.""

Me:  ""Ask away!""

Him: ""Would you like to come to my home one quiet evening and rub pasta on my nipples?""

Me:  wat.jpg  ""Um.. I'm sorry?""

Him: ""Would you like to come to my home and rub pasta on my nipples?""

Me:  ""Well.. is there sauce?""

Him: ""Nope.""

Me:  ""Oh, well then unfortunately I will not be able to oblige.""

Him: ""Okey-doke, well have a good night!""

I spent the next few hours pondering this fetish--as in, how in the hell does someone come up with such an idea, (admittedly judging the poor fellow) but later that night when I got home, and was standing above the stove in my borderline-vegetative state, boiling a box of Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese (the nectar of the GODS), I wondered, what IF, just what IF.. he was on to something?

If you guys like this one, I have a bunch of even better ones.  Thanks!

TL;DR  Beer, rednecks, pasta nipples, possibly mis-placed judgement.

EDIT:  For those of you asking, yes, I did try it.  Unfortunately, due to my exhausted stupor, I did not make the connection that pulling noodles out of a boiling pot could be potentially dangerous, and ended up with a few macaroni-shaped burns on my nips.

I was the kitchen manager and between 1:30 pm and 4pm, was alone with the front of the house manager most days. The FOH manager was this hulking 6'7"" former college linebacker. Really nice guy, but intimidating to anyone that didn't know him.

Generally, we use this time to clean things up, prep for the night, normal restaurant stuff. We might get 2-3 people coming through the door an hour, but nothing too bad. 

So on this random Monday in the middle of summer, we notice this guy decked out in bicycle clothes, a backpack, and a huge water bottle come in and just walks past the front counter. Our front counter and kitchen line was set up near the front of the store, so you couldn't really see most the dinning room without leaving this area.

Our restaurant also had these hallways past the bathroom, to what looked like an employees only area, and had access to the parking garage in back. Since he can access the garage through our store, we just figure he's leaving out the back, it happened all the time. But then, 3-4 minutes later, we see him walk back out the front of the store. OK, maybe he used our restroom and ignored the customer's only sign. Whatever, I'm not going to police the restroom.

But then we see the same guy Tuesday. This time, we have a few customers in line, so we just ignore him. He again leaves after a few minutes.

Comes in again on Wednesday. The FOH manager is in the office, so I can't leave the register area. Guy leaves after a few minutes and still hasn't acknowledged us.

Finally, he comes in on Thursday, we're completely dead, and the FOH manager decides to do a casual stroll in the dinning area to see what this guy is doing. I hear some arguing, some entitlement, the FOH manager says, ""You're an idiot"" and then this guy storms out of the front of the restaurant. 

Turns out, this guy has been coming in and filling his 64oz water bottle with soda from our soda fountain. When confronted he replied, ""If I bring my own cup, its free. All the restaurants on this street have that policy."" 

FOH manager says, ""That's ridiculous. So by your rules, if I bring my own plate, it would be free food.""

The biker then steps into the FOH managers personal bubble, puffs his chest out, dumps out his entire water bottle of soda onto the soda fountain and says, ""Fine, guess I'll never come back here again.""

FOH says, ""You're an idiot. Why would I want you to come back? You've never bought anything here.""

Check one, impressed. DerpDonald's usually takes a second math'ing.

The person in front of me takes a minute, no big deal, I'm not in any rush, I just turn up the music and snuggle my blanket a little closer (damn winter), turning off the car so I don't waste gas (and my headlights so I don't blind the people in front of me).

They get their food, I pull up, same girl that took my cash greets me with my drink. Later I realized she was literally the only one working, the one other guy who was there was on his break. She apologizes and says it will just be a minute until my fresh fries and nuggets are finished cooking. Whatever, still not in a hurry, yay, fresh food.

Thinking about the ice cream I watched her hand the previous customer, I realize I should grab some cookies. (Shut up I wasn't high. ^^^yesIwas). 

It's at this point I realize she's the only one working, when trying to get her attention proved unsuccessful as I watched her running around attempting to do a million things at once (and succeeding!).

After about another minute (so we're still at less than 5 minutes in the drive through here, pretty normal for my busy ass city) she comes to the window with my food and thanks me AGAIN for my patience. I ask if it's too late to add some oatmeal cookies, and she seems genuinely surprised I'm not complaining... so much so that she only takes one of my two dollars, tells me not to worry about the change, and comes back with THREE oatmeal cookies.

Just had to say thank you to everyone that deals with assholes all day, this made me drive off with the biggest smile on my face.

This happened yesterday (4th of July).

All of our dishwashers are mentally handicapped. I don't have any problems with this because most of them are really polite and helpful... but this one guy makes work miserable for everyone when he's there. Whenever I or another busser brings back dish carts for him, he'll curse at us under his breath and call us names. He gets away with it too, because when we complain to the managers they basically tell us, ""We can't do anything about it since he's mentally handicapped,"" so we've had to learn to put up with his crap. Since I'm kind of used to him doing this, it's not usually a big deal. He's a jerk, whatever.

Yesterday, however, was the last straw. I was the only busser on for lunch shift. A week or two before, our manager asked that, if we have time and notice the dishwasher is behind, help him break down the dish carts. This is by no means mandatory.

Now, this being 4th of July, I was of course too busy to assist in emptying out the carts. I didn't think it was a big deal, because the diswashwer was obviously not busy at all. Every time I went back there he was sitting down or goofing off. Well, any time I would go in the back to grab a cart, I get attitude from him because he doesn't want to do any work. I can hear strings of curses at me from under his breath, but I ignore it because he always does this.

Eventually though, he started addressing me directly, which is something he's never done before. If I had a minute I would help put napkins away or empty out the cups, leaving the dishes for him. When I would leave the dish room after having just helped him (again, not mandatory), he would yell after me stuff like, ""Thanks for nothing!""

I would just roll my eyes and ignore him, but finally he said something that made me snap: ""All you do is stand around, you don't do your job, you're not good for anything!"" At this I was stunned. He had never said anything like this to me, and I knew for a fact I was the best busser in the entire restaurant (I was the only one who went above and beyond my job requirements, and all of my supervisors have already flat-out told me I'm the best worker they have).

I left the dish room kind of in shock. I didn't really know how to respond to something like that, but the entire time I was on the floor cleaning, I just kept turning his comment over in my mind, and as I did, I got angrier and angrier. Finally, as I was taking another cart back to the dish room, I snapped. ""For your information, I work my butt off running from room to room trying to get all these tables done."" He started yelling over me, ""Yeah right, you lazy bitch,"" but I just kept going. ""If you don't believe I work my butt off doing my job, go do it your damn self!"" The dishwasher storms out of the room. All cooks are staring at me.

I just fucking broke down and started crying (while still trying to work). As I was returning to the floor (crying), cooks and servers started asking what was wrong. All I could say was his name as I made my way over to a dirty table. I'm sure I looked a little ridiculous standing there, crying over a dirty table as I pick up cups and plates. Whatever, I didn't care. I was going to get my job done and I wasn't going to help our jerk dishwashwer empty out carts anymore.

Finally, one of my (new) supervisors saw me crying and asked me what was wrong. I unloaded on her, and she stormed off in the direction of the dish room. At this, I was surprised. Our dishwasher had never been punished or anything before for the way he treated us. The one year he even bruised a girl's pelvis bone because he had thrown a cart at her way too hard, but he still got away with it. And now, here was my manager giving him an earful. She even got the building manager involved. They told me I didn't have to help him with the carts anymore and even got him to apologize to me. Eventually, I did start helping him with the carts again once we slowed down and he stopped cursing under his breath at me.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1373065978.0,,,True,t3_1hphdh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hphdh/if_you_dont_believe_i_work_my_butt_off_go_do_my/,

I recently started waitressing again at a place where I worked a few years ago, just part time to fill the gaps in my freelance work. I was dreading it. I knew the money would be good, but I remembered how stressful it could be and how it made me hate people. 

But you know what? I've worked three weekends so far and had some busy shifts, and I've had way more good customers than bad. I just wanted to express my appreciation for some of them.

* **Eggplant/burger mixup guy**: Our restaurant doesn't use POS, and there's a lot of different abbreviations to remember. I wrote down the wrong one and you got a burger instead of an eggplant melt. The moment I realized what happened I went over and apologized and was about to bring it back and face the wrath of the kitchen (and oh, their wrath can be terrible). Never in a million years would I have expected a customer to go ""wait, what's on the burger? Nah... this looks good. Don't worry about it, I'll eat this instead."" Thanks, eggplant/burger mixup guy. You are a gentleman and a true bro. I'm so glad you enjoyed your burger.

* **Penny ladies**: I liked the three of you as soon as you sat down. You gave off good vibes. It was a pleasure serving you. You let me know right off the bat that you wanted three separate checks, so it was a piece of cake to keep track of who had what. Some tables, I'll bend over backwards trying to give them good service but they still treat me like I spat in their Pepsi and called their kid ugly. But it was clear that you three appreciated my efforts. When you left a penny on the table in addition to your tip - an old-fashioned symbol for good service - it really made me happy. Waiting tables may not be my dream job, but it made me proud to know I did right by such nice people. 

* **180 Lady**: I thought you were going to be a nightmare. You came in with your family and I had you pegged as the impossible-to-please matriarch. I kind of fumbled the first question you asked me about the menu, and you gave me the ""oh dear the waitress is an idiot"" look and I thought it was over. But we rallied, 180 Lady. You had more questions, and instead of choking, I decided *I can still pull this shit off*, and I gave an eloquent recommendation about an appetizer special I haven't tried, and you ordered it and cleaned the plate and from then on I could do no wrong. You did a 180, and I got a huge confidence boost, and your family was delightful. You even complimented my looks in a very nice, respectful way. Thanks!

* **Bloody Mary guys**: Omg you guys, I have not made a Bloody Mary in four years, but the place was packed and there was no way I was going to ask someone else to stop what they were doing and show me the right way to do it. So I bullshitted together two ghetto-ass Bloody Marys with a whole lot of well vodka and enough Bloody Mary mix to make it look decently bloody and a couple drops of Tobasco because fuck horseradish. Garnished them up with celery and olives and citrus and brought 'em over with a smile on my face, and you lovely boys took a drink and called them fantastic. God love ya. I made your next round even stronger just because you didn't call shenanigans on my hot mess cocktails.

* **The best 6-top**: Can you guys, like, teach a seminar on Being Good Restaurant Patrons? You ordered simple beverages, you asked intelligent questions about the menu, asked my opinion on a couple things, then all ordered with no complicated modifications. One of you ordered a side of sauteéd spinach and made sure to ask me to tell the chef how good it was. I love that! You were all friendly, courteous, and low-maintenance.

So thank you, awesome customers, and all of the other good customers I've had these last three weekends. You have vastly outnumbered the unpleasant people.

1363795849.0,110,self.TalesFromYourServer,1ao3z8,We had no running water on Saturday night...rant,132,22,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1ao3z8/we_had_no_running_water_on_saturday_nightrant/,"Warning, wall of text. 

TL;DR Restaurant water main pipe burst, had no water pressure, we still open. 



So, I work at a casual upscale restaurant. We really only have one main competitor, which is right across the street. We have a Cheesecake Factory and CPK close by but we are a step above them. Anyways, we started showing up to work on Saturday and when I walked in I noticed a flood of water in the parking lot. No big deal probably the kitchen staff doing a nice clean of the fryers or something. Walking in after me is one of the newer guys, who we all love to give hell too. He also mentioned the water, and we in no uncertain terms, told him to shut up jokingly. 

But when someone took a quick break to grab water while we set up, we noticed the water outback wasnt from cleaning, a pipe burst. The water out of the machine had no pressure. So then we start looking around, can the toilets flush? No. Can the water run in the faucets? No. Dishwasher? Negative. We tell our manager, who can sometimes be smart, but is mostly just there...barely. She runs the coke from the fountain and proudly exclaims that, ""it works, see?"". After she tasted it did she realize it was all syrup and no water. Hilarious. Anyways, we go out back and you can see the water gushing out of the back. The higher ups show up and try to figure it out. 

We had 150ish on the books for that night, including a prom party of about 50. As servers, we think that they are calling our other restaurants in the area to see if we can move the reservations to their places. And at first it seems like its happening, but then out of no where the owner decides we should open anyways. Right there morale drops so fast it flies past rock bottom. They send me to another one of our restaurants to get made tea from them and water. Not joking here. 

When I was leaving, another server told me to call the health department, and I still wonder why I didnt. I had the number pulled up on my phone and everything. I truly thought cooler heads would prevail and they would realize the mistake. But that was my mistake. As I get back from that errand, they are sending another server to go buy water and coke and stuff. 

Now, heres the best part. The management was telling the host not to let people know we had problems. To them it was a minor problem. Guests, when they did find out, left. Parties walked in, found out and walked right back out. Of course our special manager would run after them to save face and try to keep them, but how could you without running water? The higher ups told us to keep people happy and we had free reign to give out complimentary drinks and deserts to make sure it happened. Bullshit in my opinion. I personally told one table that we had no water, and the dad asked how no one could tell them that. They talked to the manager and left. Shes pulls me aside and asked why I would tell them that. I went off. I was embarrassed at this, and I made it known. The worst part is that the little girl, who was ten maybe, wanted a sprite. I said Im sorry, we can't do that(when we went to buy coke, they went and got sprite but didnt tell anyone, so I said no). What about pink lemonade, she asked..Im sorry no. Thats when I lost it and told them. So I tell this to the manager and say ""how could this be ok? we have no running water, and Im telling people we cant do certain things. this is bullshit and if you want, I will leave right now."" It was much more then that, but thats the general gist of it. Finally, after dealing with tables asking questions, making snide comments, and having to put up with it all, the owner decides to close early...at 10pm. Whoopee. We clean what we can and leave. They fed us all prime rib and gave all of us 20 bucks to compensate. The rest of our tips come on a paycheck once a week, so leaving with money was a big deal to us. 

Fast forward to Monday, the owner who kept us open comes to me and asked me how it was. I went off. I asked what made him think that opening with no running water or toilets was a good idea. He said having water bottles by the sinks should have been ok. But I came back with...""So what do you do if you have to use the restroom?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Lets say you, Mr. Owner, were here that night and entertaining guests. And you have to potty, yet we have no facilities at the time. You would either hold it and make it very uncomfortable for you, or get in the car, drive to the gas station and go, and then come back. Now thats an easy 10 minute field trip, so youve missed a course at least. Or better yet, you decide to go the other restaurant, walk in and see they have an open table. You would call your guests, and say hey look at this. Then you lose out on more money."" ""Well, yea I didnt see that."" Are you that dumb?! I brought up the prom party next, ""I know we called the prom party parents and let them know, and I know they said its not a problem, but do you really think those kids weren't facebooking, tweeting, tumblring, what have you? Those are 17 year old kids that are doing a once in a life time thing, and its being ruined cause of this. I wouldnt doubt this is one some site right now. And thats a great way to ruin future parties."" ""Yea, I didnt think of that either."" ""Youre right you didnt. One server, one of the senior staff(Which Im apart of but I didnt say this) said this....Once upon a time, we cared about our name, our reputation. But now, this shows me that the owners only care about money."" Thats when the owners face really sunk. I walked away leaving him with that. The next day I had an interview and Im looking for a new job. But not cause I was fired, Im still employed, but I can no longer work for these people. 

LOL, my boss friend just texted me right now saying that, since we didnt close the other night, and used up all of our water, the restaurant is currently out of water and ice. If we had just closed, repaired it, we would be fine, but now I think itll be weeks or months to completely fix it. The reputation is damaged for good now. 

TL;DR My boss and owners are idiots. Water main bursts, and yet we still open with no running water or toilets. ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1ao3z8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1ao3z8/we_had_no_running_water_on_saturday_nightrant/,

The other night I had an *awful* table. They ran me ragged. Luckily, we were slow. Had we been busy, my other tables would have been pissed because *this* table gave me no time to breathe. They were one of those one-thing-at-a-time tables. They ask you for one thing as soon as you bring the previously requested items. ""Could we get more crackers?"" ""More ranch"" ""Yeah, this Coke tastes weird. I want water instead."" ""I need another knife. This one is too dull."" Etc etc.  Normally, I don't mind this TOO much.  I'm pretty quick. However, when they're bitchy about it.. acting as if I'm an idiot for not knowing that 8 packs of crackers wasn't enough and that they don't like the taste of their Coke...it drives me nuts. 
  
Either way, I used my typical tactic. No matter how much they talked down to me, no matter how much they scoffed at me for not predicting their every extra extra extra needed item... I just grinned and bared it. I turn into ""Barbie server."" I just smile, act super friendly and don't let anything get me down.  
  
Long story short, they were a pain in the butt for a little over 2 hours.  At the end, I ran their check (60 dollars or so), brought their change and saw them leave.   
  
My tip?  A gift card to a *different* restaurant (which is located next door to us.)  Just for giggles, I went over after work to see what my giftcard tip had on it.

I run upstairs to the kitchen, inhale my cheerios and then quickly go back to my room to change into my uniform: black crocs, black pants with a black apron and a yellow polo with ‘Sabrina’ stitched on the front corner and ‘The Spot’ stitched on the back. The fresh summer air refreshes me as I open the front door and walk to my car. I drive for twenty minutes, passing Hamptons waterside million dollar homes with Bentley’s parked in front and pull into the driveway of The Spot, the restaurant where I work. I walk through the kitchen, greeting the chefs and fellow employees as I pass, and into the dining room to start prepping for the breakfast rush. I hurry to put fresh coffee on to brew and placing sugar, salt, pepper, coffee mugs and utensils on the tables.

The clocks strikes 8:00 a.m. A swarm of couples and families bustle through the original 1857 Victorian style doors. A family of four walks past the obvious “PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED” sign printed in the largest possible font and seat themselves. I’m already preparing myself for these most likely high-maintenance city people, or as us locals like to call them, cidiots. I walk up to table forty-one.

“Good Morning,” I say kindly.

Shrugs from the other end of the table.

“May I get you something to dri ...”

“Bloody Mary with celery and lime on the side” the bald businessman in his Prada suit interrupts.

As I am scribbling his detailed order, my eyes can’t help but stray towards the Mrs. as she opens her Louis Vuitton purse and pulls out a two-pound Chihuahua decked in a Swarovski crystal collar and dressed in a pink tutu. Her surgically plastic face then slowly says, “water with two ice cubes and a screwdriver.” Guess this couple goes by the motto, “It's 5 o’clock somewhere.”

“For you girls?” I say to their young daughters.

“They will have orange juice,” grunts the father, with his Wall Street Journal sprawled out on the table.

The younger daughter has a random tantrum, tugging on her father’s newly ironed suit and repeatedly screaming, “Daddy, I’m hungry!” The father ignores the determined tugs and continues to read the financial section of his paper. The other girl sits quietly, captivated by the moving images on her iPad that came out just yesterday.

I rush to get their drinks and before I return and place them on the tabletop, the father persistently states, “The girls will split the pancakes.”

Not expecting them to order so suddenly, I rummage for my pen and paper and ask, “Pure maple syrup or the generic with the pancakes?” 
Baffled he replies, “What’s the difference?”

I am full of frustration with his rudeness, but I say in my sweet voice, “The generic is included and the pure is $2.50 extr...”

“They will have the regular,” he interrupts.

I turn to the bleach blonde mother dressed in Gucci from head to toe, waiting for her to decide on her order. I already know she is going to deconstruct the menu with diet specifications. After taking a gulp of her alcohol and flipping through the menu with her five-pound diamond ring on her finger, she says, “I’ll have Eggs Florentine, but I want the hollandaise sauce on the side and no sweet potatoes or English muffin.” This woman literally just eliminated most of the ingredients in this dish. 

As I am still writing the mothers bizarre order down, the father says, “Salmon Platter with a scooped whole wheat bagel”, not looking up as he orders.

“I’m sorry sir, we don’t scoop bagels and we only have plain, poppy or sesame bagels.”

In a raised voice he replies, “It’s not difficult…why can’t they just scoop a bagel?” 

Heads turn at accompanying tables. He shrinks in his chair and mumbles, “Sesame bagel then.”

I can already hear the chefs screaming after I send the ticket in. “Sabrina! What the f..k is this bulls..t?” “Why don’t these idiots just order a bag of leaves?” Ten minutes pass and the father points at me and signals to come to him.

Busy with other tables, I rush over. “Yes sir?”

“We’ve been here forever…what is taking so long?”

“I’m sorry sir, the kitchen is a little busy as it’s the breakfast rush.”

“Your food should be up shortly.”

“We are leaving if the food isn’t out in five minutes,” he grunts back.

I smile and say, “Of course, let me go check on your food, sir.”

I rush into the kitchen and to discover that their order is almost up. Thank god. I bring their food to the table. “Finally” mutters the husband to his wife. They gobble up their food and hunt me down for the check minutes later. I quickly get the bill, thank them, and wish them a good day. Without a word, they pay and leave. I walk over to clear the dishes on their table, glance at the receipt and see the man was kind enough to tip one whole dollar. At that point, I’m just relieved they are gone.

It is now 10 a.m. An older man and woman are seated. I walk up to their table to take their order and before I could say anything, the man hands me a napkin with scribbles on it and gestures with his hands to read it. Confused, I glance at the crumpled napkin: ‘2 coffees, omelet with spinach and mushrooms, 2 eggs scrambled with bacon.’ I smile and ask what kind of toast they want with their eggs. They grunt meaningless words and stare at me blankly. I think to myself, “Do they speak a different language?” I point to the side of the menu that lists the choices of toast, hoping they understand. The man rummages in his pocket for a spare napkin and scribbles, ‘whole wheat.’ “I will be right back with your coffees,” I say. They both put their fingers to their lips, the sign for “thank you” in sign language. I realize that this couple is mute.

One lonely looking man gets seated for lunch around noon. We greet each other and he starts asking me endless questions about menu options. He would point to an item and ask, “What’s this?” or “What comes with that?” After my extensive verbal descriptions, he finally came to a conclusion to get a simple BLT. I expressed my frustration to the chefs about this man who didn’t want to read the menu. “Maybe he’s illiterate?” says one of the chefs. After I got home from my shift, I Googled illiteracy in the US and discovered that 32 million people are illiterate in America. Growing up in a family where education is of the utmost importance made me assume that everyone could read: apparently not.

I have grown up in Westhampton Beach, the least extravagant of the iconic ‘Hamptons’. In the summer, my town’s population quadruples with tourists and Manhattanites. Although we locals prefer the off-season peace, most of the small businesses survive because of these summer visitors. Waitressing such as variety of individuals has given me insight into how many personalities and types of people are out there. My day can go from serving a high maintenance family to people with deep social and physical needs.

1374842225.0,106,self.TalesFromYourServer,1j3dbq,Groups of chatty women: you are the worst people to wait on,156,50,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1j3dbq/groups_of_chatty_women_you_are_the_worst_people/,"""Oh we haven't seen each other in a long time""
""We haven't even looked at the menu yet""
""Can we get another round of drinks?""
""Oh you're closed? We didn't realize!""

These are all phrases that make me want to go Django on my tables. Last night I had a four table section. I had six tables all night. First table was two women who sat outside my section for about an hour and a half- no biggie, it was early and they were in a closed section so it didn't matter. Second table gives me the verbal ""hey, we really enjoyed our meal tonight!"" followed by a paltry 12%. Then the night went downhill..

My four table section was thereafter filled with nothing but groups of women. All of them stayed at least two hours, one of them three. The first two I greeted them telling them about our food and allergy practices, then asked them for drinks. Upon them telling me quickly they IMMEDIATELY shift back into their conversation showing each other pictures on their phone as if I wasn't there anymore.... Definitely wasn't done talking yet, definitely didn't have specials to tell you... It took them 30 minutes to even consider they had menus (see: ""oh we haven't even looked yet"" and ""we haven't seen each other in a while""), then equally as long to consider that they had a check to pay. 

Second table INSISTED I get a sample of wine from the bar for a woman who didn't even want the sample she just wanted a full glass. She ended up ordering a full glass. This table was here for two and a half hours and ate slower than my wife eating a pizza before she realized she has a gluten problem. 

Third table took an hour to order entrees (they sat with their app and menus in front of them for at least 50 minutes), ate for an hour, then talked for another hour with desert menus in front of them, unaddressed, ambiguous as to whether they wanted desert or coffee, until two and a half hours in one person orders a water.

Fourth table was just your typical irritating table- people who don't know how to project their voice over a busy restaurant and are too busy talking to each other than to listen to you repeat their order back to them. They even told me to not put sauce on a dish then complained when there wasn't sauce on it.

In short, because my tables stayed so long I made half of what I could have. I spent my entire night running food and drinks for the other (very busy) servers. I will state that at least two of the four tables in question were very nice and paid promptly when I dropped the check (oftentimes they'll act like they didn't even realize it was there). 

In short, people need to be respectful of the fact that I am a salesperson and I have a limited selling space and limited time in which to make money. I also have a wife who cooks dinners for me that are way better than my restaurants, and I would like to get home at a reasonable time, not past when everyone else has left the restaurant and you're done gossiping about whoever and whatever. Do men camp? Absolutely. But in my experience two guys will vacate the premises LONG before two chatty Cathy's will, and they won't act like you're intruding on their time when the opposite is far more true. If a restaurant is empty and you're the last one in it, you didn't win. You didn't beat the clock or anything. It's not cute. You're just that annoying person who's getting glared at by people who want to go home, people you're screwing out of time and money. An hour and a half is the longest reasonable amount of time one should spend at a table if you've ordered either an appetizer or desert.

by this point their food is ready and I hold the door for them on the way out.

I had to do all I can to not burst into tears over this love story. Its sorta like the notebook in reverse. but its also got the added pain that they'd lost their first spouses, but were able to find love again with each other. and now his mind is going. its just so heart breaking.

Do any of you have cringe worthy stories of being with the party harassing your server? I hope I'm not the only one...

**A bit of backstory:** These all include my mother who is in general a very sweet lady- this issue occurs most often when she confuses herself (then she very stubbornly insists she is right).

--------------------------------------------------------

**Mexican restaurant** At a Mexican restaurant I ask what kind of cheese is on the tostada. Server responds. I ask if there are any other cheese options to pick from. Server says, ""no."" I say okay, and order it anyways. Then my mom starts antagonizing the server about how it's not possible that this particular establishment only has *ONE* type of cheese available and after arguing with the server for a solid 5 minutes demands to speak to a chef from the back to confirm the server wasn't lying to her. Luckily my dad and I were able to get her to chill out before the server felt it necessary to get her manager...after the meal when she'd calmed down she apologized profusely to the server for not ""believeing her"".

--------------------------------------------------------

**Steak resturant** Then there's the time at a steak resturant my mom orders a ""cobb salad"". Server informs they do not have that type of salad, but that she could order X, Y or Z type instead. My mom declines the other salad offers and states she would like their cobb salad. Server again states they do not have this, but all the offered salads are good. My mom then goes on to EXPLAIN what a cobb salad is to the server. Server states she knows what salad she is referring to, and that they don't carry it. Mom gets flustered and starts demanding to see the dinner menu as she was, ""just here last week and ordered it for dinner."" As the server hesitantly walks away to grab a dinner menu (exact same items on the lunch menu, only pricier), I ask my mom when she had time to come to this resturant the week prior, as I remember her going to several OTHER places. After a bit of confusion she remembers that it was at another place she got the cobb salad...server returns with dinner menu and my mom declines to look at it and apologizes to our server for remembering another resturant but that they too should have a cobb salad.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Coffee shop** While my parents were on vacation they stopped in at a popular coffee joint for something cold as it was 100+ degrees out. My mom is not familiar with the menu items as she seldom goes- she explained to the barista she wanted somethig ""cold and tart"". She gets her drink and loves it....skip to a later date after they'd returned from vacation and I head to this same coffee joint with her (in our area of course). As she was so impressed with the drink she'd received last time she orders again in the same manner, *""Hi- I'm not familiar with your menu but I'd like something cold and tart.""* She gets her drink and is confused as to why it's not very good- it's nothing like what she had before (It's like she's assuming this place has ONE recipe for ""something cold and tart"")! She takes it up to the bar area and explains that this is not ""what she got last time"". Not only do these poor people NOT know what she wanted as she was being vague as possible when placing her order (no indication of flavor) but it wasn't even the same LOCATION, hence...different workers! They apologized and informed they would make her something else if she could provide more detail in regards to what she was looking for, but by that point she'd already sipped away at most of her drink and decided it wasn't so bad after all. She says she is sorry and will try to be more specific in the future but that they should obviously not have such a ""confusing"" menu.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Note:**I think it's nice she always ends up apologizing to the wait staff but I mean seriously- if you didn't fly off the handle about stuff like this then it wouldn't even be necessary!

1367249237.0,100,self.TalesFromYourServer,1dcbpb,The joys of working with impatient people... a.k.a. How one of my guests almost became Mr. Potato Head.,121,21,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1dcbpb/the_joys_of_working_with_impatient_people_aka_how/,"Last night got fairly busy (surprising for a Sunday.) I was in a section near the kitchen, which rocked. It meant I could get food, drinks, etc out *way* faster.  At one point, someone in the kitchen forgot to give the back a 'low call' on bakers (for those of you not in the industry, basically someone shouts that they're getting low on baked potatoes, and more are put in the oven so that we can be fully stocked up at all times.) but hey, mistakes happen. They called it a bit later. The result? We ran out of baked potatoes for about 8 minutes. Not a huge deal. Most tables decided to order a different side instead of a baker and get on with dinner. Other tables (as the wait time got smaller) decided to just wait the 6 minutes or 4 minutes because it's really not that big of a deal.
  

My table? uh uh.  Went to their table (as we're supposed to) before hand and let him know we were a little behind on baked potatoes and when he got his food, it would only be about a two minute wait for his potato. (Again, for those who aren't in the industry who I'm sure will ask, ""But why not leave his food in the back until the baker is ready? It's only two minutes."" Two reasons: 1. It's very busy and the kitchen is crowded. Also, our kitchen supervisor was just promoted to that position, so he's on a little bit of a power kick and flips the fuck out on anyone who lets their food sit. It's understandable to want it run out right away, but he literally will cuss at servers and food runners. It gets run when it's done. No later.  2. There was no room except for under the heat lamps. And for every 2 minutes a steak is under a heat lamp, it upcooks it by one level. Medium -&gt; Medium Well.)
Back to the story.
  
The guy gets kinda grumpy about it, but says he'll just wait for the baked potato. 
He gets his meal and is reminded (and I apologize again) that it will be two minutes for his baker.  He then gets PISSED. ""Well now my food is gonna by cold by the time it gets here.  You better get it here faster. I ain't afraid to send this back."" (Right, because I control how long it takes a damn potato to bake.)
At this point, I'm so busy, I don't feel like dealing with this guy. I don't have the time. So I just go straight into damage control mode: Getting a manager.  I let him know the guy was pissed (he lectured me for a few seconds on how a restaurant *should* be run) and let him know that I'd prefer it if he ran the baker to the table when it was ready. 

The potato came out, and I saw my manager talking with the table. The guy started gesturing to his plate and getting more animated, so I went closer to hear what was being said.

Basically, the guy wanted his WHOLE BILL for free because of a two minute wait.   How did he almost become Mr. Potato Head? After hearing him command the manager to comp his whole bill, I was ready to smoosh that potato in his face wedding cake style.

I was sure my manager was going to comply, but to my amazement he said, ""Sir, I keep up with my check times. You've only had to wait two minutes for this side. Now, I can have your steak warmed for you if you think it's cooled too much in two minutes, but I'm sorry. I cannot comp your bill for a two minute wait.""   

  

Holy fuck, I've never wanted to do a little jig so badly before. Inside, my petty little In-your-faceasaurus was clapping his stubby little hands.

  

Well, of course the guy was pissed. The manager apologized again and left the table. Now I come back. I take care of them for the rest of the time as usual. Made sure they had refills, made sure everything else was great. The wife was fairly quiet, but at the end told me I did a great job and I was a 'sweet girl.' (I love hearing that.)
  

Now it's bill time... 
Their total?    36.48.  What did they leave me? 36.48... to the penny. No joke. 
Completely stiffed on their bill. 
  

Dude.. you're lucky I need this job or I'd have launched an even fresher baked potato at the back of your head as you left. 

  

  

*TL;DR:* Table was informed it was a two minute wait on baked potatoes. Demanded their bill be free. Manager said ""Fuck you, it was two minutes. Get the fuck over it Captain Doucheasaurus."" (I may have embellished that) Man gets pissed. I give good service.  I'm left the exact amount of the bill down to the penny.

So after word got around that I was in the office for so long, other servers approached the owner with their own complaints. She continued to behave as she always did, and her girlfriend managed that weekend, 2 weeks ago now. 

Saturday the 27th, was a disaster. She was miserable, rude, sitting the whole time while bossing everyone around. Being rude to the manager. The other 2 closers called her out on her rudeness, and she basically lost it and walked out at midnight. The rest of us closed at 4 am with no issues.  I guess some things happened with the manager and other servers through out the evening because Sunday my phone went nuts with coworkers wanting support to go talk to the owner. Sunday afternoon 5 of us met at the restaurant, went into the office and spoke to the owner. He let us all tell everything that happened for 20 minutes before telling us he reviewed the cameras and had fired the girl at 9am. Her girlfriend/manager was suspended. 

We all had to write statements to send to corporate, and are unsure of the fate of the manager as of right now. She was suspended for 5 days total, and worked with us last weekend. I spoke to her, she still feels like the victim and is hurt that 'we would all turn on her so fast.' Consensus is that she can act like a professional now that she isn't being manipulated constantly. The biggest bonus is money is definitely being distributed much more evenly now, all the servers are rotating party tables, and we are staying consistently within 15 dollars of each other in tips. Last night I made over 200 dollars, its only the second time ever at that restaurant, and it was a night that girl was off too. 

TL;DR: Crazy girl fired after an explosive Saturday shift. Manager suspended for 5 days, back to work and acting professional. General atmosphere of restaurant is so much more relaxed, tips are getting better as a result. Wish I had gotten the courage sooner.

A tale from a long, long time ago. Back when the Earth was cool(er), no Hybrids roamed the land and smoking inside was still (mostly) acceptable.

So my last story was well received so I thought I would throw another one out there for you guy and gals.

Backstory: I was working as a waiter in a pretty typical restaurant. We had our entryway in the middle and the north side of the restaurant was smoking and the south side non-smoking. On this particular day though, I had been asked to cover the host table.

We were pretty busy, I think it must have been a weekend or Friday evening and (as it usually went) the non-smoking section had a bit of a wait, while the smoking section had immediate seating. I had a younger couple (maybe mid-twenties) come up and the following is a dramatic retelling (cut me a break, it was awhile ago, but I'll do my best to stay accurate) of the following 3 encounters with these people (Man = Chris and Woman = Jennie):

**First Encounter**

Me: Hi, welcome to [Redacted], table for two?

Chris: Yup.

Me: Perfect, do you have a preference for smoking or non-smoking?

Jennie: Non-smoking.

Me: Sure, no problem, it will be about a 5-10 minute wait though, but I can put your name on our list.

Jennie: [Starting to come across a bit bitchy] Are you kidding? Is there any way we can be seated now?

Me: Sure, but the only tables I have open right now are in the smoking area. If that's okay I can get you seated right away.

(They discuss this for a moment before): Chris: Yeah, that's fine, thanks.

Me: No worries, let me show you to your table.

I proceed to go through the normal spiel and return to my counter.

**Second encounter**

Jennie: Excuse me, sir?

Me: [Excusing myself from the conversation I was having with a regular] Yes ma'am, what can I help you with?

Jennie: It reeks by our table.

Me [Genuinely concerned] I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to come check on what it might be?

Jennie: [Huffy, hand on left hip, right hip stuck out, gesticulating with right hand] I know what it is. It reeks of cigarettes.

Me: [Holding back bewildered amusement] Well, ma'am, it is the smoking section.

Jennie: But it smells really strongly of cigarettes!

Me: Ma'am, I apologize again, but I'm confused; what do you want me to do?

Jennie: It reeks and there is smoke everywhere.

It's at this point that I look over to check the area and make sure there's not a fire or something. There was one person smoking. In the smoking section. ONE. I get if you are aggravated by smoke it being a problem, but you CHOSE to sit there.

Me: I'll tell you what, if you would like I can put you on the list for a table and we will move you when there is an opening. Is that okay?

I usually wouldn't have offered this with a pretty full house as they were already taking up a table. Typically I would have told them they would have to come back up front and wait then, but I didn't want to jeopardize their waiters tips.

Jennie: Ugh, fine.

After about 10 minutes we get them over to a non-smoking table and we all move on with our days, right?

**Third Interaction**

Chris: Excuse me?

I had no one up front at this point and turn my attention to him.

Me: Yes sir, how may I help you?

Chris: [Gesturing toward his table] Yeah, my girlfriend said her food smells funny.

Me: [After looking where he pointed and understanding the situation more fully] Is 
there something that I can do? Would you like me to have it re-made? Have you spoken to your waiter? (I was really confused as to why they were coming to me with a food related issue.

Chris: I don't know where he is. She says it smells like smoke.

Me: Is it possible that they smell is still lingering in her nose after being in the smoking section?

Chris: [Looking downtrodden] ...yeah.

Me: Okay... um...

Chris: Look, I'm going to level with you. She's being kind of a bitch tonight. Can I just pay you now and then get boxes?

I am left at this point to assume he wanted her to think he got it for free and just avoid the fight.

Me: Um... sure...

I called over his waiter, got the check from him and rang through his card. He actually left his server a pretty sizeable tip and apologized again. But as he is signing his slip, up comes -

Jennie: What are you doing?

Chris: I'm paying so we can leave.

Jennie: Are you fucking kidding?!

That actually caught me off-guard as even though she had been a horrible patron she didn't look like the ""swearing in public"" type.

Chris: Calm down, we're leaving.

Jennie: No! You shouldn't pay for this fucking shit! (Quite the mouth on her in my memory) It smelled and tasted like crap!

I was getting ready to start damage control when -

Chris: Shut the fuck up! Jesus. Screw this. [To me] Have a good day man. Sorry about her.

He then took her by the arm and walked out.

I was never more awed/ecstatic about a customers response.

lets just say this lady felt so damn entitled from everything to where she sat (we were at full capacity in reservations on a saturday night- you dont get to sit wherever you want) - to trying to pretty much create her own menu for the chef to make.  lets just say our chef does NOT take kindly to that. she hates modifications to suit the guest palates - she has studied many years and lives her craft in order to create a dish with specific chosen ingredients and flavors, textures, etc. if you do not want to try this then its not the restaurant for you. we are not a kid friendly restaurant in that respect. we do not have a kids menu. this lady brought her 3 kids in. that is fine if the kids are mature and respectful enough to enjoy their meals and behave. they did not. oh and she wants 5 sides of asparagus (that is NOT a side option, we have it for a steak dish) and demands changes to each item ordered,... she basically insulted every person that was working, including myself to my face in front of her family. i was close to losing it inside. 

well the chef told me to tell her to go to fucking burger king where she could get it her way and kids meals for her fat fucking fuckhead children, that she doesnt want that woman in her restaurant and to get the hell out if she tries to change one more damn thing. i of course had to rephrase what she told me to tell her... but it was still my delight to tell her, im sorry, but we can not fix those mushrooms for you, i am no longer allowed to take any more orders from you. here is your check. 

EDIT:  if youve worked with a talented chef that also has an ego and is pissed off, you know all that burger king fuckhead part should have definitely be capitalized, she got pretty loud.  oh chefs, you guys crack me up. i just nodded and turned around to smile and walk back to the table to relay (and translate) the message

I always see ""Help for my first day"" posts, and thought I would share some things to avoid doing.

Wear your uniform, with minimal and tasteful accessories.  Our servers wear all black.  I don't know why some girl showed up with a neon pink headband.  They are your work clothes.  You are supposed to look professional, not fashionable.

If you have a questions, ASK.  Don't ask me on your third brunch shift what Hollandaise is.  It makes me nervous about the BS you've told tables. It is okay to not know something, but it is not okay to not try and find out.

That said, when you do ask something, try and use the ""5 words or less"" rule.  Communitcation needs to be effective.  Don't give me a story about how table 3 is celebrating their sixth anniversary and they really love the fried oysters but the lady grew up thirty minutes away from the Hidden Valley plant and doesn't like remoulade.  Just say, ""Side of ranch please.""  It will significantly decrease dirty looks from the line.

Smile a little.  We hired a girl last week that looks miserable all the time.  If you don't want me to call you Bitch Face, smile, introduce yourself, say hello to me or something
  Being professional doesn't mean you have to be unfriendly.

Don't stand around.  Time to lean, time to clean.  There is always something to restock, tidy up, or wipe down.  Take pride in your workspace.  And if you spill simple syrup in the walk-in, clean it up.  Sticky shoes are not fun.

Don't complain about the heat.  I stand in front of two grill tops that are always on all.day long.

Don't complain about your tips in front of me.  I work 50 hour weeks and make half as much as you.

For some background, this is a tapas place that features traditional Spanish tapas with a Latin American influence:

Tale the first:

I'm waiting on a table of four...two couples. Our menu features ceviches (seafood that's been cured in lime juice--it's not cooked with heat, but citrus juices eliminate the bacteria so it's not completely raw). The vegetarian non-dairy lady (who I later determine is pescatarian) asks what ceviches are and I inform her. She makes it clear that the style of cooking is not for her. Whatever; I personally don't eat fish either--to each their own. The other couple does order the ceviche, and I return to the table to clear plates, ask how everything is, etc.

""You should try the ceviche, [I don't know...Karen? Why not]. It's really good!""

[Karen]: Oh, I'm sure it is. I just...you know...I KNOW it's cooked and everything, but...I just...I just don't eat food that was once raw.""

And no one called her out on it. Except me, when I speed-walked to the service aisle and cried tears of laughter explaining to everyone what she just said.


Number Two:

I'm seating two ladies who wish to sit out on the patio. I take them out there. It's very bright, and quite warm. One looks around, turns to me with a worried expression through squinted eyes, and asks in a worried tone:

""Is it going to go down?""

Now, I've been in this business a long time. It gives you a fluent ability to speak idiot. She obviously meant to say ""My! It's bright out here! When the sun goes down, does it keep the patio this bright and hot, or does it pitch it in shade for a more comfortable dining experience?"" That question would have made perfect sense, and the answer I would have given her would fit the one I provided of ""In an hour or so, the sun will dip below the back of the restaurant, so it should be quite comfortable out here."" The answer to her poorly formed question that I regret every day I was unable to say would have been ""Tonight and every night, ma'am."" Or, in poorer taste, ""That's what she said.""

Third Story:

Customer: ""What part of the pork does the pork belly come from?""

Me (thinking it's some sort of a trick): ""Umm....well, I believe it comes from the belly of the pork, miss.""

Fourth Story:

This is from my boyfriend.

Customer: ""Excuse me? Is there cream in the cream of mushroom soup?""

Hot Sex Machine: ""Hmm...hold on a minute; let me ask the chef.""

Hot Sex Machine goes ahead and laughs for ten minutes with the BOH staff, and reminds the cook that the lady at table 8 REALLY wants ""the sausage.""",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1jh2g6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1jh2g6/i_dont_eat_food_that_was_once_raw_and_some_other/,

So tonight one of our servers (let's call her Patty) was upset with me because she didn't think that her section was a fair size. Patty had two 4 tops and two 2 tops. The server who's section was next to her had one 4 top, three 2 tops, and one 3 top. Even though Patty's section could seat the same amount of people, she was upset because they didn't have the same amount of tables. 

Patty walked her happy butt up to my hostess stand and proceeded to attempt to argue with me about her tables compared to the next server. The thing is, I don't even organize our floor plan, nor do I have the power to adjust it. Our FOH manager organizes everything, I pretty much just take our guests to their table and smile. 

This isn't the first time that Patty gave me attitude over something so frivolous that I didn't control. I couldn't take it anymore, I snapped and told her ""look, it's not my decision who's sections go where, and I'm tired of you giving me attitude about it. If you're upset then go talk to the manager.""

I felt so had for snapping at her immediately after, but I was sick of it. Immediately after I snapped, I told my manager what happened and she confirmed that I said the right thing, and it wasn't my fault she was upset. I still felt bad, and was considering finding Patty and apologizing, but when I went looking for her I found her huddled up with all the servers telling them how horrible I am. Now I'm annoyed. I asked my manager to talk to Patty about the situation so that it didn't escalate anymore, and also informed her that Patty was telling all the other servers how terrible I am. Shortly after, Patty stormed over to my hostess stand and threw a stack of menu's at me and stormed off. Never even looked at me. I was pissed. I told my manager what had happened again, and she assured me that she would talk with Patty at the end of the shift. 

I won't know until I talk to my manager tomorrow how it went, but I'm still pretty annoyed. I'm sick of servers acting like princesses when they don't get their way. I know that you guys jobs are hard and often unfair and very stressful, but please don't take it out on your host/hostess (if he/she doesn't deserve it.) they try their best. 

Sorry for typo's or confusion. I'm on a phone.


Edit: I should also note that my manager is very fond of me and does her best to keep me happy. She has a very abrasive personality and has not had a good track record with hosts (the restaurant has been open 15 months, but has gone through 5 hostesses at least. There may be more that no one has mentioned.) and we actually get along very well. She is rude and very abrasive, but I just don't care. I know she's not making it personal that she's rude if that makes sense? She loves that we get along, so she wants me to stick around.

Last night, I took my girlfriend out to a Louisiana restaurant. The food was excellent - they recently had reduced the portions slightly, but the price remained the same. I can get with this - things get more expensive. The important thing here is that even though the portions were slightly smaller, sharing an appetizer and then having an entree each was the perfect amount of food for us.

The service was a bit slow, but this place was packed. We made an extra request - my girlfriend didn't like the tartar sauce, so we asked for something different - and the meal resumed.

Then came time to pay the check, my credit card reluctantly found it's way out of my wallet. After signing the slip and giving a very decent tip ($16 on a $54 meal) we had a beignet left over that we wanted to take home in a box. We flagged down one of the staff, the same woman that took our order and brought our food, as she was (unbeknownst to us) attending to another table. She took care of them, and then immediately turned around and said ""I'm sorry honey, I was taking care of them. Would you like a box?""

I don't know why I get embarrassed when the servers are nice to me, but I do. At this point, she didn't know that we had tipped, for all she knew we were impatient and looking to escape. After bringing us a box, she proceeded to give us a warning about how to reheat the beignet, to make sure we could enjoy it properly at home. And yes, when I woke up at 3 a.m. and ate it, all was good.

**TL;DR:** If you worked a Louisiana restaurant Tuesday night in the SF Bay Area, and you gave a young couple some advice about reheating their creole pastries, thanks for the good food and the extra attention. You were swamped, but still made it a point to take care of us.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_19e5tf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19e5tf/a_night_out_customer_side/,

I was working the drive thru one day when a middle aged guy was at the window picking up his food. He leaned out the window and looked past me and said ""OH MAN!! DOES SHE WORK HERE?!!. He said this not super loud but with so much excitement his voice was trembling. I turned around to see one of the prettier girls that worked there was behind the counter in tiny shorts and a tank top and was picking up her check.  I turned back to the guy and said ""uhh... yeah?"" and he clenched his fists, closed his eyes and said ""Ohhhhhhhhh... she must be like.... ohhhhh.... 18!!! but she looks like she's ohhhhhhhhhh 13!"" and then he drove away.

We weren't very busy last night and by the time I got cut I only had 3 tables, but these people were all super nice and I thought you might like to hear about them.

Table 1 was a father and his two little girls. He was telling me how his wife was sick at the hotel room (and he got food to go for her) and his daughters were little angels the whole time. In general they were just really nice and polite, which you know after a long night is very appreciated. I guess at one point one of my coworkers was stocking TP in the restroom and had to help one of them reach the sinks to wash their hands!

Table 2 was a family; adult son, his parents, and one of their elderly mothers. Grandma ordered a margarita (you go girl) and later on mom told me is was her birthday and that they had a really bad day but she wanted to do something special and was asking me about the desserts. I started telling her about them and let her know that it would be on the house, just have grandma pick one out. This woman was so incredibly happy about this and teared up telling me how much it meant to her, that this wasn't what they had planned at all and how upset she was. I just told her she just had to roll with the punches. It was really nice that such a small thing made a difference and that I could help them. They really appreciated it and grandma had a great time.

Last but definitely not least, was a table with a little boy, who was maybe 10 years old. They were really nice and friendly, and having never been there before were asking a lot of questions and having a good time. The boy had ordered a root beer and was asking me all about it (we make our own root beer). At one point during the meal he asks me about 5 gallon kegs and how long the root beer would stay fizzy and other stuff. I knew they were traveling so I let them know that they would have to return the keg within the month and he was pretty disappointed. Let it be noted that this is a 10 yr old boy, and he was wanting FIVE GALLONS of root beer! He was going hard! He ended up buying a couple 64 oz jugs of it. 

Later that night he comes up to me and tells me he wants to buy a tee shirt for his dad for fathers day. I grab my manager and tell him we have a secret mission and need him to be sneaky getting the shirt. The boy wanted it to be a surprise and wasn't sure how to hide it so we tell him he should wear it under his clothes. He totally went for it and went to the bathroom to change! This kid comes out of the bathroom looking about 20 pounds heavier and I just loose my shit. It was one of the funniest/ cutest things I've ever seen. I was worried I was gonna spoil the surprise because I couldn't stop laughing. 

tl;dr I hope they stopped at a hotel for the night, or else that kid probably thew up root beer all over the car. ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1fzg55,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1fzg55/had_a_great_night_thought_you_might_enjoy_a_nice/,

I work in a small restaurant and all of the servers wear a green apron. We don't have a uniform (t-shirts and pants) - as long as we look clean and neat and wear the apron, we're fine. The apron is the type that you wear over your neck and reaches down to the knees.

I had just gotten off work (lunch shift) and decided to have something to eat. I took off my apron and sat down, ordering some food and having a soda. It had been a crazy day and I was tired - I didn't want to wait the hour it would take me to get home (I use public transportation) to eat something. Also, the food at my restaurant is delicious.

There I am, reading a book and munching away when I hear a lady say ""3."" I glance up and she's looking straight at me. It's a lady who's somewhat a regular. I give her a kind of smile and say ""Excuse me?""

**About the customer**: If she had been nice about it or even asked me if I was working (my coworkers and I eat at work a lot - the food's cheap and good), I wouldn't have minded so much. Hell, if she was usually nice to me when I *am* working, I wouldn't have minded so much. But she's not nice, patient or even respecful. I love it when I go by her table and ask if there's anything she needs and she responds with a rude ""No,"" then 3 seconds later bitches about not getting some kind of sauce that actually doesn't come with her food. If I overhear something like that, I'll just get the sauce and give it to her (with a smile) but yeah, she's one of *those* people.

She gives me a kind of look and just says, ""Three."" I glance at the people with her and they look uncomfortable so I just smile and let them know that I'll seat them but ask them to give me a second to get the menus. They stand there and wait while I grab them and I seat them. The ""regular"" decides to try to play nice (I'm not sure why... she usually comes in with family/friends but I didn't recognize the people with her today, maybe she's different around her co-workers) and asks with a smile, ""Are you on your lunch break?""

I set the menus down and I give her a smile and a perky, ""Nope, not a lunch break! Actually, I got off over 30 minutes ago! I'm not on the clock but the girl who's working will be *right* with you~!""

I had this overwhelming sense of satisfaction as I saw her ears turn pink. I know I probably shouldn't have done that and just seated them and let them know the server would be with them but I was just so hungry and tired that my temper got the better of me.

**TLDR;; A regular I don't like had me seat her party when I wasn't working so I let it be known to the people with her that the lady was asking the *wrong* person to seat them.**

A man and his wife came in to eat yesterday. I knew from the moment I greeted them that it was going to be a pain to serve them. I did my spiel and asked what they wanted to drink. She asked me what coke products we serve. I listed them off and she and her husband decided on Coke Zero. That is cool.

I got them and dropped them off, and she takes a sip. Now, I have been at this resteraunt for a while now and regularly serve soda to people. She looks at me straight in the eye and tells me the soda is flat. I know for a fact that it has the normal amount of carbonation, because it poured the same as it always does.

So I say, ""I am sorry to hear that, ma'am. I do not believe I will be able to change the ratio of carbonation in the machine, so is there something else I can get for you?""

She decides on a Diet Coke. I get the diet and she claims that one is flat too. At this point I go with my manager to make sure the CO2 is still full and it is.

Cool cool, I go back and ask if there is anything else she wants to drink. She settles for unsweet tea with a heavy sigh.

Time for entrées. They decide they want to get some of the as-many-refills-of-different-pastas-and-sauces-as-you-can-eat option. Then she asks me about one of the sauces.

I have worked in the restaurant industry for 21 of my 33 years alive and I've got a ton of tales (some good, some bad) to share. My apologies in advance for the wall of text.

Allow me to start with the tale of the old lady that decided I would be her subject to terrorize for about a year.

I was working in a 50's diner for a few years. I was the manager at the time but still continued to serve.  Lots of amazing customers, and lots of really, really weird customers frequented this place.  In walks a seemingly innocent old lady.  The type that you picture spending most of her time making cookies or baking pies happily in her kitchen.

I take her order, everything seems fine at first.  Salad and a coffee.  Okay, simple enough.  She calls me over.

Old Lady: ""My coffee is too sweet!""

Me: ""Okay, no problem, happens all the time! I hate it when I put too much sugar in my coffee.  I'll grab you a new one!""

Old Lady: ""Don't accuse me of doing this! It's not my fault your sugar is too sweet!""

Me: ""Err, alright then. I'll just grab you a new one.""

New coffee comes, right in time for her salad to arrive.  I drop it off, and go about doing my usual thing.  5 minutes later, I look over, she's sitting there with a full coffee, salad untouched and a sour look on her face.  I go over.

Me: ""How is everything?""

Old Lady: ""Well obviously there is a problem here.  Can't you see it?""

Me: ""Uhh, not sure what you mean.  If there's a problem, I'd love to fix it.""

Old Lady: ""Well open your eyes dummy. How the hell can I eat my salad without a spoon?""

Me: ""Err, I usually use a fork...""

Old Lady: ""Don't get sassy with me young man. Do your job and get me a damn spoon.  (Under her breath) Idiots these days.. all of them.""

I just decide to hell with it.  I get her a damn spoon.  I drop off the spoon and just to spite me, she took at least an hour to eat the salad with a spoon.  Nothing else, but a spoon.  Then proceeded to complain that I charged her for her over sugary coffee.

Now you may think to yourself that maybe this is just some senile old lady, oblivious to the world but no.  This woman just hated me.  Out and out hated me.  Every other server at this place found her to be the sweetest, most adorable woman in the world.  But to me, she was a living hell.  She never complained to any other server, tipped them well, smiled and had pleasant conversation, but to me, it was terror.  I really actually think she was slowly trying to drive me crazy.

After about a year of serving her, the last time I ever saw her, she was sitting in my section reading the paper.  I tried to make chit chat with her about the news to which she replied ""Don't feed me this crap. I can tell you're not educated.  You probably just read the entertainment section.  You're a disgrace."" I counted to 5, smiled and asked her if she needed anything else.

Old Lady: ""Yeah. I want to walk through the park to get home.  Do you think it's safe?""

Looking outside, it was like a freaking disney movie.  Birds chirping, the sun is shining, its about 6pm.

Me: ""Sure! It's beautiful out.  I always walk through the park.""

Old Lady: ""You just want me to get raped and murdered!""

Me: ""Err... Umm...""

Old Lady: ""I'm never coming back here. You disgust me. I can't believe you just tried to get me raped.""

Me: ""Okay then. Umm, have a good night?""

And away she went, into the beautiful summer night, off to terrorize another server...

What really pissed me off though was that as she passed me, she reached out like she was pretending to try to knock the glasses out of my hand, but she actually hit my hand in the process, causing one of the glasses to start to tip over. Luckily, I was able to stop the glass from falling to the floor, but a decent amount of water had sloshed out.

Even better is when I'm bussing and I see people SELF-SEAT at a dirty table and ask me to clean it for them.

1374444236.0,98,self.TalesFromYourServer,1iru3v,Don't expect to abuse your animal on our premises and expect to get away with it (LONG lots of anger).,117,19,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1iru3v/dont_expect_to_abuse_your_animal_on_our_premises/,"I just recently found this subreddit, and even though I'm not a server (I host) this has become one of my favorite subs.

Like I said, I'm a hostess at a small town restaurant along the water.  We have a small deck area that, when the weather is nice, has people willing to wait 30-45 minutes for a table.  Recently, it's been way too hot for people to sit outside.  The past week I've sat maybe 10 people outside.

Anyway.  Around 1-2 yesterday afternoon, a 6 top wants to sit on the deck because they have a dog with them.  A few minutes later however, because it's EASILY 95+ degrees outside, they decide to eat inside.  Thing is, they know they can't bring the dog into the dining room.

""Oh, that's no problem.""  They tell me.  ""We'll just go put the dog in the car.""

Um.  What???  I stood there a few seconds, thinking they might have been kidding with some black humor.  They weren't.  So I sit them down inside, and when the daughter says how she doesn't feel bad for the dog because she's ""just a *dog*"" it takes everything I have not to just throw the menus at them.  But I bite my tongue, and immediately tell the waitresses that are standing near my hostess station.  They were all in shock and PISSED, of course.  

The girl who's section I sat them in (let's call her Andrea) is the most angry.  She says that she won't serve them if they don't do something about the dog, but ends up going over anyway for reasons I can't remember (manager might have made her), lets them know how unsafe it was for the dog and that if anyone sees her in the car, how the cops might be called.  They wave the comments off and order.

When it's clear they plan on leaving the poor dog in the car, I get the okay from the manager to call the sheriff, but only if I do anonymously from my cell.  Okay, no problem.  The only thing is, they needed the plate number from the car, so when I begin walking across the parking lot and talking on the phone, two men from the party see me leave to check out their car and follow me, so they hear I'm on the phone with the sheriff.  BTW - ONE window of the car was CRACKED. 

As soon as I get back inside, the table demands to talk to the manger.  As soon as I call him over, one of the ladies starts YELLING about how ""we went about this the ENTIRELY wrong way"", berating us for not talking to them about the situation (which we did), and eventually getting inches away from Andreas face and yelling at her.  Andrea doesn't take that shit, yells right back, and I'm fairly positive that if she wasn't on the clock punches would have been thrown.

As they make their way out of the door muttering ""how dare we"" and ""how ridiculous we are"" I can't help but to tell the husband to ""please make sure his dog is okay"" in the most passively aggressive way I possibly can.

First, the same lady who was yelling turns around to me, declares ""That dog is better off than YOU!"" lulwhat.

Then the husband turns to me and the following dialogue ensues:

""You're being completely unreasonable!  I saw you outside, you had to have known it's not that hot.""

""Sir, it's EXTREMELY hot outside.""

""Well, you saw that the car is parked in the shade.""

""That shade doesn't matter, it's nearly one hundred degrees outside.""

""You should know that it's cooler inside of the car than it is outside.""

""I don't think so, *sir*.""

At this point the manager is standing a few feet away telling me and Andrew to walk away, so we just stare at him until he finally leaves.

The kicker?  These people were from Florida.  Compared to where we are in Maryland, I shudder to think about the kind of heat they leave that poor dog in back home.

These were the ""ladies"" that the obnoxious, dickhead drunks would get sent to. The same drunk who after treating the poor barstaff like shit would loudly proclaim ""lets go check out the hookers lads"" then ask the barman for directions.

Of course it would be rude to tell them to walk 4 blocks when there were almost ladies just across the park lurking in the shadows, it would also good customer service to make sure mr loudmouth got an extra drink or two in before he went off on his quest.

Then of course all the staff members would be lurking by the windows, watching and waiting...... and while we could never tell by facial expressions it was pretty obviously by the way they would scuttle quickly back across the park that at some point there alcohol filled brain had clicked and they realised the hooker they were putting their smooth moves on probably had a bigger piece than they did :)

**T:** Alright. Thank you for asking.

**O:** Was your food alright today?

**T:** NO! There were no beans in the burrito, it tasted burnt, and her bacon wasn't fully cooked!

**O:** Well, it seems to have been excellent, judging by the fact you ate it all. I don't put beans in my burritos, and the burrito meat was just made not even 3 hours ago and put in the steam table. Its fresh and I made it myself. As for the bacon, we wouldn't serve it without it being fully cooked. You wouldn't have ate it, if it weren't fully cooked anyway.**I back my staff and my waitresses up 180%.** I guarantee you the food was excellent because we wouldn't serve anything less.

[I've posted before](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1cnucj/why_people_always_laugh_the_first_time_they_come/) about how I was pretty much chained to the Teenage Zone, AKA smoking section, because I was the only server that the delinquent kids who practically lived there respected enough to obey.


**This is the story of how they came to learn that respect.**

Imagine, if you will, a fresh young(ish) server, only two weeks on the job.  Suddenly and unexpectedly, she is thrust into The Teenage Zone, due to the notable and unexplained absence of the server originally assigned there.  

Later it will come to light that said absent server couldn't take it any more and quit without notice, or even informing the management, but for the moment, all I knew was that I had to take over the worst, most dreaded section in all of history.  In my second week as a server.  On the night shift.

Everything went surprisingly well for a while, though I felt like a substitute teacher.  ""But (absent server) lets us (insert ridiculous action here) all the time!""  And so on.  I wasn't having it, called bullshit on them, and told them, ""Go sell it to your Grandma, because I'm not buying it!""  They were impressed enough to be cautious and wary, and things were, for the most part, running smoothly.

Until The Cool Kid sauntered in.

He planted his butt in a booth already occupied by some of his buddies and snapped his fingers at me.  I raised an eyebrow at him, gave him a ""really?"" expression, and deliberately turned away to refill some other kid's coffee.  His buddies laughed.  

Sensing that his alpha status was slipping, he tried to get my attention again, but politely this time.  I went over to his table, and asked if he wanted to order.  

**He grabbbed my ass** and started to say something...but I couldn't hear him over the roaring of the blood rushing to my eyes as I started seeing red.

Without even pausing to think about it, I dug my fingers into his hair and pulled him out of his seat, tossing him on the floor.  I had one knee on his back and was about to smash his face into the carpet when the manager came running up.

I vaguely heard the horrified manager yelling something like, ""....blah, blah, not appropriate...blah, blah...while wearing the uniform....blah, blah!""

So I stood up, planting my foot on The Cool Kid's neck, and began to strip off my uniform.  I told my manager, ""Fine! Then I'm not wearing the **fucking** uniform until after I kill this little pervert!""

Needless to say, I did not kill the little pervert.  The manager kicked him out, sent me on a loooooong break and managed to *not* have a heart attack.

When I reemerged in the Teenage Zone, I was greeted with a standing ovation, though I'm not sure if was because I had an epic meltdown, or because they almost got to see some tits.

In any case, the Teenage Zone was, for better or worse, forever mine from that day forward.


P.S: I did, eventually, get a handle on my anger management problem.  But not until after I quit that place.


TL;DR:  Teenagers test me.  I win.  My punishment is to serve them forever more.

For those stations, we offer soda, iced tea, lemonade, fruit punch, alcohol punch, wine, beer, coffee, etc. Fairly standard and easy to manage. We have little signs that sit out in front of the items so people know which is which, and we generally don't have an issue.

The party in question was a baby shower, and it was one in which a few dads got suckered in to coming. Three dads sitting at the ""boy's"" table with about 6 or 7 little boys (really little... the oldest was probably 7.) It wasn't my party, but that room was short a few servers, and my party didn't start until 2:30, so I got pulled from my room to help finish setup, and I got a good look at what was going on in there.

The bar, from left to right, was setup like this:

Alcohol fruit punch, small rocks glasses, collins glasses, ice bowl w/scoop, soda pitchers, iced tea and lemonade, small rocks glasses, fruit punch.

We finished setup, and I got out of there right before the actual party started (beforehand is pretty much just family milling around, putting out centerpieces and whatnot.) About 20 minutes after people started filtering in, one of the servers from that room comes around to my (empty) room and fucking loses it because stressed out dads at baby showers do funny shit.

Apparently, she stopped to talk to one of the dads while they were going up to get some punch for the boys, and offered to help him since she had the tray.

(When we're slow, we're SLOW.) I saw this woman come in the door. We were running on timing, meaning because we were almost completely dead, we take turns taking customers. We also don't have a hostess at night, and our manager was doing manager stuff somewhere other than the front. Anyway, she says there will be five of them, so I seat them at one of our party tables and give her a few kid's menus to keep the incoming kiddos busy, because she says that they will probably order off the regular menu anyway. So I get her drink, and she starts commenting on how dead it is and so on. But she's using server-speak, so I KNOW she's either been a server or is a server. Also, she keeps apologizing for everything. Example;

 Me: ""Would you like me to get you anything to drink while you wait for the rest of your party?""

Her: ""How about a Pepsi?""

Me: ""We have Coke products.""

Her: ""Oh! Sorry, I'll just take a Diet Coke then.""

Kind of funny. So I was so glad I was going to get a good table for once that night. Anyway, in come her husband and three kids. These are the nicest, most well-behaved, most polite children I had ever seen in our restaurant. Cannot stress that enough. They each order our breakfast special, which allows you to pick 4 of our breakfast menu items from a chart and make your own breakfast with it. (One of our most popular items on our menu) And for once, the whole table actually knew how to read the menu! (Seriously, this needs to happen more often in large parties.) And each of the kids were actually looking me in the eye and addressing me by my name while ordering. Once, one of the kids was sort of mumbling and pointing at the menu while I was trying to get his order, and the mother told him: ""Please look at her and use good manners."" I melted just a little.

Anyway, there were only a few little hiccups, like one of their side dishes was taking a little longer than it should have, but the whole time, they were so polite and understanding to me. And when the time came for them to leave, they left me 11 bucks! I know it doesn't seem like much, but I actually got a 15% tip, and I work in a restaurant where that doesn't happen often. (We get a LOT of old people and regulars who leave whatever they think you earned. 3-5$ is an average tip, even in large parties.)

Their leader, who I'll call Gloria, was one of those old ladies with dyed red hair and giant sunglasses that literally never left her face. We were booked up with reservations and all the gaps were filled by walk-ins, as per usual for Saturday night in our small restaurant; but the rules don't apply to Gloria, who shuffled right past the great big ""please wait to be seated"" sign and headed for a reserved 6-top.

She was intercepted by our host, ""Fred,"" who is also a manager, been working here for years and is absolutely great with customers. Fred managed to wrangle Gloria back to the entryway. Gloria explained that she had a reservation for 4 at whatever time it was (around 7, right in the middle of our dinner rush). 

Fred checked the book and found their reservation.... for Sunday night. Seems the new girl wrote it down wrong. Well, Gloria *flips her shit.* Starts *screaming* at Fred and walking around the dining room to point at the empty tables (all of which are reserved), still screaming from behind her sunglasses. I wish I could transcribe exactly what was said but I couldn't hear most of it - noisy, crowded dining room, and I was busy with my tables. But I heard a lot of **""WE HAVE A RESERVATION""** and other variations on the theme. Poor Fred was the closest I've ever seen him to losing his cool, and the whole dining room was watching this woman make an ass of herself. 

I wish I could tell you we told her to come back when she was ready to act like an adult, but Fred put together two reserved two tops to accommodate them - in my section, huzzah! And they got free desserts ""for their trouble."" Being a pro, I schmoozed their pants off and they left with a good tip and no further complaints, but oh how I wanted to tell Gloria to stuff her tantrum in her Depends. I know it was our error, and that sucks, but you know what, accidents happen. If she had been polite, we still would have figured something out for them and comped their desserts. It kills me that we have to REWARD people for abusing us - they get free dessert for their trouble, but what do we get for ours? An average tip and a little less faith in humanity?

Being recently new to the job I realise I have a few things yet to master, such as pace and timing. 

However this one night, I had a table who ensured I got fired for making their baby 'choke'. This is short yet simple. A table of 8 get seated, ranging from grandparents, parents, to a baby. It is my job to give them a wonderful dining experience. After I get their starters down, the father calmy requested I grab them, and this is important, ""a bottle of water and glasses for everyone"". Ok, sure thing. But a table is waiting to be greeted so I'll just settle them in then go grab that water for the other table. Now the whole time im talking to this new table, the other table is just glaring at me with the angriest eyes. I'm thinking wtf I better hurry this up then and grab that water. So after about 2 minutes of waiting the first table has their water, no complaints but visibly angry with me, and this continued for the rest of the night. They would constantly give me stares like I was the devil and speak to me in an agressive tone. 

Sure enough at the end of the night they ask to speak to my manager. Okkk.. I have like 5 managers so I grab one and they speak to the table, everyone is perfectly happy abd there was no complaints. I tell my other manager about the situation and they decide to speak to them as well. Eventually the table pays, leaves etc. Once my shift is over the 2nd manager who spoke to them sat me down. Apparantly the table had complained about me for ""letting their baby choke"". How? I asked. Well apparantly when the table asked for water, I quote ""they said they asked for a single glass of water for the baby because it was choking! and you took forever to bring it out whilst it was suffering! they told me you brought out a bottle of water for a single baby what were you thinking?""

Now im thinking wtf, this table strictly asked for a bottle of water and glasses for the table, in the most casual manner and no mention of a baby choking, sorry I should have known. 

tldr; table complains about getting a bottle of water and it caused their baby to suffer... fml

I had a table of four seniors last night, two men and two women. I was nothing but lovely, attentive, pleasant, and professional to them from the get-go. I'm in my early 20s so I'm always extra careful to be very efficient and respectful with tables of older people, especially if they have sticks up their asses. Usually it works out just fine.

This one guy, though... I don't know what happened. Started out fine, but at some point he just turned on me. They got their food, took their time eating it, no biggie. Cranky guy has cleared his plate and the others seem to have stopped eating with just a scrap or two left, so I stop by and do my usual ""may I take that for you, sir?"" business. Cranky guy SNAPS at me - **""WHY DON'T YOU WAIT UNTIL WE'RE ALL FINISHED.""** I just put on my most beatific Buddha smile - ""certainly, sir."" And buzz the hell off.

Of course they were all finished probably a minute later, so I had a busser clear their plates, gave them some buffer time and headed back over to inquire whether they'd like any after-dinner drinks or dessert. Everyone else seems interested but Cranky Guy is still glaring daggers at me. **""WHY DON'T YOU BRING US THE MENUS,""** he says, as though I'm an imbecile for not foisting dessert menus on them unbidden. ""Very good, sir,"" says beatific Buddha-smile gotcatstyle. (Did I mention I turn into an old-timey Downton Abbey butler when confronted by cranky old people?)

So whatever, they ended up just ordering a bunch of hot tea (argh), and crankypants demands that I bring the check at the same exact time, which (due to the non-POS nature of the restaurant) puts me slightly behind with my other tables, but no big deal. I get everything together (three separate teapots, teacups, plates, spoons, sugar and milk), bring the tray over, set it down on an empty table. Give Crankypants the check (*""here you are, sir, whenever you're ready""*) and start handing out the teas and setups, ladies first. Final annoyance: after I set up the first old lady with her teapot, cup, plate, and spoon, and am beginning to hand out the rest, she goes ""I need milk........""

1371269543.0,94,self.TalesFromYourServer,1gdtas,Worst experience you've ever had? I was threatened by a 'mafia' goon!,108,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1gdtas/worst_experience_youve_ever_had_i_was_threatened/,"This was a few months ago, but I was just thinking about it and it's too ridiculous not to share. Looong story, but I think it's worth it!

So a friend of mine called and asked if I could do his boss a favour. The boss had just taken over a bar, with no previous industry experience, cleaned house and was desperate for staff. I was unemployed, so despite my *major* misgivings about working for first time owners who have not at least a few months in a bar/resto under their belt, I went with it.

Things started going wrong at the 'interview' and went steadily downhill. First, the location. It was in a suburb of NY which is a bit of a dodgy town to begin with, but this was in the heart of a clearly very poor, under invested area - i.e. obviously no disposable income to spend on drinks. No cell reception for my carrier - relevant later. My interview consisted of a 'Yeah, you'll do - can you stay and work til 2am?' and he took off. Uh, okay. I stepped behind the bar and oh holy shit.  The floor was about 3 inches higher than it should have been as it probably hadn't been cleaned since the bar opened in the 70s. When I tried pouring a draft just to check, half-inch lumps of mouldy, yeasty ~~goodness~~ fucking disgusting grossness poured into each beer. (As an aside, I 86'd draft and refused to serve it til he had a pro come clean the taps. He tried to do it himself, I'm not even sure how, but I stood firm.) Then I checked out the stock.

We had I think 8 different types of bottled beer - but we only had about 3 bottles of each! I even sent a pic to my friend bemoaning 'What am I supposed to *sell*?' I've worked in working class 'hoods before - I *am* working class - and people don't have 2/3 beers and leave - they have 9+. And they are attached to their brand. If you run out of Bud they're not going to switch to Coors. They'll leave, usually after making a fuss about it.  A somewhat good natured fuss usually, but still.

Liquor. Holy fuck.  I think everyone in this sub knows what a [stocked bar looks like.](http://onemansblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/liquor-shelf-in-bar.jpg) I can't find a pic to illustrate but imagine four fifths of those gone and tumbleweed blowing in the empty spaces. What we did have was well or, of all things, 3 different flavours of Alize. (I'm not trying to get in to a whole race discussion, but this was a predominantly white neighbourhood, and white people don't drink Alize.) I found a flashlight and checked the bottles... uggggggghhhhhhh. Upwards of ten fruit flies in every syrupy/brown liquor bottle. More 86'ing.  I couldn't ditch them (yet) as I'd been there around 15 minutes, and boss man was gone.

Okay, I'm rambling, so some bullet points.

* So concerned about his bottom line he mused on straning the fruit flies rather than waste the bottles. NO. Also phone service got cut off and he couldn't pay for a few days. RELEVANT.

* *Maybe* 3 customers a day spending about ten bucks each. My shift pay (which was actually generous) was often more than the ring. That's why I stayed for a couple of weeks, 'cos hey, unemployed.

* I told him close for a week, clean, restock, re-open. He couldn't...here's where the 'mafia' come in...


Some guy owed him $xx000 from his other business, and said 'Hey, I can't pay you, how about I give you my bar instead?' WTF!?! After he took over, guy decided the bar was worth xx000+(some amount) and started harassing boss to pay back his *debt*.

A stereotypical guido goon came in late one night and asked for his 30%. I boggled and he walked behind the bar, said he was the boss and here to pick up. He didn't physically threaten me but his demeanor.. I took him seriously. 'Sir, I apologize, I'm new and we haven't met. I'm sure you appreciate I can't give money to *anyone*. If you call (boss man) and put me on the phone, I will if he says so.'

He backed up a bit and told me not to be scared in that Joe fucking Pesci way that means you should be fucking terrified. Called my boss. And says -

* I'm very disappointed in you. And my father - his heart hurts.

* We thought you were a friend of ours.

* You know I'm going 'out of town' in 3 weeks. I'm just looking out for my father., he's an old man now. (He said this over and over)

* Just because I won't be here, don't think that I won't see. Do you know A and B? Because I can send them here. (Boss clearly did because I could hear his voice rise to a kind of pleading tone.)

* **So what am I supposed to take 30% of? The fucking bartender?**

Right after saying that he looks me in the eye and again says not to be scared of him. Still on the phone telling boss how disappointed his father is and he needs to fix it before his three years 'out of town'. I was WAY to scared to call the cops but slipped my cell in my pocket and asked him to use the bathroom. Sent a desperate - no reception - text to a friend - 'Come here; lunatic; u don't know me'. A few minutes later scary guy is still on phone, steps out to car. Warns me not to lock the door on him - he's smart. I was fairly sure from what he was saying on phone he was getting his gun. What for, I'm not sure. I don't think he was going to shoot me. Rough me up or sexually assault me - 50/50.

I want to tell you my friend arrived with 100 SAS guys, it's very tempting. But what really happened was fucking guy came back in, clearly packing but very apologetic for having scared me because he'd never hurt a woman. Went to the bathroom about 8 times in 8 minutes, I could HEAR his snorts and sniffles. Ordered a rum and coke, and left...promising he or his friend A would see me soon to pick up.

I actually stayed til close that night and worked two more days 'til I realized I couldn't do it anymore. I'm an idiot.

I've worked there the past two summers and it's great. Manager is a really cool guy, cooks are all cool, work with cool people, it's a great time.

One afternoon I'm standing behind the register looking over the floor to see if any of my tables needed anything (only had 2 or 3 tables, not very busy) when these two girls walk in, one being about 6' 2"" and the other about 5'. Very odd pair of friends. I ask them how I can help them and they ask loudly if we do slices. I say yes we do and they each order two. The loud tall one says ""make sure mine is really hot. But not burned. REALLY HOT!""

I say sure thing. While I'm putting the order in I overhear the tall loud one saying ""Okay they're $2.25 each and I got two, so what is that?"" *starts counting on fingers*

While I'm writing down the order the tall loud one says (yelled) ""OH SO THEY'LL HIRE GUYS BUT THEY WON'T HIRE BLACK PEOPLE? I'M NOT RACIST BUT...""

I mutter ""I have nothing to do with that sorry...""
TLO (Tall loud one): OH I KNOW BUT STILL I DON'T GET IT

all the while the short one is just standing there smiling and laughing to herself

I ask them if they want to pay separately and they say yes.

It comes to 6 something each, each slice being $2.99. And they're pretty big slices too. I didn't correct them before because I wanted to get the order in and them out as soon as possible.

Anyway, TLO yells ""WHAT!?! THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN $2.25! THEY WENT UP!?!""

I tell them ""yep they have""

They haven't, they've always been 2.99

Anyway, she goes ""WELL I ONLY HAVE $4!...""

Her friend throws down 5 to cover her pizza. 

I turn around to get the first 2 slices and while I was turned around I hear TLO say ""I SHOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN IT OUT OF HIS TIP JAR HE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED HAHAHA""

Right.

Anyway I give the first two slices then about 20 seconds later the second ones come out. She says ""WHICH ONES ARE THE HOT ONES HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHICH ONES ARE THE HOT ONES!?!""

I say ""I would guess these ones **I hand them to her** as they took longer to come out""

You could see the struggle on her face to follow the logic

I really didn't know which ones were the hot ones, I just wanted them to leave

Anyway, she asks for red pepper as she rips the bag open (thing of someone ripping a t-shirt open and that's how she did it. Never mind untying the single knot holding the handles together...)

Then she yells ""OH I ALSO WANT SOME FREE BLEU CHEESE""

First of all, we decide if something is free. Secondly, stop yelling.

I ring them up for that and it's a dollar more. Her quietly laughing friend pays for it.

At this point food has come up for one of my tables who isn't obnoxious, so I say ""Have a good one!"" cheerfully as I bring the food out.

I kept an eye on them to make sure they didn't steal from my tip jar as they left their garbage on the counter and stormed out.

I know this may sound like something minor, but it made me all flustered and I started stuttering, which I rarely do. Also I may have missed some more obnoxious stuff as I tried to forget it. They were there for about 5-7 minutes.

Anyway, what blew my mind a little while later was that I realized she thought they were $2.25 each and only brought $4

I can say that I absolutely love serving, I enjoy going into work (most of the time).

 So, to get into my story, last night I walked into work, punched in, and looked at the floor chart to see that I was GSA (foor runner) for the night. My first thought was ""Why do we need a food runner on a Monday?"" then I found out that I was not just going to be running food that night.

So as I'm running food My manager pulls me aside... Lets call him S... so S pulls me aside and has me start prepping steaks for the kitchen.

Some were old.... and some were VERY old. We used to make a joke about how this group of old folks were there every day, so there's a good chance one would die in the restaurant... don't worry, that's not where this is headed.

So one day, this VERY old regular we called Droopy (because he jawls hung like Droopy the Dog's), who would always come in, and drink 2 martinis and leave, tipped very well, was always very nice, but used a cane and had a very hard time getting around, shuffled to the bathroom... well, no one thought anything of it, so no one knew that he'd been in there for a while, when another customer comes out looking at me while I'm rolling silverware like he'd just seen a ghost.

""I think you need to get a manager...""

""What's the problem, sir?""

""Just get a manager... and don't let anyone else go in there.""

I had no idea that the guy had gone in there or anything else that might be going on, so I just thought there was a flooding toilet or something. I go to get my manager, and follow him into the bathroom, and step out of the restaurant, and into a horror/scat nightmare..... Oh. My. God.

There he stood, pantless at the sink, with the pants in his hands trying to wash them off, a stream of shit running from his ass to the floor and literally EVERYWHERE else. If it wasn't so goddamn disgusting I might have been impressed. There was shit on the mirror, shit in the sink, the floor, the walls, even the walls of the stall that he didn't use, somehow. It was as if someone filled 100 balloons full of shit and then placed them on top of a stick of dynamite. There might have been shit on the ceiling, but it's all kind of a blur to me now, so I don't know. 

The worst part of it was the old man... standing there, half naked, covered in shit, sweaty as hell, trying to wash his pants off... the kicker was when he turned to look at us, I swear he looked as though he was tearing up, and said ""I couldn't make it... I'm sorry...""... It was pitiful. I felt so sorry for the guy. 

Now, the clean up. My manager at the time is to this day the best boss I ever had... he looked at me and told me to get a wet floor sign, a bag of towels, a mop, and a chair, and to block off the bathroom. He actually cleaned the guy up, and cleaned up the whole mess that night. I can't imagine the horror of it, but he did it and did what he could to help the old man out the best he could.

I had a customer come in from our side door (the typical entrance from the outdoor dining area) and ask for a menu and a manager. When I went over to him, he was soaking wet and yelling at me that he didn't get service. I apologized and asked him where he was sitting so I could send a server over to him. He pointed outside. I laughed. Big mistake.

The next thing I know, he is going off, yelling about how I should have warned him that we didn't serve people outside when its raining, how he is wet for no reason now, and how if I had any competence as a manager, I should have prepared for the rain and **stopped it** before customers came in.

I'll be honest, the only reaction I had to him was to chuckle. I had no words. So I chuckled, and then said ""Sorry I couldn't stop the rain, sir.""

It was lunch time, about 2-3 in the afternoon and the cooks boyfriend  whom I will refer to as Loud mouth (or LM for short) happened to walk in for have coffee. I had one single top near the front of the dining room near the door, and another table that came in and sat toward the middle. LM was sitting near the back of the restaurant, where the doorway to the waitress station is.

LM and the guy need the door apparently knew each other, and were talking, almost shouting at each other from opposite sides of the room.

I had refilled all the coffee, and was in the process of trying to take my two-top's order. Every time my customers tried to tell me what they wanted, LM would shout something across the room, and I couldnt hear them.

FINALLY I got fed up.

**Me:** Hey LM could you lower your voice a little?

**LM:** -sips coffee-

So once more I tried to take my customers order, and he starts back up again. Mind you, my customers are trying to tell me their order and they're kind of soft-spoken, obviously knowing proper etiquette of dining in a restaurant.

**Me:** ""LM would you kindly SHUT UP? I cant hear what they're saying, because every time they open their mouths, you open yours.""

LM just kind of huffed, and downed the rest of his coffee, went and talked to the cook and left.

The owner found out what I had done, and asked me about it, and I told him the truth. LM was talking so loudly I couldnt hear what my customers were saying, and I asked him to shut up. Owner shrugged and walked away. 


Edit: I also got a fairly good tip on that table. :3

Last night my second to last table was sat and it was two gay men who I had seen there before but never waited on. I come up, say ""Welcome back gentlemen"" and do my normal spiel. They are very quiet and have drinks from the lounge so I give the some time to look through the menu. 

I went back once and they still weren't ready to order, again being very quiet and at this point awkward. The next time I come back they order a $45 bottle of pinot and a pork satay starter. Our chef prefers yes to ring in the entire order at once, coursed out so I decide to get the bottle, do the presentation and then get their entree order before I put the food in. I bring their bottle, pour it for them and ask if they had questions about entrees. They were, again, awkward, so I put in the app order and decided I would get the entrees later. 

Halfway through their satay I check on them and they obviously don't care for it. I take it away and ask if they'd prefer anything else from the app menu but they decline, and again ask for time when I inquire about entrees. At this point I've had my last table get seated and its a couple of my coworkers so they've apparently seen me interact with the new table. A minute later, they ask for the check. 

I knew they weren't happy, I just couldn't understand why. Everything I did was by the book and professional and yet they were upset. I sent over my supervisor to try to figure out what went wrong, and this is where I am pissed.

Apparently they were upset before they sat down because they were promised patio seating but didn't get it, and were still upset after we explained our patio is being renovated so NO ONE could sit out there. Then, and this is the kicker, they were upset that they weren't sat with a woman or a gay guy, *""Like we normally are""*! They told my supervisor they thought I didn't like gays because they felt ""forgotten"" and that I treated the other table (my coworkers) ""like royalty"". 

It still pisses me off that through no fault of my own they took out their frustrations on me and were quick to judge based on them pulling the gay card. Half of my coworkers are gay and I'm sure as hell not hating on them.

Well, not *that* busy but the kitchen was in a weird funk where they fell behind for some reason. It was just one of those days.

Every (or almost every) table of mine was pleasant and I was on a good roll. One table was a couple, the lady had a salmon and the guy had the pork chops. The food was up by 17 minutes (a little long, but not that bad) and I brought it out and apologized. At the check back, the guy interrupts me mid-sentence and says, ""I don't want this."" I say, ""Sorry?"" ""These pork chops are dry!"" and the lady interjects, ""THESE PORK CHOPS ARE SO FUCKING DRY!! HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO EAT THEM? WHY WOULD YOU BRING HIM DRY PORK CHOPS?!"" I had been nothing but polite to this lady and it baffles me that someone could be so unabashedly rude to a complete stranger. Plus, I'm not even the one who cooked the damn food! I was so taken aback by her cursing and yelling at me that my eyebrows raised and my jaw dropped (involuntarily). I guess she noticed that she crossed the line and she toned it down a little. I said, ""I can have the cooks remake them, or would you prefer to order something else?"" He says, ""I don't care. Whatever won't take *forever*."" I had the cooks remake them, brought them out and then everything was ""Wonderful."" (their words) 

Afterwards they wouldn't look directly at me, even refused refills. When they finished I asked the lady what dessert she wanted (she ordered a 3 course meal) and she said ""nothing."" I said, ""I can pack it up for you so you can take it home?"" She finally meets my eyes and says, ""I'm asking for a box, the check and NOTHING ELSE."" Well, fine BITCH. It's your money. 

Pshh. They still left me 20% though, so I can't be *too* mad.


Also, today a lady ordered the (mahi)^2. I asked, ""What sauce would you like with that?"" And she says, ""You can pick for me. Whatever you like."" So I picked this lemon caper sauce that I like on fish (but I put it on the side, just in case.) She didn't mention anything the whole time she and her friend sat there eating, but at the end when her friend went to the restroom she calls me over and says, ""Just so you know, that sauce was *disgusting*. If I were you, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."" What the fuck! Why didn't you say anything when I was asking how everything was?? Why didn't you just pick your own sauce then?! I guess she was really offended by my taste in sauce because she signed her name angrily on the slip and left me no tip. :(

The following happened this past monday and i'm still quite upset about it...
I work at a small, but quite successful restaurant. One thing we are proud of is our customer service, myself in particular, i've never got a bad review on yelp or a bad rating on our comment cards.
So we had this reservation at 8pm. 2 people showed up in time, the rest of the party was a good 30 minutes late, on top of that they had another person coming. Everything went fine, they loved the food, i was taking care of everything and they didn't have to ask for nothing.
When i dropped the bill one of the guests got it and put cash inside, i've asked him the usual ""are you guys all set here"" and took the book to cash it out.... Turns out that their bill was $135 and the guy put $250 inside.
Of course part of me was thinking on pocketing the money, but i decided to take the honest path and return the change. Came to the table and explained that the bill was $135 and that he had gave me $250.
The payback for my honesty? Not only they where the last table in the restaurant staying after we put all the chairs up, turned the lights on and the music off, after asking me to take 300 group pictures etc... they left me NOTHING!! Not a buck or two... Absolutely NOTHING!!!
Unfortunately i can't change my ways and if this kind of situation presents once more i'll probably do the same and return the change. But this pissed the fuck out of me!!

I don't just work the counter, I also run food, bus tables, wash dishes, do refills, clean, etc. I get paid minimum wage plus tips -- don't kill me y'all, it's still not a living wage. 

So, at work today, this lady came in. She’s come in a couple of times before, but hasn’t achieved regular status. Typically, she’ll come in and get a water, coffee, or italian soda. No biggie. She’s got a strange personality, but she seems friendly and as if she means well. On one occasion, though, she asked me, “Do you guys have a facebook?” To which I nonchalantly replied, “Yeah, we put the specials and pictures of the specials on there, feel free to like us.” She then asked, “Do you have pictures of your employees doing things on there?” MFW: o.O; “Because (Name of another restaurant a few blocks away) has photos of their employees working.” Errr… Okay, well good for them I guess? Happy stalking Other Restaurant! 

So, anyway, she comes in today and gets a glass of water. Water’s free, so I just fix her a glass of water. I turn around and she says, “I put a dollar in your tip jar because you always give good service.” How sweet! A customer that doesn’t even pay for anything tips! Wow! My faith in humanity is restored. She’s said similar things before, “Hey, I put a dollar/two dollars in because you guys are so friendly, etc.” She may enjoy stalking servers via fb, but she’s a nice person!

Well, where I work, we have a register at the counter. And typically, we don’t like having a lot of money or big bills in the jar so as to dissuade thieves (because this has been an issue before). But we typically like to leave a couple of dollars in there to give people an incentive. Also, we like to make big bills or ones for the register to “make change” so we have enough of certain bills/coins. Well, right before she came in, I counted 7 dollars in the jar. I was planning to make a 5, but didn’t want to just leave 2 bucks. So, I figured, “Yay! I’ll have 8 now! I can make a 5 and leave 3 in there. Perfect.” Right after she walks out (she was only in there to grab her water and leave, a minute max and we were dead), I go to count what’s in the jar and there’s 6 bucks…..

That trifflin’ bitch didn’t leave me a dollar! She TOOK a dollar. I mean, it’s only a dollar, but still.

…. It’s one thing if you don’t tip. It’s one thing if you’re a thief and take tips. Okay, you suck. BUT DON’T YOU TELL ME YOU LEFT A DOLLAR IN THERE AND STEAL ONE INSTEAD.

They are self centered, think we should put them ahead of everyone else. This little conversation happened last week during my orientation.

    Host: ""How many?""

    Host: ""The kitchen is backed up right now, so it will be about 25 minutes before we can seat such a large party. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.""

*My name is Mega Church Woman. You're making me wait to be seated. Prepare to get bitched at.*

    Host: ""Yes Ma'am?""

    Church **Bitch**: ""I'm from [redacted mega church name].""

They stayed for a while, had an entree and two drinks each.

After they finished eating, I cleared their plates and waited for the regular to finish his drink. Another group came up to the bar and asked if I could put on the basketball game. Now, our university's basketball team is doing *very* well this season, so I told the regular that another group asked for basketball. The regular said that they were finished and cashing out soon, so I figured it was no big deal. 

Trying to keep everyone happy, I told my coworkers to keep it on the NFL playoffs until right when the basketball game started, so we did. I keep going about my work, and a minute or two later the regular grabs my attention:


&gt;Reg: Excuse me, but who changed the TV channel?

Me: Ummm... ~~Name~~, one of our servers... why?


&gt;Reg: Well we just find it very rude that you would change the station when no one is even watching this.

&gt;Reg: I just want you to understand why I'm not tipping you.


Me: Uh. Um. Well... *Long awkward pause.* No, I guess I don't understand that.


&gt;Reg: We just find it rude that someone would change the channel on us without telling us first. We were going to leave soon anyways, but you couldn't wait for us to leave to switch the channel.

Most of my coworkers are great, but the other food runners are not. This particular story is about New Years eve shift.

On new years, we were busy. Insanely busy. We had over 170 reservations, in a restaurant that seats about 200. It was nonstop, and i was on top of my game, getting tickets out fast and making sure that all the servers had what they needed. Normally, we only have two runners on shift; however, we were so busy that we had an extra on for the evening. I came in early to set up, while the two others were over 20 minutes late to their respective shifts. This is only a minor annoyance, but was the start of a lot more. When i would run out salads, i would come back with a whole tray of dirty dishes to buss. They were not bringing any dishes in, and were getting me to buss the ones they did bring. This, however, was not what made me the most angry. Our owner decided that since it was a holiday, we all were going to stay and help clean. I took this as a cue to do extra work, so after i finished my section of floors, i grabbed a mop and helped all of the other kitchen staff with their floors. And even after i was done with that, i went to the dishroom and started scrubbing pans, even though i had never been trained with the dish equipment. And what were the other runners doing while i was busting my ass? One was complaining to servers while eating pizza that the boss bought, about how it wasn't fair that he had to stay here on HIS new years. The other girl was walking around really slow, touching various things in the kitchen to look like she was cleaning, while texting away on her phone and trying to clock out early. The sweet part of the story, though, is when we finally left, the owner pulled me aside and shook my hand, telling me he was proud to have me on his staff and good job. The stupid female food runner came up right as he was telling me good job and started telling him thank you and she was glad that she was a ""huge help""! Well, my boss looks at her and says ""Shut up, i was not talking to you."" I laughed, and he chuckled with me.

I work at a burger place where you order at the cash register and I bring your food out to you and get whatever else you need. We do to-go/call in orders as well.

We have this customer, we'll call her A. A is not a regular customer but I've seen her come in once before. What's weird is that my manager used to own a dry cleaner's that this lady frequented before and now she decides she wants to come eat at my manager's restaurant- oh joy. 

My manager HATES this lady. Also, my manager is not one to take crap from rude people, she'll just tell them we don't need their business. Most of our customer are awesome regulars so we don't usually have that problem. 

So A calls in an order and my manager tells her it will be about 12 minutes (not the usual 8-10 minutes because she ordered her chicken well done...). She orders a grilled chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, and two honey mustards on the side.

My manager looks at me after getting off the phone with A, ""junkofthe_heart, A is coming in(she briefed me on who A was)....she'll probably be rude to you so do not take it personally, this lady is mean."" I'm thinking okay, she's probably not THAT bad, I've dealt with some rude people before.

So A comes in not 6 minutes after she orders her food and at first she seems a little decent, not rude but not very nice. She pays for her food and i tell her it will be a few more minutes, that's when she turned into the devil.

A: OH MY GOD, I'M DYING IT'S SO HOT IN HERE!

Nevermind that it's 105 degrees outside and she was standing by the kitchen where it's 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the restaurant.  

me: I'm sorry ma'am if you want I can bring you a fan, it's a little bit hotter next to the kitchen because of the grill.

A: NO THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I'm dying in here! I'll just leave! is my food ready yet?!

me: Let me ask the cook.. It should be almost ready..
I come back not even 15 seconds later..

A: Is it ready or is it NOT READY?! IM LEAVING!

I'm thinking holy crap lady it hasn't even been 12 minutes and it's not even that warm in the store. My manager just looks at me and rolls her eyes as everyone in the restaurant can probably hear this lady. She walks outside for literally 30 seconds in the 105 degree weather and then walks right back in.

A: Is it ready yet?! This is ridiculous how hot it is in here..

Manager: I dont feel warm at all! I think it feels just fine! 
My manager is just messing with this lady because she hates her. A has always been rude to her. 

me: Yes maam, here's your food! 

A: IS THERE TWO HONEY MUSTARDS IN HERE?

me: yes maam, it's in the bag..

A: Oh thank you!

me: .............Have a good day!

I'm thinking what the heck, this lady was the devil 5 seconds ago and now she's acting like nothing ever happened and all happy. I don't understand people like this. They think they deserve special treatment and that they're better than everyone else. If she didn't want to be in the heat she shouldn't have left her house. No actually she just shouldn't leave her house period.

We are a fairly new store so we get a lot of new customers. Well the other night I had a lady and her husband seated in my section. The lady wanted the turkey burger. Now the turkey burger comes with avocados and a lot of other things on it, and if you don't tell me you don't want all this shit that is on it, well guess what you are going to get it. The conversation goes as follows: * Lady- I would like the turkey burger with wild mushrooms and braised onions.
*ME- Ok would you like (yada everything else) plus the mush+onions OR  just the MUSH+ONIONS.
*HER - just add mushrooms and onions to my burger!!!
ok so I assumed she wanted everything with the mushrooms and onions added. (YES I WAS WRONG) So the food comes out and she says, ""there is cheese on my burger."" Well yes ma'am cheese comes on the turkey burger unless you tell me not to put it on there for you. She says its ok and I assume all is well. I WAS WRONG.
*LADY- FLAGGING ME OVER
*ME- Hello, is there anything wrong ma'am?
*LADY- ""Maybe you are just incompetent, and maybe this just isn't the job for you, which it probably isn't because of your lack of detail. BUT I only wanted mushrooms and onions on my turkey burger so maybe after you realize how much of an incompetent idiot that you are you can take this back and get me the RIGHT burger.
*ME- Ma'am it was my misunderstanding I didn't realize you only wanted  mushrooms and onions on your burger. I will take this back right away and get you the correct burger. 
*Now I understand reading this how you can assume this was my fault but I tried my hardest making sure when she ordered that there are a lot of other things that come on our turkey burger. Also at the time I am trying my hardest not to burst out crying with rage because I have never in all of my serving experience been treated like this.
*So her other burger came out within 8 minutes and everything was dandy. My manager took it out to her (thats our policy) and she apparently was a total bitch to him to. None of my managers listened to her complain about me because they knew what had happened. But. HOW THE FUCK DO PEOPLE THINK ITS OKAY TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS?

One weekend I was working the front of house position we call a ""key"" which is basically a front of house ""manager"" that is responsible for going to tables and taking all the heat from mistakes and trying to correct them. I was approaching a bar table that had an issue with a steak to apologize to them. As I am talking, I feel a pretty good slap across my arm. I turn around and there is a man sitting at the bar staring at me. I go, ""Can I help you sir??"" while staring at him in disbelief. He said to me, ""I didn't get my horseradish sauce for my steak! I asked for it already!"" And I just said, ""Okay, I will go get that for you."" And as I turned back around to continue talking to the table he just screams, ""NO!! NOT AFTER YOU TALK TO THEM! RIGHT NOW!"" And I said, ""Sir, I was just going to talk to them about an issue and I will be right back with that sauce."" He goes, ""God, do I have to ask a manager or something?!"" And I just said, ""Sir. I am a manager. I will be right back with that for you."" I went and got the sauce and then when my boss found out, the store proprietor, he told the man to not hit the employees and the man freaked out and said he would leave. He was obviously intoxicated, but he was with his wife as well (who didn't say a word the entire time). My manager let them leave because she was driving but damn!

We've had 3 people quit and one person on vacation which leaves us very short staffed. The management isn't trying hard enough to hire someone new and is only telling us want we want to hear to keep us content. The truth is very evident though. Everyone is being forced to work longer hours and more shifts than they had signed up for. 

I am a university student and only working as a waitress to get me through school. I asked for 4-5 days a week in the summer. I am being put on for 6 days (were closed Sundays), being asked to come in early (without enough notice), being asked to work split shifts (also without notice), harassed on my days off to come in and then guilt tripped when I say no. 

I was visiting another city with my sister on my one day off and was called and texted by management asking to come back early to work that night. I texted a coworker who I thought was a friend to see if it was really going to be that busy. Management continued to ask me to come in even though I said no. They even tried to bribe me. It go to the point where I just began ignoring them. 

The next day I asked the same coworker how the night went and then went off on a bit of a rant about how I was harassed and how they need to hire more people. She agreed with me and ranted a bit herself. Little did I know she was actually just telling me what I wanted to hear so that she could go and report what I said to management.

The head manager came up to speak with me while I was in the middle of serving tables. She did not pull me aside or wait till after my shift. She said she was cutting my shifts down to 3 shifts a week and that if I have an issue to speak to her and not to my coworkers. I told her that I was simply blowing off steam and that I did intend to speak with her after work. 

I'm pretty upset with my coworker for ""tattling"" on me but I don't really mind that my shifts got cut. Yes, it will be less money but the stress right now isn't worth it for me. I am looking for other work that has to do with my career choice but I want to pass on the lesson I learned from this. Even if you think your coworkers are your friends, do not rant about work to them. It's not worth the risk of looking like a bad person or getting your shifts cut. Rant to outside friends or family instead. Plaster on a smile and fake it through the stress until you make it.

I work in a tiny restaurant, about 10 tables.

The restaurant was full except for maybe three dirty tables (two tables that can seat 4, one table that can seat up to 9) even though we'd split some of our tables up to make more seats (split up a 4 seater into two 2 seaters).

A group of four walks in and starts heading towards the tables. I stop them and let them know politely that all of the tables are dirty and that I'll need to clean them before they can sit down.

They say okay, not a problem. I turn to the computer to print out a check for another table (took all of three seconds) and when I turn back around... guess what?
They're sitting at the *dirty* table that seats *9 people.*

REALLY?! I mean, if you were going to sit down anyways, just *say* so. Or let us know that you want to sit at that table!! Don't just *wander* on over to lay claim to the table.

Because of you, I had to change 3 of our tables into one table for a group of 7 (technically I used two tables but we couldn't use the third table because of the way I had to set up that table for the large group :'(  ) and a group of 4 had to wait way longer than necessary to be seated.

Are you happy? I know you enjoyed the food since you four ate every last crumb on your plates, but I hope you get indigestion. I really really hope you get indigestion. Indigestion so uncomfortable that you have to leave your house at 2AM to go buy some tums or alka seltzer or something like that.

Think Perkins-esque, but a little crappier. Our normal clientele was well..elderly. We closed down way back when and I have continued serving since at another place, but this story always will stick with me.

On our menu, we had hot, open faced sandwiches. We had two, the Hot Pot Roast Sandwich and the Hot Turkey Sandwich. They were the exact same concept, piece of bread, meat, gravy, and a side of potatoes and some veggie. Super good, very unhealthy, and pretty popular. 

This elderly lady comes in by herself and spends a LONG time looking at the menu. At a place like this, you really get to know your regulars and I had determined based on the time she spent looking at the menu, she had never been here before. She was at a booth near the front of the store, and the kitchen was at the back. The restaurant was basically set up like a long hallway, if that makes sense. I wanted to give her adequate time to look at the menu, but every time I kept returning, she said she ""wasn't ready yet."" Cool, no big deal, I have 6 other tables to tend to. She took an unusually long time, but that wasn't THAT crazy because I noticed most elderly people liked to sip their coffee etc. 

She points to the menu and orders one of the hot sandwiches, I can't remember which one. Now, on our menu, despite the name being ""Hot Turkey Sandwich"", nowhere in the description did it say that the sandwich was warmed up OR openfaced. Because of this, I usually always would make a comment about it, complementing their choice, something along the lines of, ""Oh yes, that's a really good one. Something about the mashed potatoes and warm bread all smothered in the gravy really hits the spot,"" I can't remember exactly. She smiles and so I go to put the order in.

I bring it out when it is ready and she is CLEARLY displeased. She says to me, ""What is this? I ordered the turkey sandwich, not this disgusting thing!"" Mind you, we don't actually serve any cold deli style sandwiches. These were the only two sandwiches on our menu. I explained to her that it was what she ordered, and even went as far as grabbing a menu to show her- in the exact spot she had pointed- that that was, in fact, what she had ordered. At this restaurant, the servers made their own salads and took care of their own soups.. By this point, I could tell she was pretty pissed off so I apologized for the mix up and offered to bring her something else. She mumbled that she didn't have time for the kitchen to make anything else, and I explained to her that I could run back and make her any salad off the menu (we had about 8 or 9, all intricate and really good), or bring her out a complementary cup of the soups- we had 3 that day, including chili. I listed them all off, but she wasn't having it. I attempted to kill it with kindness but she grumbled that she would ""just eat the damn thing"" and to leave her be. Very unhappy. Very rude.

A few minutes later, I walked by her table to check on another one that was close by. She flagged me down, but it was clear that she didn't realize that I was her server. She said IN THE NICEST TONE EVER, ""Excuse me, but my server messed up and brought me the wrong sandwich, do you think I could trouble you for a cup of chili instead?""  Handing me the plate, which had been untouched.

I put on a fake smile and told her that was no problem, brought the plate back to the kitchen, and grabbed her damn chili. To this day I have no idea why she didn't just accept my offer in the first place and decided that had to flag down ""someone else"" (which was really ME, jokes on you!) to get what she wanted.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_17kpaw,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/17kpaw/do_you_want_me_to_bring_you_a_cup_of_chili/,

Let me first say that I will always own up to a bad table, whether it was out of my hands or not, and this was absolutely nowhere close to a bad table experience. That being said, when I first saw this 'tip', I was honestly too busy to look in my books from each table and see who tipped what, so I just looked at the pieces of hardware (not mentally noting the pennies) as interesting random items left behind, especially from the awkward family I had just waited on at that table. 

I ran into my boss first, and after I told him about it he said I should keep it in my pocket as a ""karma charm"" for the next day. And I was all on board, until......he got the text, (weird, but his cell phone number is on the front door next to ""general manager""), saying that I took ""forever"" to greet them, I was talking to the host the whole time, and they had to wait on refills ""forever"".

To make a long story short....I was triple sat, and it was more than obvious to them that they were third in line, because I was very polite about it and let them know what was up and that I would be right with them. The host had to come to my computer at one point to open a table that they'd forgotten to open and continued to talk to me as I entered food, closed out tables, and printed checks. Their table also all had bar drinks that were coming from our overly busy bar, but you best believe their water glasses were always full and their food was prompt. We had a couple short funny conversations that went well, they smiled, I made good suggestions and helped them out when ordering, got them to go drinks and other things I really didn't have to do.....When I learned the truth behind the screws it *almost* got to me.

But then I realized...who the hell walks around with screws in their pockets ready to leave a server for a shitty job done?! The kind of people who are looking for the tiniest excuse to not have to leave a tip, and somehow still feel good about themselves by making a cowardly point.

To that table: [Point well taken.](http://i.imgur.com/vBUWnFH.jpg)


Edit: The title was supposed to say 'cash' not 'weight'.....eh well, it's been a long day, you get the point.

Edit2: So, they're not screws. I mean, I obviously knew one was a nut, but wasn't so sure about the other two. But, ""screw you"" was definitely the message being portrayed by their presence on my table. They even made sure to mention that they left them on the table in their text to my boss.

Around the holidays we get a lot of traffic from military people who apparently missed our shakes a lot while they were overseas. (Don't know why, our shakes really aren't that great... but whatever floats your boat!). 

When we got a new CEO a few years back, he took away all discounts including senior discounts, uniformed workers (police officers, firefighters, and ambulance drivers), and military discounts. Seeing how many military personal we have come in over the holidays and how many times we have to say ""I'm sorry, we can't give you a discount for your hard work, dedication, and personal sacrifice"" really made myself and the other servers upset (especially since our favorite grill cook left for the marines), so we would do what we could for them. Typically, we got the managers OK to give them a free shake.

So one day 2 guys and a girl came in wearing their uniforms and asked me if there was any kind of discount. I told them I could get them any shake they wanted. While it wasn't what they had in mind, they were still excited since they hadn't had a milkshake in about 6 months. They couldn't make up their minds on which kind of shake they wanted, so I had them list off what sounded good and I got them a small shake of each flavor. I don't think I had ever seen a grown man so excited to see a cookie dough milkshake!

These two women come in at least 3x a week for unlimited chips and salsa, and waters w/ lemon. Their bill totals $2. Sometimes, they will spring for a couple of sides of sour cream for 50 cents each.

These women generally stay for 1 or 2 hours, and require at least 4 refills on their chips and salsa. To add insult to injury, they only ever sit in the corner of the restaurant farthest from the kitchen, and up a couple of stairs. In addition, they require water refills and fresh lime slices (to sqeeze over their chips). They always make a huge mess. Sometimes, they complain that the (free) limes are too dry. Other times, they ask for 2 or 3 tubs of salsa per bowl of chips.

So basically, when they come in, I spend hours checking on them; pouring them waters, bowls of chips, and sides of salsa; and grabbing them free lime wedges from the bar. The kitchen does nothing, the bar does nothing. I do literally all of the work.

I was a customer and witnessed this incident happen right in front of me yesterday and I thought I'd share. 

Just a few things you need to know: This all happened in a heavily-accented redneck Acadian French, so I'm paraphrasing/ translating it into an English-redneck instead. Two: This restaurant was a wind mill, and so it has a little bit of an awkward layout, it's in a u-shape with a staircase in the middle that leads to the bathroom upstairs, the coat room and the kitchen being on either side of it. Also, there are WAY too many ignorant people like this man around my home town. 

As I said, yesterday I was out for dinner with my mom at a local (very tasty) Greek restaurant. We had just gotten our yummy food and were chowing down when this family arrives.This family consists of a meek, soft-spoken mother, a teenage daughter that is clearly trying to be classier than her dad, and this tattooed mountain of a dad. 

They walk in and immediately I see that this mass of masculinity is clearly not well versed in the concept of sit-down restaurants. His wife and teen daughter sit down and he's just walking around, huffing and puffing, trying to ""git sum sarvice"", in his words. He meandered around the cash, peeked at the kitchen, and was walking WAY too close to the tables, triggering scared looks from other customers. He was super beefed up, and his face was red with effort, I'm guessing his brain had trouble processing the fact that this wasn't fast food. He then tries to enter the kitchen to go pee. I know this because I overhear him muttering ""....bathroom..."" and grunting. He tries to enter a closet, too. This man is clearly not able to follow the obvious signs pointing to the staircase, leading to the washrooms. Eventually, he gave up and sat down. All the while, me and my mom are shooting each other looks. We feel bad for their server already.

The waitress arrives, polite and peppy, ready to serve them drinks and whatnot. The man glares at her before growling at her to ""giv 'im sum damn time"". His daughter is extremely embarrassed at his behavior. His wife is just looking at the menu nervously as the waitress leaves. I was trying not to eavesdrop too much, but he was speaking rather loudly. I'm not too sure of all of what was said, but this is the gist of it:

Fowl Father: This menu's full of pussy food!

Meek Mother: Oh...look at that, honey, there's steak! And that tzatziki looks delicious!

Daring Daughter: Yeah dad! You can have this, or maybe even this! Look at that, you like lobster, right?

FF: I'LL EAT WHAT I WANT, Y'ALL EAT WHACHU WANT!!!

DD: Dad...

FF: THERE AREN'T ANY HAMBURGERS? WHY AREN'T THERE ANY? 

DD: Dad, it's not that kind of restaurant...pleaaase just...

FF: WELL I'M LEAVING. ARE YOU COMIN' WIT ME OR NOT?

They both fell silent. I didn't dare look around. Then I heard him getting up.

FF: WELL?!?! ARE YOU COMING OR NOT??

I looked over as he walked through the door, the two ladies in tow. The waitress was just coming back, and she stopped in her tracks when she saw them peace out. She looked at me and my mom, and all she said was: ""Well, if he's not happy, there's a Mc Donald's on the other side of town"". 

I just don't understand why he'd ruin an evening that his daughter seemed so excited about, JUST because it wasn't an experience he was used to, and it was something just a bit different when it came to food choice. He missed out on some great food though, the chicken kebobs and steak we ordered were delicious.

There were about five of us that always joked around and had a good time messing with each other's tables in a friendly manner.  This turned into a full fledged game that would catch you off guard at times.  At the restaurant we worked at which was a large ""upscale"" volume restaurant(17 servers on the floor, 4 bartenders, 5 hostesses, etc.)  We all helped to run out food to the tables.  When someone in our little group of friends had the opportunity to drop off food at another friend's table, they would drop little tidbits of false information about the server at the table.  

The rules went like this:

Never call the food runner a liar.  You must play along with whatever they told your table.

Never tell someone's table something negative that might hurt a tip or affect the server negatively in management's perspective.

Server's may exclude themselves from ""the game"" for any given night, but he owed any other people in the group a drink(no doubles or excessive costs) if they were out that night.  This had to be stated at the beginning of the shift, and only happened to my knowledge twice.

That was the extent of it.  During the course of about a year that we played, I lied to tables about my wife returning the next day from a year overseas, getting the lead in a local town play of the King and I, applying to be a counselor at a camp for young actors, and also, my personal favorite, graduating with a degree in native american basket weaving...

I work at a sports-centric restaurant with like 50 TVs, 30 Beers on tap, etc...That kind of place. So they come in and order some boneless wings to share. The man then jumps right into the following conversation with me. Now keep in mind I am a 24 year old girl and I'm regularly told I look younger. 

Man: So do you have any kids?

Me: (awkward pause) Uhm, no. My boyfriend and I aren't ready to have kids yet. We want to spend time just us before we start a family.

Man: How old are you?

Me: I'll be 25 in August.
 
Man: Time's running out isn't it then? You'd better get on it! 

Me: (awkward silence) 

This guy just asks about if I have kids before even asking if I was still in school, or how old I was, or even if I had a boyfriend/fiancee/husband. It was bizarre, and I tried to be as friendly as I could and continue with the conversation. He then went on a rant about why we don't have milkshakes, and how not everybody wants a beer. I tried to tell him that we have flavored lemonades or virgin daquaris but, no, he wanted milkshakes and that I would easily be able to convince the entire company that we should have milkshakes. They eventually left, after going up to try to pay their bill at the carry-out station instead of at the table, and completely stiffed me.

It was the busiest shift and usually the most profitable for the servers, since it was an extremely popular place with no competition nearby. The place had a *lot* of regulars who would come in for the same breakfast every day (leaving me to wonder just how many pieces of bacon can be safely consumed by one person in the span of a year...), not to mention all the 20-somethings coming in for hangover breakfast and elderly couples grabbing a bite after church. 

Once I started working the bar section, it was *especially* profitable for me, since I had more tables to serve than everyone else, *plus* all the singles and couples sitting around the bar (roughly 25 seats, full at all times, with a really high turnover rate) — at any given time on a weekend, I'd have up to 20 cheques open at once. It was stressful, but worth the cash. 

I was great at multi-tasking the ridiculous number of customers, but often didn't have time to chit-chat beyond the normal courtesies of greeting them, topping up their coffees and quality-checks. I especially didn't have time to deal with the unnecessary bullshit I always faced with this *one* guy who came in roughly every other weekend. Thankfully not a daily regular, but I still had to deal with him more often than I cared to.

Every time he came, he ordered the same thing but always spoke very slowly and patronizingly to me as if he thought I were a total bimbo who would surely get his order wrong (I never did). He always tried to chat with me, which is a nice gesture and all, but he was always so *negative* in his conversation topics. He would just basically gripe about whatever was going on in the news or in sports or in the neighbourhood. Never pleasant. 

All that aside, what *really* pissed me off about this guy was that he always, **always** had to make a big show of the fact that he had brought his own coffee from Tim Hortons or whatever nearby gas station because he reeeeeeaaaaalllly didn't like the coffee we served. It was no fancy brew, but literally no one else *ever* complained about it except for this guy... and he did it *every single time*. Message received, buddy! It's not like he didn't recognize me, he just felt I needed to hear it every damn time, as if he expected me to either bring my own blend from home and brew it especially for him or pressure my managers into switching brands. This was definitely not going to happen, as all of our food came from the same supplier, with whom we had a great business relationship. I even humoured him one time by asking my boss about it right in front of him, just so he would feel that his constant complaints had been acknowledged and that I would *try* to do something about it, but his response was pretty much ""Why the hell would we do that?"". 

We never, ever banned anyone from bringing in coffee from somewhere else, so I don't know why this guy couldn't just let it go and shut up about it. Most sane people just don't order something if they don't like it.

I was working this particular night as the only server so I had to take every table in the dinning room, anything not at the bar, and the back room.


At about 7:00 I had 5 Dinning room tables, a few in the bar and quite a few guys for a pool league when a large group(15 people maybe) of friends walk in. Through out the night I would come back to check on this party and they would just be gone. They would seriously leave once every 15 minutes. After a few hours, I noticed that one girl left, she had only had a pop so what ever. After the next 2 breaks another one left, so I was getting slightly weary.


At about 10 the tab for the whole table was around 200 dollars. I went over to check on them, when they were gone again, this time they were gone for a good 20 minutes, and I was freaking out the whole time. When they returned, 3 more were gone. They ordered more drinks, and I printed their tab thus far. When I was bringing back the drinks they were gone again. This time I was upset, and told our pull-tab worker about it, and asked her to just tell me when they got back.


When they did eventually return, I went over to their table and set the  current tab down and politely asked if I could hold someones credit card for it since it is a very pricey tab, some of their friends left without paying already and I was worried that they may forget and just leave. I also told them that at the end of the night they could still split the check, and pay how ever they would like.


I was in turn called; stupid, retarded, inconsiderate, and told I wrecked one girls birthday because I was apparently forcing them to close their tab out.

Our waiter clearly stole our table from our intended waitress right in front of us by sitting down with us right next to me. In that 4-6 inches of space, like it was no big fucking deal. Put his hand on my knee for all of half a second before he realized I was about to punch him in the throat. As soon as he left I moved my purse to take up that space in case he decided to do it again because what the fuck? 

Then he came over just about every 90 seconds after we ordered to see if we needed anything.

Now onto the tale...

I had not been at work long and was just doing some side work until the phone call came in. I go over and answer it. A guy on the other end wants to order a large pepperoni pizza to go. Awesome, easy and I won't hear the cook complain because the pizza has more than one topping on it. I send it through, tell him how long it'll be and the price. It was then he tells me he doesn't want to pick it up himself, he's going to get his son to do it and want to pay over the phone by credit card. Again, awesome, I'm one of three people allowed to do this and while the card machine asks at least a dozens questions before it'll process it's pretty easy to do. 

The process is going smoothly, though I can hear the guy getting agitated with every question I ask. Then it goes a little something like this...

Me: ""Okay sir, now it's asking me for your billing address, so just the number of your home."" 

ToGo Guy: ""Stop, just stop. Why are you asking me all these questions?""

Me: ""Uh, because that's what the machine is asking me. Since the card isn't present I have to input all the info it asks for.""

ToGo Guy: ""But why? This is ridiculous. Are you writing this all down or something?""

Me: ""What? No. Why would I?""

ToGo Guy: ""I don't know but this doesn't seem right. I've done this before and I've never been asked questions that were this personal before. Why are you asking me this? You're writing this down aren't you?""

Me : ""Sir, it's like I already told you, I have to ask because the credit card machine won't process it without your information. I'm not writing it down or anything, I have absolutely no reason to and I'm pretty sure my bosses would flip.""

ToGo Guy: ""I feel like I'm being scammed, cancel my order.""

Me: ""Are you serious? I'm only doing my job here.""

ToGo Guy: ""Yes, goodbye.""

So I go in the system to cancel the order. As I'm voiding the entire check I'm shaking my head thinking this would not have been a problem if he had just not been lazy and picked it up himself instead of trying to get someone to get to do it for him.

This was a sign of the things to come.  Around 6:00 pm, we had a 14-top b-day party come in.  The birthday girl was there with a couple of friends for about 30 minutes before her mom got there.  Her mother had made the reservation with me earlier that day, was very polite, and had a good sense of humor.  I told them it was corporate policy that I couldn't seat them until at least half of their party was there.  The girl was very understanding and I got her seated as quickly as possible.  The party was very clean and tipped well.

The cherry on top was around seven, when a couple and their two sets of twins (girls around 7 &amp; and boys around 9) came in and sat in the section right behind the host stand.  The woman asked me about a couple items on the menu, because she hadn't been to the restaurant in a couple of years, and told me she was pregnant.  I am not shitting you when I tell you, their kids were the BEST KIDS I'VE SEEN IN A REALLY LONG TIME.  Obedient, clean, polite, the whole nine yards.  I even went up to them when they were done and complimented their parenting skills.

Here's the kicker:  I live in a large ""urban"" (yes, black) city.  All of these people are black.  I hate that I work with some people that are just unabashedly racist, and act like they have every reason to be.  Every time I hear someone use the term ""hood rat"" or ""ghetto"" or some other bullshit like that, I just walk away.  I can't stand people who are bigoted based on SKIN COLOR, something that **no one** has **any** control over!

I just wanted to share this with you all :)

This just happened tonight and I thought this would be a great place to share it. 


Just to give a little background on the restaurant I work for it's a chain restaurant that's kind of like a conglomerate of a few different restaurants. I also live in Indiana and we have laws against comping alcohol. 
So anyways, my first couple of tables leave me sub par tips and I'm used to pulling in 20-25% per table so I knew this night wasn't going to be great. 


I get sat a 5-top at one of my booths there's mom, dad, grandma, and (what I'm guessing is) a 2 and 4 year old. Well they all order waters and some alcohol so as I'm walking away to get their drinks, mom stops me and demands that I bring crackers or bread over to appease the children (who are crawling all over my booth) and I tell her that our kids meals come with carrots and ranch so I'll bring that right over with the drinks. So anyways it's all typical picky family with ill behaved children until everyone gets their food (at this point mom is on her 2nd Absolute Red Bull) Well mom and grandma ordered medium cooked steaks that come with two sides...well those are cold. Dad's meatloaf is cold as well but he's just going to eat it though ""I'm not happy with it"" so I bring the steaks to the back and my manager has me re-ring them for steak count and goes and talks to them. He comes back and tells me the dad has called his kitchen ""shit."" I go back over there to tell them that their new food will be right up and against my better judgement bring mom her 3rd Absolute and Red Bull of the night. I bring out their food and all are happy (except now the little girl is dumping out my sugar caddy and salt and pepper shakers and mom and dad are too drunk to care) until they get the check. Mom and dad are to the point of slurring words so of course reading that check is going to be confusing, so I go over to them and they proceed to ask me to explain the discounts so I tell them that it's illegal in Indiana to comp alcohol, but that my manager had voided one drink each from mom and dad and then proceed to explain that I had to re-ring in the steaks so that we can keep track, in which case very drunk mom screams ""WE FUCKIN KNOW THAT."" Either way they can't wrap their head around why there bill was $110 and is now $69 and why all of these food items are popping up on their bill because the manager said they were comped. This is when dad starts screaming at me. 


Dad: I WANT A BILL THAT SAYS WHAT IT IS I'M PAYING FOR AND THAT'S IT. YOUR MANAGER SAID HE'D COMP ALL OF THE FOOD AND TAKE OF A COUPLE OF DRINKS. 


Me: Sir, the bill lists all of the discounts at the very bottom, unfortunately it's illegal to discount liquor so those discounts won't appear on the bill because we had to void them off. 


Dad: WELL YOUR MANAGERS A FUCKIN LIAR AND A FUCKIN PIECE OF SHIT!! 
I then proceed to grab the bill and as nicely as I can explain to them that I'm going to send my manager over to explain the bill. 
All in all, I got $10 on what was originally a $110 bill that had been discounted to $69. This table kinda ruined my night. :( 

TL;DR Mommy and Daddy get drunk, the kids destroy my table, Daddy doesn't understand how to read a bill with discounts on it, proceeds to scream profanities in a mildly upscale restaurant.

One customer comes in with her daughter and asks for a table for three.  Problem: we have a pretty strict policy against seating incomplete parties.  Bigger problem: I only have deuces available at the moment.

No big deal, I figure - I tell this customer that I can't seat her because she's incomplete, but it's not all bad, because I don't have a table open.  She starts berating me.  ""You have tables right here! (pointing to the deuces) Just put us there.""  After explaining that pushing the tables together would violate fire code (truth - we pack these tables in there), she says ""You'd rather leave them empty than seat us there? That's pretty fucking stupid.""

After that exchange, I tell her to move towards the bar, and I'll get her seated with the first available table once her party is complete.  She finds and talks to my manager, then comes up to me and says how I was rude, she was embarrassed, and after six years of dining at my restaurant regularly, she was probably never coming back.

After my shift, my manager pulls me aside to talk to me about it.  He confirms that she is (was?) a regular, and tells me her side of the story, which was embellished to involve me being a total jackass who told her ""to get the hell out of my face.""  I tell him that's not true, and mentioned that she was looking for me to seat her against the policies he had specifically set.

He looks up at me, and without missing a beat, says ""THAT's what she wanted?  Well fuck that bitch - she was probably on the rag.""

So I now work as a host at a sushi restaurant. It's a pretty easy job and I work with cool people. One part of my job is to take To Go orders. So around 7:30 I get a call and we answer the phone with ""moshi moshi"" which is Japanese for hello. Here is the conversation.

Me: Moshi moshi

Caller: What? Do you speak Japanese?

Me: Yes I do would you like to order in Japanese?

Caller: I don't fucking speak Japanese. I don't fucking understand mushi mushi.

Me: Um... ok. What can I do for you?

Caller: Do you have rice balls?

Me: Rice balls? No, unfortunately we don't.

Caller: Rice. Balls. CAN YOU HEAR ME?

Me: We don't have rice balls. Is there anything else I can get for you. (It's taking all my power not to be rude to him.)

Caller: I want Shitake (he pronounced it ""shi-da-key"")

Me: Shitake? Would you like it as a roll or -

Caller: SHITAKE! I don't want a roll I want Shitake!

Me: OK I understand that. I need to know how you would like it.

Caller: Can you hear me? I don't think you can hear me let me spell it for you.

(I think 'ok whatever' and let him spell it.)

Caller: s-u-c-k SPACE m-y SPACE d-i-c-k 

I don't even respond.

Caller: READ IT BACK TO ME. READ IT Bitch! SHITAKE! READ IT!

At this point he continues to berate me and I can't even get a word in. Now at this point you would say ""why didn't you just hang up?"" well if you have read my other talesfrom.. post you would know I worked at a placed dubbed Cluck n Feed. At Cluck n Feed we were forced to stay on the phone because we had to put up with it according to management. 

So I'm getting pissed off and it's obvious to me that this guy is a fucking dickhole. I just moved up from host to server and I was worried that by hanging up on him I would lose my opportunity to become a full time server. 

I handed the phone over to my manager and he dealt with it. Basically decided to not even indulge. Hung up. Told me if that ever happens again, I'm allowed to tell him to fuck off and hang up.

Still I hope that guy gets hit by a truck. He was rude and I am working 4 doubles this week. I am in NO MOOD!

We also have a variety of hot teas, black or herbal. Sometimes when it's slow and I want a pick-me-up, I'll brew myself a ""specialty"" iced tea; like a lemon ginger, or a peppermint, or maybe a wild raspberry hibiscus. But it takes a while to do, and it's certainly not something we put on the menu or offer to customers.

So enter the Tea Monster. Unassuming older lady, dining alone. It's near the end of my shift, the rush is over, I was on top of my game that day and feeling good. Tea Monster wasn't technically in my section, but we pool tips so when it's slow we play it pretty fast and loose with the sections. I volunteered to take her because my coworker was busier than me and I always like to give extra friendly service to people dining alone whenever I can.

I go over and say hi and right away I can tell she's a little cranky, but no big deal. I figure, I can fix that. Ask her if she'd like a drink, joke about my awesome Bloody Mary mixing skills. She declines the booze, wants an iced tea... but do we have any specialty iced teas?

*She's just one lady, and I only have one other table... I'm gonna be nice!* I think, foolishly.

""Well... not *officially,* but since we're not busy I'd be happy to brew you a special iced tea if you don't mind waiting a little.""

She likes the sound of this and orders a peppermint iced tea. I pop off to brew it. I do my usual thing - steep the bag in hot water, wait a while to let it brew, pour over a glass of ice. I even garnished it with a mint leaf. I was gonna give EXCELLENT SERVICE, dammit.

Tea Monster flags me down a minute later. 

**TM:** ""This tea is too weak. You should have brewed it in hot water first then poured it over ice.""

[I've made a huge mistake.jpg](http://memeorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ive-made-a-huge-mistake-arrested-development.jpg)

**Me:** ""Oh, sorry about that! I actually did, but I must not have let it steep long enough because I didn't want to keep you waiting. I'll just fix that for you."" 

Round 2. Second tea bag. Steep, brew, ice, garnish, drop it off with a smile.

A minute later...

**TM:** ""Now it's not cold enough. You need to fill the glass with ice and then pour the water.""

**Me:** [""No problem! Sorry about that, let me fix that up for you one more time.""](http://24.media.tumblr.com/3f31e1641d866ad4624d420e8e537b92/tumblr_mmwpt0Q8zb1s5tzmro1_500.gif)

Round 3. Third tea bag. Steep for like five goddamn minutes, pour over massive amount of ice, fuck the garnish she doesn't get any more of our mint, drop off with a (slightly crazed) smile. Luckily this time she was either satisfied or sick of complaining.

The rest of her meal went smoothly, but she did manage to make me her tea bitch in one more way at the end:

**TM:** ""You give free refills on iced tea, right? I don't need another of these, but I'll take a glass of regular iced tea."" 

I was ready to go home and not in any mood to fight her on it, so I just said sure. 

Final score: three tea bags and a glass of iced tea to the Tea Monster, $2.50 to the restaurant.

Week of July 4 madness, I guess.

So yesterday I worked the opening shift, meaning I'm alone for the first hour then joined by another waitress. A few tables of regulars came in during the first hour, including a bunch of older guys who like to sit at one of the tables in the corner and usually end up with anywhere from 5 to 7 people crowded around it. I put on my best chipper waitress routine for them and they were totally fine and happy.

The other waitress showed up and we got a nice little Monday lunch rush. I was pretty busy but I knew the guys liked to hang out so I didn't worry about them much, just checked in periodically to refill drinks and make sure they were ok. After their food came out, one of them flagged me down and asked for a pita (a lot of our food comes with pita bread, and a lot of people just want a couple pita). I said sure, ordered it up, jotted it down on my ticket with a 25 cent charge, the usual price for a single extra pita. 

Yadda yadda, they eventually get their bill and divvy it up amongst themselves and give me cash. Cool, I make change, give it back, tell them to have an awesome day, all is well. 

**UNTIL** they're leaving and I overhear the guy who asked me for the pita berating the **other waitress** because I ""charged him 75 cents for a pita and it's ridiculous and that pita was supposed to come with his meal and he's not coming back."" This guy is a regular who comes in with this group practically weekly. I go right over and ask what's up and he spouts the same thing at me. I politely explain that it was actually only 25 cents, that my handwriting probably made it look like 75 but I knew the price and would never charge 75 cents for a single pita - and also that I didn't realize it was a pita that was meant to come with his meal, I thought he was ordering an extra one, and **if he'd brought it to my attention when he saw the bill I would have taken it off immediately.** Bear in mind that this is only 25 cents we're talking about, but this guy is freaking out like I spit on his omelet. He doesn't want to hear anything I'm saying and keeps insisting that he's never coming back.

The happy ending is that one of the nice guys left something behind and called about it later; I happened to pick up, and after assuring him that we had his item and would save it for him, I asked him to relay to the other guy that I felt bad about the misunderstanding and would have happily fixed the mistake if he had told me about it. Phone guy sounded properly embarrassed about his friend's dickishness and told me not to worry about it.

But seriously, who acts like that? For one, it was 25 FREAKING CENTS. I know he thought it was 75, but even so. And if you see something on the ticket and think ""wait, that doesn't look right,"" FLAG ME DOWN AND ASK ME ABOUT IT. I was always available to them and would have corrected the error without batting an eye and it wouldn't have been an issue at all.

I work at a fine dining restaurant with a medium sized menu, and we get a ton of regulars and a lot of new guests every week. On this night, we happened to have onion rings as a complement to two of our dishes: The pork shoulder and the pork chop. Under no circumstance will the chef or the manager send out onion rings if they're not with one of those entrees. 

So a new couple sat at a table in the bar area and were pleasant enough, or so I thought. I went to take their drink orders, got them their wine and beer, and gave them a few more minutes to look over the menus. When I went to take their order, the woman got the scallops entree, and the man's order went like this:

Man: ""I'll take the ribeye, medium rare, and can I also get a side of onion rings?""
Me: ""Unfortunately sir, we don't serve the onion rings as a side. They come as a complement to a couple of our dishes.""
Man: ""Really? It's not possible? At all?"" 
Me: No sir, unfortunately. I can ask the chef for you, but I won't make any promises.""
Man: Ok, we'll just get a side of fries.""

So, at this point, I think all is well with the couple. I obviously didn't ask the chef or the manager if they could have onion rings, because I knew what the answer would be and it seemed the table didn't care. When I dropped the food off, I told them that I couldn't sneak away any onion rings for them. 

So, all goes seemingly well until the end of the meal, after they've paid and I hand them their check book back. I start to do my typical ""Thank you for coming in, I hope you enjoyed everything"" but was interrupted at the end with ""Actually, I was very dissapointed that I couldn't get onion rings.""

So, I repeated everything, that the chef will not send out onion rings unless it's on one of those two entrees. He looks visibly upset, for the first time that night, and tells me, this time with a little attitude, that he's ""never had a restaurant tell him he couldn't have something as a side that's on the menu.""

Now, I wanted to say that this isn't Applebees, this is a fine dining restaurant. But I didnt; I said ""I apologize for that sir, but there's nothing I can do. Have a great night"" and I walked away. I didn't want to get into an argument. I told my manager what happened, who also serves tables, and he just laughed.

Apparently the couple asked for a manager at the front door on their way out, and the same manager went to talk to them. He told them the same thing I did, and that ""If we did it for you, we'd have to do it for everyone."" They weren't happy.

Anyway, I just felt I'd share. I love working in a restaurant where the owner/managers/servers are allowed to say no. Our menu comes as is, and there are only a select few items you can substitute.

I had a couple come in yesterday before 11am, have three drinks (one Corona, two Malibu and whatever fruity). Honestly, I was like 'Godammit"" because I usually get another hour to sit on my ass and read the papers/play Scrabble. It was completely internal, my bosses are cool, I wouldn't give somebody even an inkling of a chance to complain. I just wanted to finish the crossword!

So they had their drinks, 45mins-ish. They needed no service apart from the second round, they were so wrapped up in shop talk. Very easy customers . He did call me ***fat*** for a tall girl, as a way to compliment his short future shortie.

Time to leave, verbal tip -'You're so awesome, we'll tell our friends!' No cash on the bar. The guy, who had paid for the three drinks, picked up his singles ($5) and counted them. Again, NO MONEY LEFT ON BAR and he counted his singles.

4 hours later he comes in with a different lady friend and asks for $2 in quarters. Count them out, and wait for him to hand me $2.

'No I need the change from the $5 bill I forgot earlier. $2 in quarters, the rest in bills.' What to do.... 

- No you purposely didn't tip me jerkface (and ahaha I would have gotten away with it, as I said the bosses are preeetttty cool).


- Give him back $5 and have my register short... fuck that, thank God I don't work in a chain/with managers answering to corporate.


- Be a pro, and more exactly, curious to see how much *more* b.s.. 'I'm sorry sir, I'm sure you meant to leave it, but as i recollect you checked and I've swept about the area. Mistakenly put it in your pocket? I appreciate the intention, anyway. Thank you.'

He reaches in his pocket, pulls out 75 cents, kind of scatters it on the bar, and tells me it's my tip from earlier, give him two more Malibu and fruity shit.

I. Am. Not. Scrambling. For. Quarters.

I **still** gave him a buyback. And a free shot (well, he asked for the shot - we give them when the home team scores. I guess he read the memo.)

So blah blah he's hitting on this chick, who if she had any smarts would have peaced out at a 75 cent tip. It's an old adage, but it's true - how they treat their server/someone they perceive as 'lower' is how they'll treat you. It's the reason why a lot of major corporations do dinner interviews.

No tip again. Came back 15 minutes later to sell me life insurance - 'low earning sectors are underrepresented.' LololololololNONONO

Look guys, one of the first thing it says on that handy little bar to your right is ""Be respectful.""  You may not agree with many things discussed in this subreddit. The one I'm seeing people complain about the most is tipping.  Yes, some of you either don't understand how tipping works or you just don't like that a tip is ""expected.""  Trust me, we get that. Some people just feel that way.   However, starting a giant circle jerk about it every chance you get is not acceptable.  This is a happy and friendly sub for servers to vent their frustrations as well as rejoice in what makes their job enjoyable.  
  
As mods, we love having more people join our sub. Nobody enjoys banning people. However, it's hard not to when you see the same people posting the (intentionally) flaming comments over and over again. 
  
Lastly, the other issue I've noticed would be the insults of people who deem themselves ""professionals"" and insinuate that because a server does not wear a suit and tie, he or she is not professional and is beneath them.  Everyone deserves respect.  Many servers are working through school.  Merely because they have a different job than you and you feel their job is less important than yours, does *not* make you better than them, nor them better than you.

They were looking to hire an entire staff, and me being unemployed jumped at the opportunity.  I went to the restaurant, interviewed, and got hired on the spot.  Pretty sweet, right?

Well, the whole thing has been a clusterfuck.  The restaurant was suppose to open July 7.  Then July 13.  Then July 15.  As of today I have no idea when its supposed to be open.  The general manager, who has never been a GM before, is ignoring the phone calls and emails of everybody trying to figure out what's going on.  Supposedly the health department has yet to inspect the place.  We still haven't trained on the POS system.  We still don't have menus.  This place is supposed to be fairly upscale, but half the servers have little to no experience.  I'm already regretting wasting my time on this 'job' and have started looking for another.

On top of all that shit, the GM announced that we wouldn't get our first paycheck for the work we did getting the restaurant ready until August 2nd.  State law says that you have to pay your employees at most every two weeks, and that the check must come within 5 days of the end of the period.  Which means that our first check should be given to us on the 15th of July.  I'd say something, but I'm kinda beyond caring right now.  If I actually get word that the restaurant is opening I might go in for a few shifts just to marvel at the inevitable chaos that's going to occur, but I've pretty much already written this place off in my mind.

So, my buddy is working at one of the nicest Italian restaurants in the city.  One night, he gets a group of 12, and they are awesome.  Cocktails, nice bottles of wine, 4 courses, just some serious diners going all out.

My buddy is obviously thrilled at the way things are going.  He has built a strong rapport with the host of the group, who is listening to every suggestion and ordering the best items on the menu.  My friend feels so good about the table, that he goes to the bartender and makes a bold prediction:

""I'm going to sell this whole fucking table Louie Trey.""

In case you are unaware of what the server meant by 'Louie Trey', he was referring to [Remy Martin Louis XIII Cognac](http://www.stupiddope.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/louis-xiii1.jpg).  A bottle retails for over $2000.  The empty decanter can be sold on eBay for $500+.  In his restaurant, it costs $250 a pop.

So, of course, the bartender smiled at my friend, admiring his pluck and remembering a time when he had such dreams of the 'perfect table'.  The bartender gave him a smirk that seemed to say, ""Awwww, that's cute, good luck with that"", but my buddy was undeterred.  

Dinner service ended and he passed out dessert and cocktail menus, making sure the host noted the extensive selection of after-dinner liqueurs.  

Before he could even walk away and allow them a moment to ponder, the host of the table shouted out his name, met his gaze, and said the words he had anticipated his entire server life:

""BRING US 12 SHOTS OF LOUIE TREY!""

My buddy was able to contain his excitement just long enough to reply ""Of course"" so cool that you'd have though the fucker just asked for an extra bev nap.  He quickly retreated to the POS and opened up the bar screen and began to press a button he had never pressed before.  

""Boop""  $250

""Boop""  $500

""Boop""  $750

""Boop""  $1000

""Boop""  $1250

""Boop""  $1500

""Boop""  $1750

""Boop""  $2000

""Boop""  $2250

""Boop""  $2500

""Boop""  $2750

""Boop""  $3000

Factor in the auto grat for the large party...that's $600.  $600 in addition to the already engorged dinner tab.  My buddy just made about $1000 on *one fucking table*.

He pressed 'send' and slinked over the the bar to see the bartender's reaction to the ticket.

So, the bartender gets the manager to unlock the case with the Louis, sets out 12 glasses, and gets his trusty jigger--at this price, you can't guesstimate, this ain't the SATs.  He begins, being careful not to spill the expensive nectar:

1...

2...

3...

4...

5...

6...

fuck...

7...

8....

fuckFuckFUCKFuckfuck!

They only have 8 full portions of Louis, and it's not exactly an item you keep a case of in the back.  You could try and split the 8 portions 12 ways, even reduce the price, but people are likely to get pissed if they just paid $2000 for what seems to be a pretty light pour.  

My buddy is panicking, imagining the host of the party cancelling the whole order and demanding the manager and wondering ""what kind of two-bit taverna are you running here and what the fuck is this auto gratuity? For this shitty restaurant with shitty service and no fucking fancy cognac for my esteemed guests?""  His payday is quickly slipping away.

Everyone turns and looks at the manager.  He takes a beat that feels like an hour, then makes his ruling.  He silently grabs a pint glass and starts pouring the shots into it, carefully, then pulls a bottle of Remy XO off the shelf.  A fine cognac at $30 a glass, but not Louis XIII.  But, desperate times call for desperate measures, so...he pours in 4 shots of XO and redistributes the cognac onto the 12 glasses.  Not a word was spoken.

My buddy is relieved, excited, a nervous wreck.  He returns to the table and silently sets the glasses down in front of each guest, hoping to avoid any inquiry about the 'suspect' nature of the stepped on cognac he is delivering.  He slinks back to the wait station, eyeing the host, thinking 'there is no fucking way this guy will be able to tell that drink is not all Trey...right?'  

He watches the host picks up the glass, still laughing at the conversation he is otherwise engaged in, raise the glass towards his nose...and makes a face like he just smelled horse manure.  He then says to the entire table, ""Whoa, whoa, don't drink this!  This isn't right.""  He shoots his eyes to my server friend and waves him over vigorously.  Oh, Jesus...

The guest: ""What is this?""

Server: ""Um, that's the round of Louie Trey you ordered...sir.""

Guest: ""Louie Trey?  What the hell is Louie Trey?""

Server: ""Um, cognac?""

Guest: ""No, I didn't order any Louie Trey--I said bring us 12 shots of *Cuarenta y Tres*.""

Wow.  That's right, he didn't want a $250 cognac--he wanted 12 shots of Licor 43; at $5 each, somewhat more affordable.

The manager, who had been standing at a short distance observing the proceedings, rushed over to my buddy, who is stunned, dejected, relieved, embarrassed, and a bit punchy.  The manager asks what happened and the server explains the misunderstanding, and chuckles at the turn of events.  The manager doesn't chuckle.

""Get. Those. Drinks. Off. The. Table.  NOW!""

Suddenly it clicks in--these folks are about to down $3000 in product they didn't want and won't pay for.  The server quickly rushes back to the table, apologizing for the error and snatching the precious liqueur from guests' hands before they can put their mouths in it.  He returns it all to the bar, where the manager then has to pour this 66% concoction of Remystein's monster back into the Louis XIII decanter.  Hey, it's not like you can throw it out, right?

The bartender, of course, finds this the funniest thing he's ever seen, and pours out the 12 shots of 43.  The table is happy that the disgusting swill they were erroneously served is gone and celebrate with a shot, not realizing they just turned down three grand worth of booze in exchange for some fruity vanilla shit that would cost them $20 a bottle at the liquor store around the corner.

On this particular Saturday, there'd been a show the night before and there was going to be one tonight, so we still had the flyers and buttons and stickers and what have you out where they would be for people to get them at the show. I was also wearing a pride shirt I'd made with a rainbow heart on it (which will be relevant soon) In the middle of an unexpectedly large lunch rush (think 20 minute wait for a two top--it was insane), these two older gentlemen came in, probably around mid 50s. I inform them of the wait and they say okay, and when I let them know that they should wait in the waiting area we have in the back (couches, board games, books, piano, coffee), they say ""No, that's alright, we'll just wait up here."" I could see that these were the types of people who probably wouldn't listen to me, I'm only 16 so we get a lot of customers who consider me unable to know what I'm doing and refuse to listen to me. Effectively, one of them is standing and blocking my counter while the other eventually wandered a bit towards the back. 

The man who stayed up front sees my shirt and asks me something along the lines of ""A rainbow, huh? Is that what the kids are into? Seems kind of gay to me,"" and when his friend comes back up towards the front he asks about the flyers in the back, asking if there's a ""Gay family member or somethin', seems ya got a lot of gay stuff back there."" I tell them we're having a benefit to support the Seattle queer youth, and they immediately seem offput. One of them asks ""Does that include you?"" and I tell him ""Indeed it does, sir,"" and he taps his friend on the shoulder and says ""Y'know, I think we better leave...""

All I could think as they left was that it was for the best, so I didn't have to kick them out. We have a low-tolerance policy for discrimination, and there was no way I was going to make any of my servers deal with these two.

Long time reader (and eater) first time poster here.  I wanted to share an experience I had today when I went to a local Hibachi restaurant for half price night. 

I was with three of my friends and we had a server who seemed pretty average, engaging, a little forgetful but I mean who isn't? So I was expecting to tip my regular 20% (before the 50% off) as I normally do. But right before she gave us the check she told us kind of a sob story and I wanted to get your opinion on what happened.

She came over and apologized for forgetting about us (which she didn't really) and said she had a really bad night and that a group of 4 teenagers had done the ole dine n dash leaving her to foot a $150 bill. She said she didn't get a good look at them and she has to pay the restaurant the whole bill herself and that she would probably end up in the negative for the night. First of all, do owners actually do this?

Anyway, I got my bill for $22 ($36 pre discount which was circled by the way) and me, feeling bad for the poor girl after she informed us that 1/2 of the tip we give her go to the hibachi chef, decided I would be generous, as I was planning on spending $50 that night anyway, so I left her a $50 bill and told her it was all set and that I hoped her night got better. She came back and said that I didn't have to do that, I insisted and she said she was going to cry, which she kind of did for all of 2 seconds.

So there I am feeling good, thinking I made this poor girls day when I noticed that all over the hibachi area of the restaurant that there were at least 10 cameras, arraigned so that no area was uncovered. It seemed strange to me that with all those cameras she couldn't get a good description of the people and that she would have to pay a $150 bill.

It was at that time that my friend happened to see a buddy of his working as busser (he also is a bartender but not tonight) and he asks him about the situation. Well his buddy said that she did have a really slow night and hadnt made a lot of tips. She also had a reservation of 8 and only 4 showed up so she lost out on that but she never got walked out on.

So now I feel that I got scammed and I guess I just wanted to share my experience with you. Do you guys as insiders feel like what she did was okay? Should I call the business tomorrow or should I give her the benefit of the doubt? I mean if what she said was true then I feel fine leaving a nearly 100% tip as I genuinely felt bad for her, but if she was scamming me then I feel like I should call the business and tell them what kind of server they have working for them. I guess I just don't know what I should do.

Edit: TL;DR: Waitress told us she got walked out on and has to pay $150 to the owners, gave her a 100% tip. My friend found out it was a lie, what should I do?

EDIT2: Okay guys here's an update: I just called and talked to a ""manager"" (probably an assist manager or something) who said that she absolutely lied to me and that she absolutely did not have a table walk out on her and in no way owed them $150 (which I mean how can 4 teenagers spend that much on half price night anyway?). She also looked up my bill in the computer, verified what I ordered. Turns out my prediscount total was $37 and it got reduced to $23 after the discount. Stupid me, paid in cash so there was no record of me leaving $50 but the manager definitely beloved me. The manager said in the computer she put that I left only a $4 tip.

So, I've been working steady as a barista for a good three months before I resigned, I essentially loved my job - it was a great place, great boss, good drinks. We not only handled the usual variations of espresso but smoothies among other things, alternating from that to going on the cashier post and chatting it up with customers make it all the better. It was overall a really great place and working there since it opened was a joy!

... And then the place gets famous, *fast*.

Now, I think we're all aware that once a place gets a huge flow of customers, not everyone you meet will be a pleasure to deal with. Over here because we kind of sold ourselves as an artsy-typed cafe, we have a tendency to deal with 'that guy'. You know, the pretentious, trying-to-hard-to-be-eloquent-and-artsy type people.

I have two instances of that during my course of work.

The first, is some coffee-savvy man that literally strides into the store, curly hair, fedora, shades he never seems to take off, skinny jeans, and checkered shirt, think hipster-type people. We greet him warmly with our usual ""welcome!"" and the man *nods* off, not even so much of a smile back. A bit of a pet peeve of mine but fine, he's not the only customer who does that and not all of them are bad news.

A good colleague and personal friend of mine manned the cashier, and the man went up to the counter and ordered an iced cappuccino.

So, barista fact!

**Iced Cappuccinos are either non-existent, or a bad idea.**

This is because the *foam* which cappuccino drinkers love so much has to be made apart from the cold milk that's used in the first place, it causes a lot of wastage of milk in the long run and the foam would also melt the ice almost instantaneously - ruining the refreshing drink and creating quite the ugly sight if I have to be honest.

Usually we're confronted with this order by customers and we politely tell them either how bad the drink is and/or suggest an iced caffe latte instead. 

This man scoffs and shouts ""Really!? No, I **want** my iced cappuccino."" banging on the counter and glaring daggers at my bud and myself, he eventually goes on to comment about how we 'don't know coffee' and is a 'disgrace to the coffee community'. I quietly walk up to my already flaring friend and whispered ""No worries, I'll do it,"".

My friend knew our boss was lurking around and it's really not right of us to stray from the menu, he was a bit hesitant to follow until our boss walks up to him and gives him the okay, charges the same price as a caffe latte.

Our boss then walks up to me, smiles, reaches down into the fridge and passes me some *old* milk that we usually use for frothing training for the newer baristas. The milk isn't bad per se but it gives off a really awkward, texture when drinking it because it's been pulled before. He then says ""Go ahead, froth it."" And froth it I did.

So we then served the iced cappuccino to the man, his face full of triumphant confidence that he showed us what's what. Takes a couple of sips, and comes back to the counter, requesting to change it to a caffe latte. We smiled back and we told him ""Sorry sir, you might need to pay for that,"" and he did, face red and suddenly very quiet. Our team laughed about it for the longest time during after hours.

I work in the restaurant, which also has a bar area where fussy middle aged ladies convene for coffee and gossip.

Today I had my first encounter with our infamous customer, the ""two cup coffee lady"". For background: we serve cafetiere coffee which you can get for either one person (has one cup's worth) or two people (has two cup's worth). Pretty simple to most people, but not to this lady.

Lady: ""Hello, yes I'd like a cafetiere coffee for one please...but can you make sure that it makes two cup's worth because I've had that problem here before.""

Me: ""Sure no problem, I'll get you a cafetiere for two so you definitely get your two cups!"" 

Lady: ""No no that's not what I want. I want it for one person but I want two cups of coffee out of it.""

Me: ""...........I think the one person cafetieres only make one cup?"" (I don't think this, I know this with certainty because I work with these things every flipping day)

It's now becoming a very middle-class stand off. Our smiles are getting fixed and suddenly she cracks.

Lady: ""Oh for goodness' sake, I ALWAYS have this problem here. Nowhere else seems to be this difficult. Please just get me what I've asked for.""

I realise that she's not going to back down on this. So after consulting my manager (a massive pushover), for the sake of my sanity and my job I fetch her a 2 person cafetiere but only charge her for the price of the 1 person.

As I bring it over she sees the larger size and starts to object but I cut her off, smile sweetly and say ""I've only charged you for the 1 person"".

She looks smug and proceeds to enjoy her two cups of coffee for the price of one.

I later find out from other staff that she comes in every month or so, does the same ridiculous song and dance and frustrates everyone so much that it's not even worth arguing with her.

I was there over a year and corporate hires a new GM.  I had worked with Bill when he was a server on three occasions.  He was a damned good server, and would clean post shift like nobody's business.  Now he has trained at another restaurant as GM and swooped in to take over our restaurant.

He arrives vested in his new power and has a pre-shift meeting with servers and kitchen.  I manage to miss a lot of these meetings because I catch the transferred tables from am shift closers.  The meetings that I do catch feature him singling me out as a great seller of booze (I drink, so I do a good job upselling liquor) and riding me about earring size (earrings which passed policy not a week before he started).  

I do my best to please authority figures, and even though I have the best sales and the best customer service feed back and never throw the kitchen under the bus, Bill rides me like Sea Biscuit.  He nit picks everything I do, and gives gentle guidance to the rest of the staff for the most part. 

I do not understand what I have done wrong.  I have waited tables at a variety of restaurants for ten years and I earned the sweetest shifts - Tuesday through Saturday, four to close.  I make a hundred dollars a night in the bible belt in a small town.  I do great work and pay attention to detail.  I apologized to his face the one time I knew my attitude was out of line and told him I would be more professional from that time forward.  Bill still stays on me like stink on shit.

It got to the point that I felt physically ill when I pulled into the parking lot due the anxiety of anticipation of his onslaught.  I was so happy when he was needed at another restaurant and my old GM was transferred back.  I confessed to her all the things I had seen, heard, and felt.  She gave me hug and told me that she would do all she could for me.  She wasn't a real straight shooter, but she wasn't looking to fire me or get me in trouble, so I was grateful she was back.

No discipline from management.,82,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1fjum4/lazy_coworker_who_is_potentially_stealing_from/," I work at a small pizza place as a server. I make 3.25 per hour plus tips. On weekends we typically have a server and a phone person for carryout and deliveries. The server clocks in at 3.25, while the phone person makes minimum wage. If we happen to get too busy for the one server to handle it, the phone person will clock in at a server's pay and start taking tables.

I've been having some issues with my coworker, who will will call Sandy for awhile. To put it frankly, she is too slow to handle rushes, so she is frequently put on phones. However she will try to steal tables when the server's back is turned as much as possible, even though she is making minimum wage and should not be getting tips. She also will do little tiny things for my tables, without me asking for or needing her help, and then demand half of my tip. She will clean my tables as soon as they leave, again without me asking, and there is never a tip left on those tables.

Awhile back I had a regular come in who usually leaves a generous tip. She wiped the table, he apparently left nothing. I have seen him multiple times since and he has always tipped since. I am 99% sure she is stealing my tips. Some have recommended asking the regular about it, but I would feel uncomfortable bringing a customer into the situation.

We have had many more issues with her as well. She stands around talking her entire shift, then when closing time comes around she has no side work done. Many nights the manager and/or cook has to help her close. MY manager told me she has been stuck there until 1AM with her on a Sunday night (which are extremely slow, and we close at 10PM). We believe she may do this on purpose to get more hours.
She has had multiple complaints from customers about everything to messing up orders to having a rude tone. If she is taking a phone order and a dine in customer walks in, she will put the customer on the phone on hold in the middle of their sentence so another server doesn't ""steal her table"". Money has gone missing from registers multiple times during her shifts. 

I am tired of nothing being done about these issues. I have talked her. At first I was very polite, more recently I'll admit I have gotten aggressive, but I do not appreciate people stealing from me and my coworkers. My manager is an extremely wonderful person. However she is too nice for her own good, and will not discipline her employees. I talked to her about these issues, and she said Sandy must be caught stealing before she can be terminated. I understand this, but are the rest of these issues not something she should be disciplined over? She has had at least six customer complaints that I know of, and she hasn't even worked there for a year. I do not know what to do anymore, I have talked to management and her as well. The last time she tried this with me, I made it no way unclear that she is not to take my tables, clean my tables, or even speak to my customers and I will not be giving her any part of my tips because of these problems. Since then I have not had as much of an issue when I work with her, but she is still taking advantage of my coworkers who are reluctant to speak up. 

EDIT: I remembered one more issue I forgot to put in here, and had some formatting problems. We have a salad bar. Each item must be flipped into a fresh container every night. She only flips the ones she thinks ""needs it"". She also NEVER checks expiration dates on items for the salad bar. I have come in after a few days off to find that literally everything is expired, yet it is on our salad bar and people are eating it. I try my best to stock up and make sure everything is fresh when I work but I am not there everyday. I really fear someone is going to become very sick because of her.

The other night I went to a famous all-night diner in my city with some friends for some delicious hippie hash and were faced with a bunch of high schoolers fresh out of their prom. There was one waitress and one cook and they looked annoyed as hell. For the most part the kids left them alone...until three others walked in. I was outside having a smoke with a friend and when we came back in these fuckers were sitting in our seats, with one bitch looking at my phone and purse in disgust, loudly asking ""WHOSE SHIT IS THIS?"" The waitress politely asked her to get out of our seats and the girl literally sneered at her. I was by the girl's shoulder at this time, and while at 5'4 I'm not particularly intimidating, se hastily made her retreat when I hissed ""fucking MOVE"" in her ear.

The three teens decided they wanted to make an order. The waitress told them three times they needed to do it at the register but they kept interrupting her to tell her what they wanted. It was two AM and I had enough of this bullshit. I literally shouted at them. ""OVER THERE. SHE SAID OVER THERE. ORDER THERE."" They stared at me and the guy hastily moved to the register to order. I went for another smoke (one thing I need to work on is my excessive smoking...damn you kitchen work for introducing me to sweet sweet tobacco) and the two teen girls came out to illegally smoke, not seeing me lurking behind a tree. The one screeched with laughter and said ""that waitress is such a fucking cunt! Is that fat bitch (me) her girlfriend or something?"" I finished my smoke and walked right past them, saying nothing, only to hear them laugh again. They came back in and decided suddenly to pick at their boxed up food at the counter. I exchanged looks with our waitress and she looked like she honestly hated her life right then. She wanted these skanks out but couldn't say anything. So I did. I exploded.

I can't remember exactly what I said, as I was drunk, but it had something to do with getting STDs, never calling hard working people cunts in their own restaurants, and getting out before I peed on everything they loved. Those bitches fled, and the waitress gave me my meal for free. So I tipped her what the meal would've cost and fifty percent because fuck prom.

( why I hate Free Pie Wesnesday)",87,13,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1awmaa/no_sir_we_do_not_have_any_mustard_why_i_hate_free/,"So, I am a relatively new server at a sit-down restaurant whose claim to fame is its 'Free Pie Wednesday' (actual name of special withheld) it is absolutely the worst night of the week. The special is basically this: order something off of our menu, even a drink that is not water, and you get a free slice of pie. How corporate can afford this is beyond me, but that is a rant of another sort completely. 

I arrive to a madhouse, which is a main occurrence in this specific day of the week. Don't even ask me why, but on this particular night, of all nights, we were not working in sections. (WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?!?) so it was even more hectic than it needed to be, with servers being sat all over the dining room. But I digress.

Since i am sort of new, I often get stuck with the regulars who we really wish were not regulars. (You know the type.) right before I get on the floor, my GM is in a fit because the day shift threw away all of our mostly empty mustard bottles, leaving us with no mustard, on a freakin' WEDNESDAY. (Typical of day shift, but not the point here)

Right away, I am triple sat, and I can tell something's up because part of the senior staff hands away a regular to me eagerly.

I go to greet the older gentleman who is dining alone. Usually, I have no problems when I serve our many senior citizens who come here, but this guy...

Right away we were off to a bad start by his body language and lack of eye contact at first. I tried to be as cheerful as possible and treat him as I would any customer.

""Hello sir, how are you this evening? My name is outrageoushamster and I'll be your server..."" (Blahblahblah you know the rest of the script)

He barked out ""Coffee, black! No creamer, you got that?""

""No problem sir, I can get that for you right away. Have you already decided what you will be having, or do you need a few?""

""I just sat down! Jeez! An this table's still wet!"" ( points to slightly damp table that was cleaned specifically for him because he 'always sits here')

"" I'm sorry I will dry it for you as soon as I can.""

Then I go to get my drink orders for my other tables to save me a trip or two. Now, the thing I hate most about my place of employment (aside from rolling silverware) is that when someone orders coffee, we have to bring them a whole pot of coffee, a mug, a small glass of water, compote full of little liquid creamer packs, and of course, a straw. Add a few other coffee orders to that, plus other drinks; and that small tray can get really heavy. Plus we have to pour their coffee into their cup while its still on the tray. 

I must have miscounted my mugs or something, because of course, I was short one mug for this man. I drop off the coffeepot, and water, apologize, and tell him I will return with his mug. ( of course I didn't forget to dry his table) he grumbled grouchily a little, but otherwise no complaints. I come back a few minutes later to take his order. He could not be more condescending if he tried. He was telling me slowly as if I were stupid, and made all these frivolous alterations to his simple order. When I asked him if I could get anything else for him, he shouted ""yeah, you can give me my damn coffee mug! I've been sitting here with all this coffee and no cup!"" Embarrassed, I apologize. It totally slipped my mind while I was running around for my other tables. I then ask him if he would like any condiments, and among his long list he tells me, he includes ketchup and mustard. Of course, he was the only customer with a problem with the fact we did not have any mustard at all.

""Whaddya mean you don't have any?""

"" I'm sorry, but my managers and coworkers told me we are all out.""

""Unbelievable! Go check the back or something!""

"" I will check one more time sir, but I am pretty sure we are totally out.""
He grumbled more, so I left him to cool off a bit before his meal came out. When I was grabbing his mug, I stopped to ask my GM what I should tell this customer as he was very upset. My GM just took one glance at the table and told me "" oh just ignore him. He's a bitter old man with nothing to do but degrade other people. Let him bitch. There's nothing you can do about it.""

Later, when i returned with his meal, he again asked for mustard. I told him that I was sorry, but we were definitely out.

""Ridiculous! How could you be out! Can't you just walk across the street to (insert name of mega brand superstore) and get some for me?""

I just kind of held back a chuckle of irritated disbelief and looked around at our VERY busy restaurant.

""I'm sorry sir, but I cannot do that for you.""

""Sure you can! It's right there!""

""Sir if you haven't noticed, we are extremely busy and we are right in the middle of our dinner rush. I'm sorry, but I cannot abandon my other tables to get mustard for you.""

""Unbelievable!"" More grumbling.

At this point, I was done reasoning with him, and instead Asked him how his pancakes were. ""Very good, you can leave now"" (waves hand dismissively) 

I left him to eat in peace for the remainder of his meal as it was clear he wanted nothing to do with me.

Finally, he was at the front desk paying for his meal about 45 minutes later. I happened to be nearby, and heard him comment to the cashier; ""boy! Everything went wrong today!"" All the cashier said was/ "" yeah, well it's Wednesday."" And then he left with his damn free piece of pie.

He was the rudest, most entitled, frustrating customer I've ever had to deal with. 
TLDR; mean old man orders me to go across the street to buy mustard specifically for HIM after I tell him multiple times that we are all out.

One of the servers I work with has a boyfriend and two of his friends that like to come in when she is working, but rarely sit in her section.  The problem, you ask?   Well last Sunday they sat in my section for over 2 HOURS  and drank coffee while we had a very visible wait at the door for this entire time.  The icing on the cake was that they left me $2.  I was pretty pissed that they took up a table this long, causing me to essentially lose money.  

Now all of us know that this happens.  It's part of the job.  What is so infuriating is that they deliberately sit in a section other than the one guy's girlfriend so that SHE still gets tables and makes money.

We were there probably two hours, maybe a little more, and our server was absolutely amazing.  It was a combination of little things - drink refills whenever we needed them or even looked close, patience when we took forever to order, and no complaints or dirty looks when we sat there sipping our soda/coffee for a bit after we finished our meal (usually I can tell they're itching for us to get out of there).  

Combine that with the constant smile on her face, and it made for a wonderful ending to an extremely stressful morning.

I'd handle all of the to-go orders up front, and I was darn good at it. A guy called to order 5 personal-sized pizzas (which could feed 1-2 people each). We would also give out our award-winning delicious focaccia bread with each order. Our standing policy was to give one (generously sized 7-8"" round) loaf per 3 entree orders. The idea was that if you ate at the restaurant, you'd be served a loaf of bread and share with your whole table. Extra bread could be purchased for $3 a loaf to go.

Well the guy gets in to pick up his order and about loses his mind. Per our policy, I have included one loaf of bread. Instead of asking for an extra loaf nicely, he proceeds to yell at me (probably 16 or 17 years old at the time) saying ""I AM FEEDING MY WHOLE FAMILY! I NEED MORE BREAD TO GO WITH MY PIZZA PIE!""

My thoughts- 1. Why are you yelling? I don't even- 2. ...you're not from around here... are you.. Pizza pie? 3. If you need more food, order more. Don't depend on a restaurant giving you free items to eat. 4. This is a nice restaurant... if you are hard up on money, maybe go somewhere else.

So I calmly explained our policy. At this point, he still has not asked if he can have another loaf of bread, he has only yelled that he needs more. I am used to kind and well-tipping regulars, and am not inclined to acquiesce to some jerk who feels entitled to yell at a stranger about bread. Our manager steps in.

The guy proceeds to complain about his pizza pie / bread ratio, and immediately shifts to a more demanding position. For his great injury, he demands a steak.

Manager tells him some variation of 'no way.'

This was the only time I've ever met the 'yell and scare people' type of bully, and it is still baffling to me. Pizza pie... psshhh

I worked almost any job in the restaurant, but usually I was scheduled as a hostess or server assistant. One day, a Saturday I believe, I was working a double shift, 11-4 as a hostess and 4:30-11 as a server assistant. As a hostess, I wore a red shirt and as a server assistant I wore a black shirt. So at 4 I went on a break to change shirts and smoke before I began my next shift. As soon as I got back in, I picked up my bus tray and got right back to work. Now at the time, I weighed about 90 lbs and these trays are bigger than me and weighed just about as much as I did when full, so 6 1/2 hours of this after already working all morning usually put me in a bad mood. So I'm cleaning tables when I notice a couple, who had come in while I was still on my other shift, calling me over to their table. The conversation went something like this:

Lady: ""How long have you been working today, miss?""
Me: ""Since we opened this morning, ma'am.""
Lady: ""Weren't you a hostess a few minutes ago?""
Me: ""Yes, ma'am, but I've started my second shift now.""
Lady: ""Well, it looks like you deserve this then.""

She hands me 2 twenty dollar bills. At this point, I'm completely stunned because I have no idea why she's giving me this, I haven't even helped her as they had sat in the bar area where the hostess does not have to sit customers. I collect myself and tell her thank her profusely. She just simply responds, ""Merry Christmas, young lady."" 

This just made my day and nothing else that the horrible place I was working at did could kill my mood for the rest of the night. I never saw the couple again, but I think about them every holiday season for being so kind to me when I needed it most.

Four days in, I closed the place last night and the male manager stayed to help me with deposit and tip-out procedure, which was really helpful. after closing we sat to chat and have our shift drink. I had a sake and we talked about the restaurant for a while, he insisted that I try two other sakes off the list so I'd have some to recommend (red flag?). He offered me a ride so I wouldn't have to walk alone at night while tipsy, and he ended up driving to a bar near my house instead(red flag take two).

At the bar, he asked me on a date. I said it was a bad idea since I work for him and dont want the workplace drama. Boss tried to convince me otherwise by forcefully kissing me and inviting me to go on a three day vacation to the beach with him (woah!). I was drunk in an unfamiliar bad neighborhood at 1 am, so I tried to be nice and just get my damned ride home, while still saying 'no way!'. In the cruel light of morning I'm afraid I wasn't straight up enough to solve the problem.

since I'm the new closer Im sure we'll have more nights locking up alone, and I'm already so so uncomfortable. he could make life terrible and I dont know him well enough to judge if he'll be a vindictive asshat or not. Should I just quit and start looking again? should I talk to him about it in private and hope its not awkward as hell? I haven't met the owner yet and don't have his number, but I could find it I'm sure, I just don't know that it would go in my favor. help!

**edit** - thanks so much for the excellent advice everyone, this was a great resource for me. I feel loads better having done something!

I emailed the owner today and told him the story. He responded immediately thanking me for coming to him and promising to handle 'the situation'. He said the company in no way condones this sort of behavior, so I take that to be a good sign that something might actually be done. I'll finish out the weekend shifts I'm already scheduled for (though I am completely willing to walk out if he's being a fool) and then probably quit so I can stop thinking about this. I'll report back this weekend and let you guys know how it all turns out.

****edit take two!**** alright, home from my first shift since this incident, and everything went great. Manager was sitting outside meeting with the owner when I got to work today, so I went in through the back and avoided that. the story is that he was let go before dinner today after a meeting last night discussing what happened among the staff, many of whom came out with awkward or inappropriate encounters that they'd had with him. apparently other servers had decided to quit with me if he wasn't fired. he might work another couple shifts (without his manager privileges) while they work out his replacement, but never closing alone again, and no longer than a week. I spoke to the owner who wanted to make sure that I understood what was happening and that I was ok with the guy still being around. I said something along the lines of 'I ain't scared"", and that was that. got a lot of reassuring hugs from all my co-workers, rocked the Friday shift and made a bunch of money - life is good! thanks again, everyone.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1371885433.0,,,True,t3_1gqlfo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1gqlfo/foh_problems_sexual_harassment_style_xpost_from/,

Apologizes for the wall of text that follows.

	
I worked as a buser, now a waiter for two summers, and will more than likely be going to work for a third. The restaurant is located along a busy shoreline, and we have gotten all sorts of customers: Tourists from Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and then the standard traffic from out of state and locals. The job was enjoyable, the hours were semi-long, but full time waiters and bartenders made $400-$500 on a good week, bussers around $200-300. The restaurant has three floors, the second floor main restaurant and a small bar, the ground floor with a large bar area and smaller restaurant area, and the basement where we store food, alcohol and dry supplies, as well as our management office. Anyway, I’m going on too much about this place, let’s get to why you’re here.

	
One particularly busy night, I was working as a buser during the night shift. As me and two other busers were cleaning the second floor of the restaurant, our boss was in the basement, tallying banks and cash totals from today’s service. Next to him is our security system monitor, feeding video from about 12 cameras located through the restaurant. In addition to the cameras, we employ a private security “detail” consisting of ex-cops. On the weekends, we’ll have one upstairs and another downstairs, generally walking around and talking to everyone from management to customers. As our boss is counting money, he notices someone upstairs, reaching over the bar counter, stashing away a bottle of liquor under his shirt. “Oh hell no”, my boss (whom we’ll refer to as Mike from now on) thinks. Mike locks his office up and hurries to the ground floor bar.


Dumbass, our thief, is still at the downstairs bar, talking to friends. Their conversation goes like this:


**Mike**: “So… what do you think you’re doing?

**Dumbass**: “Uh.. nothing. Just enjoying the bar.”

**M**: “Don’t play retarded, give the bottle back.”

**D**: “….”


At that point, Dumbass books it to the front of the restaurant, running outside onto the boardwalk. Mike tries to give chase, but being a heavy smoker, fails to keep up. He screams at the local police, “HEY, do you see what’s happening here?” and in response give him a dumb look at first before seeing the fleeing thief, so they give chase as well. Our downstairs “detail” soon gives chase as well, wondering what all the commotion was.


Dumbass throws the bottle of alcohol back at the group chasing him, nearly hitting Mike and the cops. Dumbass then runs into a waiting car, being driven by his girlfriend. One of the cops almost manages to grab Dumbass, but the car takes off, nearly hitting the officer in the process. We’ll probably never see him again, right?


Wrong.


As I’m told from Mike, two hours later, Dumbass turns himself in at the police station, having shit his pants. Yes. He literally shit his pants. I walk downstairs after I finish my cleaning duties to see Mike and the “detail” laughing about what happened earlier, and they retell the story. So, what about that bottle of alcohol? Turns out Dumbass was pretty cheap, having stolen a bottle of house Vodka, which costs my boss only $8.75.

",90,16,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/18wi8w/totally_messed_up_when_corporate_was_in_and_the/,"This happened a little bit ago but I felt like sharing. 

My restaurant was doing a promotion, so naturally we were slammed. People from corporate pretty much always come when we are doing a promotion so that they can walk around and talk to customers, offer them free shakes, and get them to want to come back to eat again. 

The way my restaurant runs we have those locators on tables, and you order at a register (similar to noodles and co.). Occasionally the locators get moved around or people misuse them, but I usually can figure out by the types of orders and how many people there are. Example: Big plate and two kids plates is probably going to the guy with two kids even though the locator says it is at a table for five buff guys. 

Anyway I walk the plates to the table the locator said the food went to. There were three people missing from the table who were using the restroom before their meal. The remaining people at the table told me that those orders were most likely their friends, and to just put them down wherever and their friends could sort it out later. I knew something was off, primarily because there was no ticket for that order on the table, but three plates=three people, right? 

I set the food down and saw the ticket number on a different table on my way back. I immediately realized my mistake and panicked. Rather than get the manager I decided to go back, grab the plates, and bring them to the right table. The guy abosolutely flipped out and started yelling about how they touched the food and diseases and how unprofessional that is. 

Honestly, he was right. I messed up. 

IT just sucked cause I had to sit down with corporate and my manager a second and apologize and look like a fucking idiot, because we are supposed to announce the name/what the meal is and be positive that the order goes to the table. 

They ended up giving the guy a full refund and a $20 gift card and we both apologized. 

**TL;DR Version**- I bring food to the wrong table and get told it belongs to their friends who are at the restroom. I put the food down and realize it was supposed to go somewhere else. I was afraid to tell the guy he would have to wait another 15 minutes and didn't want the kitchen to get mad at me (they were swamped) so I gave him the food that was on the other people's table. He freaked out about them touching it and how it was unprofessional, all while corporate was there, and they had to over-comp him and I don't think they got the best impression from me.

In my 8 years of serving this had only happened once before and that was a good story in itself.  Needless to say I was shocked to get a phone call complaint, but it turns out they straight made up everything that went wrong. They claimed they found a hair in their salad and told me about it, to which I did nothing and just left it on the table (in reality they boxed it up to go). They asked to speak to a manager to which I told them no. Plus they claimed they tipped me still whilst we clearly have the credit card slip reading 0. I'm a pretty good server, and my manager promptly told them they were full of crap because she knows I in particular would NEVER have done any of those things. 

My only other complaint was nice because I managed/served at this restaurant. I served the night before, and managed the next night.

He was tending bar yesterday afternoon and a gentleman sits down at the end of the bar and orders a cosmo, but not very sweet, so with maybe half the triple sec/Cointreau and half of the cranberry juice.

Well fiance accidentally over-poured the cranberry, realized his mistake while making it (he was doing this at the other end of the bar from the guy), poured it into a high ball, and made a fresh one to spec.  After delivering the drink to his guest, the guy comments, ""oh, looks like you messed the first one up!""
Fiance: ""Yeah, I accidentally poured a little too much cranberry in the first one but made a new one to your liking.""
Guy: ""Well let's see how you did, bring it here!""
I guess he was saying how he was a regular (first tip-off) and seemed to be a rather convivial dude, so fiance brought it over for him to taste.
Guy: ""Oh yeah, definitely too much cranberry!""
So fiance reaches back over to dump it in the sink, but instead,
Guy: ""Oh no, you messed that one up, so it's mine now!"" And knocks it back in one gulp. -_-

Poor fiance didn't quite know how to react to that one, and didn't say anything about it.  I personally wouldn't have let him try it in the first place, but our restaurant (well his, but I worked there for a quarter of my life so it will always be ours) very much has the ""the guest is always right"" (yes, guest, not customer) philosophy, and really try not to say no to anybody.

They ordered a coffee and a juice and took a look at the menu. She informed me that her son had a nut allergy and if anything was cross contaminated then he couldn't have it. I was one of the managers so I was aware of the cross contamination issues, and luckily, we had gotten a delivery from our bakery that morning and our bakery will specifically mark things that are nut-free and not made with anything or on any machinery that has touched any kind of nut. I tell her that it should be okay and that I will double check the packaging from the bakery to make sure there isn't an issue. 

So her and her son look over the menu and decide that they just want some sweets. She orders a cinnamon coffee cake and orders him a chocolate peanut butter brownie. I say: ""Well if he has a nut allergy, you might want to think about something else, because the brownie is made with peanut butter and has chopped peanuts in the batter."" She looks at me like I just slapped her. She then rips into me: ""Don't you tell me what I should order for my son! He's my son, not yours! And peanuts are NOT nuts! Do you even understand English?!"" (I was 21 and lived in USA my whole live) so I say ""okay, ma'm, if that is what you want, then I'll bring it right out."" So I bring them their food and have someone take over my table because my shift was over (only had the one). I warned the next server who told me the next day that they paid their bill quickly and left after eating everything. I hope the little kid was okay. 

EDIT: As some of you have pointed out, peanuts are not true nuts, but everyone that I know that has a nut allergy is highly allergic to peanuts and peanut butter. I figured the mother knew that the peanut butter brownie had nuts in it, but I didn't want to run the risk of a possible lawsuit against the company if it turns out he was deathly allergic to peanuts.

I swear on my Reddit account this story is true. I couldn't make this up, I'm not that creative. It is told with as few flourishes as possible, and is written with all fondness for these fine people. While in the moment I hated life (as did every other server who came in contact with them), I often think back to our encounters and have a good belly laugh. Of all restaurant guests I've ever served, these were the cream of the crop.

Context:
I worked at a single-location greasy spoon diner in a small town while I was in school. I had been there at least 6 months at my first encounter with these people, and worked there for another 2 years after.

My favorite worst customers were semi-regulars at the diner. The blew in with the winter wind one day, and while that sounds like the beginning of a poetic narrative, they were so frail they really pretty much floated in. They both look at least 90 years old if they ever were a day, and they sat themselves in a secluded booth about an hour before closing on a Friday. I have a soft spot for the older and wiser, so seeing two obviously senior citizens out so late warmed my heart. Thinking they'd just stopped in for a milkshake or a piece of pie, I volunteered to serve them. We only had a few other tables in the restaurant at that time, and I knew the other server was eager to leave for the night.

I approached the table with menus, water, straws, and silverware, and greeted them. Before I could ask any questions, the man interjected ""I don't need a straw, I drink my water like a cowboy!"" I asked if they would like anything to drink, but they just opened their menus and started poring over them, noses nearly touching the pages. I quickly deduced that they were hard of hearing, as they began shouting at each other about the menu offerings. Since they didn't show any interest in my presence, I excused myself by saying I'd give them a minute to look things over. Calling attention to myself was my first mistake.

We'll refer to these customers as Jerry and Lil' Mama. Jerry turns to me and shouts ""what have you got that's easy to chew?"" Surprised by the unusual request, I tried to think quickly on my feet. ""Well, we serve breakfast all day, so maybe pancakes or eggs."" Every time I opened my mouth after that moment, it was interrupted by Lil' Mama shouting ""JERRY! WHAT'S SHE SAYIN'?"" Jerry made a point of ignoring her, which made her all the more determined to be heard. Jerry shouted ""WE DON'T WANT BREAKFAST, WE JUST GOT NO TEETH!!!"" Jerry then began reading the menu aloud to me, audible to the whole restaurant. The other employees were kind enough to back me up on my other tables at this point. Somehow Lil' Mama deduced that Jerry was ordering, but making a show of it, and changed her tune from ""What's she sayin'?"" to squawking ""JERRY!! Just tell the girl what you WANT!!""

After at least 5 minutes of this, I finally offered a bowl of chili and grilled cheese, which both showed enough interest in that I just left. Keep in mind, this was to their benefit, as the kitchen was closing up as they were speaking. I ran back and put in their order and tried to help finish up my other customers and work on restaurant closing tasks.

Grilled cheese doesn't take long when it's the only order going into the kitchen and the staff are eager to leave, so I brought them their meals and hoped to get some peace for a moment while they ate. To the contrary, they wanted to make small talk while their food cooled. They asked about me, including my name. I was wearing a name tag, but I assume they couldn't read it because of their vision difficulties. ""misswigit, that's a nice name. Our daughter used to work with a misswigit across town in 1972."" Insert long, nonsensical oratory about someone who may have had my same name 40 years prior. Turns out telling them my name was my second mistake.

I eventually convinced them to eat and tried again to get back to my closing duties, as it was about 20 minutes before closing at this point. Every couple minutes I would hear ""MISSWIGIT! WE NEED (fill in the blank- ketchup, pickles, sugar, crackers, many of which were on the table anyways)."" If I didn't respond immediately, they would either just yell it again or shout ""WHERE'S MISSWIGIT?!"" A few requests in, Lil' Mama asks for a takeout container for her meal, even though it looks like all she's managed to do is get chili on the hairs growing out of her chin. I thought they were leaving, so I took them the check, but Jerry insists he's going to finish his whole meal then and there. He'd barely made a dent and it was closing time, but we still had cleaning and prep to do, so I told him to take his time. This was my most fatal mistake.

Jerry and Lil' Mama DID take their time, Jerry DID finish his dinner. He called me over to check it so he could show me that he'd LITERALLY licked the plate clean. This took until about an hour after closing, partly because of all the times they ""needed"" this or that. I guess it pays to be completely deaf, because Lil' Mama sat there watching Jerry, occasionally trying to make conversation that literally fell on deaf ears, eventually falling asleep in the booth.

When Jerry went up to the cash register to pay, he made like he was going to hand me the bill and some cash, but snatched it away at the last second and said ""Now don't smudge the ink, I just printed these dollars a minute ago."" I took their payment, thanked them, sent them on their way, and then went to clean the table. My tip was exactly one dollar, folded into a tepee and balanced over Jerry's water cup.

Jerry and Lil' Mama were sporadically regulars after that, and every time was about the same with a few hilarious differences. The REAL story, if you want it, would be about the night I had to ask them to leave and not come back (still one of the saddest and happiest moments of my serving career), but I'll save that for another time.

I quit my last gig, and I'm starting the search next week. I have been working in restaurants for a long time. I would rather be doing something else, but times are tough, and it helps pay the bills. So, with all that said, I have some stories from the years that I have decided to start depositing here.It is also a form of catharsis.  This is one from my last gig.

I have found that some of the worst restaurants are affluent suburban casual dining places. Lots of kids, lots of attitude, not so much money, because these people are mostly pretending they are important and have money to waste, or maybe they do, and they're just assholes. 

The restaurant can only be described as a clusterfuck. No expo, no food runner, make your own desserts, make your own salads, toast bread for every table, carry tickets to the kitchen, verbally call for tables to be fired, and no tickets or organization in the window. The system is set up for mistakes, and the owner claims ""it works"" when you point out flaws in the system. Also, the hostesses are 16 year olds working their first jobs with no experience, or training. No idea of a rotation, so your entire section gets filled up at once, while the rest of the restaurant is empty.

edit: just to be clear :Every table gets bread that must be smothered in garlic and olive oil, sliced, placed in the oven, and taken out by the server. Every entree comes with a salad that the server has to make. 


I can handle tables. I have been doing this a long time. Too long. This place...you were always in the weeds with all the shit you had to do. 
So I have a 6 table section. Shouldn't be that big of a deal....well it is here. 

I get 2 tables, then 4 sat all at the same time...so now this is the groove through the Friday rush. I botched an order (chicken on a salad, instead of salmon). It happens, and I had two other chicken salads on different tables, rung in at the same time. Easy mistake, and I own it. I apologize, and the lady just lays into me. Raises her voice so everyone can hear her, and starts railing me about how i'm terrible, at my job, I need to get it together, I've ruined her night, she has *never* had this happen before. Fine. you're pissed. She repeats this every time I go to the table, to refill water, ask if they're okay...etc. I told the manager she was fucking crazy, and sent him over. They got a free round of drinks, but she kept it up all night. One of my other tables comments, ""what a fucking bitch. I'm sorry you have to deal with folks like that."" Not everyone is an asshole. I get a $4 tip, on a $70 tab from the salad couple...which covers my tip out, and I fucked up so, it is, what it is. 

The restaurant is always one small event away from a meltdown, so the night trucks along, and begins to wind down. 

I get double sat....again. No big deal, after getting sat 4 at a time with all the shit I have to do at this place...it's fine at this point. I can catch my breath a little. 

I take the orders serve the food. Make sure everyone is cool. ""Yes, everything is fine."" blah blah blah.  I take good care of my last few tables. 

The table is a little weird. We use the butcher paper, and have crayons for people to draw with on the table. I ask them if they need anything, they say they are okay...a minute goes by, and I'm talking to another table, and she holds up a sign she drew in crayon on a torn piece of paper. ""PARMESAN CHEESE."" I bring some over, with a smile. How cute.  I'm bussing the table at the end of the meal, and ask ""Was everything okay this evening?"" 

Lady: No. 

Me: I'm sorry, what was wrong? Anything I can fix for you?

I'm holding her empty plate that looks like it was licked clean. 

Lady: My food was cold, and unacceptable. 

Me: I am very sorry ma'am. I would have fixed that for you, but have no way of knowing, unless you tell me. 

Lady: You know. You served it to me knowing it was cold. We don't go out to eat much, and I never get treated like this. We go out to eat once a month, and this cold food ruined my night. 

Me: Ma'am, I am very sorry, but I assure you, I did not know your food was cold, and I would not knowingly serve anything that would make someone unhappy. There is no way for me to know if the food is cold unless you tell me. I asked you multiple times if everything was okay, and you said everything was fine.

Lady: Don't lie to me. You knew it was cold, you can check the temperature of the plate. You did it on purpose.

( For the record the plates are usually pretty toasty. They come out of the dishwasher hot, and then sit on top of the window where the heating element is...so the fuckers stay warm as long as the heating element is on)

Me: Ma'am, I am very sorry you feel that way, but the plates are warm from the kitchen, and the only way I have to ascertain the temperature of your food, is what you tell me. I will not touch your food to see if it is warm, I have to go on what the kitchen gives me, and you. 

Lady: Wrong. You have ruined mine, and my husband's night. AND, I had to ask you for cheese. 

I just walked away. Presented the check, ran the card, ""have a nice night."" Stiffed. 79.00 tab. Fuck this restaurant. 

I see lady using her crayons, and writing something else, before they leave. I'm expecting a nasty little note, and I'm about to lose it. Doesn't leave it. Thank you for small things.

Get my checkout in, thinking about some cold beer after work, and the manager whips out a torn piece of paper with red and green crayon writing.

I proceeded to get chewed out for cold food I had no control over, and my bad service. I have been waiting tables longer than most of the servers put together, and I haven't had to deal with this kind of bullshit. 

No back-up from the manager. I told him that I don't want to work at a restaurant where the customers are so incredibly rude, and I get no back up, or slack. ""look at my sales, and my tips. Tell me that anyone else is doing better than me. You can look at the numbers. I have to deal with rude psychos, and I'm going to get blamed every time?"" 

Two weeks notice. Thank you very much.

Sundays were the worst at this place.  12pm-7pm, tourist crowd that simply just wanted to come in and order appetizers and then leave.  The restaurant was fine dining, not for bar food.  We had tables in the bar for that very reason since we were extremely limited on table space in the dining room.

I get a four-top as my first table on this Sunday:  One extremely large woman and her three rail-thin children.  I'm not sure how genetics worked out on that one, but I digress.

The woman orders our biggest prime rib with a side of fries and all three of the kids order chicken fingers.  Pretty straight forward order.

Our ketchup came in small silver bowls, just like gravy bowls you would use to pour on your potatoes.  With four dishes having fries, this table would probably need a good two or three of them.  A couple of minutes before the food comes out, I come out with the ketchup bowls and returned to the kitchen after hearing the familiar ""DING!"" that the food was up.

I come out with the food and set it up on the rack, dishing out the food to the kids first (Kids ALWAYS got their food first from me) and then gave the prime rib to the mother.

**Me: Anything else I can get for you now?**

*Woman:  Yeah, we're going to need more ketchup here!*

The kids had taken one of the ketchup bowls for themselves to share.  I watched as this woman took the other two bowls and dumped both of them on this beautiful 20oz prime rib.

As servers, we collect a lot of stories about people being extraordinarily nice or extraordinarily awful, but this is one of those rare ""just plain weird"" experiences.

This happened way back in 2008, so some of the details are a little fuzzy, but I'll do my best. 

I was working my first ever waitressing job at a small but popular place in a small but popular tourist town. It was a fairly quiet evening, with just me and my coworker, a very sweet, highly competent girl we'll call Jen.

Jen got sat with a 4 top. Three of them I remember next to nothing about; just unremarkable, middle aged, Caucasian people. I think it was a mix of men and women. But the fourth guy... the fourth guy was definitely from another planet.

He didn't LOOK that weird. Like his friends, he was middle aged, white, average looking. On the tall side of average height, dark hair. He just had slightly bulging eyes that didn't seem to blink very much, and an expression of total amazement with everything he saw. We'll call him ET.

Jen was a very friendly, personable server. She would always introduce herself (not mandatory, I usually don't) and speak very warmly to her tables. From most customers this would elicit a smile, maybe a question about the menu. ET, however, seemed amazed and delighted that this young lady had approached HIS table and introduced herself! ""Hi, Jen!!! Wow!!!!"" said ET. 

His friends began to help guide him through the process of choosing a drink and reading the menu. He seemed utterly incredulous. Now, our menu is pretty extensive for such a small eatery and has an interesting Middle Eastern flair, so it's not unusual for customers to be encountering offerings like baba ganoush and moussaka for the first time. But ET seemed incredulous at the very notion that there was a place where you could go and sit and choose a food and someone would make the food you chose and someone named Jen would bring it to you to eat. Wow! He had so many questions, and aside from the strangeness, was a delight to behold; who am I to rain on someone's parade of childlike wonder? 

After ET settled on a steak dish and his table was happily enjoying their appetizers, Jen and I engaged in a little speculation in the wait station. The only logical conclusion was, naturally, that he was an alien from outer space disguised as a human. We had a good chuckle about it, but not at ET's expense - we found him delightful.

(I should also mention that there was no indication that he was in any way mentally handicapped, and his accent and manner of speaking were totally neutral whitebread USA.) 

So ET's table's food comes out, Jen drops it off and tells them to enjoy and goes about checking on her other tables. I'm busy in my section as well.

Suddenly there's a commotion. It's coming from, where else, ET's table. The whole dining room looks over to see ET looking perplexed and frightened, his eyes bulging out even further. One of his friends realizes what's happening - ""Oh my god, he's choking!""

Jen, that wonderful human being, springs into action. She zips over, tells ET to stand up, gets behind him and performs a beautiful Heimlich maneuver. PTOO! ET ejects a hunk of unchewed steak the size of a baby's fist and starts taking deep, gasping gulps of air. 

""I was choking!!!"" he says, eyes still wide, still sounding utterly flummoxed. ""You saved me!!! I just took a bite of my steak and then.... I was CHOKING! But you saved me! Oh wow! Wow!!!!""

Jen got the round of applause and rock star treatment she deserved from the other diners, and ET was nothing but grateful... and absolutely amazed that attempting to inhale a cobblestone-sized chunk of meat had resulted in a blocked windpipe. 

So you tell me. Is there an earthly explanation for an adult male being utterly unfamiliar with the concept of restaurants, and apparently of eating in general? Or did Jen save the life of a visitor from outer space?

Last year I was working in a Mongolian BBQ place while I finished up my last year of college. If you don't know what a Monglian BBQ is, it's not like a normal restaurant. You collect raw meat and veggies then go up to a grill in the center where the cooks make a stir-fry with it in front of you using swords. They usually flip them and do little tricks for entertainment. 

Exciting I know.

Well the one I worked in was rather upscale for what it was, and with the plates being $23.99 it kept out most riff raff. Well lucky for us there was a hotel across the street and large group of swingers congregated there for a ""weekend retreat"" there were about 100 couples and most didn't stray far from the hotel so we would see the same couples repeatedly.
On Saturday (mid-retreat) I noticed a particular new couple getting very small portions but going up to the grill repeatedly. Kind of weird but not THAT out of the ordinary. Well after they've been in the restaurant for 4 hours my friend Mark (who was one of the cooks that night) took me aside and looks completely horrified.

Mark: ""insidethetardis, this was in the tip jar that weird couple left it""

Me: ""okayyy""
He hands me one of our cloth napkins and a hotel keycard falls out. Oh this is gonna' be good. On the napkin itself there is a note...

*Note: Dear guy in the RED hat, My name is Cathy I just wanted to let you know that I think your very cute ;). And I would love to blow you while my husband watches. If you're into it maybe he can blow you too? We're staying next door in room #303. See you later....I hope. Cathy*

Fanstastic.

Mark: ""Well??""

insidethetardis: laughing histerically ""She used the wrong you're'""

Mark: ""What should I do??""

insidethetardis: ""Ignore it I guess?? They're in my section I'll tell them we're closing""

Mark: ""Thanks!""

So I tell them and they finish up as they're heading out they walk past where Mark is scrubbing the grill. The man yells out ""scrub that grill boy!"" and the women giggles and yells ""don't forget what I said"". Then I KNEW he wasn't playing a joke (Mark was the teasing type)Oh jeez. I said goodbye to the couple and then notice the mans fly was undone, with his shirt peeking out and flapping in the breeze they went off into the night.

Always sits in one particular area of the pub unless his friends who I think are old school friends of his, anyways they've turned out normal and he's just a tad strange. I thought he was just a bit nerdy and withdrawn, which is fine by me- I'm a nerd myself but have found some massive bags of confidence in the last few years after working in some high end kitchens.

Anyways, I was doing as a barman does and making conversation with him because he was propping up the bar and looked as if he'd had a long day. I was just putting away glasses at the time, so I'm able to hold conversation. He's moaning about his job and how few hours he gets, so I suggested maybe getting a second job. That's when it got a bit weird, he says ""I cannot serve two masters."" 

I was like... wat. I thought it was about to get really sinister there until he sees the weird look I've got on my face and decides to explain. ""It's against Bushido, my religion. No Samurai can serve two masters.""

I really didn't know what to say, I didn't want to point out that Bushido / Samurai isn't a religion so I just said fair enough mate, I guess that makes sense. Might be worth looking for a job with more hours though. Luckily at this point the phone rang so I hopped off the bar to go answer that.

Anyways, last night we were talking about films- martial arts films in particular because I had just watched Shogun Assassin and mentioned it to him because I knew that's his kind of thing and despite the Samurai thing being a bit strange, he's a nice guy and I do try my best to engage him in a bit of a chat whenever he's at the bar and if I'm drinking there when I'm off I'll buy him a beer, I buy most of my regulars a beer in turn because most of them are awesome and they buy me them in return.

So anyways, Shogun Assasin. We then get talking about House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and other cool films when he mentions Red Cliff. I was a big fan of Dynasty Warriors so read into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms a bit more after playing the games and though I've not read it yet, I'd like to. So I recognised the name Red Cliff from when I'd been reading and discovered there was a film about it. So we talked about that and the RoT3K and he comes out with ""Yeah, I wasn't in it but my son was."" 

I was like oh I didn't know you had a son, I thought you were a bit young to have a child old enough to be in that though it came out a while ago didn't it? And he laughs, and calmly apologises and explains that his past life caught up with him for a moment and he meant Sun Quan because in his former life he was Sun Jian.

It just blew me away, he was so sincere about it.
It always astounds me when someone has complete faith in things like past life or religion and stuff because I'm not a believer. I was just stood there like wat, okay. 

I don't know what to even say to that and I don't know what he's going to come out with next, but he's such a nice guy.

Two of them started at the bar waiting for the third. They didn't order anything at the bar. Insisted on getting a table even though they did not have a reservation. Fine, it was early enough that if they had been normal people we could accommodate them. 

Strike one: they completely ignore me when I stand at the head of the table and then talk over me when I try to greet them. Strike two: they take forever to order. I had to come back three times. Strike three: they ask me what's good even though they had already made up their minds on what to order. One of the girls is not eating, but insists on holding on to the drink menu. Doesn't order anything to drink either. Strike four: They eat reaaaaaalllly slowly because they talk too damn much. Strike five: They're done; we need the table. They take forever to pay and then continue to sit there. Finally, my manager had to ask them to move to the bar. They chat with the bartender and let him pour waters for them, but they leave after about ten minutes. 

We pissed off guests with reservations to accommodate a 3-top of campers who spent a grand total of $35. The 4-top with a reservation that had to wait for that table? They spent $200 and were gracious and nice (even though they had to wait for a table). It's not necessarily that the campers were cheap, it's that they were inconsiderate as all hell, but then I guess that's why we call them campers.

It was a sit-down restaurant, although I think I use the term ""restaurant"" loosely.

Anyway, I usually worked swing shift (there's a rant for another time), and I had the whole middle room (of three) for my section.  Yup, by myself.  It was pretty easy and it wasn't like there was a whole lot of business.  Until the big greyhound bus pulled into our parking lot.

A high school sports team (or some kind of young sports group) decided to invade our restaurant for dinner.  Our manager told them there'd be an automatic gratuity (Sure, fine, they said!), and we stuffed them all in the third and back room, and two other servers would join me in there and we'd each get a row of them.  While taking care of our other sections as much as possible.  The other servers on shift did pull together to help cover everything we couldn't.  The back room was just a tad too small, and so I had a 2-top of theirs sit in my middle section.  So I had 5 tables of this party as opposed to the other two's four.

They were RUDE.  One of my fellow servers was apoplectic with rage at their treatment of him, and I wasn't far behind. Thankfully, my other section's tables were wonderful and seemed to understand we were overworked and I don't think they liked the large group any more than we did.  

Finally, after they had finished, we sang hallelujah (not really) and got to work cleaning up after the little pigs.  Out of those 5 tables I had from the group, I found about $3 on the tables combined.  Jerks.  Oh well, I thought, the auto-grat would help make up for the hour's worth of work I put into them.

NOPE.  As we found out with a sense of disbelief and fury, they refused the auto-grat.  They REFUSED an auto-grat over a party that they had been informed about.  Their group was CLEARLY over 8 people.  WTF?!?!?!  I didn't even know you could refuse an auto-grat like that!  Turns out, it is possible.  I hope that group lost every game they ever played.

""These kids are on a fixed budget, we can't afford the automatic gratuity charge.""  That's what the team manager woman apparently told our manager.  Listen, lady, if you can't afford a sit-down meal at even the cheapest of sit-down restaurants (which includes the server tip!!), you take your team to a Taco Bell or a McDonald's!!  

As for our manager, he shouldn't have let them refuse the auto-grat.  Pansy.  He said he'd talk with the upper management to see what they could do for the three of us that were basically stiffed.  Nothing happened.  Sucky management is just among the many reasons I quit that job.

I wasn't too upset as we still had a little bit of work to do before we could get out of there.

We go to get food orders and here is where I start to get annoyed.  Between the 12 full grown adults 8 ordered something to eat.  Of those 8 only 3 ordered an entree.  So the other closer and I put in the order and go about our work.  The food went out and once they get it everything is fine (other than the fact that they were the only people in the place by this point.)  Then it is time for the checks and they get them all.  It is a mix of cash and cards and everyone gets them to us as fast as they can.  Everyone except separate checks lady.  So I run the cards and get change for everybody and crack a few jokes as I am putting the checks down for everyone.  

Finally the lady hands me hers and I tell her I will be right back with her change.  I get to the back and that is when I start to get a little worried.  Inside her check for $21.19 is a twenty dollar bill, a one and a quarter.  So feeling extra petty I pull 6 pennies from my pocket and throw them into the book.  I set it down in front of her and she, completely unfazed, scoops the pennies into her purse.  So I go back about my work and as they are leaving, bitch face comes up to me and says, ""Sorry, I didn't have any change, but I will take care of you next time.  You boys were great.""  My jaw dropped and the bartender said it looked like I was going to hit this woman.

I work at a somewhat well known ice cream parlor on the west coast. We also serve burgers, fries, and since my location is in Hawaii we serve ""local food"" as well (saimin, steak plates, hamburger steak, chicken katsu). I'm somewhat new at serving, I've been doing it for about 2 months now. 

On Wednesdays kids eat ""free"". By free I mean for every adult entree and adult drink purchased, you get one ""keiki"" plate for free. This attracts in hoards of families. Usually Wednesdays go somewhat smoothly, but we always make less tips since the bill total comes out to a lot less. 

Today though. My god. I started off with a 14 top. 5 adults, 9 kids. They took up all of the high chairs in our store, making all of the other families coming in during the dinner rush upset. I had just come off break and the other server transferring the table to me had gotten their drinks, but neglected to tell me that they wanted 5 separate checks. Within 5 minutes of serving them, one of the adults spills water everywhere and doesn't tell me so when I'm reaching over her infant to put an appetizer in the middle of the table, I nearly slip and fall on top of this 5 month year old child. 

""oh yeah sorry I spilled water""

Thanks lady. Thanks. 

Once the meal was over, *then* I'm told about the split checks, I split them the best I can and bring them to the table. There were a few small errors so I had to pull my manager in to help me. No biggie. 

Then I realized I forgot to add in the 18% gratuity. They finally leave and leave me a whopping $10 on a $150+ tab. 

I go to bus their table and there are 3 dirty diapers just laying alongside their plates. Not 1, but *3*. Seriously people? Our bathroom has a changing table and a trash. 

I don't mean to leave a long negative rant here, but today was the worst Wednesday I've worked. One of the other servers had a kid vomit onto his plate and leave it there for her to clean up. I love kids~

I was working for a restaurant and [deffinately had some issues with the place](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/13h0ap/ode_to_the_rude_table_of_10/). 
I finally had enough, and gave my two weeks the week before christmas. (I had some time off comming, and I'd be damned if I was going to deal with abuse from them during the holidays)

Since then shit has quite hit the fan there, and the head bartender has been caught stealing, the gm has gotten in more trouble and both of them have resigned(havn't left) as well as loosing a handfull of good employees. I'm not saying I am responsible for it going to hell, rather I just had the foresight to jump ship early.

However, this has left me without a job until yesterday. 

On kindof a last ditch effort I applied to a company that I havn't had success getting an interview with previously, and surprise I got a call. (At this point I thought it might just be for a lower end dishwasher type position but hey money).

However, in the middle of the interview the Chef noticed my previous experience, with catering/bartending (was a supervisor for a year an a half) and went and got the head of catering who liked my answers.

So at this point, I'm sure I'm just going to get hired on at the bottom, because food establishments love to promote internally and that's fine too. HOWEVER here's the que derpface moment. I was offered a position in management, as well as possible bartending based on my previous experience. (Which the previous restaurant wouldn't even look at.) 

So now I'm back with a company i'm sure I'm going to enjoy, doing the thing I truely excelled at insted of having to listen to my previous boss critque my lack of religion/style/life choices.


I hope this still fits in TFYS, and I'd like to think this is just part of the Universal Karma giving back to one of us.

Now, I am very white, but I used to live in Seattle, where Vietnamese restaurants are as common as Mexican and Chinese takeout. I'm very familiar with the dish.

Since I've left Seattle, this place has been the only place I've been
 able to find pho, and I've ordered it a few times over the years I've been here, most recently about 6 months ago.

This time I ordered it, and it was different than I've ever experienced it, both at this particular restaurant and in general. The broth was the correct flavor, the pieces of beef were prepared the normal way, the garnishes were as expected–but the rice noodles. Every other bowl of pho i've ever hadbhas been full of thin, angel hair-esque rice noodles. These rice noodles were flattened, like fettuccini.

I was disappointed, but at the end of the day, it was only the texture that was off, not the flavor, so I decided not to send it back. I was still curious at the change from the norm though.

When our young Asian server stopped by to check on us, I decided to ask when they changed the noodles.  I emphasized that it tasted great, and that I had no complaints, but that I was just curious because I had never seen this dish served like this. He immediately became defensive, telling me that he was Vietnamese and had never seen it served the way I described. After a few sentances of basically telling me that I was wrong and didn't understand the cuisine, he flip flopped and said that maybe they had changed the noodles, but it was obvious that he was only throwing me a bone to salvage his tip and he clearly thought I was a moron. 

The rest of the night he practically ignored my table, and when he did grab refills for us, he did so silently and without making eye contact. I also saw him talking and laughing with another server while throwing glances my way.

In the end, I left unhappy and embarrassed, but I left him a normal tip, which I'm now almost regretting.

So, servers- when I'm dining with you, is it rude to ask questions like that? Does it annoy you when customers question the prep without actually wanting to complain? Because I'm honestly flabbergasted by the incident, but also feeling a little self concious that maybe I broke some unspoken dining rule, and now I'm afraid to go back : /",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1jrr0v,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1jrr0v/what_the_pho/,

Lately there have been a few things that have been occurring at work which haven't left me a very happy employee. Upper management at corporate seems to have made a requirement of my management to save money on labor by cutting expensive employees (dishwashers, bussers, hosts, etc.) and having their workload fall on the extremely cheap servers. I'm paid server minimum wage for my state, which is less than $2.50/hr.

Like almost every restaurant, I have to tipshare/tip out of my sales, and a part of that goes to the busser. However, between lunch and dinner, usually around 2pm, that busser gets cut and goes home, leaving me and a few others servers to bus tables for our server wage, while *still* tipping out to who we call the ""invisible busser"". They also like to cut the dishwasher, and I absolutely refuse to wash dishes for $2/hr, which pisses off the rest of the kitchen staff because then they have to do it.

Another complaint me and my fellow servers have been having is the problem of excessive sidework. There is a class action lawsuit pending against Darden Restaurants, (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, etc.) One of the claims is that any server who performs sidework duties which take them more than 20% of their shift is entitled to state minimum wage for any time over that 20%. This is certainly happening at my restaurant; when asked what percentage of their shift they spend doing sidework, the average response is 30-40%.

Back story: I work at medium-sized restaurant as a server/busser/dishwasher and it's located on a busy street with lots of other restaurants in a college town.  My problem at work is dealing with people bring outside food in the masses and then leaving their garbage and dirty dishes (that we so graciously supplied to them). My managers don't really deal with the floor often and don't understand our frustration with these people. 

These non-customers think that because one person in their ten person party bought food from us, it's alright to eat there.  I know for a fact that the other restaurants don't allow this, but we must put up with it because ""what if they change their minds about ordering from us?"" This is BS because I am more familiar with our non-customer regulars than actual paying customers at this point. 

Lately, I just ignore their tables until the very end or give them the ""are you seriously doing that?"" look. But, the tipping point in this growing entitlement movement was this large family who came in with outside food and only bought one thing from us.  The father at the end of the meal got in my face and yelled stuff along the line of ""YOU WILL TREAT US LIKE REAL CUSTOMERS!"" after visiting all the tables around them multiple times, but theirs. 

It's stupid, because I barely get tipped enough and I'm supposed to put up with extra shit from these kinds of people?  I was wondering what else I could do to drive home the point with these people that they are being rude without asking them to leave? Currently, I'm thinking of dropping lines like *""Man, I feel really sorry for you guys.  You pay good money for (INSERT NEIGHBOR RESTAURANT'S NAME) and they make you eat over here? Show's how much respect they have for you and the employees here who end up picking up after them! Oh well, I guess I'm not able to complain, people who bring outside food tend to tip the most because they feel sorry for making us work harder! ""*

the rez was at 12:45.  at 12:15, right as our lunch was in full swing, shit-hitting-the-fan rush mode, a lady from that rez calls and asks if we can take the order for the table and have the food ready when they get there.  we tell her that its a little too busy currently to take an order just to hold the fire, and then make sure to get it sent in perfect timing to come out when they arrive.  the lady says that we can just put it in now, she doesn't mind if its just sitting on the table when they arrive.  whhhaaaaa?  that table was still occupied and we had other customers present that we needed to be taken care of.  we told her to call back when they were on their way over and we'd put it in then, and the timing should be just about right.  the lady also asked to have the cheesecake cut and out on the table when they arrived as well.

so while the waitress who has this rez in her section is currently slammed, now she has to prioritize cheesecake readiness (at a place that doesn't do desserts, or sing birthday songs, etc...).  and the bartender had to ignore her customers and servers to take an order for a 6-top.

the ladies show up, were predictably a bit impatient but otherwise sweet and the waitress had no complaints about them.  someone in this sub mentioned recently that maybe the people who get so worked up about celebrating birthdays are those that never thought they would live to see another.  so i'm not hating on these people by any means.  i just thought it was pretty strange.

(wordy wordy),84,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1chjvx/in_which_i_attract_the_babies_and_in_which_i_get/,"I would just like to share that I am a baby-magnet. This has started recently, but our restaurant is very busy almost every night of the week, so there's children EVERYWHERE, all the time. I always end up in the section in the back, one of our 'party' sections. This is the 3rd time this month I've been asked to be a babysitter because someone's baby likes to have a staring contest with me. One mother let me pick up her baby because he'd grabbed my fingers and literally tried to get me to pick him up himself. SO PRECIOUS. 

And then another kept crying all night, except when I'd come to the table. When I came to the table, she would just stare at me with her big baby bug eyes and I'd stare right back for an extended period of time. (My eyes are huge and light so I think I weird the babies out). It got to be flat-out comical by the end of their meal and the dad asked if I babysat. 

I don't know why it's so amusing/weird, but I get followed by little toddlers everywhere and have to make sure I'm not being tailed into our kitchen or server station (it's happened twice already), and I had a little girl make me a rainbow with these colorful wax sticks we give to kids. It's gotten to the point where if someone calls ahead or has an exceptional number of kids, the host or manager specifically has me take them. Funny thing is, I didn't even like kids up until very recently. 

Does that happen to anyone else? A server of ours is the EXACT opposite- he's perfectly handsome and nice, but babies burst into tears at the sight of him and toddlers scramble away in fear. We have to wonder what'd happen if we shared a large party of children.

Next story: 

I went to a family-owned Italian place, as I'd heard some good things. It was 5 of us just wanting to carboload. Our waiter seemed a bit standoffish, but it didn't bother me. We already knew what we wanted, so we got our waters and ordered our food. Twenty minutes later... nothing. We're all out of water and it wasn't like we chugged it, and there's no food or the complimentary bread that they apparently prided themselves on. A busser brought some bread after about half an hour but we forgot to ask him for refills. We wait some more and finally get our food and the server scurries off as soon as the plates are in our hands. Finally, I decide I'm tired of not having water because DAMN IT I am THIRSTY. 

I ask him for a manager and he says he is the manager (lolwut), so I tell him straight up. ""I'm really not pleased with our level of service. You've been to our table less than your busser and we've been without water for nearly an hour."" He immediately gets defensive and snaps at me. ""Well sweetheart, if you can't tell, we're extremely busy and sometimes you just have to wait. We can't always be at your beck and call."" WHAAAAAAT. It wasn't nearly as busy as he tried to make it seem- actually, it was totally dead for a Friday night anywhere and probably for a good reason. I think that was the point where I kind of lost my shit and I pretty much bitch him out, to the effect of: 

""That's completely bullshit. I work at a restaurant that easily has twice this traffic on a Wednesday night, and no matter how busy it gets, there's absolutely no excuse for not bothering to stop or send someone else by. Especially with your shit attitude, how the hell are you employed when you're this poor of an employee?"" Pretty sure I followed up with some comments about nepotism, too. 

Anyway, I tell him we're ready for our bills and we need them split and he brings them. I guess he decides he wants to call me out, so he asks ""Where is it you work? You know, where you get such good service when it's busy."" He walks off after ~*calling me out*~ and my friends are both appalled and entertained at the entire commotion. I just sign the slip ($1 on $22) and write the name and address of the restaurant and tell him to come by anytime, and it's his turn to look surprised. My CC% average is about 26%, so I'm confident in my own skills and I take my job seriously. I don't think he expected me to respond that way, though, cause I'm still waiting for sassy man to show up. :((

Pretty typical but we only had two people in the kitchen so tickets were taking longer than normal to come out.  I explained to all of my tables that we were understaffed and ensured them everyone was working to get their food to the table as quick as possible.  All of my tables were OK with this and understood as the restaurant was clearly packed... also the only other server on the floor and I were running around like crazy!

So these two ladies complained about everything having to do with the food.  First it took too long(I did feel bad but I did warn them), then they didn't have ""enough"" fries (they had our normal amount but I had the kitchen make more for them.. free of charge!), and then one of the brats didn't have enough chicken on her wrap (there was definitely more than enough on there for any normal person..coincidentally the wrap was almost completely eaten by the time she complained).  

I had a manager involved from the start of the complaints and the main complainer told me that she thought I handled everything well and she knows that all of these things are out of my control.  When I finally brought them their check, it had the wrap and one of her drinks completely comped AND we even honored their 20% off coupon that we normally wouldn't have accepted. (also free fries.. yummm!)  I get to my ""I really apologize for everything and hope you do come back and visit"" speech.  Then the main complainer proceeds to say that she has worked in a restaurant before and continues to sympathize with me..

This is the exact moment I know I'm getting a shitty tip.  Has anyone noticed that there's a large amount of people who claim they have ""worked in the industry,"" or ""are great tippers"" but tend to be the biggest pain to deal with and actually aren't great tippers?  Do you believe they have in fact worked in service?  What do you think makes them decide to include this in conversation? (I personally NEVER tell waitstaff that I am a server when I go out to eat!)

I always take the table, since they don't tip well, the redneck servers cannot understand the accents,  and I don't really care because they are hilarious and teach me some German snippets here and again.

So the restaurant is on this kick that every time you bring someone an alcoholic beverage, you have to bring them a glass of water.  This is supposed to help keep our patrons hydrated and sober or whatever.  So I ask all my tables if they want water when they order alcohol - except my Germans.  They get big goddamn beers and do not want water.  Ever. 

That week, the Germans come in earlier than usual and during the rush.  I am hopping around five tables and having a blast.  I bring six 24 oz mugs of dark beer because I am a badass serving wench and slide them to the boys like I am an alcoholic magician.  Off I go to tend the other tables while they chit chat and decide on their entrees.  

I turn around to their table not five minutes later to see my manager with a tray of six large waters wobbling toward them.  They did not want the water, they did not ask for the water, but she was intent on curbing their boozing ways.  I am across the restaurant and I could not save her.   I watched in mingled fascination and dismay as she picked the first glass up off the tray to set it down on the table.  The tray weebled, it wobbled, and it flipped the fuck over, drenching a third of the table and two pant legs of confused German men.

I peeled around back line on my way over there, grabbed two dry dish towels, six sets of silver and another tray.  Table reset in three minutes and the wet gentlemen appeased with a round.  The manager stomps off with the glasses while I finished sweeping the ice up off the carpet and amusing my tables.

Everything is fine, crisis contained, and I headed to back line to throw in an app of queso.  Manager attacked.  ""Why didn't you bring them water?!""  She was very red in the face (drink spills are totes embarrassing).

""Well, because they didn't want it...""

Manager: ""We always bring water when the guest has alcohol!""

Me:  ""Unless they don't want it?  I have been waiting on them for 3 months.  Do you want me to bring them water that will clutter their table and they won't drink?  I asked all my other tables and brought water to all who wanted it.""

Manager tried to reprimand me again, but the queso was up and needed to be ran.  I was on the short list for a few weeks, but when you watch me like a hawk, you see good stuff way more than you see bad stuff.

I've been a server since November.  I started immediately serving breakfast, never previously having worked in a restaurant.  As of this past Saturday I have graduated to serving lunch, and the first day doing this we got slammed.  The girl I was working with refused to take a five-top because she said they are always assholes, so I got stuck with them. Being my first day, I definitely struggled with making sure I got orders right and cashing them correctly, so I was a bit slow.  This one table was extremely rude the entire time, even though they knew it was my first time serving lunch.  When they left, I got tipped $5 on a $60 bill.  The girls I work with said I actually did a great job, but tables like that make me think otherwise.  

I love serving, especially because I always have really great people who come in and they're always so happy, but people like that are also the reason I hate my job.

Fun. Speaking of customers, here’s a story from my first season at the restaurant. And apologizes for the wall of text that follows.


Around the second week of June is when we really start getting into the swing of things. The shore town starts getting busy, parking is a choice between a $25 lot fee or pulling your hair out while driving around for 30 minutes looking for a spot 5 blocks away from the boardwalk. As such, a lot of locals in the area will come up for the day/evening/night, riding a bike up or walking.


One hot day in July, around 10 PM, a group of four people, two couples out to dinner, came in. I’d say they were around their late 40s, early 50s. Couple A featured Salt and Pepper, a man with the definition of Salt and Pepper hair, and a woman, Peggy (her hair reminded me of the wife from Married… With Children). Couple B featured Stocky (wasn’t hefty, but wasn’t built), and his woman companion Nancy (dunno, just looked like a Nancy). The two couples seemed to have pregamed as well, but S&amp;P and Peggy were on a different level than Stocky and Nancy. Well, 4 drunk/buzzed middle-aged folks, what harm can they do?


The waitress goes over to do the standard introduction and take their drink order. Beers for the men, wine for the women. No water needed. The bartender had noticed the table earlier and said essentially, “Alright, but keep an eye on them.” The waitress returns with the drinks, giving the table another minute with the menu. The minute passes and before the couples order food, they want more drinks, Margaritas this time. Still no water needed. The bartender notices this and places the table under a temporary flag, wanting to see how they handle two rounds of drinks before serving them any more afterwards. Personally, I don’t know what tipped him off: The fact they were one drink away from being completely gone or the loud, nonsensical conversations they were having. The waitress agrees and brings the second round of drinks over, and finally gets the food order.


Now, at our restaurant, our biggest/most expensive item was something called the Mega Seafood Platter. Included: 1 whole lobster, a pound of crab legs, and an assortment of shrimp, mussels and clams, all raw. The market price for it all? $80 per platter. This particular table ordered two of them, one for each couple. The dollar signs appeared in the waitress’ eyes when she came to the back area. Hot damn, she was gonna get a huge tip from this, the bill was running close to $225 now, 20% would be a $45 (before tip-out and cash drop) tip. However, the couple had one last request while waiting for their food: Another round of drinks. Finally, the waitress cleared her mind and saw the harsh truth: These were drunks, pure and simple. One wrong move, and they were gone, as well as her tip. And even if they made it through the meal, what were the chances of getting that magical 20%?


The waitress took the drink order, but went over to the bartender. He said he considered them flagged, but to talk to the guard on detail and Mike, our manager. Mike couldn’t be found, but the other manager, Colleen, was available. Colleen stood at a corner of the restaurant in sight of the table, and watched them for a bit, before Mike reappeared. Mike talked to Colleen, the bartender and the waitress to get their opinions on the table before heading over. The conversation between Mike and the table went something like this:


**Mike:** ""Hey folks, how’s everything this evening?""

**S&amp;P:** ""Good… good. Hey, we had just put in drinks, can you ask our waitress where they are? She’s doing a great job, we’re just parched, (S&amp;P lets out a drunken laugh), don’t worry.""

**M:** ""Well, I actually wanted to talk to you guys about that. From what I’ve heard, you guys have had a little to drink.""

Nancy separates her finger and thumb about an inch apart from each other. “Only a little”

**M:** ""Ah-ha… well, we do want you to stay, however, we do have to cut you off from the booze. We’ll gladly still serve you, however, we cannot server you anything other than water or some other beverage. Also, we would like you to keep it down, as a few customers have come over to me about your loudness.""


Stocky, who seemed to be the most sober, or at most, the least impaired, promised to keep the group in line. This lasted all of exactly 2 minutes, I kept track. S&amp;P starts complaining how this place “used to be so much better. Locals were treated with respect. I mean, we’re locals, we shouldn’t have any limits.” The waitress headed back over with the 2 Mega Seafood Platters, placing them on the table, before asking if there was anything else she could get for them. The answer: More alcohol. The waitress signaled the security guard (an awesome guy by the name of Jack, who if I remember stories about him, will gladly share) for his help, while Peggy went on a rant on why they should be given more alcohol. According to Peggy, “we only live a few blocks away, we’re staying at a motel, we walked here. WE’RE LOCALS.”


To wrap this all up, Mike, who was already having a stressful night as it was with the heat and crowded restaurant, essentially wanted to get them the hell out. The Platters, relatively untouched, were voided off the final check, knocking the bill from a whopping $230 to the total of the drinks, $66. The waitress received a $2 tip. In the end, management decided that while the drunks should have paid for all the food and have been promptly escorted afterwards, it wasn’t worth the trouble to argue with drunken assholes in a busy restaurant. After the couple left, I looked at the clock. It just turned 11 PM.



**TL;DR: Locals aren’t favorited, they are only slightly more tolerated. And even then, we still hate them sometimes.**

I work at a small restaurant that's trying to get off the ground in a small town. I'm a waiter and have had experience in restaurants since I was 15, and as well as a year of supervisor (assistant manager) under my belt.
That being the case, I show up early, don't request alot of time off and generally give 150 % to my customers, because hey they pay my bills.

The specific instance today had to deal with a table of 10, that walked in and imediately started off. They walked in at 12:30 and expected to be out by 1:00 (the whole works, we're an italian sit down place, fancy 15$ plates and such) I politely explained that we would do the best we could to accomidate them. 

The slew of events that just got worse and worse:

-We'll call her Dorthy interupts me trying to get drink orders to ask if I'm ever going to take their food order (not two minutes after they sat down, and while i'm trying to balance 2 other tables as well) 
-Dorthy's friend Jannet asks me why I havn't brought bread to the table yet (bread comes after drinks, and after orders at our place)
-Now, it's been roughly 10 minutes since they sat down,i've taken their order gotten their bread, gotten drinks and they start complaining about how long the food is taking so I run back to explain to my manager that this table might be a problem.
The rest of it is as follows:
Food gets out to them in a resonable time, but their unhappy about it and bitch to my manager who is giving me dagger eyes from across the room, who then has to write off the whole table.

-I get written up for 'yelling"" at them and not being able to handle the table, even though I told them that they came in angry and I was trying my best to make them happy.

What gets me, is my other tables at the same moment left outstanding tips and raved to my manager about how good the service was and how good the food was, but my manager wouldn't connect the dots that something is amiss when 2 out of 3 tables like their server, and the 3rd one is one that I mentioned came in angry.

My Manager:


*Yells at his employees in front of customers, and I mean he YELLS!


*Makes us pay when a customer walks out on the bill, even though we aren't allowed to cash them out, and the state will exempt the cost of such a check come tax time.


*Makes the second shift waitresses do all of the side work and cleaning for the entire day, even though they get less than half the tips ( and way fewer customers) that the morning girls do.


*Makes us do extra work (cleaning mold out from under the cabinets with bleach, stay late with no pay to help prep food for the next day, etc.) that he refuses to do because, ""It's not his job.""


*Forced me to promote the restaurant on TV (news interview) by telling me that I would receive more hours, then immediately threatening to cut my hours if I did not comply.


*Lets customers (this is a truck stop, so occasionally we get really skeevy people, although most are cool) speak in a horribly inappropriate manner to the waitresses, touch the waitresses without their consent (as long as it's 'innocent' touching), and throw things at them.


*If a waitress stands up for herself or walks away from a customer, she gets in trouble and has her hours cut.


*Continually promises more hours based on sales/work, but then will not give them to the waitress in question. He also has almost double the waitresses he needs, so nobody gets enough hours. 


*Will not allow a waitress to go home if she is sick (e.g. vomiting and/or has a high fever) unless she can find someone to cover for her. This is **NOT SAFE**.


*Comes into work high.


*Accuses the waitresses of being rude and running off customers, even though they aren't and they don't. He takes this opportunity to yell at them.


*Yelled at me specifically about having an attitude and never doing what was asked of me by my superiors. The only person who ever asks me to do anything is the head waitress, who had no idea what was going on. I still don't know what I supposedly didn't do.


*Had me train my replacement without my knowledge. When found out that he was planning on firing me, and confronted him, he got mad at me. He then made up a bunch of excuses, yelled at me, and cut my hours. I found out what he was planning from another waitress, to whom he was bragging that he was going to fire me and give her my hours. ^So^why^the^replacement^dumbass?!? 

*Generally takes out his bad mood on his waitresses, especially when he is working front.


and


*Fired one of his register workers, who happened to be the sweetest woman I have ever met, because her til was short. Specifically, her till was short every single day she worked. She had to pay the difference, every single day, even though she and the manager worked the same register at the same time. She decided that she was to blame, and she was going to fix the problem by being super observant and counting the till throughout the day, so that she would know where she was going wrong. She started by counting the till as soon as she came to work (something that he had previously told her not to do), it was short $7. He screamed at her, in front of customers, told her that she was a liar, and that he had counted that money out himself, so he *knew* it wasn't short. By the end of the day the till was short $30, she didn't have the money and so couldn't pay it. He fired her and threatened to call the cops.

tl;dr I QUIT!!! I was sick of the drama, and could not stand what he did to poor LouAnne*

Maybe younger? I had gotten braces off in the past year and had a clear retainer (llllllladies).

We went to a country club we belonged to and had for a while. I guess the older guys got involved in the club's politics and people knew my dad as a result. Food was usually decent so we went that night for dinner. 

Anyway, I had forgotten my retainer cover and used a drink napkin to wrap my retainer. After the meal the server had cleared the table... all of it. She never saw me put the retainer in the napkin which was white so would have been very hard to notice (and why would she unwrap it?)

She went to see if it could be recovered and had an ""oh shit"" look on her. We casually went about seeing if I had placed it on my person or if it had fallen in the table. A couple minutes later the waitress came back and said she had checked what she could and even the *trash*. 

We, being a hopefully reasonable family, were like ""holy hell"" because we in no way thought she needed to go to that kind of effort. She apologized many times and we kept telling her it was not an issue. Hopefully she got a good tip because she certainly deserved it.

We saw her plenty of times over the years since then and when I had the retainer I would always make a show of putting it in a pocket when she waited on us. After that she would always ask ""No retainers today, right?""

Still I feel bad I caused someone to root around in the trash. I'm kind of thankful she didn't find it because I would probably of thrown it away when I got home because I really didn't need to put orthodontic equipment from the trash in my mouth for hours on end.

I recently started working at a chain restaurant and I thought I'd share a story and possibly hear some similar stories from others. This happened a few weeks ago, and I had been working there for about a month at the time. Note: I DO have serving experience, but only in a small, hole-in-the-wall type place.

SOOOO, it was a Monday night, and it was pouring rain outside. People were coming in soaking wet and hungry. As the sky got darker (from clouds, not nighttime), all of the servers and managers started joking about us having a tornado. It wasn't so unlikely, as we are in the midwest and it was quite warm and humid out. 

As the rush picked up and we started hitting ""in the weeds"" mode, it started thundering. I was standing in the back getting drinks for a recently-sat table (which of course, was a 6-top with kids in a hurry to get to a show or something) when I looked up only to see the lights and clock go out for about 2 seconds, come back on, then go off again. I thought, ""Okay, if they stay off, we can't do anything. Everyone has to leave or just not eat or something, right?"" Of course, before I even finish this thought, everything comes back on and stays on. Everything's okay, right? NO. The computers are all restarting and not working, meaning we can't enter orders, print tickets, or have any sort of order in our small, corporate server lives. 

After a tiny, internal freak out, I realized I had no idea what to tell my tables. I decided to go and tell them what was happening and to offer them drink refills while they waited. I especially wanted to give the ""in a hurry"" table a chance to go somewhere else, as I didn't want them to miss their engagement. Of course, they decided to stay and put me on an even tighter time crunch. As the manager on duty started trying to get the computers back on track (this had obviously never happened to her before), one of the experienced servers quickly devised a plan for giving orders to the cooks and writing up tickets. Bless her heart, seriously. Food took a long time, orders got mixed up, and for a while we could only take cash, but we managed. I felt so bad for everyone in that restaurant; the cooks, my manager, my coworkers, and especially the customers. Luckily, my tables were forgiving (some more than others) and patient. It was only about 40 minutes we were without computers, but during a big dinner rush, it felt like 2 hours.

Once everything was all caught up, rung in, reconciled, and organized, we went back to functioning like it was a regular Monday night (however, we were a little sweatier than usual). I'm kind of glad it happened, so I am prepared for something like this in the future, but man, was it terrifying. I hope it never happens again. It also made feel kind of stupid, because restaurants this busy haven't always had computers (especially of this caliber). 21st century servers are so privileged.

I swear it is true.

Many years ago, I worked day shift in the coffee shoppe/restaurant of a casino here in Australia. This particular day my section was empty except for two elderly women and a young family, mum, dad and two children around seven to nine years of age. Into my section danced a woman, but not before she'd done a twirl or two past the buffet (we had both buffet or table service options) and asked the chef if she could speak to a pork chop. She was a wild hippie child, wearing a sparkly cheesecloth skirt and top and sandals, an outfit that passed our dress code, but only just. The outfit was semi-transparent, had no pockets, and she was not carrying a purse or wallet, something I didn't immediately notice as it was not yet relevant. After reading the menu several times, she ordered half a dozen oysters natural and a chicken salad (drumstick &amp; thigh served on a bed of fancy salad) While she waited for her first course, she got up once or twice to dance around the table. Think fairy dancing; fairly high fairy dancing with lots of twirling and dipping and flipping of long curly hair. Naturally, I told the chefs to speed the service on this one up; we needed her gone. When the oysters arrived, she apologized to each one before she ate it and did another dance circuit of her table between each slurping down of oyster. I cleared the table as soon as she was done and bought out the salad as fast as I could. She sat and ate, relatively quietly and without much dancing or humming or singing of incomprehensible lyrics under her breath. However... once the chicken was picked clean,the salad gone and only a few limp bits of lettuce and the bones remaining, she picked up one of the bones, lifted her skirt, stuck the bone down her panties and began masturbating with it, right in full view of every table, every waitress, every section of the restaurant.

I shot up to the desk to call security, the parents grabbed their kids, covered their (very interested) eyes and dragged them out of there, the two old ladies chattered on, oblivious, and one of our waitresses, walking by on her way to the bar, saw what was going on and promptly fainted. None of these things fazed our heroine.

Security arrived and I told them who, what and where. They had a little trouble comprehending the 'what' because I was laughing so hard I was a bit breathless. When they got to her, she'd just, err, finished, but the old ladies had noticed by this time, the fainted waitress was back on her feet so my tale of sexual adventures with poultry was corroborated. She was removed from the premises after her name and address was taken as she had no money to pay for her meal (no purse or pockets, remember?) and I wandered over to the now empty table to clear it, sanitize it mightily, and find out if the ladies at the next table would like coffee and mints with their porn.

As I picked up her plate, it slowly dawned on me that the chicken bone of ill repute was nowhere to be found. Nowhere.

No pockets. No purse.

I'm just about done when this woman stumbles in through the door, pants covered in snow (she had clearly fallen down outside), and goes up to order. I'm a little mad that I have to re-mop, but it happens, so I keep cleaning as she takes her order. 

 Our line is set up so the bread and meat is on one side, veggies and toppings on the other. This lady, slurring, lists everything she wants on it at once (a LOT to remember). My coworker says ""I won't be able to remember all that, please wait.""

""Well everything else is down there, and I have to make the--""

 ""Aren't you supposed to be a sandwich artist?""

 ""Why not over here?""

""We only have one, ma'am.""

""Only one?""

""Hmmph. I'll be talking to your supervisor about that. I almost FELL.""

She gets done paying and the door opens again, her other drunk friend shuffling in. ""Oooh, be careful!"" She says to her friend. ""THEY DON'T PUT UP NO CAUTION SIGNS."" Still glaring at me.

Right?,75,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/16vnhi/everyone_has_a_crazy_regular_right/,"   There is a man that comes into my restaurant a couple times a week.  He's turning 70 in about a month and he has a very thick french accent.  He is also very, very needy.  Usually I am the only one with enough patience to deal with him but this is because he tips well (always at least 30%).  He always asks me to find him a nice girl.  I feel bad because he just seems lonely but he has such a strong personality... It's like a pungent cheese.  Not everyone can deal with it.  One time he asked me to find a woman ""No younger than 30 and slightly broken in"".  I told him I'd keep an eye out while trying not to crack up.  Often he says things that have me at a loss for what to say.
  The past few weeks he has been coming in with stacks of magazines, like the kinds of stacks you find at a doctor's office.  Everything from diabetic cooking magazines to the local news paper. He'll bring them in and leave them for us.  It's a little odd but whatever.  One day he made me sit down with him and write down the websites for a bunch of the magazines so I could subscribe to them.  Mind you, he isn't selling subscriptions.  I actually did sign up for a bridal magazine, but that was just to mess with my boyfriend.
   Anyway, last night he came in with a stack of magazines as usual and a plastic grocery bag.  I set him up with water and chat with him a minute.  Then he asks me to wait while he found something in one of the cooking magazines to show me.  He finds this recipe and shows it to me.  I agreed it sounded good.  Then, out of the plastic grocery bag, he pulled out a wrapped up piece of meat and asked me to tell the cook to prepare this recipe for him using the meat.  
   Now, I've had people come in with their own drinks before and frankly I don't care.  They aren't allowed to do that, but especially if the drink is like juice or something for a child, whatever.  That doesn't often happen in this restaurant though.  I have never, ever had a customer bring in their own meat and a recipe to go along with it.
   We didn't end up doing it, but that was by far one of the strangest requests I have ever gotten.

We also give out bottomless fries. My favorite (and unfortunately, recurring) question from guests is ""what does 'bottomless' mean?"" I usually respond with, ""it's like in Mary Poppins, when she sticks her hand in the bag and it just keeps going.""

Anywho, here is the story of the worst ""regulars"" I have ever seen and how I managed to get them fed up to the point where they never came back.

I had been working at this restaurant for about 6 months, but usually worked on weekdays/lunch shift on weekends. On one of my first Saturday night shifts I got sat with a table that was infamous for being rude/vaguely racist. My first warning came from the hospo, who stopped me on her way back to the front to say, ""I'm so sorry about table 73. It was your turn..."" On my way to greet the table, every server I passed groaned and whispered, ""I'm so sorry."" One server even said to me, ""It's a good thing you're white."" 

""Ok,"" I thought, ""at least I'm white."" I go up to the table and see an obese, 40s-ish man with two older women, one of which is probably his mother. Before I say anything, one of the women says, ""I want hot, fresh coffee."" There I am, a newbie server, completely thrown off my game by this woman who won't let me even introduce myself, much less give my corporate spiel about our Royalty Program (which is completely free and easy to sign up for, like a Kroger card. Plus if you sign up for one my manager won't be up my ass for the rest of the shift). Also, the man ordered a ""large"" Diet Coke. Once in a while I have a guest order a ""large"" soda, and I just bring them a soda in a pint glass, since that's all we have on the line. Also, we offer free refills (excuse me, ""bottomless"" refills), so there's really no need to specify a size when you're ordering a drink. 

So I take a coffee mug, fill it with hot water to let it warm up (which is  something I learned working at a coffee shop and not something I've ever seen another server do at my restaurant), empty it, and serve the coffee, regular-sized DC, and a glass of water to the table. The man puts his hand up before I even put his glass down and says, ""I know for a fact you have larger glasses than that. Bring me a larger glass."" Only at this point do I realize he REALLY wanted his DC in a large mug from the bar (there is one regular who comes in about 4 times a week that we serve soda to in a large stein. He is awesome. Last Christmas our bartenders all pitched in to buy him a stein with his name engraved into it that we keep behind the bar. Other than that, sodas go in a pint glass). Ok. I go to the bartender, who is in the weeds as usual, and wait until she has a spare second to get me a stein from the cooler. By the time I get back to the table, the woman's ""hot fresh coffee"" that I had dropped off earlier has gotten cold. I get yelled at, because I'm responsible for Newton's Law of Cooling. So I go start a fresh pot. By this time my 6 other tables are getting shitty service, which gets even shittier when the big dude starts grilling me about every item on the menu, asking me about every single burger (when all you need to know about the items is written on the menu. Every question he asked could literally be answered by reading the menu).

I put their order in, and when I drop off the check to the brown-skinned man at the table next to them, I hear the man mutter something along the lines of ""fucking Arabs, deport them all"". I made awkward eye contact with the offended guest, who tipped me well and left quickly. At one point I apologized to another table for not refilling their drinks quickly enough and they responded, ""it's ok. I see you have your hands full"", alluding to the asshole. When table 73's food was ready, I asked a black co-worker to run it for me (this table was apparently notorious for using the n-word). She was more than happy to, and responded to their scowls with the biggest smile I've ever seen.  

As you can imagine, their food came out all wrong and had to be re-made. The man then ordered a shake. When I brought it out, he claimed he had ordered it to-go. I told him I would gladly put it in a to-go cup, but he demanded to speak to a manager. I had been updating my GM about this table all night, so she knew things were not going well. The man complained to her that his check was more than it usually was. She pointed out to him that his check was $3.99 more than it usually was because he had ordered a $3.99 shake. He bitched to her for, no joke, 11 minutes because ""I come here every week and never pay this much, and besides, the service is always sub-par"". Basically, she told him he had to pay his full check amount and she didn't give a shit whether or not he came back (BTW, I LOVE my GM). That was about 12 months ago. I haven't seen him since. 

My other favorite serving stories, in no particular order:

-the woman who told me that if the (free, and, honestly, not very good) bread did not come out with her salad, she wouldn't pay for any of her meal. 

-the man who ordered fish'n'chips and requested fries instead of chips

-the woman who changed her baby's diaper AT THE TABLE

-I once had a group of 4 teenagers come in on a busy night and order only fries and water. I was feeling surprisingly charitable so only charged them for one basket of fries and brought them a couple of free refills. One of them decided to get an attitude with me and ""reminded"" me that they had actually asked for 4 baskets of fries. My response? ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I was trying to save you money by bringing by one basket at a time, but if you wanted 4 at once, by all means, I'll ring up 4 baskets."" He tried to apologize after I brought them their check. 

-the white woman who complained to my manager that I was racist and gave them bad service because her daughter was mixed race. The black woman who came in at the same time she did (and got the same service) overheard the conversation and told me I had done a wonderful job serving her and gave me a great tip.

**Disclaimer**: I work in the UK. I am still paid minimum wage but minimum wage for someone over 21 is £6.19ph ($9.42) here. I don't know cost of living in America but about 70% of my monthly wage is living expenses (that is rent, tax, bills, NOT food).
        

I work at a restaurant that puts a discretionary service charge of 10% on your bill automatically. 

**We do not get that**. 

It makes menu prices look cheaper. Less than 5% of that 10% tip is put into a kitty. I also can't take my tips above and beyond that- they go into the kitty too, then every **6 months** it is shared out between everyone- managers, duty managers, BOH, FOH, housekeeping, reception, everyone. We are not kept up to date on how much money is put into the tips box, we have no idea if we're being stiffed.

Despite the fact that I serve roughly 6 tables out of a total of 14 on a Friday &amp; Saturday night (we're a five star hotel with a Michelin star chef; the restaurant is not large capacity: even a busy night will usually only have 3 relays), between 2 and 6 guests per table, &amp; an average bill on a table of 2 comes to roughly £100, but very often upwards of £200, &amp; despite the fact that guests very often leave me good tips above and beyond the 10% they already think they gave me (I made £75 in above-and-beyond tips this Saturday over 5 tables, which I guess would make normal tips in America, but the ettiquette in the UK is to tip 10% not 20% &amp; in general the British are pretty poor tippers in my experience), when the 6month share came up I made £500. 

Most of you will probably know that that is some prime bullshit. If I were able to keep the tips I made (service charge included) only on Friday &amp; Saturday nights, even if I shared them with the other server &amp; the bar guy, *&amp; they didn't share theirs with me*, I would make my half yearly share in a month, month &amp; a half at most. When we have American guests, I often get tipped for breakfast, &amp; if I run into long-stay house guests when they are checking out, they will press me ten or twenty bucks for my service over the days they were here because I've usually served them every breakfast &amp; dinner &amp; room service for 3 or 4 days.

**For servers:**

Does this seem fucked up to you? Is anything illegal happening here &amp; can I do anything about it (regarding the service charge not going to staff)? I'm happy to share my tips with BOH &amp; reception but I can't help feeling pissed that my manager gets a share of my tips: is this fair? I mean if they hadn't done their jobs right I wouldn't be able to do mine as well as I do, but they also earn much more than me. I also feel a bit shorted that housekeeping get as much of my tips as I do considering they work 5 days out of 7, 9-4, &amp; we only have 11 rooms; I work 6 or 7 days out of 7, &amp; I just came off 15 days, 10 of which were splits and my usual split pattern is 7am-2pm 6pm-12pm. Am I just being a big baby here? I want to know if this is a legitimate problem because one of the other serving girls is very dissatisfied too &amp; one waitress and two duty managers have left since I started a year ago through dissatisfaction with the company, especially working hours and pay. 

**For Customers:**

What I'm saying is- be careful with your tips, folks. If a place doesn't give their discretionary service charge to the staff, often the staff can't tell you that, &amp; you won't be told that at interview if you apply to work there. I'd be fired if I told a customer that &amp; it got back to the company, because it cuts directly into profits as, like I said, it is there to offset cheaper menu prices. Also, although I am allowed to tell you that if you take off the service charge, the tip you leave will be shared amongst the staff, if you do take off the discretionary charge my manager will be on my case to find out why.

So my Grandma was my cousins and my Nanny when we were younger, so she would watch us after school and all day during the summers.  Well its mid-summer about nine years ago and I'm hanging out with Grandma and little cousin who was about two at the time.  My Grandma loves walking, so when it was about 10:30 am, we decided to put my little cousin in the stroller and take a walk to the local ice cream parlor after an early lunch and before it got too hot.

So we walk the three or so miles to the parlor, but when we get to the parking lot, my Grandma realizes she left her wallet at home.  Little eleven year old self was like ""Ah shit"" because it's getting warm and ice cream sounds delicious.  Well my Grandma being resourceful as always suggest we look around the parking lot because people always drop change there.  Lo and behold not five minutes later, we found a $20 bill on the ground, righteous right?  Not quite...

So we go into the parlor, she and I each get a scoop on a cone, and the total comes to no more than $5.  She hands the server the $20 and as I'm chin deep in this cone, the server opens up the bill (yes it was folded) and it turns out to be one of those fake bills with the bible quote about greed on the back.  At this point all three of us were thinking ""Ah fuck"", the teenager server looked like she was about to shit her pants because it appeared some Grandma was going to stiff her, but my Grandma swears up and down she didn't know it was fake and pleads if she can do an IOU and pay her back at around 5 pm when my Grandma was done watching us kids.  The girl agreed (I don't think she really had a choice) but to this day this astounds me because this was a chain parlor and I'm pretty sure any other server would have just laughed at us and demanded instant payment.

Fast forward to 5 pm and sure enough my Grandma comes back, pays in full, and tips the girl for being so nice and understanding.  The server was so surprised that my Grandma actually came back that she brought out the manager and they all just kind of laughed that someone actually followed up on an IOU....

So to you summer ice cream parlor worker from nine years ago, I thank you for actually having some faith in a little old lady and her grandkids and not ruining our ice cream run.

So I work the lunch shift at an upscale-casual local staple that is typically packed, but slows down some during summer. In a college town that's a given, but we'll still get a pop here and there, and weekends are consistent.

It's been a slow-ish week at the end of a slow-ish month, so I'm hoping for a big Saturday before having time off. And I get it; everything is going great, full section, tables flipping, high tabs with drinks and desserts on most, guests are pleasant, and I'm Prince muthafuckin Charming.

With one exception - around 1pm I met a man who did exactly all of the following, in this order: 

* Complained to our MOD about waiting 15 minutes for a table for 6 in the middle of the rush.
* Occupied this table with the only two members of his party who had arrived by the time it was ready. For over thirty minutes.
* Failed to acknowledge my presence in any way when I greeted the table; he just kept talking without looking up. I'd already approached and walked by a few times to let him wrap up his conversation. 
* Did it again after the rest of the party materialized.
* Interrupted me as I was telling the stragglers my name to begin ordering for himself and his wife.
* Asked for a turkey burger. Medium-rare. Wouldn't accept fully cooked poultry and chose something else.
* Resumed loudly talking with (at?) his late companions as I tried to answer their questions about the specials.
* Didn't want a refill. Yet. But would. Later.
* Argued with his friend over who got to pay - a classic Insist-Off.


To top it all off, they were joined after settling the bill by two friends I assume they saw walking by on the sidewalk (patio table). These be-shopping-bagged ladies pulled up chairs blocking my only path to two other tables and ordered water and an iced tea.  Happily, they all left after not much longer, and I didn't charge for the tea because hassling them for hassling me just seemed like more hassle than it was worth by that point. Also, I had started to suspect they were simply fucking with me, and I wanted to include some small reward if that was the case, because it was pretty impressive.

The rest of my day was great - had the highest sales and consistent 20%+ tips. Bizarre how all your customers can be a dream come true, and one man can do almost everything you hate by the numbers as if it was on purpose.

It's less a ""bar"" and more just spread out tables in the lobby. A woman and her son sat down at the furthest table from the bar. I greet them, take their drink orders. The boy ordered a Coke and the woman ordered a martini, and they both needed dinner menus. The bartender Y, as usual, made a huge martini- one that barely fit into the glass. It was definitely going to spill if I put it on a tray (carrying martinis or empty beer bottles on a tray is impossible for me). 

Instead, I put the dinner menus behind my arm and carried the two drinks out in my hands. Of course, the martini spills as soon as I start walking, and I stop at the first table (which no one had been sitting at), and carefully wipe off the base of the martini glass with an *unused* cloth napkin. From across the bar, the woman exclaims, ""She just wiped off my martini with a dirty napkin!"" I let the menus fall from my arm, immediately turn around and tell Y to put the martini in a new glass. I can't believe her reaction, though. It's not as if I dipped a dirty napkin into her martini! 

Y rolls her eyes and makes a new martini for the woman. Apparently the woman comes into the hotel all the time and raises hell for something- she realizes her eggs are overcooked after eating her entire breakfast, her fork was dirty, the wait was an hour, etc. Y, who is incredibly hospitable and amazing, ends up taking the table to spare me. Y gives her great service, as usual, and I happily checked up on her when I went to my other tables. Anyway, she ends up tipping less than 10% and fills out a survey and gives us a bad score (which mean *a lot* at our hotel). It sucked and I feel like I'm to blame.

I work in a burger place, not quite fastfood, where you go up and order at the register, and I bring your food to your table and get you anything else you may need. I do pretty much everything like make some of the food, clean tables, serve food, and take orders. We can get fairly busy at lunch time which is when I work pretty much every day. 
I like my managers. They like me. No problems getting along with them. The only problems comes with their management skills. We are extremely understaffed and that's only due to them not wanting to pay another employee. I get extremely frustrated some days because I have about 20 different things to do at once and no one to help me. Another thing is them not paying their employees on time or not paying someone at all. Yesterday I planned on getting my paycheck but they had ""forgotten"" to bring them because they had a busy weekend. That's no excuse. The other day the main cook, who gets paid on salary, had another cook take his place for a few hours because he could not be there. My managers did not even pay that man for being there. Is that illegal? Also, my managers pay one of the cooks money out of the register (about 50$) every week so they don't have to put it on payroll to be taxed. Is this ok to do? 
My manager has become too dependent on me. I am starting to work only weekends June 10th which also happens to be the day they go on vacation for 12 days. TWELVE DAYS. They want me to work extra while they're gone even though I have already told them I cannot work weekdays starting on that date. They are leaving the store to 3 servers, including myself, and the 2 cooks. We have not hired another employee yet and I'm really nervous we won't find someone and have them trained by the time my managers go out of town. I personally do not think they should leave their business, which is already struggling, to three people, two of which are still in high school. They expect me to be in charge of the business while they are gone and I do not want that responsibility, especially when I am just starting summer courses. I'm their best server, and I do not want to leave them at a time like this, but I do not agree with what they're doing. Does anyone else share any similar problems?

edit: also, I am a bit suspicious they are not paying the cooks overtime. The cooks work between 40-60 hours a week.

I complained to the waitress that this was not what I ordered, and she brought it back out, with the cucumbers removed, and said ""You didn't ask for no green peppers, not no cucumbers, so we weren't really sure what the problem was, but they picked out the cucumbers for you.""  At this point I told her that the menu said nothing about cucumbers for this item but did for similar items, and she was kind surprised, and apologized.

You know the type. The people who don't care if you're on a ***two hour wait*** , or the ones who are completely oblivious to the fact that every table around them is empty and clean and there are no servers around but theirs, and they STILL decide to sit and chat...and chat...and chat...and chat until you're almost contemplating just sitting and staring at them awkwardly until they get the hint.  
  
Most of us have the same problem. Unfortunately, we can't say ""Excuse me, I hate to sound rude, but there's a rather long wait at the door. If you'd like, I can try to get you a spot at the bar."" or something similar... We can't offend anyone.  
So over the years of serving at various places, I've come up with a few ways to help get the hint across to campers without offending or upsetting anyone.  
  
For people who camp while it's busy:  
-Bug the crap out of them.  Seriously. Once you drop that check, check back *very* frequently. It's easy for them to get lost in conversation and lose track of time. Don't let them forget you're there and that other people want to sit and eat just like they did.  
  
-While they have the check, say ""Is there anything else I can get for you before you head out?   Would you like any drinks to go?"" etc. Keep hinting.  
  
-My personal favorite, act confused.  For example ask them (in a quizzical manner) ""Was there anything else I can get for you?"" or ""I'm sorry, I got a little tied up in the back. Was there anything else you needed?"" Etc.  A nice way of saying ""why the hell are you still here?"" lol  
  
  
 For people who camp when you're cut:  
-If you're in a section with chairs, (or if they can see the chairs of someone else's section) start putting those chairs up on the table to sweep and leave them up after you sweep. (even if you just mock sweep).  This almost always works.  
-Mention to another coworker (politely) plans for after work. Mention that you're cut and how you need to study or pick up your kids or whatever you need to do when you're off work (which you can't be til these guys leave...)  Just basically remind them you're a real person with responsibilities as well..   
  
And whatever you do, do NOT ignore them.  Some people I work with do that, but 99% of the time, it only results in them getting lost in their own little chatty worlds and staying as long as possible.  
  
I'd love to hear any other suggestions you guys have.  :)

However, I live in the 'South' (Northern VA) and I'm surprised at how racist some people can be! 

My horror story begins:
It was a normal day I work and I got a table. As I'm grabbing silverware, I size up the table to see what kind of guest I was dealing with (business men, family, group of friends, etc...). There was a very nicely dress African American woman with her two young sons, who were also well dressed. I walk over and greet them, asking them how they were  and whatnot. And before I could introduce myself, the lady interrupted me and said very loudly, ""I'm going to work you like you worked my ancestors! And don't expect any compensation for it.""  I had no clue what to say, so I just stood there and said ok. The lady was true to her word and had me running for the whole time she was there. She even snapped at me for asking her son if he liked his meal. I told my manager what she had said and he even made a point to stop by the table and see of ever thing was going alright.  The lady told him that everything was lovely and the service was great.  She was honest. When she and her sons left, there was exact change left on the check presenter. 

I have had stuff like this happen before where I have been called a 'little white brat' and a 'stupid cracker girl', but I think what bothered me the most about his lady was that she said it in front of her children.

Tonight was a different story...Toward the end of the dinner rush I was sat with a table of nine. Looked to me like family friends, 30-60 years of age.

I work at sports-themed restaurant, and the only time that I enjoy being at work when the audio is on for games is during hockey season. I follow the Blackhawks, have for several years, and that is the local team.

Anyways, we have several ""Blackhawks regulars"" that would come in for every game. This one lady in particular stood out to me as soon as I met her. We'll call her Sue (changed for anonymity). She's older (60s), always came in alone, had a memo book with all the players names and numbers, a crossword book, and wore a Blackhawks hat every time. She normally was not in my section because she sat at the bar rail (bartender's turf), but I would come up and talk to her about the game and the players that she likes and just hockey overall.

For game 6 last week, she actually sat in my section for once. She got all of our other ""hockey regulars"" to sit in my section, also. So I was super busy with my other tables, plus the added 12 regulars. The bartender pulled me over for a moment to let me know that these people don't tip very well. I didn't care at the moment because I was too busy, keeping up with the game and my other tables and all.

At the end of the game, it was celebration city in the entire restaurant, with the Blackhawks winning the Stanley Cup that night. As I was high-fiving all of my other patrons, Sue pulls me into a giant hug. I cash out everyone, and I'm going through all my books. Between all the Blackhawks regulars that Sue brought to my section, I have over $100. When I looked at my book from her, not only had she tipped me 100% (~$50), there was a note on the credit slip saying to check my pocket. She had slipped a $20 into my pocket!

I was hoping she would come in today for the NHL draft so I could thank her, but no such luck. Sue is really an amazing person and she helped me have a superbly awesome night at work.

I work in the restaurant/bar area of a hotel, whereas I'm pretty good waiting tables and serving food the bar is where I'm at my best. With it being a hotel we often get big groups of people coming in: stag/hen parties, people going to an event in the city over the weekend or just families on a break so I get to meet a lot of new people. This Friday we were quite busy, we had a large group of older women in the restaurant who were down for a conference and there was a Speedway event on the Saturday night that a lot of people had come down for the weekend for. I was on the bar and, although it was pretty busy, things were running smoothly and everyone seemed very happy.

Anyway, in comes a group that was two separate families who were down for the Speedway event, they sit down and the two dads come to the bar to order a round. They start with a Guinness, which I put on straight away as it takes time to settle before you finish it off, and proceed to tell me the rest of their drinks orders. As I'm doing their other drinks one of the guys leans right over the bar and pulls back the Guinness tap. I look at him and say: ""sorry sir, I was just leaving that to settle before I top it up for you"". He looks at me smugly and replies: ""it's okay, I used to work in the business mate so I'm just helping you out"". He wasn't helping. I know how to pour drinks and I don't care if you 'used to work in the business', at this moment in time I'm running the bar and you're a punter, so keep your mits off my pumps. I finish off the drinks and top off his Guinness, making sure it was well poured for him with and fully settled before I hand it over. All seems well.

The next night after their Speedway event they come back to the hotel and to the bar, once again I'm running the bar and it was a very busy night. Alongside the two aforementioned groups we had in house, we also had a large wedding party and just the general Saturday night business. They come to the bar, order their drinks again and leave happily only this time the ex-pro seemed a bit miffed that he'd had to wait a while and I'd served a couple of others just buying bottled beer whilst his Guinness settled properly. As I was the only one on the bar at that time I did this just so a large crowd wouldn't gather as we waited like two minutes for his drink to settle but it's standard practise anyway.

Later on he returns to the bar and it's quietened down a bit but I'm still serving customers. I'm literally in the middle of taking an order/doing some drinks for a woman when he shouts at me ""listen mate, start us a Guinness off there so it won't take so long this time"". I acknowledge his existence but I choose to ignore his request because I'm dealing with someone else. As soon as I've finished the woman's drinks I start off his Guinness for him. I take his money and once again do a couple of quick orders while we wait. Once again I finish off the Guinness so it's properly poured and hand it to him. Rather than say thanks he looks at the Guinness and then looks at me with a face of sheer disgust and utter disdain; you'd think I'd taken the Guinness and flung it in the face of his first born by the look he had on him. 

There's no resolution or happy ending, he didn't complain but I just felt like venting my frustration that somebody who was so proud and vocal about his experience ""in the business"" could have so little respect for me and for the other patrons of the bar. Next time mate, try asking politely and being less of a miserable sod. It makes for a more pleasant experience for everybody.

**TL;DR** - *Miserable know it all gets wound up because he orders a drink that requires time to settle but then has to wait for it to settle.*

What's yours?,77,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/169eed/my_favorite_freak_out_moment_at_work_whats_yours/,"Last spring I had a night that will live long after I'm gone from my current restaurant. I work at a corporate chain in a very economically and racially diverse area so I get every type of customer imaginable. I also need to mention that at the time I was 4 or 5 months pregnant. So I went to greet a table that looked and acted like they had just emerged out of a crack den and had never been to a restaurant before. The first guy asked if we had raspberry iced tea. I told him we did. Then the woman sitting next to him asks me the same question. My hackles are already going up. I get their drinks and take their order. The guy orders a burger and then proceeds to change everything about it and add a million different things. This burger seriously went from $10 to $14. When I sent the order to the kitchen it looked like an essay with all the memos and extra charges. After running me around like I didn't have 5 other tables to take care of, the guy liked the burger so much that he wanted to order another one to go. Our computer has a repeat button that copies the last entree exactly as you put it in. I pressed repeat and waited for the burger. When it came up, I started boxing it up. I turned and started walking to the table, when I realized that one or two of the modifiers was not correct. I was literally at the end of my rope after a long, exhausting shift filled with pain in the ass customers (I'm also pregnant and irritable) and I had slipped and fallen on my hip in the dish area earlier (while wearing non-slip shoes). I stormed back on to the line and started screaming at the kitchen while I swung the to-go bag against the dessert fridge. I then proceeded to take the burger out, mash it in my rage filled hands , and throw it on the counter. The kitchen usually acts like they can do no wrong at my work (when they get stuff wrong all the time), but they were just like ""Dude, just remake it, don't ask her anything."" I later apologized to the kitchen and they were cool, but scared of me for a little while after that.

Lots of people just came in grumpy and nothing could make them happy. And as the lunch rush was ending, this woman came in. 

She was with her husband and 2 adult (early 20s) daughters and one toddler granddaughter. Before I could even get my corporate-mandated spiel out suggesting one beer and one cocktail, she cut me off saying ""I want a white peach mint tea and don't try to tell me you don't have it because I'll get your manager right now and let him know how to make it. And oh yeah, it's free refills so don't try to charge me."" So apparently this was a mocktail we had about 4 years ago as a seasonal but she insists we make it for her every time. 

Her tone of voice and attitude were the worst thing about her. Everything she said was implying that she was right and you were wrong and you better not dare try to contradict her. I bet she does this shit at other restaurants too. 

She asked about a special we run a couple times a year. It runs for about 6 weeks about 3 or 4 times a year and just ended last week. I told her it wasn't on right now and she was furious. ""It JUST started!"" she yelled at me. I started to mumble ""well actually it was going for 6 weeks"" and she just caustically cut me off with ""whatever! You run these specials for a few days but put the ads on Facebook to get us in the door."" 

She (not the rest of the table, but SHE) ran me around for a solid hour. Everyone who encountered her got the ""you're a piece of shit and you better try to please me right now"" treatment. I had a really hard time tending to my other tables. 

At the end of their visit as I was clearing plates and they were declining dessert, etc, she said ""get me another white peach mint tea, my free refill. One for here and 2 to go."" Well we usually happily make one to-go for a guest who is on the way out the door. But someone having one there too? That constitutes 2 more drinks to get 2 to-go. I rang them in accordingly. And of course the bartender had been irritated to make these things the whole time. I brought the check and she freaked the fuck out that I charged her for the 2 to go. ""These are REFILLS!"" she was practically screaming. At that point I got my manager. Sadly, she deleted the ""refills"" off the check. 

The party of 5 had split 3 menu items so their bill was only about 30 after their not having to pay for the ""refills."" They tipped $5 and continued to camp in one of my 2 best tables for the remaining 2 hours of my shift.

I got called in (last minute) to cover a morning shift that usually consists of serving road workers, most of whom do not really want to be waited on by a guy.

We open the restaurant to discover that there is a 25 top of kids on a field trip coming for lunch.  Panic mode.  Kids are generally not fun to wait on and 20+ sounds like a nightmare.  The group arrives and we discover that the party consists of two different Special Ed classes. FML.  

Fast forward 30 minutes later and everyone has finally ordered amidst the chaos and the place has unexpectedly filled up.  Now that the grill is backed up, I am left to refill non-transparent kids cups with lids to a party that refuses to sit and stay in one place.  

Food comes out flawlessly.  I am exhausted and flustered beyond belief.  Most kids finally settle down and start eating with the exception of one little boy who has had four Cokes already and is screaming at me across the restaurant for more.

In most cases I would not hesitate to be a complete smart-ass and hound the parents for not controlling their kids, but who can yell at a mentally challenged kid?  I swallow my pride and prepare to give the kid another Coke when one of the chaperones stops me in front of the child.  The chaperone makes the kid stop yelling, then apologize to me and shake my hand before I give him another drink.

To me, it looked like she had eaten about half of her onion rings, and she flagged me down and said that she was not gonna pay for the onion rings because they were cold by the time she got her 2nd burger, I told my manager what happened, he went to talk to the table, and ended up taking the onion rings off.

So a friend of mine was working at a restaurant in St. Louis at the time. One day, a woman walked in, sat down, and ordered pasta with pesto... but no oil.

Pesto, in case you are unaware, is a combination of garlic, parsley, and various other spices - IN OIL. So naturally, oil-less pesto is gonna taste like shit. But what the hell, customer is always right, yadda yadda yadda, so they make the order.

No less than five minutes after her order comes out, she shrieks for the person who made her pasta, which happened to be my friend, and berated him for making what was basically a pile of doggy doo-doo and wanted compensation. My friend stopped her in the middle of her rant and said, ""Miss, do you know what pesto is?"" Upon receiving a prompt no, he told her, and then said, ""So if you tell us to make it without oil, how do you expect it to taste like pesto?! That's like expecting me to make gourmet cheese without milk.""

Please don't think that I am not grateful to all the moms out there. 

I work at a chain restaurant famous for 'I want my baby back ribs.' It's very family friendly so a lot of families with littles (under the age of four) come in. I normally don't mind them as long as the children are well behaved and for the most part, they are.  When I come by with the littles's drinks, I normally place them in front of mom and dad saying 'I'll leave this in your jurisdiction' due to the fact that some littles get excited and the drink ends up in their lap.

When I say this, I normally get an 'Oh thanks!' Or 'I guess you've seen him chug it before'. But every couple of tables I get someone who says 'You must be a mom.' 

Now, I'm 21 but I've been told by a lot of people that I can still pass for 17. And when this man said this to me I politely told him 'Nope, I just always think what would my mom do. And if your son is tossing crayons, I'm not so eager to give him wet ammo.'  The man laughed and meal went along as usual. 

I had another incident like this only I said 'Nope I'm only 20' ( this was a couple months ago), the mother got very indignant and told me that she had her oldest at 17 with her husband. I awkwardly changed the subject and went away thinking 'Well, I don't want to be anything like you...'

One night, rather early in our shift, my coworker (and the only other server working at the time) excuses himself to use the restroom, which we share with the gas station.

""Yes, sir.  We are on a long wait, if you want to get a table you have to go up to the host stand (eye twitch, maniacal smile)""

*  A couple comes in as I am putting menus down on said table, talking among themselves about which table they want to sit at.  They come up to me, ""So we can just sit anywhere we want, right?""

(rabid grin, breathing hard from running my ass off everywhere) ""No, sorry guys.  We're actually on a couple hour-long wait, but if you go up to the host stand there, they can help you out!""

*  I seat a man and his son, the man proceeds to tell me that our Yelp reviews are just horrible, and the Urbanspoon ones aren't much better.  He ""knows better, because [he] is a regular and loves our food and service, but those reviewers are just self-entitled assholes who nitpick everything""

He then proceeds to flag me down WHILE I'm seating a table to show me our Urbanspoon percentage on his smartphone and talk more bullshit about how the reviewers suck.  I politely excuse myself to go check the bathrooms and claw my face off with frustration.

*  Couple comes to the host stand to get on the wait list, I tell them that if they want to go to the bar that they can get faster service, etc.  The woman: ""okay, we'll go to the bar""

""Great, have fun!""

""...Aren't you going to give us a pager?"" (cue snooty, huffy voice)

""Oh, would you like me to put you on the list?  I thought you were going up to the bar!""

""Uhm, yes, but we are going to the bar to wait for our table""

""okay, no problem!"" (gives pager, etc.)

I page them after about ten minutes, and the husband tells me to ""just set the menus on the table, we're going to finish our drinks before we go over there""

Okay, whatever.  ""Your table is right over there, sir!  It's all set for you when you're ready""

* We had to shut the kitchen down at nine PM instead of our usual eleven because we ran out of food.  Cue guests being OUTRAGED that WE did this to piss them off, because everything is the servers' and hosts' fault

I got so many stories but a terrible memory,  so let me tell you guys one that comes to mind. 
Let's start by saying that the place I work out does NOT get busy on a Saturday lunch at all...  we get the occasional pizza party and maybe a couple of tables. that's just the way it goes. It's worth mentioning and helpful to the story to say that our dine in pies are more expensive than the to go pies and additional 3$ to be exact.

wall of text ahead. 

Saturday lunch, dead as it could be a couple come in. I can tell the lady will be a pain in the ass before she even comes in,  from now on we'll  call her Lucifer...

 it was a warm day out so we had the AC on so here this lady comes and takes a seat without waiting for me to seat her although there's a huge 'Wait to be seated' sign before you enter the dinning room but anyway.  whatever plenty people do it and although it bugs me I let it slide. Lucifer sits down and before I introduce myself, she announces she's got a 3$ off a large pizza coupon. I really don't care if people use a coupon or not, because at least 60% of people make up on tips. so with my nicest voice I tell her that that won't be a problem. So they order a pie and a couple of drinks and I see Lucifer crossing her arms hinting that it's cold inside the dinning room so I see her husband prepared to run  over to the car to get her coat..  since there wasn't anyone else in the dinning room I decided to save him some time I'd just lower the ac..  she didn't even say thank you. after a few mins she said it was too hot ...  at this point I'm on my whatever mood but let it slide since I realized she must just be a bitter lady. I bring them the pepperoni pizza they ordered. I wait the obligatory minute or two and make sure everything it's okay. 

me: Is everything okay folks? 
Lucifer: it's just fine. 

at this point her husband is already rolling his eyes at her and understands my frustration. 

So they finish eatin their food and Lucifer asks for the check while I promptly ask her for the coupon. now the plain pizza for dine in is 14.95 plus a topping it's 16.95 plus tax . So I proceed to give them the check where I had already deducted the coupon.. and i shit you not this lady goes bezerker on me. She demands to speak to the manager to the owner because of the travesty of a pizza pie being 16.95
conversation went a little like this. 

Luci: What is this price you're giving me. Oh my god.  this is why you guys are going bankrupt (we aren't) and this is why it is so dead this lunch.  noone is going to come eat pizza at a restaurant for such a price. 
me: Well we ARE usually slow on Saturday lunch because most business we get throughout the week is from office buildings around the area where executives come to eat and since they don't work weekends then it's usually dead on Saturday lunches. But I assure you we are far from going bankrupt we been open for over 13 years and are doing quite steady compared to restaurants in the area. 

Luci: This is impossible, I'm sure you're lying this place looks like it's about to close down (this location has been open for 5 years and it was built from the ground up to be a restaurant so none of that closing down nonsense) 

this is when she says the thing that makes me almost laugh out loud as I work 66 hours a week. out of the 77 we r open. 

Luci: I know you guys sell your pies for 6$ my son gets em all the time,  you're trying to scam me. You guys are going to lose my son's business he Always comes here and he gets 6 or 7 dollar pies. and now you are trying to scam me. 

Me: *Jokers grin on my face I had already resigned to get a tip from them* Excuse me lady noone is trying to scam you or trying to steal your money, HERE IN THE MENU IT SHOWS THAT PIES ARE 14.95 AND EACH TOPPING IS 2 EXTRA. I charged you accordingly and deducted the 3$ from the coupon. furthermore we NEVER have 6 or 7 dollar pies. A coupon wrongly went out on the mail with a 5.95 price tag for pizzas printed on it at which price we are actually losing money. (I was a little dramatic but 5.95 is right on the border of us losing money on a pizza. but the owner was honoring the coupons) So if your son is only ordering pies using that coupon then we are better off without his business as well! besides that our pizzas ARE never under any circumstances that low. 

Luci: *blank stare* *husband trying to not make eye contact very embarrassed* I'm never coming back here again and I'll be sure to tell my son to never order from here again. 

I wish this story would end well but the manager was there and he got an earful of what she said and although he didn't agree. he knew my boss would chew him up if he heard about this. So he charged them 11.95 plus the topping and then took out the 3$ from the coupon and Lucifer was content. 

They left some change as tip I guess although her husband was extremely apologetic rolling his eyes at her and shaking his head. 

So that's how my story ended. I never got in trouble.  I never saw that lady again that happened about 3 or four months ago. I'm happy I actually told her off. I think it's a little sad that my manager/boss will give in to any idiot complaining loud enough. I wouldn't need their business if they were such trash. 

**tl;dr: Lady comes with coupon and raises hell when pizza pie is a couple dollars more than what she thought it would be. I tried to stand my ground since we didn't do anything wrong,  but manager gave in at the end **",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1i1cnc,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1i1cnc/old_lady_from_hell/,

They were an older, middle-aged man and wife. I helped them find the bottle of wine they had during their previous visit by narrowing it down to three bottles from their description and then offering them samples of the three. They were very nice and seemed happy with their service. Until...

Their food came up. The expo immediately grabbed their dishes from under the heat lamp and I followed right after with ground pepper and cheese. When I got to the table the lady said, ""Oh, there you are."" 

Me: ""Oh, sorry. Did you need something?""

Lady (in a snooty voice): ""No, but the other girl had to get our food for us.""

Me (confused because I was only about 5 steps behind the expo): ""Oh yeah, that's our expo. She runs the food to tables.""

The husband didn't seem bothered but the lady still looked unsatisfied. About 5 minutes later she asked for her food to be reheated so I brought it to the kitchen. Once again, when it was ready the expo brought it out. My party was starting to arrive so I couldn't bring it myself, but that's the expos job anyways. When the lady got her food back she said, "" It must have been sitting for a while before it was brought to us."" The expo replied,"" I'm sorry it wasn't hot enough but I saw the chef put it up and took it out right away."" The lady still seemed confused and just said, ""Oh.""

I wasn't annoyed or upset by her though as I figured she probably had never encountered an expo and therefore did not understand that they are there specifically to run food for the servers. She was very nice but also probably, very confused. My manager and I got a good chuckle out of it.

My GM tells me to ask if she wants it toasted, which she does. I explain to her they will have to put it on the grill because our toaster has butter in it, and she says that is perfectly fine. 

When I bring out the sandwich she calls me over, while I am talking to another table to tell me that there is no way she can eat it because the bun is burnt ( it wasn't, there were the perfect amount of grill marks) and because SHE IS ALLERGIC TO TOMATOES. 

This is important, because she ordered a BBQ sandwich. At a BBQ restaurant. Whose menu clearly states the BBQ comes with sauce on it. 

So she says to just give her a bun without toasting it (NO BUTTER- she's allergic to that too) and no sauce on her pork. At which point I explain that meat sauce we use to moisten the pork has sauce in it too (no, no, that's ok, I just need the regular sauce left off).

We were actually on a wait list for the majority of the shift, which is very rare for us (I think in the 5 years of working there, the lunch shift has only been on a wait list like 3 or 4 times), and since I was the only busser, I figured I would make bank. There have been days where we haven't been as busy as I was yesterday that I made at least 60-70 bucks in tips, so I figured at the absolute minimum I would make 50.

I got my tips today, turns out I only made 40. I was really disappointed and upset, especially when several of the servers I worked with yesterday told me how much they tipped me out. I thought the tips had been figured out wrong, so I asked my manager if she would check to see if they were correct. She did, and they were. When I found out, I was visibly upset.
Then, my manager called me over to the lobby. She got out the tip sheet and showed me how much each server tipped me out, re-did the math on the calculator, and sure enough, 40 bucks. She then said, ""I know the tips were done correctly, but I feel bad because you worked your butt off yesterday."" She then pulled 10 bucks out of her pocket, handed it to me, and then hugged me. ""I love you, I don't want you to be upset. I want you to have this because you always go out of your way to do stuff for me. If you ever think the tip sheets are wrong, let me know and I'll go over them."" I almost cried.

Before I continue, let me tell you a little about my manager. She's a grandma, in her late 60s, early 70s, and is an absolute sweetheart. I have worked with her for 5 years and loved every minute of it. She treats all of us like family,  so I really don't mind doing extra work and running errands and stuff for her. The past two years or so, she has relied on me for a lot of ""extra"" stuff. We have a beverage cart that belongs to the amusement park, but we basically control it. Every morning, I open and stock the cart for the cart clerk, do inventory,  drink orders, etc. I also help do other jobs inside the restaurant, such as hostess, run food, scrape dishes, clean bathrooms, and make copies of our paperwork.
Occasionally, she'll give me 5 bucks here and there for doing all this stuff for her, so the 10 that she gave me today was more than I was used to.

For the rest of the day, I did whatever extra work she asked me to do. I mean, she already paid me 10 bucks of her own money, so I was more than glad to do whatever she asked without expecting anything else from her. Then, about half an hour before the end of my shift, she came up to me, smiling. ""Look at what that gentleman gave me,"" she said, holding up a 5 and a few ones. ""Here, I don't keep tips, I want you to have it,"" and shoved it in my pocket. I tried to tell her to keep it because it was meant for her, but she wouldn't take it back.

Tl;dr: I was disappointed when I didn't make as many tips as I thought I should have, so my manager gave me 18 bucks out of her own money.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1375054586.0,,,True,t3_1j8orj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1j8orj/i_have_the_best_manager_ever/,

- I seat an old woman in another server's section and she is crotchety, complaining about shedding napkin linens and tries to order wine after wine that we don't have.

- The restaurant has done away with conventional tables, and substituted picnic tables. There are no seat numbers and I'm running food.
- Extra tables have been added but no one's told me their numbers and they're not in the computer.

Rio was our stop over point a few times so we got to know this city pretty well. One evening we went for dinner at Garota De Ipanema - which is the restaurant where the ""Girl from Ipanema"" was penned.

This was our second time there before the food and service was so good. When we arrived the place was packed and the only open table was right next to the entrance. There is no door on this place, so as I sat there with my side directly at the entrance opening I hear screaming.

It kept getting louder and louder until finally we could see it was a guy wearing a Brazil jersey just screaming at nothing. He walks right over to the entrance and was within a foot of me, still screaming.

His hand was next to his face and shaking violently with a clenched fist. His other hand was in his pocket. It was at this point we realized his yelling was in English - sort of.

I say sort of because he was talking about how the world was out to get him because he was the senator of the united states of Canada. Being Canadian we were embarrassed he would be claiming to be one of us, even if it was in a completely cracked out way.

His rant continued, then he admitted he was from Quebec. Oh, thank goodness. He isn't a real Canadian. 

Now that we've cleared that up, this guy was dangerously close to my face and clearly high on some drug. I didn't know what would happen at this point and just before I could get up just in case I needed to defend myself from a crazy crackhead, the waiters came running over and pushed him back out into the street and made sure he walked far away before they returned to their jobs. 

Those guys were unbelievable servers and they definitely earned their tip that night - and I'd like to think it was a good one. 


**EDIT:** I understand Quebec is an actual part of Canada. My comment was a facetious joke aimed at the ongoing geopolitical issue of separation in Quebec.

This is an update to my original post [To quit or not to quit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/17rw8k/to_quit_or_not_to_quit/)

If you would rather read about regular old Cluck n Feed adventures feel free to take a gander at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/18cpwa/cluck_n_feed_1_the_man_in_the_wheelchair/)

I'm hoping I did the links right. Sorry if I messed them up, still learning Reddit.

Cast list:
Grumpy pants - Marinara Manager (Formerly known as Tweedle Dee I changed his name because it might get confusing)
Micro - Chef who sexually harassed me / bullied me
Sweaty - General Manager (Formerly known as Tweedle Dum)
BB - Fillmeup Manager and Owners son
Whiskey and AmBear - Coworkers

Now on with the tale...
I put in my two weeks notice on the 10th of this month (this past Sunday) and needless to say my boss was not happy. In my reasons I wrote ""Moving on"" because he was watching me write it and I chickened out. Most of you guys told me to talk to HR and not quit because quitting would mean admitting defeat. Between my initial post and my notice I learned of a few other key issues going on at the Marinara location that basically pissed me off enough to quit. 

The next day I worked at another location. The one I originally work at will be known as Marinara and this second location will be Fillmeup. So while working at Fillmeup I took a moment to tell my manager, BB, that I was leaving and when he asked me why I told him the truth. In addition to everything that has happened in my last post Micro has also bullied countless other coworkers of mine. Things he would tell us:
*You can't do your job, you should just quit
*What's wrong with you? Is this your first day? Should I tell Grumpy Pants to fire you?
*You're drunk! You can't do your job because you're drunk! (I mean seriously?)
*Are you stupid? Are you even awake? What's wrong with you? Just leave.

That's only a few things. He has made other coworkers cry and will mostly pick on the women. Sometimes he'll refuse to acknowledge a female server and just ask the male server standing next to her to repeat what she said. One of the most appalling things I discovered is that they have actually put shit in people's food. AmBear has found hairs, plastic, and even a penny in her food before. All of which Grumpy Pants is fully aware.

I told BB that I was leaving because I was unwilling to work for a company that would allow this treatment of the service staff and that I am seriously considering taking it to the NLRB. BB was shocked, SHOCKED to hear what was going on over at Marinara Cluck n Feed. He asked me why I never came to him earlier and to be completely honest it was because Grumpy Pants will tear us apart if we ever went above his head. I asked BB how to reset a printer once a few months ago and Grumpy Pants LOST IT! He didn't yell but he was definitely harsh. ""You NEVER go above my head EVER. AGAIN!"" 

I told BB how Grumpy Pants will also threaten to take away hours if you don't do as he says. He has threatened to take away my hours if I didn't pick up a shift even though I just plain couldn't. He will use threats and anger to get his way, but most of all he allows the kitchen staff to treat us the same. After I told him everything about what was going on, BB thanked me and disappeared into his office.

Today (Tuesday in case you're in a very different time zone) I worked in the morning at Fillmeup and clocked out around 12:30. BB and Sweaty were waiting for me. I sat down with them and told Sweaty everything I had told BB the day before. He was shocked as well. Not only as Grumpy Pants but with Micro. Apparently he is an ANGEL around BB and Sweaty. I told him everything and they begged me to reconsider my resignation. I told them I would think about it. 

A few hours later I received a call from my coworker Whiskey and he told me all about how he was questioned by Sweaty and basically confirmed everything I said earlier. Next thing I know I get a call from Sweaty telling me I was now officially on a week long paid leave pending an investigation into the Marinara Cluck n Feed. This Thursday I'm meeting with HR to repeat my story for the hundredth time. I'm scared to see what happens next. Part of me feels bad if Grumpy Pants gets fired because he is nice... sometimes... but fuck all with Micro. I'll keep you updated.

I have many stories from the year I worked there but one couple stands out the most. 

They were very pleasant older couple, late 40s-early 50s. We were slow that night so I would stay and talk with them as they wanted. I was about 17 at the time and still in high school. 

They would ask about classes and how I was doing in them, a little personal but whatever I'm an open person. They were happy I was doing well and said I was wonderful at my job and had great work ethic.

So far just sweet little innocent complements. They then mentioned that they used to have a daughter my age that passed away in a car accident, she had been drinking. They said she was always unruly and had horrid grades. I gave my sympathies for her passing and was edging away cause they were getting a bit odd.

The woman said she would be so proud to have me as a daughter and would always treat me wonderful. The man said he would get me my own car even (I had mentioned I didn't drive because my parents wouldn't allow me till I was 18) They said they had tons of room at their house in the country and plenty of money. 

I wanted to run and lock my self in the bathroom at this point, the looks they had were positively frightening! They were like lions eyeing their next meal. I just kinda laughed and said that I already had parents and pretended someone called me from the kitchen. 

I made my coworker give them the check as I hid in the kitchen. The cook saw himself as a big brother and said he'd set them straight but I said they were only being sweet. My coworker came back with my tip and a phone number saying they wanted me to call them to talk more about it.

I handed my pen to the girl at the window (I was bagging the food for her) and she passed it to the customer. He dropped the cap to the pen in his car, and handed the signed receipt back. My co-worker politely asked for the cap back, but he didn't want to go to the trouble (I'm not sure what his exact words were). She explained that it wasn't her pen, and he replied ""Well I'm sure the owner won't mind.""

Even though nothing else was said on the matter, he asked to see a manager (while still in drive-thru, holding up the line). He complained that my co-worker was so ""petty."" My manager was pretty surprised that he felt the need to bring this up, and she didn't reprimand us at all. The guy still drove off with my pen cap, though.

It wouldn't have been so bad, except that *I was the only person in the front of the store with a pen.* Everyone else has come to expect me to have one and have stopped bringing theirs.

They leave the building in my care, and i'm incharge of distributing payroll, training employees, cooking food, basically making sure lunch/dinner go smoothly for the students eatting at my dining center (We do buffet style).

I love it, my boss is quite possibly the busiest guy on this campus and he's still taken time to stop by the little hole in the wall that he put me in charge of. (appologetic even for not being around) So we'll call him Friendlyexhausted.

The story:

It was mid dinner rush and our cook had had to leave at 5:30 (usually leaves at 7) leaving me to cook all the food for roughly 150 people (again buffet style) while managing the upstairs. I'm knee deep in a frier and I hear the fire alarm go off. So running upstairs I'm confronted by my employees stammering something, but all I knew was I needed all 150 of those kids outside NOW until I could figure out if there was a situation. 

(You wouldn't believe how many college kids will refuse to leave a building unless they themselves can see the fire.)

So once everyone is out of the building, I wait a couple of minutes before calling the fire department..it turns out that our building wasn't even wired to let them know when a fire alarm had been pulled so it was news to them. They send over a fire truck and well..low and behold the fire department has no clue how to shut off the alarm in this particular building. (Great! also there was no fire at this point) 
So after a good 20 minutes, the police show up and point out that the alarm needs to be shut off behind the ONLY door in the building I do not have a key to, and we all have a good laugh after the fact.

The kids file back in, I thank the police and the fire department and everything goes back to normal just as Friendlyexhausted stops by. At this point I'm still kindof shaking from adrenaline so he asks me what's wrong. I explain what happened and he told me I should have called him! 

Now, I wasn't angry at this point just adrenaline fueled so I practically shouted at him "" I did! 15 times!"" 

He flips out his phone and very quietly said..oh..you're right you did. (He had to run out of the building at this point but mentioned we would talk later)


So later after getting a more detailed report from myself, he just chuckles and tells me. **""I'm glad I got a good one, I can teach anyone how to cook but I can't teach an instinct for safety. Even if you didn't smell or see fire, you put those kids first and remained calm."" **

It is kind of a niche restaurant and has mounted deer,  buffalo etc. on the walls. We have private rooms you can reserve.  This large party with three 10-12 year old boys comes in and requests a private room. Everything seems peachy as we seat them in our private room which has most of the mounted deer hung in it.  About 10 in to being sat, the parents do nothing as these kids run wild through the restaurant.  One of the 12 year olds starts poking, pulling and hanging on one of the mounted deer, in full site of his mother. As I come over to ask him to stop, the deer falls, hitting the boy in the shoulder. The mother is in hysterics claiming that the restaurant should pay for any bill they may have because of this blah blah. My manager comes in,  comps all of their meals, and has to fill an incident report and insurance claims and more paper work. 

Here's the kicker. We also have some saddles outside. I look out the window after they had left, mother in full blown tears, grandma scowling and the granddad rolling his eyes.  The little shit was running around playing on the saddles and flailing his supposedly incurred arm around.

After it passed by the weather was perfectly bright and sunny, but the tables were SOAKED.  Not only did the busers not have time to wipe them down and set them up, the tables were wood, so they needed time to dry out on their own.  Not to mention there was another storm set to come through.  So I decide to not set up the deck.

Had a 4 top come in that was adamant about sitting in the bar, they wait a few minutes, go sit at their table, alright cool.  A few minutes later I notice they're gone, bartender tells me they went outside.  Lo and behold, they made the bartender wipe off the chairs and they're now sitting at a soaking wet table.

Just this last Sunday, my boyfriend and I decided to get some brunch after I babysat all morning. i was exhausted, hungry, and sun-burnt. We decided to go to the nearest vegan place to try out their brunch since we've heard a lot of great things.

We get there and it takes about five minutes for them to clear one tiny little table and seat us. The server takes just about as much time to get over to us. When he does, he seems a little flustered like he's been really busy. Okay, no big deal, we're just drinking waters and put in our food order. Now we wait. For over a half hour. It wasn't the waiting, or him forgetting to put our food in, I'm a server, I get it, it happens. It was that he never came over, apologized, and let us know what was going on. The table next to us sat down ~25 minutes after us and it wasn't until they got their food that my boyfriend started getting really upset.

We decided to wait a few more minutes, and then we got up to leave. Our server walked by right as we were getting up and told us he believes our food is ready. We sort of give him a look and sit back down. A minute later, our food comes out. My boyfriend said something about how long it took and the server didn't say anything, walked away, checked something and then sort of muttered - didn't say it **to** us - that 'it took 15 minutes, it takes time to cook food.' At that point, *I* started getting upset.

I can have a lot of patience, but when you make a simple mistake and try to basically blame us for our indignation, it all goes out the window. My boyfriend was even angrier and was about to raise his voice (which is bad - he has a *stern* voice) and another server/manager came right up to us and asked 'Did he just say that to you? I'm so sorry, we've already had to talk to him once today, I'll get your bill right out to you.' Another issue was that he messed up my boyfriend's order and also put the wrong ones down in front of us without telling us what they were (while different, they looked similar). We asked the manager guy for a box, he comped our entire bill and we just left.

I've never had an experience like that and it was just horrible. I felt awful for the rest of the day and kept running it over in my mind, like maybe we did something wrong. I hope it's okay I posted this in here. It's just still on my mind and I wanted to type it up, try to get it out.

1372304628.0,55,self.TalesFromYourServer,1h5nff,Fellow server got shafted by management tonight taking care of a large party. I'd love to hear y'all's opinion on this.,69,14,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1h5nff/fellow_server_got_shafted_by_management_tonight/,"Alright so here's what happened, and I'll warn you know, this is a wall of text. 

My restaurant sponsors a little league baseball team. Tonight the team was to come in and eat for free as a congratulations on the season from us. We were told it would be 8-10 boys and their coaches. No problem, we set them up in our party room (it's essentially a sun room off to the side of the restaurant that connects to the outdoor patio but it's really perfect for private parties and such). They also had pre-ordered food and it was going to be buffet style with wings, chicken tenders, mini burgers, fries, that kind of stuff that kids like. So pretty much the entire thing should have been incredibly easy. But like we all know too well, that's exactly when the ground falls out from under your feet...

Anyway, since it was not a huge deal we only assigned one server to take care of it. It's Wednesday night, not a big night for us, so we didn't have many servers on, just kinda the essential staff. So the team starts coming in and right away we have a problem. It's not just the kids and coaches, it's all their families as well. This happens at 6:30 so right during our dinner rush. The girl taking care of the party (we'll call her Zoey) was doing awesome, and trying to get drinks as fast as she can. Since it was dinner rush, the rest of us servers weren't able to help her too much, same as our manager, who we were all busy taking care of our tables, running food, drinks, etc. Zoey was handling this like a champ, or as best as she possibly could. 

When everyone had gotten there it turned out to be more like 40 people. Now for parties over 20 we will assign two servers to take care of it. Poor Zoey, who had just recently started serving about a month or so ago, got tossed into the deep end. Now obviously the pre-ordered food did not last long, since it was intended for 8-10 boys not 40 adults/boys. So then they all started ordering more food. By then, dinner had died down so we were able to help her out more. I ended up running most of her food for her while she was scrambling to do refills and all the other little things. Most of the tables I ran food to were understanding and very polite, except one. This table had four of the largest adults I've ever seen. I delivered their food and the patriarch snarkily said to me ""I'm missing a kids milk"" Now I took food out, I had no knowledge if he had ordered a milk or not, so just as I was about to tell him I'd find Zoey for him, she arrived beside me with the missing milk and some other things Mr. Walrus had requested. When she gave him the milk he said, in the most condescending tone I've ever heard, ""I've been waiting for that milk for a VERY long time."" I must have had the ""you've gotta be kidding me"" look on my face, and it took all of my will power to not tell him, ""look around you, you see all these people that this poor girl is trying to take care of? You are not the only one here and I know she is doing her damndest to make sure everyone is taken care of."" 

That was not the end of Mr. Walrus. After it was all said and done, everyone cashed out and gone (and yes, beyond the pre-ordered food they had to pay for their meals. Not sure if they got a discount though) I was helping Zoey clean up, and I asked her about how it all went. She said it went as smoothly as it could have gone except for Mr. Walrus. Apparently as she was cashing out some of them she had six credit cards in one hand and on her way to deliver a to-go to another table, Mr. Walrus stopped her and actually said ""before you do anything else, go get me another ranch."" She paused, tried to compute what he just said, and told him ""alright"" and then proceeded to continue taking the to-go to the other table. Apparently he was the biggest self-centered douche imaginable. She then said ""Yeah and his name was [well-known and unique musician's name here] as well! Can you believe that? What a name!"" That caused a previously unconnected synapse in my brain to turn on. I had waited on that same guy and his needy, bitchy, never tipping, terrible family at my last job! He was so bad that no server would ever take care of them. The manager would have to. It made sense. He only left her a dollar or two on a much higher bill. Think less than 5%. Anyway, it was all over except for Zoey to get paid. 

Since a lot of the food was free, she was not able/allowed to apply a gratuity. Starting there I'm not really sure how or why that was. She ended up making about $30-$40 from the tables themselves, and since our restaurant essentially paid for the rest, our manager was to give her another amount of money for the rest. Well, the manager on duty called our GM to find out what Zoey should be given. I'm not sure if he explained to our GM that the 8-10 kids was actually 40 adults/kids but he was told to only give her $20. I was completely flummoxed, as was Zoey. The restaurant paid for most of the food, she took care of a very large party by herself, with at least one table of complete assholes, as well as the kids who wouldn't be quiet or stop running around the entire restaurant, and they were only going to give her $20 after not letting her apply a gratuity? Does this seem sketchy to you? It does to me. I saw how much she busted her ass all night and we helped her as much as we could, and for management to pull that one on her? She's already planning on talking to our GM about it, and I told her I've got her back, as well as the entire serving staff that was on tonight. I hope she gets a little better compensation, but I dunno...what do you guys think? 

**TL:DR** **Coworker has party of 8-10 turn into 40 complete with hyperactive boys and bitchy adults. She's not allowed to apply gratuity, restaurant is paying for most of the food. Party gives her ~$30-$40 and GM gives her only $20.

",71,18,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/157h9j/finally_revenge/,"Through my degree I worked at a fine dining restaurant in New Zealand. I left soon after I got a job related to my degree so it has almost been a year since I worked there, however I caught up with an ex-colleague yesterday and she told me a story I thought I would share. 

Throughout my time at this restaurant we had a very low staff turnover due to an awesome manager who fully supported us and was just all round an awesome guy. Things went down hill as soon as he left. The lady who replaced him (lets call her Jill) was nice enough, until she left her husband for a waiter who was a lot younger than her (he shall be named Aaron). 

This wouldn't be anyone elses business so long as Jill and Aaron were sensible and kept their relationship out of work, however there were far to many instances of their relationship getting in the way of our jobs. A few examples:

* Arguing in front of customers

* Favouritism (Aaron would ALWAYS be sent home early, even in front of people who had worked doubles)

* I am almost certain that Aaron was starting nasty rumours ABOUT HIMSELF! well his relationship really.. and spreading them so that he could yell at the rest of the staff for ""interfering in his private life

So gradually the restaurant lost a lot of staff, including myself, because we were not willing to be involved in the convolution that was Jill and Aaron. It has been a while since I quit and so I was interested to learn that the restaurant lost almost all its staff! 
A duty manager quit, so Jill promoted Aaron into that position, causing all the staff except my aforementioned ex-colleague to leave! As said earlier, this is a fine dining restaurant, so a certain standard is expected, which has been too much for my ex-colleague to maintain all by herself, so she recently handed in her notice too... and they have recently had a lot of bad reviews on various websites.

There wasn't a soul around except our regulars, that come in for coffee. 

Fast forward to *20 minutes to close*. Table walks in. A table of **regular customers** that *know* we close at 8 pm. They pull this shit *at least* once a week.

Now keep in mind we have a supreme pizza on special right now. We have something called a create-your-own and you get the idea. Well they wanted a create your own pizza, with the special supreme price, by just adding a bunch of crap to it. NOPE NOPE NOPE. Not happening. They ended up getting a veggie pizza with pepperoni. You can add one item without jacking up the cost. The thing that pissed me off is the fact that **they wanted to eat the pizza in the restaurant.** It takes 15 minutes in the oven.

So by this time its 10 to 8 pm. We are getting ready to close, I just had to do some minor things. I finally get the pizza order, make it and put it in the oven.

Another table walks in. nice, we wont be leaving until late. 20 minutes later, 2 more tables come in. Son of a bitch. Its 8:30 by now, we closed half an hour ago.

Guess who ***has*** to serve them? I do. Its mandatory. I can't shut the kitchen down if I have customers in the restaurant. Before the pizza table walked in, I had everything done. I had to put the steam table away, clean the grill, and lock the door on the way out. I ended up having to pull everything back out I had just put away, and dirty dishes we had already washed.

I recently became a night manager, and have one golden rule..well two:

1.)I don't care what you get up to, long as you don't make me look bad to my boss. (Example being, I don't care about ipods in the dish room, or occasional cellphone checking, I understand just don't let it interfere with your work.)

2.) you can give me 80% for x hours of your shift, but between say 6pm-8pm I need 150% because it's crunch time. (lot of work needs to get done, closing duties and such) 


I thought this was a pretty fair policy, and for the most part it's worked out. I've gone to bat for both my dishwasher, and my line cook (Day shift was blaming them for stuff) and got their respect because of it. 

However, there is this one, ""Server"" of sorts who cannot be arsed. Half my team has been down for the week, and the rest of us have been taking on extra work to still get out on time. Everyone ha been cool and understanding about it, and it hasn't been a big deal except for this guy. The final straw was today, when I asked him to in addition to mopping his area, if he could mop another area as well. He flat out said no, it wasn't his job with an attitude. 

edit: 

I looked back and for clarification. I am a working manager, at any given point I am in the dish pit, behind the line, at the register, picking up tables because there are 6 of us total in the entire building at night. So don't read this as another manager who likes to issue orders from on high. I do anything I expect my underlings to do. 


My question to you fine people, is ""Is it better to be feared than adored?"" 

Pardon kindof the rantishness of this, but I'm just a touch offended at getting walked on while trying to be the Good Guy Manager. 

**edit 2:**

So today my boss was in and I just pulled him aside and asked for some advice, (basically how to proceed) because I didn't want to have to write him up, or continue to have to threaten a write up to get work done. Boss took a look at the closing ideas I've had, and listened to my side of the story. He then went and talked to the worker to explain (I assume) what I was trying to get across, boss then leaves.


Worker comes back over, apologizes for his actions, explains that he thought I was trying to dump more work on him instead of make it more fair for everyone and proceeds to be a model employee for the rest of the night. (even asks what else he can do!) I hope this lasts, and I think it will because he saw how un-fun it  can be when I have to make it a serious environment permanently. (Today) 

Thanks for all your advice everyone!

Everyone that we have hired so far are decent, slow but decent. Except SlowPoke (not a clever name but we'll stick with it). 

Background: We go through 3 different types of training: follow 1 (shadowing your trainer), follow 2 (shadowing your trainer and starting to be hands on), and follow 3 (reverse follow, trainer shadowing you). We also go through the basics, plus you get computer training, food running training to familiarize with the food and table numbers, menu class and all that good jazz. You will always be thoroughly prepared before being on the floor by yourself.

Anyway, SlowPoke has been hired about a month ago and she still isn't out of training. Yes, its a crap load of stuff to know and I don't expect you to come out perfect after training but come on, a month!? She had her first section tonight (two 2-tops, the managers wanted to see how she would do) and she still struggled and she didn't even know how to run a credit card. She had to be trained multiple times and she still hasn't grasp the basic concept. We tried just letting her drink run and food run but it has gotten to the point where expos and bartenders are getting frustrated because she still doesn't know the table numbers or how to garnish a margarita (lime and straw!!). Am I being too harsh on her? The managers have worked on her since the beginning but I think they are about to give up. Bless her heart for trying but there comes a time where you have to admit defeat and move on to another job.

It was the worst job I've ever had. The management was uncoordinated, uncommunicative, and had no idea what their customer base was and insisted on pushing for menu changes. The clientele was mostly elderly people who hated the constant changes in food items and prices, which they took out on me. The tips were awful, too, and my coworkers were just nasty. But I digress. I was prepared to stick it out until the day that this woman showed up.

My section that day was near the front, and I had two guests seated and one I was running some food or drinks to. I was headed up from the kitchen, and as I was passing through to get to the table, this elderly lady rather loudly asked for my attention (""EXCUSE ME!"" or ""MA'AM!"" I don't quite recall. But she SCREAMED it). I hadn't noticed her but I'd just gone through the section a few seconds earlier to do something else, and I know she hadn't been there long.

I apologized and said I'd be right back, and ran the food to the other table. I sat down a napkin for her and opened my mouth to speak, but she immediately cut me off.

Her: ""WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES AND YOU'VE JUST BEEN IGNORING ME?! YOU'RE THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD, I'M THIRSTY AND HUNGRY AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIVE MINUTES...""

She just went ON AND ON, and I felt awful. I hadn't been doing this job long and while I did feel bad for not having noticed her sooner, it had only been a few seconds, not five minutes! I think she also complained about my appearance (something about my hair or glasses IIRC) and how long it took her to be seated, but we were pretty much empty. There wasn't a wait or anything.

I eventually got in a few apologies (genuinely, at this point I really felt like I'd messed up and didn't want to upset her) and tried to ask her what she wanted to drink. I flipped my notebook open and got ready.

In a voice so quiet I almost couldn't hear her, she started mumbling out, ""I want the hurphmurphruph and the ghurmpghurmphcheese with sweettata fries and hurghrukehjr,"" and she kept going with what sounded like a complicated order. Part of the problem was, she was on some kind of respirator which muffled her voice and added this raspy sound, but she was mostly just speaking so quietly and enunciating so poorly I couldn't understand her.

Me:'Ma'am? I'm sorry I can't hear you very well, could you please repeat that?'

She glared at me, tried repeating it again but again, just mumbled very softly. I caught a little more of it this time. I don't remember exactly what she wanted, just that it was some kind of beef product with some sides. I don't think she specified how well she wanted it done or anything.

ME: ""Sorry ma'am, that was sweet tea and... A cheeseburger and some sides?""

At that point she gave me this glare like I'd run over her dog, stood up, and told me she was never coming back/I was the worst server in the world/etc, etc. Shaking with rage, not yelling but no longer talking quietly. And then she left.

I just stood there for a second like what the hell. The whole exchange lasted maybe half a minute. To this day I have no idea what had her so upset.

So, beginning of the night I have a super fun, energetic tab open. This customer tipped me $50 on an $80 or so tab. Customer was drunk by the closing of the tab, so I double check this is really what they want and they insist. Made my night, how thoughtful!
The rest of the night, however... I get this a lot, it was one of those nights I was extra tired and so it was just more frustrating than usual.

I am not here to meet men, I am here to pay my bills, I am not going to give you my number. Not to say, I don't enjoy meeting people, having regulars and such, but mixing business and play leads to disaster, I learned that the hard way.

So anyway...my good friend called me up Monday and asked if I could cover his shift Friday at 5. I said sure, I'd love to.

As part of the cost control, the manager was also always the first shift cook. I had been at this location for almost four years and had developed a very loyal following (I could barely go around town without someone coming up to me asking about waffles and bacon, etc).

Well, there was this one older couple that had never seen eye to eye with me. I saw them maybe twice a month, and as seems to be the trend, the husband was no problem. The wife, though, was a horrible piece of work. Nothing I could do would ever elicit a smile. 75% of the time she came in without incident, but that other 25% was horrible.

The first time I had ever served this couple was in my first week running the store. I was fresh out of training and cooking by myself (a policy that has since been altered for any new manager's first six months). I cooked the order as I heard it called to me, three cheeseburger plates, one with diced onions. It gets delivered and sure enough, the customer wanted a hamburger, not a cheeseburger. So I fix my mistake and apologize, but to no avail. I hear complaining the entire time they are there, and I have other orders to cook so I cannot escape. Apparently this incident four years ago set the tone for our relationship.

Fast forward to a month before I am going to quit. I already know this but I am the only one. I have yet to put in a notice, but I do have other opportunities lined up. It's Saturday lunchtime, busy as two hells, and lo and behold here comes some of my favorite customers. They have breakfast because we serve the full menu 24 hours a day. It gets cooked and there are no issues with the food. Obviously this will not please the Queen Mum.

As the couple is about to leave, they call me over. She tells me her server has refused to do a drink switch, coffee for iced tea to go. The server had informed her that policy indicates that she has to charge for the additional beverage, especially since it is a higher menu price. Queen Mum begins a very low-key rant about it and I cut her off. I supported the server's choice to abide by policy rather than please this horrendous customer.

Queen Mum decides to inform me of her intention to pour her large coffee out and waste it because she couldn't get the tea she wanted. I inform her that it is her right, as she purchased it. She then says, ""I will pour it our right here, I'm not scared.""

""Ma'am, if you do that, I will have to ask you to pay your bill, leave, and never return.""

""How can you be so rude? Who is your supervisor? I want the customer complaint line!""

""My boss's name is [redacted], here is her cell phone number. If you still want the customer complaint number, it's on the back of your ticket. Have a great day and please don't come back.""

I went back to cooking as the couple exited the restaurant, and as soon as I was clear I sent my boss a message. Queen mum was very quick and had called both numbers in the time it took me to cook a few orders.However, my boss assured me nothing would come of it, as the lady was obviously just a piece of work.

I miss some things about that place, but thinking of this story reminds me of why I got out.

Why anyone would go to a family pizza place hoping to do shots I have no idea, but maybe the two pitchers of Bud Lite he and one other guy had already drunk between them had something to do with it. (This same guy came back into the restaurant a while after his group had left and wandered around briefly, looking lost.) But anyway, this story is about an adventure I had with a different table, back when it was just slow enough to consider it.

It was a 7-top of middle-aged women who all arrived separately, keeping me going back and forth to get drinks for them as they arrived. When the last one got there and I showed her where the group was, she mentioned that they were high school friends. They were all nice and cheerful, and everything went smoothly as they ordered, got their food, and ate. Most of them wanted separate checks, but hey, no big deal.

However, after they had paid and I was returning them their credit card slips and change, attention somehow turned to the small pile of dollars they were collecting on the table for a tip, and one of them joked that I should sing for it. I told them that I can't carry a tune to save my life (which is true), but I impulsively added that I could recite a poem for them instead. They agreed a little too enthusiastically and asked for a ""lighthearted"" one. Now, I enjoy memorizing and reciting poems, but I was a bit nervous and had no idea what to say, so I said I would think about it and come back.

For the next few minutes I attended to my other tables while my mind raced, wondering what to do. Finally I went back and told them they had two choices: [The Embarrassing Episode of Little Miss Muffet](http://www.brookmans.com/history/littlemissmuffet.shtml) or a [nature poem about a meteorite](http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/c__s__lewis/poems/2368). They unanimously called for ""the embarrassing one."" Great. I wasn't getting off easy.

Well, I went for it, recited the poem as charmingly as I could, and took a little bow at the end amid laughter and applause. Then I said ""You all have a good night"" and exited. They stayed for a while longer, but I didn't go back to their table.

I ended up getting a $20 tip out of it - not extreme, but not at all bad, since I think that was around 30 or 40 percent of the bill. My coworkers were suitably impressed. I wish I could show that tip to everyone who's made fun of me for liking to recite poetry.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,standard,True,t3_1ivas1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1ivas1/little_miss_muffet_discovered_a_tuffet/,

1369793009.0,53,self.TalesFromYourServer,1f8prm,Racist server claimed that I was discriminating while seating parties.,64,11,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1f8prm/racist_server_claimed_that_i_was_discriminating/,"Pretty long story, I apologize! TL;DR at bottom. 

I've been a hostess since last September at a popular seafood chain restaurant. I think I'm safe in saying that I am a reliable employee and know what I'm doing, and as a result my managers rely on and trust me. We have new computers at the front podium that are supposed to keep track of rotation between servers, but sometimes it doesn't really work right and I just keep it all in my head while manually putting the correct info on the screen. This tends to be a problem when servers don't like what you do, because you can't blame it on the computer. 


An older, white server Mary (name changed; skin color is relevant) has been a waitress practically all her life, and she is very good at her job. Servers are annoyingly limited to 3 tables, but on busy days she can easily juggle 6 or more (with the manager's permission) while bussing all her own tables. Since I started working, we've gotten along very well and she's great to just chat with. Mary would occasionally get on my case or roll her eyes when a less-than-desirable table would be sat in her section, but no big deal, a lot of servers tend to be like that.


One particularly awful lunch shift a few weeks ago had me following the rotation diligently when I could, but because Mary is such a great and long-time server, she has a lot of regulars who request her when they walk in, throwing off my rotation. This often leads to her getting double sat, more tables than other servers, and just generally getting screwed over. I apologize all the time for it, and usually she understands, but she was super pissed at me that day. I had been giving her too many 1-tops per the rotation and then I probably double sat her 3 times because of requests. 


Things started calming down and I sat her another table, a 4-top black family. At this point, her entire section of around 4 tables consists of all black customers. I saw Mary walk out of the kitchen, notice this table, and dramatically throw her arms up before storming into the kitchen hollering complaints about me at our coworkers. I knew she had been frustrated with me for my seating choices, but I honestly had been going by the book all day. I go in there and, quite out of character for me, confronted her and asked what the problem was. She told me that I was sitting her all ""ghetto tables"" and that they were going to notice and were going to call the restaurant out (and me specifically) on discriminating against non-whites and segregating them into a specific section. 


This was the most ridiculous accusation I've ever had of me. Everyone who walks through the doors of that restaurant is just another customer to me. Some are more irate/rude than others, some speak differently, and some are the most interesting or friendly people I've ever spoken to. A person's race/skin color/ethnicity has never mattered to me. It clearly mattered to her, however, because I guess with her vast experience she's ""learned a thing or two"" and just expects all black people to not tip as well and be generally crappy tables. 


I had never been disrespected like that by someone who was 25 years my senior, and was so upset that the diners probably heard her accuse me of being a racist that I couldn't even respond to her and went back up to the podium trying to hold it together and continue doing my job. I'd been having a bad week so holding back tears was a little difficult, and my (hispanic) manager came up and saw how upset I was before I could just let it go. I ended up telling him the truth--that their best and apparently very racist server just freaked out at me for seating her a black table--and he was visibly perturbed by the blatant racism and got her in trouble with the GM. 


I felt like shit because I hate getting people in trouble, but I think that her reaction was highly uncalled for. She avoided/ignored me for weeks when we had shifts together, and just yesterday seems to have forgiven me (I did not apologize but avoided her in turn) and came up to the podium to chat like she used to. 



TL;DR -- Racist middle-aged white waitress flips out when I seat her a third consecutive table of black customers because ""I was segregating."" I got upset, manager noticed, she got written up.

1369116960.0,48,self.TalesFromYourServer,1er08b,Bad customers are bad. Having a CTL who refuses to take tables is worse.,57,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1er08b/bad_customers_are_bad_having_a_ctl_who_refuses_to/,"First a little context. I work at the busiest restaurant in the biggest and richest city in the area (pretty much one of the only places in the country that's booming in a big way right now) and we get a LOT of business even on slow nights. I work 45-50 hours every week, pulling double or throughs most days to help make up for our severe need of more servers. We run a third the number of servers we should for the level of business we do and have a washout rate of about 75% on server trainees. I'm one of a bare handfull of servers who can handle the hardest sections, party room, bar, wherever I'm needed and also keep up on sidework and run hot food during the rush. I say this not to brag, but to establish that I'm a pretty good server in a place where even experienced servers are scared off by the intensity and stress.

Today I worked a double, pretty normal for a Monday. Started off with a big top, got a nice tip on top of grat, and was generally having a good night. I was in the biggest section which also happens to be the section farthest away from the kitchen and a computer, so it's also the hardest section to handle but nothing I can't manage. Five tables including three big tops. No sweat. It's pretty slow, and about 8:00 I'm down to one table and looking forward to getting cut so I go back to the kitchen to shoot the shit with the cooks.

I'm back there for just a couple of minutes when one of the hostesses finds me and asks me to pick up a table. Apparently two guys had decided they were too important to wait on a Hostess and seated themselves. At a six top. In a closed section. On the opposite end of the restaurant from my section. And me and the CTL were the only ones still on.

I really don't want this table. There's no way in Hell those guys will tip well enough to make it worth while. So I ask her to get the CTL Cliff to pick it up. She blushes apologetically.

""He just got double sat. He won't take it.""

Here's the thing about Cliff. He's been working in the biz for a long time now. He's an older man, and gets along very well with his customers (he does magic tricks and makes bestestest best friends with everyone) and knows the menu like he knows where on the ear his dog likes to be scratched. 

That said, he's a kinda terrible waiter. Back when I was a Host I'd clash with him all the time because he'd get mad at me for 'double sitting' him when he'd had ten minutes between tables. That's not to say I didn't actually double sit him sometimes, but the man CANNOT handle the sudden change and blows up at whoever he thinks is responsible. We've almost come to blows over it because I wouldn't put customers on wait to give him time to do his lame magic tricks for every damn table in the middle of the Sunday rush. We get along better now that I'm a waiter too, but the man refuses to take tables less than ten minutes apart and is usually CTL for the closing shift as he only works nights. You can see where this is a problem.

So anyways, I peek out the door and look at Cliff's section. Sure enough, he has two tables. One already has drinks and he's dropping off the other's as I look. Both of my tables have been eating for a while and are almost ready to pre buss. At this point, I realize I'm screwed. They've already asked him to pick it up and he refused. I sigh like Kiph helping Zapp into his new PJ's and go greet them. 

Forty minutes and 5% later, I'm ready to punch something. So I do. Sadly it's not Cliff's face; it's the metal counter at the drink station in the kitchen. It hurts. It also cracks my silver ring. Great. 

Cliff's last tables had left twenty minutes ago, leaving him with an empty section and I got three more tables after the two asshats. Sumbitch. I don't know if I should blame Cliff for being a lazy bastard, management for letting him be a lazy bastard, or the Hostess for being too damn nice to sit him again. I hate this shit, and I don't care if I can make $50 an hour here, I won't put up with it much longer. Co-workers like this is why our washout rate is so high, and it's why I try to teach my trainees how to handle getting double or triple sat more than anything.

TLDR: This is why we don't have nice things. And your band sucks, Cliff.

Essentially, when I eat out, I'm courteous to my host. I thank them and act polite. I then ask them to go and give my thanks or compliments to the chef. 

See, in my experience, the ONLY thing the chef ever hears is if there's an issue with a meal. All day long being told to hurry up with orders, get things out in a timely manner, even when there's a rush and you're under-staffed, and then some asshole's complaint comes through. And you don't get a fucking tip from the meal, either, unless that place has a communal tip jar. 

So I always make sure to send a polite thank you or a compliment on a top-notch aspect of a meal toward the kitchen. Their job isn't easy, either. They deserve a little thanks.

It's a really good deal, especially if you can eat more than 12 wings.

We have small plastic placards on each table that describe the special in some detail, so that customers are aware of it as soon as they sit down (rather than depending on us servers to tell everyone). It's very convenient.  Customers place their first order for 12 wings, then subsequent orders for ""refills"" of 6 at a time, as soon as their most recent order hits the table.  As long as you're still eating, we'll still cook you chicken, even if the special has ended.

Apparently I have a tattoo on my forehead that says ""you are welcome to share this all-you-can-eat special among several people"" and ""order extra, so you can take some home with you!""  Unfortunately, both are against our policies.  Every time I work a lunch shift, I get customers who try to place one order for the lunch special and share it (seriously, on what planet can two or three people share a single, $12 order for all-you-can-eat anything), or try to take uneaten wings home with them (like, placing an order for a refill or two, for the express purpose of taking their 24th-36th wings home with them).

I've been waiting tables and bartending for a while now, and it still shocks me how rude these people can be when I tell them that it's against our policies to give them to-go boxes for their unlimited wing orders.  Today was especially rough when my ONLY TABLE OF THE DAY racked up a $50 tab ordering beers and this relatively high-maintenance ""buffet,"" and tipped me $5 because I wouldn't let them take their extra wings with them.  Granted, on a 7 hour shift, $10 isn't so different from $5, but it's the principle that gets me.  

I've been trying to head off the problems by outlining our takeout and sharing policies at the beginning of the diners' visit, but sometimes I'm just super-busy, or they seem to already know about the special (and presumably the rules regarding it), and then they spring the irrationality on me at the end of the meal.

One time, though, we had a real character come in. He looked like a crackhead or something, and hung around all week. He seemed nice enough to talk to, but there was something off about him. 
Halfway through the week, he had a big religious conversion out on our patio. I dunno if he met the guy or they just got to talking, but they had a big thing out there. Weird, but there was no one else out there, so we let them be.

Sunday night roles around and this guy's back. And he's ordering a lot of food. Previously he'd only ordered the cheapest beer we had and maybe a side order.

He hung around all night, not really bothering anyone beyond being talkative. My manager had a bad feeling about him and refused to wait on him, so I did. We also had the delivery driver keeping an eye on him when he wasn't out driving. One of the regulars was also trying to watch the guy.

Many ""anti-tipping"" people are very vocal about how we don't deserve a certain percentage of tip.  So I pose this question: What can we do to *be* deserving?

The only other complaint/comment people have is that it's on the business to pay us well. However, that isn't the case and there's nothing we, as servers, can do about it. (Short of a country wide 100% server strike which, let's face it, will *never* happen. There are people lined up for our jobs. We're dispensable.)

First day out of training and the guy that trained me calls out sick. No big deal. First party... a fucking 20 top (for those who just read for the stories, a table of 20 people). Normally the servers pre-bus... nope. It's like they think ""New guy=No pre-bussing."" So, 15 minutes after they leave, i have finally cleared the table, cleaned them, and got them back to where they need to be. Next party shows up... 15 top. Now, this server, who we shall call Alex, has been dealing with a lot lately. It's not my place to tell her story, but I digress. Anyway, I knew her before I started working there, so I told her that if she couldn't pre-bus, it was fine by me. She pre-bussed anyway. That was a good party and a easy clean-up. 

Now, this last party was hell on a party bus... literally. No call ahead, no warning what-so-ever.

Long story short, I ended up quitting before the place opened, because I could tell that it was going to be a clusterfuck, and I had found a better job opportunity at an established company.  I even have insurance and paid time off now!  So when I ask for my paycheck that should have had my training hours and the time I spent in the restaurant getting it set up, I was told they weren't going to give it to me.  Their position is that because I quit before the place opened they aren't ethically required to pay me for the work I did.  When I threatened legal action (which was kind of a bluff, since the amount they owe me is about $200, and no lawyer is going to waste his time on that), they stated that had thrown away my paperwork and that they would claim that I had never worked there.  Apparently even though they had taken everybodys tax and residency information, they hadn't filed it yet with the state.

So I have no proof that I ever worked there, and I live in a state that is very, very unfriendly to the rank and file workers.

My question is, I was thinking about encouraging friends, families, and redditors with a taste for justice to go to the restaurant's yelp page and give them negative reviews.  I admit, I'm a bit of a petty person, and it bothers me that they feel like they can get away with fucking me like this.  I want my vengeance damn it!

First, the dining room is not my area of expertise, I work in the kitchen/back office. 

I was sitting in one of the dining rooms (we don't seat customers there unless its slammed or they ask) taking a quick break. We have 0 customers at the time. The door opens and 2 ladies walk in. One of the servers, I'll call her J, greets them warmly, seats them, and gets their drink order. She serves them 2 non-alcoholic drinks, they say they need some time to look at the menu. A minute or so later, they call over a different waitress and ask if we served steak (we've NEVER served steak) and that they've had it here before. She apologizes and informs them that we've never carried steak. The different waitress goes back to whatever she was doing and J heads over to the table. The 2 ladies get up and announce very loudly, almost shouting ""WELL, NEVERMIND THEN! WE DON'T WANT TO EAT HERE IF THERE ISN'T STEAK!"" and proceed to get up and leave out of the emergency exit. Of course the alarm sounds and after the dust settles J is totally baffled. The beverage glasses were completely empty.

I know this was probably a case of some dumb/angry ladies trying to chug some sweet tea and run, but here is my question. If some customers came in, ordered drinks, and then decided not to eat, would you give them the bill for the drinks? (Non-alcoholic)

The floor manager and I argued on this for a good while. He said no, because it was our fault for not having what they wanted to eat. I would charge them, they ordered it and drank it, right?

Ziosks are mini computers at every table that customers can use to order appetizers, desserts, milkshakes, smoothies, play music and games, and best of all, to pay their check if they are using a credit card. As much as we dreaded them and complained that they would take our jobs, they really aren't that bad and can be really helpful on weekends when we are swamped. They haven't replaced us servers. We still have to run around getting drinks, delivering food, making desserts and checking on customers. The management REALLY wants us to get customers to use the Ziosks, so they are keeping track of what percent of our customers use the Ziosks to pay. If a certain server consistently falls below a certain percent, they will be given smaller sections and possibly lose shifts. So the hosts make sure to tell the customers about the Ziosks when seating them and I always tell the customers when I drop the check that if they are paying with a card they can use the Ziosk and if it's cash I will take it. 

Most customers go with the flow and use it at least to make a payment. However, there are quite a few who are very vocal about their hatred for it. Most people are reasonable about it, but a few have actually been unnecessarily rude. Tonight I had a 3 top (a mother and her 2 teenage daughters). They were nice and everything went fine until I dropped off the check and told her about the Ziosk. It was like a switch flipped in her. She looked me dead in the eye and said in a really firm voice, ""I really, REALLY, don't want to use that. I have a total aversion to it. Just take my card."" Now I have prepared a speech for the few times that people have been rude to me about this, because I will not be treated like that. I brought back her receipt after doing it the regular way and said in the sweetest voice possible, ""I'm so sorry, we don't mean to bug you. It's just that I can get in trouble if the percent of my customers using the Ziosk is too low---"" before letting me finish she grabs the Ziosk and slams it onto the table behind her and says ""Well I guess your percent is going to be ZERO!"".

Sorry for the rant.  ,56,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1as5uo/i_finally_figured_out_the_dance_sorry_for_the_rant/,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I've never really considered myself a good server.  All my previous jobs had shit management, and I never took them seriously.  I hated serving rich assholes, and I hated money hungry managers more.  I used to work in human services, with adults with disabilities.  After some legal issues, I'm not able to work in human services for the next three years. So serving it is.  


I was recently hired at a local brewery/grill type place.  I've always had a love affair with their microbrews, so I was pretty happy about getting hired.  Over the last few weeks, I've busted my ass to learn the menu, prices etc. and I still need little reminder notes in my book so I can keep track of my duties and organization.  

The past few nights I've worked, I've had issues with being overwhelmed.  Even with a three table section, I've spent too much time at the computer, having to delete orders and put in apps/soups/salads first etc.  I forget things easily and I need to write every small thing down, even reminders to do a quality check and drink re-fills.  Because of this, my co-workers and managers have been constantly asking if I need help.

But tonight, man...tonight...it clicked.  I consolidated.  I used trays because I still don't have a four glass carry down (still working on that at home).  I really like my co-workers, and because we have a team serving style, I need to trust them.  I let go tonight and just let it fucking flow, man.  


I made 20% or more at every table, and just got my shit together.  It felt so good walking out of that place knowing I just made $20 an hour.  Considering last night I made less than 5 an hour, it was definitely a good feeling.   


I realized that part of the reason I did so well tonight is because the bitchy fucking servers weren't there.  Well, there was one, but she's pregnant, so I forgive most of her attitude.  Not to mention being...just happy and being in the right attitude really made the difference.

We've all had our guests that are bad, rude, mean, condescending... you name it.  After having a guest who wasn't the worst I've had (but certainly no peach) it raised the question: When does it become too much?  
   
Let me give you a little backstory:  
The other night I had a heavily pregnant woman and her young daughter come in. She was very nice, as was her daughter. She ordered a tea for herself and a kid's bev. As I was about to leave she said ""Oh right.. we have one more coming, and he'll have a tall Budweiser.""  Now, of course, I knew this joiner was probably her husband or boyfriend.  However, as most of you know, we can't serve alcohol to someone who isn't there (and our managers feel VERY strongly about serving alcohol to pregnant women.)  I said ""Of course! I just have to wait until he gets here to bring it out to you. That way I can see an ID. You understand.""    
   
She was very nice about it and said, ""That's fine. Thanks."" 
All went well until the demon-husband-from-hell showed up. I immediately saw he was clearly of age, so I brought his beer before he even had a chance to take his coat off. No joke, he look me right in the eye (pissed already) and said ""WHY wasn't this beer waiting for me when I got here? What, you couldn't serve my wife? Any IDIOT could see that she's way over age! Some reason you couldn't serve her?""   The wife looked so embarrassed. As a server, I deal with people being rude as shit to me all day, but you just insulted an (as far as I've seen) innocent woman. Come on. 
Not to mention, it was 15 minutes or so later... the beer would have been warm and gross when you sat down.
I explained our policy to him and he just complained and waived me off. 
Long story short(ish) he was like this about EVERYTHING. Insinuating I was stupid for not carrying plates the right way, serving them in the correct order (HIM, then the women) and so forth. 
At the end of their meal, I'm attempting to collect their plates and he slams them ALL into my arms (stacked like you wouldn't believe. Bowl, plate, silverware, bowl, silver, a cup, a plate) I mean..the leaning tower of Piza would be jealous.. Of course I prebussed the table, this is what was left. (He wouldn't let me take any big things unless everyone was done with everything) As I was trying to hold all the mess he handed me, he stacked on a full cup.  I couldn't move to readjust at ALL or something would fall.  I took 2 steps and a knife hit the floor. Before a nearby server could get to me, the wife hopped up, grabbed the knife and sat it on top, smiling. I didn't even have time to thank her  before a sauce up fell. Again, she grabbed it and sat it up for me. We both laughed and I thanked her. Before I was out of ear shot, I heard him berate her for helping me. ""That's HER job. You don't need to be touching those disgusting things. That's what she gets paid for.""
Finally when I had the table pre-bussed (he had 5 tall boys in him and was working on his 6th.. just being more of a dick as the night went on) when I asked if anyone would like dessert and offered some options. 
Now, when a table is annoying, I turn into Barbie server. I don't have that annoying dippy cheerleader voice (I don't want to piss people off) but I'll smile and be friendly as fuck so you can never honestly complain about me. I genuinely do want you to have a good visit. 
He goes ""HELL, I DON""T KNOW! We JUST finished eating (lie..they'd been chatting a while already) Why don't you stop smiling like an idiot and go do something, already? We would like some FAMILY time at a FAMILY restaurant.""  
I immediately apologized if I had bothered them and told them I'd check back in a bit.  The wife tried to reassure me, but he wouldn't let her.  
At this point... we're closed. 
I check back later and when I ask about dessert, the women shake their heads no, and he ignores me completely. So I return with their check and sit it on the table. I let him know there's no rush whatsoever and I'll come take care of it whenever they're ready. 
I shit you not, he uses the back of his hand to flip the check onto the floor and says, ""Do we LOOK like we're ready? I'll let you know when to bring our bill.  We might want more to eat, I'm not sure yet.""  
10 minutes later, he whistles and flags me down (I was only a few feet away, walking toward them) and he says ""We've decided we'll have a two scoops of vanilla ice cream with extra chocolate sauce and 3 spoons."" 
  
This...is not even...on the damn menu...  
 
  
But whatever, other desserts come with ice cream, we can do it that way.  I only charge him for a kid's ice cream, load them up, extra chocolate and all that jazz. 
When the bowl is practically LICKED clean, I take it away and he FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY ""asks"" for his check. (By ask, I mean he insults me for not having it out fast enough... you know.. because I'm psychic and shit...)
  
The bill was around 75.00.  
  
He paid in cash, let me keep the change and left with his family. 
After adding it all up, he tipped me 15.00. 
20%.  
   
Not what you were expecting, right?  
   
Exactly. 
Like most servers, it was like water off a duck's back at that point.  They were gone, I (surprisingly) was tipped very well, and because they stayed so long I had all my other outwork duties finished, so all I had to do was sweep and clean their table and I could go home.
No biggie. 

   
But as I was driving home it hit me:  This is wrong. That man was verbally abusive to me for a little over 3 hours total. He was rude, he was mean, he was condescending, insulting, hurtful... He was verbally abusive not only to ME, but to his wife as well.  He was a completely AWFUL person to serve and even worse.. to do it with a smile and what felt like a thousand apologies.  
  
But the worst part is, because I was tipped well, that made it ok. 
That relieved some of the anger and the hurt from his actions. 
  
So THAT is my question.   
   
When does it become too much? 
  
To me, it seems fine. He's gone, he paid, I made good money.  But what am I really doing? Am I okay with this? Being treated like absolute shit for hours? Being talked down to and made to feel stupid? (I'm a pre-med student AND double majoring!) Having someone be awful to me is OKAY because I was paid for it? 
  
At first, sure, he's gone.. it's okay. 
  
But then I thought.. would this be the lesson I would teach my children (when I have them) ?   That someone can treat you like dirt; so long as you're being well compensated it's acceptable?  
  
  
   
Has anyone else had a moment like that?  Just a moment of realization where no.. you tipping me well doesn't make up for your awful personality?  
   
When does it become too much? 
   
Where and HOW do you draw the line?  
Is it possible to even do so?

   
   
TL;DR: Man treats me like shit for upwards of three hours. Complete dickwad. Tips me 20%, unexpectedly. Like most servers, he's gone, made good money = It's all okay. It's over with. 
But when is it too much? When/how do you draw the line and say ""No! No amount of money is worth you treating me like dirt.""",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_19e19l,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19e19l/at_what_point_does_it_really_become_too_much/,

Let's call it Pasta Shack. I worked morning shift, and did all the prep work, plus worked both front and back of house as necessary until around 3:00 each day.

Well, Pasta Shack decided to do some reshuffling of higher-ups. You see, before it was like this: Unit Manager -&gt; District Manager -&gt; auditor -&gt; president of the company. And there were two of these auditors in the entire company, and all the UMs and DMs hated them because they came around from time to time to beak everyone's balls.

So our audit guy, let's call him Angelino cuz that's pretty damn close. Anyway, they decided they no longer needed these auditors. So, Angelino had the choice of going to CA to be a DM or to take over as a UM in our place.

Here comes the next part. Our UM had her masters in hotel/rest management and was hot shit. Let's call her Lori, cuz that's the bitch's fucking name, and a whole nother story. Anyway, she hated Pasta Shack, and stayed around until she found a job that was up to her standards. That came around just as Angelino was losing his spot. Lori hated Angelino, so how did she get him back? She didn't show him a DAMN THING about how to run a unit, and the last time he did that was like 20 years before.

Guess what happened? Some weeks, cheese for a month. Other weeks, no dough. You get the picture - he couldn't order cuz he didn't know how. He had no clue how to run the place, and we were basically a ship without a captain for several months. You can imagine how fun that was.

Well, Angelino decided that I needed help in the mornings, and hired heroin freak. I can't remember his name, so let's call him HF. HF started off really well, and everyone loved him. But, then the heroin came around, and that was that. He would take 30 minute bathroom breaks and then come back, high and useless. Guess who did all the workd of two people? Me. Guess who managed to miss somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 if his shifts? HF. The thing is, I was the only one with a key and I had to let HF in every morning.

So, Pasta Shack has a new special pizza. It's stuffed crust. So what does this mean for the launch? PREPARE A SHIT FUCK OF DOUGH FOR ALL THE HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE COMING IN AND STUFFING THEIR FACES. Of course, you guys already knew that one.

So, Angelino is finally getting annoyed at HF. Guess who didn't come in on launch day? HF. So, Angelino finally makes his way around and asks about HF. I tell him that he didn't come. Angelino screams ""THAT'S IT, HE'S FIRED!!"" and storms off.

So, next day, HF shows up in the morning. I say ""I can't let you in because I was told that you were fired."" HF looks shocked. I let him in and tell him to call Angelino. Did Angelino have any idea what I was talking about? Of course not. Did Angelino remember in any way his adolescent tirade? Nope!

So later, some shift manager comes in and hears about the whole thing and blows a gasket. Doesn't matter that I was told by Angelino himself that HF was fired, nosiree, it was so out of line for telling HF that. In fact, Angelino told SM that he'd have thrown me against a wall had he been in that morning. Got written up and everything, formal reprimand.

HF keeps his job, and I feel about 3"" tall and realize for the first time in my life that nobody in management can be trusted until they prove themselves to me. Life goes back to normal.

Like two weeks later, I go in to pick up my paycheck. Guess who's there? Angelino. What does he tell me? ""You got your wish, HF's fired""

So this morning I was hostess at work, no big deal I'm one of the only people who likes to be at the door. I'm also up there with another employee, he's nice and we get along well. Well because it's slowed a lot for the summer after one hour our busser and the guy at the door with me get sent home. Not a problem, I'm doing fine. 

But then hell breaks loose, 2 teams of 16 come in at the same time (I work at a sports bar known for lots of tv's wings and beers on tap) Ok after a mild panic I seat them. Things go smooth and I avoid a wait list and they leave. We clean it up and right after a group of 40 comes in. Cool give them the tables both those parties were using. 

Alright, now 2 servers are taking that and the rest of the house is full except for a 6 top, the patio and our bar. In comes our trouble maker. They're a group of 4, two parents with 2 younger kids. I tell them it should be around 10-15 minutes for the dining area, otherwise I can get them outside now or they can head down to the bar. Nope they don't want either.

 Then one a booth leaves as they are bitching and a server starts cleaning it off (she's taking that big 40 top so I know she can't finish cleaning it right away) so this woman goes ""What about that table over there"" I tell her it's a 6 top and I can't sit a party under 5 at it (and considering we've gotten big parties of 7+ all day I didn't want to give up the last big table to 4 people) and then she points to the booth. 

I tell her that server might not be able to clean it off right away and I can't leave my position (I really can't when it's busy and I'm up there alone) and that's the end of it. I tell her again it should only be 10 minutes since that table is being cleaned off. Well they decide to go somewhere else. But her husband goes to the bathroom and while he's in there she chimes in ""Actually is a manager around? You're really snotty""

 Well (pardon my language) fuck this shit. I go find my managers, both are working expo and running food since we are swamped and  now under staffed. I tell them someone needs to talk to them since I am quote snotty for not giving them a dirty table or a table to big for them. Thankfully my manager takes it over and I have to sadly watch her give me the bitch look the whole time she eats. She gets free apps and I saw the manager give her some cards for free stuff to use later. Ugh. At least she was nice to her server (one of my favorite's there so I warned her the woman may be less than pleasant) thankfully when she left I was off helping other people. 

This is the first time I've ever had someone openly tell me I'm crappy at my job. My manager said nothing to me about it so I know he thinks I wasn't in the wrong. Let's just say I can't wait to be gone now that I've got a new job. Just 2 weeks left in this job, I am not cut to work in a restaurant!

TL;DR: Manager cuts people too early, I get tons of parties but make shit work. Bitch comes in and wants a table to big for her party, and then a dirty table. I tell her no (as I've been told to in this situation) and she demands a manger because I told her no. She gets free shit. Can't wait to be done.

EDIT: Added some line breaks. Ohhh and I'd like to add my favorite line this woman used. ""There's empty tables everywhere how can it be 10-15 minutes? Why do you refuse to seat us if there are empty tables?"" I told a few of the other employees that and we got a laugh, we all knew when she came in we were swamped.

But I thought I'd shake things up a bit with my story of an awesome customer that I won't be forgetting about anytime soon.

I used to work at a pretty standard sports bar chain that marketed a lot towards 'family dining'. AKA A *lot* of families constantly using the dining room and staff as their personal babysitting service, screaming kids running around, messes that only bored over-sugared kids could make, and crappy/nonexistent tips. But I digress.
Now, this place didn't have the best *quality* food, mostly greasy pasta, pizza, and kid's meals like chicken fingers. Now mix that with a lot of young kids and one of them is gonna barf. It happens, I understand that. But it was such a pain. Even after it was mopped, the place was covered in carpet so it stunk like vomit for days after(we couldn't even seat people around it, losing out on a whole section of the restaurant). 

So that rant aside, I'm working one afternoon and a young couple is getting ready to leave with their very young daughter(I'm horrible at age but maybe 2yrs old). They'd been very quiet, I hadn't really noticed them much to be honest and they weren't my table. All of a sudden the little girl starts getting upset and she looks visibly green. Not good. The dad panics a bit and tries to hurry her to the door which is literally only a few feet away. We all know what's about to happen though and I can feel my mood plummet, and my stomach turn. And just as we predicted, the poor girl throws up her dinner of chicken fingers and fries- but not before the dad used his lightening fast reflexes, shoved his cupped hands right under her mouth and *CAUGHT THE BARF*. I got the impression his body reacted faster than his brain, and once he realized what he did, I opened the door for him and he shuffled out as he apologized. He came back in to wash his hands and the staff gave him a round of applause and a few coupons. His heroics saved us an evening of smelling barf, apologizing to customers for the smell, and losing out on seating. Stand-up guy!

I'm breaking up the data as so:

**Women**

I considered including a section for married couples, seeing as it is usually women and married couples who tip me the best, but I thought it might create too many fuzzy areas. Regulars and anyone I give an industry discount to are going to be omitted from my data.  Thoughts?

I know this isn't going to be incredibly credible, but I think it will be fairly interesting to see the results. Does anyone have any advice for what to include/not include?

**Update**

One user had a really good idea to record each actual percentage, rather than put it in categories. I'm going to start my data over using this method. 

Here's the data from last night's shift.

Less than 20%: 7

20%: 3

They placed it on top of the book, rather than in it. I didn't think much of it, but this became key later. I went back into the restaurant (they were on the patio) and talked to the host for a second. This is also key, because earlier, on my way to work, I hit a bird with my car. Total accident, I didn't expect to continue flying towards my moving vehicle, but it did. She jokingly called me a bird murderer and I thought more about it. I somewhat blacked out while mucked the plates from on the table and then walked around through the kitchen. When I got to the edge of the kitchen, I realized I didn't have the card. 

I retraced my steps about 5 times, checked every pocket 8 times, and then retraced my steps again. Finally, I decided it was either in the trash can or stolen by ghosts cause I couldn't find it. I told the FOH manager, and my fellow servers helped me look for it. We still couldn't find it, so after 10 or so minutes, I finally decided to just tell them. 

I tell them about how I somehow lost it in like 45 seconds and how I was going to buy their lunch. I told them about how I was about to toss the trashcan, as that's the only other option. They were totally cool about it. They told me they trusted me, and hoped I found it. I took their info and on my way out, they asked me how much the bill was even for. It was just under 30 bucks, and the woman gave me $5. Seriously. The woman who's credit card I just lost, tipped me. Amazing.

Anyway, a few minutes later, the night crew started coming in. I was getting them up to speed about what happened. As I was talking to them and putting some gloves next to the trashcan, the very same host who was joking around with me about the bird exclaimed ""I FOUND IT!!!"" I totally thought she was joking, but she reached into the space between where we muck the utensils and the stainless steel, and there the card was, transparent as can be and on it's side.

I bought her some cookies from next door, and she's only 17, so I can't buy her a bottle of her choice. Any ideas on how to reward her?

$300, just sitting there.

At my suggestion we checked the camera - no luck - and called the ATM company -nope- no way to find out who's cash it was.

At this point people were kind of giddy. Boss 1 pulled me aside and said 'Hey, I'll use it for Christmas bonuses!' Fuck that. 1 - he wouldn't. 2 - If he did that's about $3.50 for each FOH and BOH,  pointless. I stuck to my original plan.

I left it, untouched, in an envelope in the safe for over 90 days. Asked people who'd been there that night if they knew someone who'd lost some cash. No-one came forward. So 3/4 months later, that money took me to the best festival I've ever been too.

When I was in high school I worked as a hostess at a well known restaurant/gift shop. Somehow I became the host manager after working there for about year. Everyone else on the host staff was a teenager as well, but they often didn't show up for shifts and were generally lazy. My point: I ran that shizz. 

So, like a lot of restaurants, Sunday afternoons were a complete circus. I'm talking 2 hour waiting times.. and people actually waited that long. I left the easy jobs to my co-workers: taking names and seating guests. I was the one bussing the tables, trying to keep up the section rotations and helping out the servers when necessary. Then of course, there's the biggest pain: trying to set up tables for huge parties. This is where our story begins. 

An African American family of 28 people dressed in their Sunday best and who had obviously just come from church wanted a table. All together. In non-smoking. ASAP. I looked around at my super packed restaurant for about 10 minutes, stalking the customers to see if I could devise a plan of action that would free up 6-7 tables that were all in the same area.. that would have their eaters finishing up around the same time.. that didn't violate any fire codes with their construction.. and obviously this was impossible. So, abandoning the hope of a miracle, I call one member of the family up to the podium to discuss the issue. I didn't get one member, I got the whole family. I explain to all of them that if they wanted to wait for one huge table that they could be here for HOURS. My solution was to split them up into 3 or 4 semi-large tables that would be close by each other. It was confirmed by the family that this was an acceptable solution and they accepted the fact that it would still take 45 mins to an hour to achieve this. 

Cut to about an hour later, I have somehow scraped up three tables in the same corner of the restaurant. I call ONE MEMBER of the family up to the podium so that I may get their approval of the tables before I get the whole crew up in my face. But, of course... I get the whole crew. Against my pleading, they stampeded into the dining room. They see the tables and begin screaming at me (at least 6 people yelling at once) ""WE. SAID. ONE. BIG. TABLE!!! WHAT IS THIS?"" in the middle of the restaurant. Obviously I'm confused. We went over this, right? So I politely apologize because, you know, obviously I'm in the wrong. I must have imagined that whole conversation. But I politely explain that we spent the last hour getting THESE tables together. If you want that huge table, you're waiting at least another hour. They erupted. The patriarch of this family was seriously pacing up and down the aisles of the restaurant, and had the entire establishment's full attention. He is pacing and strutting and wagging his finger at me saying something along the lines of ""Now you silly little girl, I see what's going on here.. you are making us wait longer than anybody else here because we're BLACK! I KNOW IT! AND IT AIN'T RIGHT! AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR THIS!!! WHERE'S THE MANAGER?!!"" The manager had already walked up behind him at this point. 

**Manager:** ""Is there a problem here sir?""

**Man:** ""HELL YES THERE'S A PROBLEM, THIS PLACE IS RACIST AND I NEED TO SEE A MANAGER RIGHT NOW""

**Manager:** Okay, well I'm the manager. Let's all go back out to the lobby and we can discuss this. 

So he leads the family out to the lobby/gift shop. More senseless yelling and the manager trying to calm him down. Manager calls me over to have me once again explain the seating situation to the man. After much apologizing on our part and calm discussion they finally agree to keep waiting for the large table so they can all sit together. Sigh. Crazy. Most of the family wanders off to find a place to sit while they wait. While the man and my manager (tidbit: manager was a 6'9"" white man) are wrapping up their conversation, a random white customer walks up the the manager. 

**White Customer:** ""Excuse me, are you the manager? I just wanted-""
Manager turns slightly toward the man. 

**Black Customer:** ""OH HELL NO! WE ARE TALKING HERE! I can't believe you have the nerve to interrupt someone's conversation!"" Then turns to the manager: ""I see how it is, you'll stand here and smile and nod your head while I'm talking to you but as soon as a WHITE MAN wants your attention you can't get rid of me fast enough!"" 

**White Customer:** ""Hey now, I didn't realize.. ""

**Black Customer's Wife:** ""HEY NOW you need to shut the F--- UP MF-er, they are having a conversation here.""

**White Customer:** ""WAHHHT!!! *YOU* NEED TO SHUT THE F--- UP, B----!!""
Black customer swings at manager, misses. Swings at white customer, he swings back.. I don't think any contact was ever made.

**White customer:** ""I JUST WANTED TO TELL THE GUY HOW DELICIOUS MY BLUEBERRY MUFFIN WAS!!"" He pushes the black customer and runs out of the store.
 
Family starts screaming at me and the manager about how we're a bunch of stupid crackers and how they're going to sue us. A teenage girl from the family swiped at my podium, scattering papers and supplies everywhere, and SPIT. IN. MY. FACE. They all knocked over every sales display in their path on the way out - loose jellybeans and plastic beads everryywheree, broken yankee candles, etc. We filed a police report but they were never caught. I was allowed to leave early with pay that day.

I'm prepared for comments calling me a racist. This is how it happened. It wasn't a race thing until they made it a race thing. 

**TLDR: African American family upset about the wait time for a table turn it into a race issue, then try to fight a random white man because he unintentionally interrupted their conversation with the manager. Then they spit in my face and trashed the gift shop.**

Eventually, M came back into the kitchen, and shes FUMING. Now, M is a *really nice person* really sweet, and doesn't really get mad about anything. She's pretty mellow. she tells me she never uses this word, but ET was being a total cunt. I didn't know it, but ET made M make *2 pots of coffee* because the first one wasn't good enough. Our coffee was a little strong, apparently. Well finally ET and her cronies get their food. They eat, talk. The time is about 8pm. They took about half an hour to eat, and then requested strawberry shortcake, with no ice cream. M puts them together and prints bills when they finish. ET requested we take the ice cream off the total price of someone else's bill, and I told M not to, because its like a condiment. You may not get it, but you're going to get charged for it simply because the strawberries are hand sliced, and they cost a metric fuckton. 

(8:30; half hour after close) Then they asked for a senior discount. Oh the senior discounts. This is where I stepped in, as I had been in the kitchen doing my own closing duties.  We stopped including senior discounts for the main menu. Being a tiny place, we were losing a ton of money (like $500+ a month) so we only include it on a senior menu we had specially made, which includes the discount in the price on the menu. We don't have a button on the POS for discounts. She wants discounts. I peeked my head around the corner, to keep M from flipping tables and raging hard, and tell ET that we discontinued the S.D. on the main menu, so they didn't qualify for it, since they ordered off the wrong menu. ET didn't try to argue with me.

about 15 minutes later, I head out to ask M a question, as she was closing windows and etc. ET asked me why we were closing (in her entitled bitch voice) as the sign we said we didn't close for another 15 minutes, and trying to make us look bad in front of her cronies. I told her closing was actually 45 minutes ago, and we closed at 8pm. She *tried to tell me we closed at 9.* (I was just thinking *no bitch, we don't. get the fuck out.*) I re-confirmed that it was 8pm.  

The kicker: As they were *finally* leaving(8:50) they saw the little donation box for the local lions club chapter. For those that don't know what the lions club is, its an organization that helps the sight impaired with ocular testing and help with getting glasses. On top of the donation box, it says 5 cents minimum donation, and its filled with mints. The first time I heard one of the lackeys speak was to hear her exclaim ""5 CENTS?!"" as if it were a massive amount of money and it would break the bank. As they walked out the door I said very loudly. ""Its for good cause, I would give them 5 cents. Not like its going to make or break someone!"" and away they went!


TL;DR: Old people are extremely cheap, and don't know how to be courteous. Also: $2.00 tip, and the cronies left nothing. wooo! Luckily we had a pretty nice to-go order 5 min before close, and the way we work, is the cook gets the tip on to-go's since they do all the work. (Waitress may take the order, but they arent delivering anything, or waiting on them hand and foot.) I split my $8 tip with the waitress since she had some things to do on the order that I didn't have time to get myself. 

_________________________________________________________________
Bonus story:

The time I pissed ET off enough to where she didnt come in for 6 months.

I had just started waiting tables, and had a slight temper (still do; I hate people. I like my kitchen.)

She was doing her usual sprinting of the waitress, and I had other tables I had to attend to. You can imagine. Finally I had gotten tired of her shit, and I was getting pissed off. 

I said this: ""Is there ***anything*** else I can get you, because I have other people to tend to."" This pissed her off to no end, she didn't request anything else, and kept her mouth shut. We didn't see her for like 6 months after that.

We have a large burger called the classic. It comes with onionrings ON the sandwich... like a condiment. You can't sub them for any thing. either you get them, or not, you still pay the same price. Lady orders one to go, but wants to substitute an order of fries, instead of getting the onion rings. Sorry cant do that. she was nice enough about it.

Our home-run comes from this couple though...

Had a table come in, a two-top. they sit, they order drinks.

I make their food and send it out. half way through their meal, the wife comes up to my window and gets my attention. I assumed she wanted the waitress, and have the waitress go see her. A few seconds later, the waitress comes back and asks in the tortilla was flour or corn. I'm thinking who the hell doesn't know the difference?! and tell her its flour. They said are you sure, and I said positive, we don't carry any other kind of tortilla. The menu said corn tortilla, and I told them it was a typo, and we don't carry corn tortillas. I called my boss, and he told me to remove the taco salad from the bill. Which I did, and they received it. 5 minutes later, he calls back, asks if all the food was gone on the plate and that's when I face palmed.

Because heres what hit the ball out of the park. **he ate everything in the tortilla (lettuce, meat, cheese, onion, and tomatoes), and half the tortilla. Our meat seasoning for the meat in the salad, and the cheese are not gluten-free.** he only complained about the tortilla after he ate THE ENTIRE THING.

We have a small number of staff and only one manager


Our manager is always saying things that make me want to smack my head off the wall but her most recent one was IMO the most ridiculous.




Our restaurant is an Asian restaurant (not chinese) so we have to explain a lot of our dishes and people often ask a long list of weird and wonderful questions, so I'm used to fussy and awkward customers. We had two guys come in recently who I could tell were going to be a pain in the ass as soon as they walked in. They were rude and didn't look at you when they ordered and just sat reading their newspapers the whole time, not looking up or acknowledging the servers once.


I brought them their food and everything fine, and after a while went round and did the ""Is everything okay with your meal?"" talk.


Me: ""How are you guys getting on? Is everything okay with your meal?""


Guy: ""It's salty."" (he had still managed to eat half of it)


Me: ""Oh right okay, would you like me to take it back to the kitchen, see if they can do anything?""


Guy: ""No.""


Me: ""Okay then, are you sure?""


Guy: *blank stare*


Me: ""Can I get you anything else, any more drinks?""


Guy: Give me another diet coke""


Me: ""Sure thing.""


Got him his drink and went about the rest of the shift. When clearing the plates at the end I asked if everything 
else with the meal had been okay, but apparently the whole thing was *too damn salty*, despite them being able to clear their whole plates.


They asked to see the manager, so I kindly obliged and brought her over. About five minutes later and after a heated discussion she calls me into the kitchen to talk to her. Apparently the customers felt I hadn't done enough to rectify their issue (struggling to see what more I could of done but hey). She also said that the main problem was that these two men were Diabetic and therefore couldn't eat very salty food. So I said to her that they had never told me that so I just figured it wasn't to their tastes.
She then replied with:


""But you can tell from looking at someone if they are Diabetic. I mean, as soon as they walked in I could see that they were very ill, and my first guess was that they had Diabetes. It's easy to see if someone is Diabetic by just looking at them, you know?""

They came in the middle of an all out 9 table rush, they bickered with one another to the point that my other table complained. Then the finale, I brought the mother the wrong flavored tea. She got raspberry instead of strawberry. I, immediately realizing my mistake, turn to grab it off the table on to be met with the ENTIRE GLASS thrown in my face and the woman standing up yelling ""you stupid little bitch"". Yep. I shit you not. I was shocked into silence, I couldn't move. She tossed the glass on the ground, where it shattered, and continues with ""now go get me the right one."" She sits back down. My section is silent, and her family bursts into laughter and high fives. I turn and walk to the kitchen still in shock. 

My GM notices and asked me what the hell happened, I explained shaking and trying not to burst into tears. He flew out onto the floor and asked the table to kindly pay and leave, I try to go about my business taking care of the rest of my sections soaked in tea. Next thing I know my manager gets a glass of water to the chest and the woman is yelling profanity again. He ended up man-handling the woman out of the restaurant amid threats to file assault charges. The rest of the family followed rather quietly at that point. 


The worst part? They walked on a hundred dollar check, and corporate policy is that if the server doesn't pay the amount we face a two-week suspension. I have a newborn and bills, I had no choice. To add onto that, three other tables in my section where friends of the feuding family. Three no tips on $75+ checks. I got off work crawled into my jeep and bawled for a solid hour.

Working here for two years, I've seen numerous bussers come and go. Some idiots, some great bussers, some slow bussers. About a year ago, Kevin comes along. He's a super nice guy, probably one of the most polite guys I've ever met. He's 19, around my age. I train him one day, we get along, talk a lot. He wasn't so hot at bussing but I didn't even think of it because it was his first day. 

Kevin's been working here over a year, still just as bad as his first day. He's still super nice, but has become extremely lazy, irresponsible, and inconsiderate of his co-workers. Here's an example:

Saturday night around 9 o'clock. Three bussers on, I'm first cut. Kevin's closing. Second cut busser tells me I can just set all of the tables and then I can leave, considering it died down. I set every table in the restaurant. Go up front to clock out. Kevin is standing there doing NOTHING while second cut busser is bussing his heart out.

Me: ""What's up""

Kevin: ""Can you **bus**, **wipe**, and **set** the cantina(bar/cocktail area) for me?""

*Are you fucking serious? You're literally doing nothing.*

Me: ""Well, what are you doing right now? Can't you do it?""

Kevin: ""Oh, I'm rolling silverware."" 

*Bullshit. We have two full baskets of silverware and the host is in the middle of rolling the last few pieces.*

Kevin: ""Oh, and Tim(cantina server) asked me to ask you to do it.""

*Bullshit. I know he's lying. Tim would not approach a busser doing nothing and ask him to tell another busser, who's doing their job, to bus his section.*

It's small, but the actual restaurant is pretty huge. Weeknights are usually painfully slow. Our weekends are the average restaurants' Tuesday night. 95% of the time, only one server is needed for each shift. And that server also gets to be the host, busboy, chips and salsa person (random question time: does this person have a title?) cashier, barback, sometimes dishwasher, ... in addition to regular side work like rolling silverware  and restocking, and whatever else. So we may look slow or empty. But I'm actually doing a hundred things at once. 

A two top came in after I was already taking care of a few tables. Two older women. No big deal. I sat them at a booth that seats four. They were nearing the end of their meal when a random friend of theirs came in and sat at their table. Still no big deal. He was just meeting them and didn't want to order anything. Then another two friends came in to join the party. A group of five doesn't fit too well in a booth meant to seat four. So this one girl took a chair from the closest non-booth-table. 

Strike one. 

Don't just walk into my restaurant and start grabbing things without asking. And I wish the original two women had said something about how some friends might be meeting them. I would have happily sat them at a five- or six-top or whatever. 

Everyone in this group is a smoker. We have a city-wide indoor smoking ban. Before the ban, our restaurant area was smoke-free, but people could smoke in the bar. Instead of going outside to smoke, a few of these customers decided they were above the law and went to the bar area. Remember how I said the restaurant is huge? It's separated into three sections. Each one has an alarm. The bar was closed tonight. Do you know where this is going? 

They definitely set off the alarm in the bar. 

Strike two. 

The alarm company called and the manager sorted it all out. It could have been a huge ordeal though. I've been there plenty of times where the alarm went off and all the local emergency services showed up. That's a post for another day. 

&gt;*Random lesson of the day time: don't ever just decide to walk around a restaurant. I had no idea where these people were going. Did they want to move to the bar after their meal? Were they looking for the bathrooms? So many questions! If they had just taken two seconds to say ""hey we're gonna go to the bar to smoke,"" things would have been so simple. I could have just been like, ""naw, y'all can't smoke in here. And the bar is closed tonight. I don't mind if y'all smoke out front even though it rings the damn bell every time you open the fucking door jesus christ kill me why am i even a server""*

After hanging out with their buddies for about two hours, they asked for the check. Not individual checks. Just one. Awesome. I can add that up quick so they could leave so I finish closing duties and also leave. It ended up being $44.04 total. I run the lady's card through the card machine. I print the receipt for her to sign. She puts $3 on the little line for a tip. And then **fucking counts on her fingers to figure out the total and still puts *$48.04.*** 

I can't. 

Edited to add: We have a lot of old pictures and historic stuff hanging on the walls or on display. I don't mind people walking around after the meal or while waiting on their food and looking at this stuff. Little kids especially love roaming around and looking at the antiques we have (cameras, typewriters, etc). Just please don't touch. And I don't know where or when the pictures were taken, so please don't ask. And if you're crouched down in the hall area and you see me coming through with steaming hot plates, please move.

As much as some people may be mouth breathers, you cannot have EVERY SINGLE COMMENT you do not agree with, removed. If that were the case, we wouldn't *have* any comments.

So here is a guideline of what is acceptable and not acceptable when comments are concerned.

***Unacceptable*** **Comments:**

* Comments deliberately using offensive language.

* Comments that contain racial slurs.

* Comments that contain revealing information of the OP, the post, or yourself.

* Comments that ""bully"" or harass other users.

***Acceptable*** **Comments**

* Comments *not* containing any of the above stated.

* Comments that express one persons views and opinion.

* Comments relating to the story, or advice given.


As you can see, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Just because you may not agree with that opinion, doesn't mean it is grounds for removal. That is what the *downvote* icon is for.

 If we were to remove **every single comment** that everyone didn't agree with, not only would we be hypocritical, but we would be *violating the first amendment of the constitution.*

To start, I just want to say that I grew up in a city of around 60,000 in Wisconsin. There's a bar on every corner, and throughout my life I've been in many of them. Good ones, crappy ones, everything in between. I've been in small town bars before, too. Nothing prepared me for this.


For my mom's birthday one year we went to check out a newly built casino. For the record it was me, my wife, my mom, my dad, and my sister. We are all lower middle class looking people, I think. Upon arriving at the casino we discovered they didn't have any sort of restaurant so we asked a security guard if there was a place to eat nearby.


I don't want this to get too lengthy, but basically we ended up in a small nearby town, and opted for the only place we could find, an establishment called ""Klinker's Bar &amp; Grill"". The name wasn't encouraging, but it looked okay on the outside.


We walked inside, and I was instantly reminded of the Simpson's episode where the Hibberts enter Moe's Bar. There were three people inside; two at the bar, and the bartender. All three turned to stare at us without saying a word. The amount of ""unwelcome"" we felt was surreal. Felt like a tv show. My mom tentatively asked if the ""grill"" was open. The bartender said ""Yeah"". That was the only thing he said to us the entire time.


We sat down in the eating area, and were handed menus without a word. The lights were off. He did not turn them on. No offer of drinks. Whatever, we look at the menus, which turn out to be pretty standard bar fare, which was exactly as we expected. We look at the menus, but we're all feeling uncomfortable and unwanted. We wait for him to come back to ask about drinks. I get more uncomfortable, and we start to discuss if we should go somewhere else. I finally can't take it any more, and say I want to leave. So we stood up, and right as we did so the bartender was coming over to us, and we filed past him in single file without saying a word. Fucking awkward.


A simple greeting (even if disingenuous), asking for drinks, and turning on the light in the eating area was all it would have taken for us to stay there. I get it, you didn't want to make a bunch of food, and we apparently looked like uptight city-folk or some bullshit to you. Apparently making money for the place and getting a tip was too much work.

The first was a successful dinner-theater that had been run since the late 70's/early 80's where I worked as a bus boy during high school for three and a half years.  The second was a (then) brand-new steakhouse where I worked for a month and a half before I was unceremoniously fired while I was substituting for another waiter (I literally was not supposed to be working that day).

The owner was a great, charismatic guy.  He had two managers, one that managed the bartenders (who was a cool guy) and one who managed the waiters (colossal douchebag), as well as the top chef.  The waiter manager, my boss, had apparently never ran a restaurant before, because us waiters didn't even *have* sections.  We were assigned tables on a rotation schedule based on which tables were seated.  This lead to dumb shit like a waiter having tables on literally opposite sides of the restaurant.

There was only one hostess, a woman in her 60's who was a friend of the owner's family.  She was a huge bitch.  She was a harpy to all of the waiters, but especially me, because I was one of two guy waiters among the female waitresses (actually I can't even remember if there was another male waiter or if I was the only one).  I can't think of any other reason except I was a total waiter noob, but I wasn't a complete ignoramus of how a restaurant is run, after the three and a half years of busboy experience.

So one night, about 2-3 weeks after I started working there, I'm working and a customer approaches me and says that his table had been sitting there for 20 minutes without a waiter.  The hostess bitch forgot to tell one of us waiters that they were seated there!  I apologized profusely and took their table.  Got their drink orders and meal orders in.  The 20 minute wait pissed off the table though, and when the guy asked for Heinz 57 sauce for his steak, got really pissed when I told him we only have A1.

They were finishing their meals when the hostess bitch told me that she needed their table ASAP, and that I should tell them to leave.  Being an idiot, I did, as graciously as I could, tell them that their table was needed for more customers.  The Heinz 57 guy was, obviously, pissed off, and demanded to see the restaurant owner.  I got the owner and the guy let him have both barrels about how shitty the restaurant was and that they wanted a full refund, which the owner gave them.  They did leave me a tip, though.

During the next staff meeting, I brought up the concept of waiter sections and how it makes more sense for a waiter to wait 4-5 tables next to each other than their stupid rotational thing.  This pissed off the hostess bitch so much that she nagged me literally every shift, forcing me to wrote a letter to the owner saying that if she keeps up, I'll quit.  After that she tried to kiss my ass.

It was that job that convinced me to go back to school for something practical (which I did, in biotechnology, which I discovered that a local tech school had a program in).  3 years later, I have a job as a lab tech in a startup chemistry lab and it feels great.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_162yy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/162yy7/the_hostess_is_a_bitch/,

Alright, so a bit of back story. I had this store manager- let's call her Jean. Jean was a a short, hefty 20 something who thought being a pizza manager was the best thing since sliced bread, she took her job and yours very seriously. She also wore too much eye make-up. She was the kind of person to talk about you to another server while you were 10 feet away cleaning tables. That happened, whatever. Anyway, she would get you into trouble with the head store manager and act like he just happened to find out on his own. She also told all our co-workers MULTIPLE times that I had officially been fired. I never understood why she was doing this, since I always had my job and was never fired- it just made her look stupid.

So here's my story.

It was Friday and my shift just started. I come in, dress in my attire and begin my duties. Well, for whatever reason, it was a slow day. So, Jean told me that I could go home and that if she needed me, she would call. HOWEVER, and I fucking STRESS THIS, HOWEVER- she said (and I quote) ""If I don't call you before 7, then don't worry about coming back in."" (As in, if it got busy and they needed people, she should be calling before 7. If not, then whatever, no need to go back.)

She called me at 7:10. I missed said call because I was grocery shopping. However, she said  ""If I don't call you before 7, then don't worry about coming back in."" Okay, so it was after 7 when she called, but I didn't see the missed call until like 8:30. **She** only tried to call **once** and did **not** leave a message, so I thought it wasn't a big deal. Cool. Not.

SO. Sunday rolls around and we have a staff meeting. I show up and sit with all my co-workers waiting for this shit to get over with. All of a sudden, Jean comes out in front of all of us and says ""Kamajo8991, can you come to the back with me?"" and everyone ""oooh"" 's like we're in school and the principal called me to his office or something. So I follow her back, only to find my giant douche canoe of a store manager back there waiting for me. *sigh* This conversation took place, all while Jean is standing right next to us:

**BossMan: So tell me what happened on Friday.

Me: I don't know. What happened on Friday?

BossMan: (he thinks I'm being sassy, so he gives me a look) Apparently you got called in to work on Friday and didn't show up.

Me: Well that didn't happen. 

BossMan: According to Jean here, multiple people tried to get a hold of you and you never came in.

Jean: Yeah, a lot of us tried to call you.

Me: First of all, no. Nobody but Jean tried to call me, and it was well after 7- the time she told me I didn't need to come back if a call wasn't made prior to 7. She left no message, and again, she was the only one to call.

Jean: Yes we did.

BossMan: I'm going to go ahead with what Jean's telling me, seeing as she's your manager. I don't feel she has any reason to lie.

Me: Excuse me, but she is just as capable of lying to you as I am. AND, I will gladly go to my cellphone provider and print out my missed calls and anything else you'd like proof of, just to show you that I'm not the one making crap up.**

BossMan proceeded to tell me I was on an unpaid leave for a week and I would get a call from him saying if I would be keeping my job. He eventually did call and I did still have my job, but I had enough of all this bullshit since it had started as soon as I got there. I was never anything but pleasant to her and everyone else in the place (I'm being mean here though, because it still pisses me off).

Well, I told him he could keep my job position because I was sick of all her bullshit, and that I couldn't believe how he hasn't realized why he's lost so many employees. It was because of Jean. I was fed up, and quite rude to BossMan over the phone, but whatever, he's a prick.

Her grandma says to her, 'Honey, Grandma has take out an education savings plan for you so that you don't have to be a server.'

Bam.  Right there.  This poor little girl just learned that being a server is beneath her, that it's something undesirable and 'low.'  That it's not a worthy job, and that the only people who do it are those without an education or any 'better' prospects.

I have a degree in chemistry.  I put myself through university by working in restaurants in almost every different area.

As a server, I don't mind cleaning up crumbs and the table. I don't get pissed if your toddler got a little overzealous throwing around the Cheerios. But if I have to clean up a disaster zone spanning a 10ft radius of your table, I'm going to be pissed. 


Most notably, was the time I worked at a small family restaurant where the majority of seating was against one wall. One long booth ran along the entire length of the restaurant. On a slow afternoon, I finally get a table. It's a family with a little boy. While the parents are eating the little boy starts running and playing around the restaurant (on the main floor not behind the bar or going near the kitchen). Which I don't mind because he's not disturbing anything. Then he stands on the booth and starts running up and down the booth the entire length of the restaurant. I can't say anything because it's my only table and they are friends of the owners. BUT THIS IS NOT OKAY! After they left I had to not only do a ton of cleaning under their table but I also had to clean and sanitize the entire booth or basically most of the seats of the restaurant.

I used to work in hospo back when I was a student, in a restaurant that earned most of its money through tourists (we were a hotel restaurant, the hotel took most of the bookings for cruise ships etc). 
Some of the stories:
American customer: Please speak American English: I can't understand the language you are speaking!
Well, I actually speak english too, and as far as I am aware, the only difference between me and you is that you are not making the effort to understand my accent


In New Zealand, tipping is optional and not leaving a tip doesn't mean that the customer didn't like the service/meal/whatever.
 
Customer from the night before storms in, right in the middle of service:
'I left no tip last night and no-one has contacted me to find out what was wrong with my meal (her server asked her multiple times how she was enjoying it, always responded with 'everything is lovely') How do you expect to keep customers with that attitude?'

Me: Ma'am, in New Zealand tipping is optional, not leaving a tip does not warrant us contacting you
Customer: SO!! At restaurants back home if I don't tip the manager contacts me to find out why! I am appalled and will be making sure the news papers hear about this!!

(Im not actually sure where this lady was from, her accent was very neutral, Im not sure what news papers she was talking about but we never heard about it again)

Last story:
We were serving a Hapuka (species of fish) carpaccio special. After telling the customer about the special, I began explaining what we meant by carpaccio, because it was a very loose interpretation of it. Customer interupts: Don't worry, I know what carpaccio means. Ill take the special, can the chef make it a main size? 
I went and checked, the chef said 'urggg that won't be very nice but if he wants'

I tell the customer that the chef doesn't recommend it because it will have to be a large chunk of essentially raw fish (in nicer words). 

The customer assures me he knows what he is talking about and he will take it. OK sure.
*ten minutes later when the food has arrived*

Customer: Everything is lovely, I just feel like this fillet is quite thick, and I think the chef must have slightly misjudged how long to cook it for

Remember this is carpaccio - its only supposed to be slightly seared around the outside anyway, and the customer said he knew this

Me: ok, is there anything I can do such as take it back to the kitchen or order you something else?

Customer: no, I am fine, its still tasty! 

Even left a $20 tip on the way out the door

Next day, we get an email that said basically:
The server did not tell me my food was going to be raw, she said it was a carpaccio, I like my carpaccio cooked well done, but she didn't bother to even ask and wouldn't take it back to the kitchen when I expressed my concern!!

I work about 30-40 hours a week and I give 100% every minute I work.

I have standards and expectations of my customers and co-workers, but I in no way feel that I am better than anybody.

*It's Friday, middle of lunch rush, and we're very busy and grill team is falling behind. Orders are building up and customers are becoming restless.*

A man comes in, maneuvers his way through the crowd that has built up in the lobby, approaches one of my managers and says that he just went through the ""drive-thru"" and we screwed up his milkshake. (There was a little vanilla on the bottom of his chocolate milkshake.)

Normally his frustration would be understandable, but in this case, he berated one of my mangers and used gratuitous amounts of swear words in front of women and children.

I go up to the out of line customer and say, ""Excuse me sir, but I am going to have to ask you to watch your language, there are women and children about.""

The unruly customer responds with, ""I'll do whatever the fu...""

I cut him off and retort with a very audible tone, ""Shut your mouth. You understand me? Good.""

I then walk away from the customer go over to my manager and tell him that I will hand over the now corrected milkshake.

I walk back over to the customer, look him right in the eyes and tell him in a very stern tone, ""You have a good day Sir.""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You would think that would be the end of it.

I stand off to the side by the frappe machine and begin to fill other orders, but milkshake man hasn't left yet.

He's looking for a fight and so am I, but that's why I am joining the military and this guy isn't my enemy. However if he thinks (thought) I would jeopardize my expectations and standards of my restaurant, then he is mistaken.

He looks at me with a laughably wicked stare and says with a meager tone, ""You know, you're pretty cocky kid.
""
I respectfully respond with, ""Sir all I wanted was for you to watch your language.""
With no respite for his brain he says with a tone of condescension, ""Well all I wanted was my milkshake fix.""

I'm pissed and I quickly reply, ""And now it's fixed, so leave and take your attitude with you.""
This whole argument began picking up speed and tempers on both sides were starting to flare, but at the moment I was a fucking stone wall, nothing could shake me, I was Dirty Harry, Rocky Balboa, and Butch Coolidge all rolled into one.

When he ran out of witty ramblings, he then tries to impose his will on me with a subtle threat. If there is one thing that really boils my blood it's big guys using their size to intimidate others. He says to me, ""You know, you better watch your mouth kid.""

I lean in close to his face and say with and audible tone, ""Yeah? What are you gonna do about it?""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*In light of this response, the bully male has been challenged. The tough guy customer has immediately become aware of his surroundings and sees that other customers have taken notice of the altercation and in order for him to maintain his status in the wild jungle of human society he feels the need to act quickly or others will sense he is weak and tear apart the minute he leaves the popular fast food chain.*

I can see he is desperately searching his brain for the next move, all he can come up with is this...
He grabs his milkshake off the counter and throws it at me!

It bounces of my chest and lands on the ground and splat.

Luckily for me not a single drop of milkshake got on me, but my adrenaline has sky rocketed and my blood is boiling.

Gears have been ground, fuses have been burned, crayons have been broken MOTHER FUCKER.

I am a 220 lbs, 6 foot tall, 21 year old that has been training for the past year hoping I get accepted to a Spec-Warrior program in the U.S. military. Just twelve months ago I was 150 lbs and I could barely curl 20 lbs...... Lets just say I know how to handle ""tough guys.""

I point to the door and shout, ""Get or I am calling the police!"" (Haha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The rest of the story sucks and this is a wall of text so I'll finish up.*

No fists were thrown that day.

The police were not called.

The general manager of the store came out from his office and intervened, he replaced the customers milkshake and the asshole left with no repercussions.

I did not get in trouble.

The customer is always right.....utter bullshit.

So, a few years ago I was a student at a fine college by the name of er, Texas College University (TCU). A few times every week, I'd go to the local favorite bar/restaurant, er, we'll call it Ruffalo Bros.

So, I'm at Ruffalo Bros, having some of their world famous Ruffalo wings. It's probably midnight. In walks some dude I've never met, and his girlfriend! He sits down next to me, and I don't pay him much attention. He orders some food, and I'm sitting there watching sportz on the teevee.

Suddenly! ""Hey, hey man. Can I have your celery?"" I look to my left, and he's got his hands on my celery. ""Sure, man. Go ahead."" I wasn't going to eat the celery anyways, he can have it.

""Oh, thanks man. I love celery."" He scarfs down the celery like a desert nomad in an oasis. It's like ambrosia to him. He seemed like a pretty nice guy, albeit extremely drunk. He introduced himself, told me his name (I forget), transferred in from another college where he used to play baseball (drinking problem perhaps?). He was trying his darndest to engage me in conversation, but he was having a really hard time keeping his trains of thought straight.

Suddenly, he reaches over and grabs my wing bowl without asking. I'm finished with my wings at this point. The bowl is full of stripped ~~Buffalo~~ Ruffalo wings, mostly bones. ""Hey man, you mind if I have these?""

""What? Uhhh... sure?""

""Oh, thanks man."" *snarf, crunch* He's eating my discarded buffalo wing bones. I guess they were just gonna go into the trash anyways? His girlfriend's face has a look of horror, and amusement.  ""Man, I love... the bones. I'm like the only person I know who likes them.""

We didn't talk anymore after that, but I walked home in total shock. I told my roommate about it, and we had a good laugh about it.

I'm very new to bartending (just got my cert three weeks ago woo!), so I haven't had legions of drunk people to deal with, but dang. Dude was messed up.

I first started working at an Asian Fusion restaurant about 3 months ago. I've worked a lot in retail however, this is my first food service job. It was my first Saturday dinner shift and the restaurant was super busy. I was barely keeping my head above water and was really flustered. At one point I really just wanted to cry. There was a family and a couple that I was serving and they were just the absolute sweetest people. Even though I was taking forever with their appetizers, drinks and order they were really patient with me and kept a smile on the entire time. Throughout the entire night they were telling me really encouraging things like you’re doing great, don’t worry and because of those two tables I got through the night. When I gave them the check after my awful service they still gave me well over 20% and wrote things like you did a great job. Their notes really reminded me of how wonderful people can be and if it weren't for those two table I don't know if I'd still be at this job.
Tonight that same family AND the couple both came in. The couple recognized me and begged the manager to be seated in my section and the family just happened to be put into my section. I explained to the two tables how their kind words had really encouraged me and had left a huge impact on me. I bought the two appetizers and had a wonderful time serving them. 

There was another family that came in today that had a slight British accent. I asked if they were British and they said they were so I was fangirling like crazy. After I gave them their check the mum asked if I had any ties to Britain and I told her I just love Harry Potter. She laughed and said she does too. So we talked about Harry Potter for a bit and then they left.

Throughout the entire dinner service I couldn't stop smiling.

First off, I love my restaurant. It has its inner politics and other flaws, but so does every restaurant. But I love the people I work with, and I love my bosses. They really do try to help those that they feel work hard know that they are appreciated. I'm a favorite at my work, because I work hard and I'm a team player and I'm not lazy or stupid. And occassionally, I'm awarded for it.

Tonight was one of those times.

I walk in and discovery I'm on a party of 20 with another girl for a special beer dinner. Basically, it's a set, prepaid menu with the beer paired with certain items. The beer rep and his guests were the nicest people I had met in a long time. Only half of his guests show up, and when I asked him what to do with the rest of the food, he first asked me if we can donate it. I told him we do donate to a shelter, but they only come pick stuff up on Sunday. So then he tells me to *give the food to the hardworking staff*. This is filets and duck breasts we're talking about. So I tell the kitchen the food is up for grabs and many ate for free tonight.

At the end of the meal, I ask the rep what he would like to do with the rest of the beers he had stored in our cooler. *He tells me to give it to the staff.* This is quite a lot of beer. I brought an entire case home with me and there was still enough to go around the entire staff. Plenty of people had multiple free beers before leaving. 

On top of all the kind things the rep left behind for us, he tipped me and the other girl on top of the 20% grat. I left work feeling like my hope had been restored in humanity. I couldn't thank the beer rep enough, and I'm sure he has no idea the impact he made on the staff. But *thank you, thank you, thank you* for realizing the staff are real people.

Picked up the rack, noticed there was a little fuzzy thing under one of my fingers, No big deal probably just some cloth that got caught on the rack.

(tiny rant),48,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1emey0/why_is_that_my_fault_tiny_rant/,"I work in a small (super tiny) restaurant and for the most part, our customers are awesome. I love our regulars and I love (most) of our other customers.

Tonight, though. Ugh.
Two ladies came in for dinner and all seemed normal. They weren't super friendly or anything, they just wanted to chat and eat without much interference from their server.

It was time for them to pay and one of them grabs the check and gives me her debit card. I slide it and... the machine can't read it. I try again and again for a couple of minutes (earning me a somewhat evil eye from my busy co-worker) but it won't read the damn card.
Our restaurant policy is that we can't input the data on the machine manually (it requires too much personal information and the owner is not comfortable with that), so I take it over to her, apologizing even though I know that the reason for the card not working is that the magnetic stripe is damaged. Even as I apologize, I let her know that the magnetic stripe on her card is most likely damaged because the machine is not having a problem reading any other cards.

The lady who gave me the card lets out a *huge* sigh and takes it from me, saying ""Can't you just input the card number?"" (I did get the thought that perhaps she knew that her card was damaged but a lot of places are willing to just input the credit card information so she just didn't bother to get her card replaced). I let her know that we're not allowed to do that because it requires too much personal information.

She lets out another sigh and tells me that I should let people know if the credit card machine isn't working *before* they place their orders. What if she hadn't had any cash? She spends another couple of mintues ranting about how irresponsible we are. Seriously?

.... I just. Really?
I mean, sure, it would be easier if we could just take all of the information you're willing to give us and just input your cc number and charge your account, but I **just** told you that the problem was with *your card*, not our machine! 

And if you hadn't had any cash? Maybe we would have called the cops, who knows.

I haven't really had any problems with people not being able to pay their bills (we have only Mastercard and Visa stickers on our windows but we still get people trying to pay with Amex - not that I mind, I give them a sheepish smile and let them know that we can't take Amex) but if you're going to blame me for the ""credit card machine not working"" in a rude tone, I'll make sure that the owners know that you're unable to pay for the bill.

It's *not* our fault that you put your damn card on something that damaged it and you obviously know that your card is damaged from the confident way you said I could just input your address into the card machine because you ""don't mind."" So, screw you, lady. You embarrassed yourself (although you didn't seem to realize it) and you embarrassed your friend (her ears were *red* and she wouldn't look at me the entire time - she had a sudden fascination with the wall), I hope you never step foot in our restaurant again.

A part of me wishes you hadn't had cash, just to see how you would have reacted. Damn bitch.

It was delicious. 

So, I got to work today and Patty told me ""I was upset yesterday because if the way you spoke to me."" I apologized for snapping at her, but let her know that I still meant very thing that I said. I didn't ask my manager how their conversation went. 

The whole shift I received either the old shoulder from her, or attitude whenever we had to interact. She also spent a lot of time huddled up with the second hostess (today was her second shift, and she came to work with us because she is friends with Patty) giggling and glancing in my direction. Whatever, I don't care, it's petty. 

Later in the shift I was walking back to my hostess stand when I saw Patty playing around on my computer. Servers do it a lot, I wasn't concerned. Except that I had guests walking in the door that I had to check in. I whispered ""hey, can you get out of here?"" And nodded toward the door. She turned away from me, greeted the guests, and checked them in for their reservation. Meanwhile I grabbed the menus so I could seat them, and Patty turned, snatched the menus and proceeded to take the table to her section. I said her name and made a ""really?"" face, and she just stormed away. 10 seconds later she sticks her head around the wall that was separating us and asked ""well what do you want me to do with them!?"" I was so exhausted already I told her I didn't care. She sat them in her section and she stormed back into the lobby/hostess area and yelled ""well what do you want me to do with table 43, then?!"" I lost my temper again and told her ""you're gonna do whatever the fuck you want anyway, so I don't know why you're asking."" And I walked away from her. She pretty much avoided me for the rest of the shift, and I stayed in my area. At the end of the shift my manager made us sit down and all try and resolve. Patty started crying and insisted that she was only being nice. I kept my cool, but told her that she was being completely disrespectful and immature. My manager didn't buy Patty's story, but just said that we had to get along and that if we didn't we would both be suspended. I've pretty much been okay with ignoring her, so I'll keep it up. And I think she's scared to do anything else.

I went ahead and sat them in table 2. I took their table and took care of everything they needed. The table behind them (table 3) called me over to complain about their egg rolls being light brown and the ground pork inside still looking pink and raw. I apologized and immediately took the egg rolls to the back. I told the chef and he checked it out. The food thermometer indicates that the food is safe to eat. I told the chef to go ahead and cook some more anyways. Another server takes the food out but the guests still arent happy with their egg rolls. This is where we fucked up. The other server went ahead and told them we can cook it some more but it's going to be well done and way too hard to eat. Being a small restaurant, us servers cannot really offer what bigger restaurants offer when we mess up. The guests asked of the food is safe to eat and the server said yes and told them we've been serving the egg rolls that way the whole day and so far, no one's gotten sick. It was already known that we will take out the egg rolls from their bill. After a couple of minutes, i went back to check on table 2. Asked them if they wanted to go boxes or desserts. They said they were ok and that besides me serving a beef dish before their filipino soup, which made them feel full faster, everything was good. As i was walking back to print their receipt, i over hear table 3 talk to table 2 that they're glad everything was good for table 2 because theirs (table 3) was bad. They told table 2 the situation with their egg rolls and how the server argued with them. Table 2 feeling all heroic, called the said server and started schooling her. She was shouting at the server in front of everyone, so the manager comes in to diffuse the situation. He told them that the egg rolls are indeed taken off the bill and that we are sorry but table 2 feeling like the almighty person that she is, kept shouting and saying that it is bullshit and that if table 3 refused to pay for anything are we gonna call the cops? Manager handled the situation with as much tact as any professional would. Table 2 shouted she will never come back and literally started pointing her fingers to our manager and kept arguing and making a scene, so the manager said politely that she is not welcomed at our restaurant any longer then the manager walked away. She kept yelling at no one and talking loudly. Funny thing was tables across the room are telling her to shut up and just get out. Finally table 1 have had enough of her. Table 1 got up and approached her and tells her to stop shouting because he was trying to enjoy his meal with his family and that table 2 is making it impossible. She finally calmed down but she started taling pictures of our restaurant. About 20 minutes later, she got up to leave and as she was walking by, she mumbled something that really pissed off table 1 so the dude from table 1 chased her and cussed her out.

A couple of days after the incident, she wrote a review on yelp telling her side of the story. According to her review, we argued with the customer (semi-true). She also said that we dont care about customers and that we don't know how to run a business because we told her to leave and never come back. She failed to mention that she made a scene, disrupted other guests, and almost got into a fist fight with another guest. She also said that the filipino community is so disconnected and are so unhelpful to each other. What she doesn't know is that the only thing she's doing is killing the small guys and actually not helping filipinos because reviews like hers can potentially kill a business, which can result to our restaurant cutting our hours or even letting go some workers (which are all filipinos btw). 

Anyways, i know yelp is a helpful tool to a lot of people. But for us negative reviews like these are bad news. Some bad reviews are warranted. OK i dont have a problem with that.

He was sexist, mean, and rude. He would yell out loud if the waitress wasn't there with his pop the minute he sat down.

Well one night he comes in, grunting into his cell phone, and sits in my section. I rush over with his pop but end up hovering, unsure if I should interupt his conversation or come back when he's off the phone. I had a feeling he would yell at me if I waited till he was done so I just stood there until he eventually said, ""Chicken chow mein, Egg Foo Yong."" While he was talking he made a motion with his hand as if to show one thing and then another right beside it.

I wasn't sure if he wanted two whole orders or a combo plate with the two items on it, and I didn't want to interupt him, so I asked my boss. The boss said it was for sure a combo plate because that is what he always got.

Sure enough, when I brought him his food. He yelled at me and called me stupid because he wanted two whole orders, not a combo. If he hadn't have been on his phone, I could have asked him to confirm. From that day on, I've resolved not to approach tables when they are on the phone. I know my managers might not agree with this but I find it completely rude to be on the phone when you're at a restaurant. I will be more than happy to serve customers when they are finished on the phone.

So, how do you handle customers who are on their phones?

As servers and people who work in the food industry know, when you get super packed sometimes you cannot provide service to the best of your ability. And as customers don't ever seem to realize, they are not the only table in the entire establishment. My place is pretty unique in that it has three (technically four) levels, so it is a HUGE restaurant (bar in the basement, tavern/kitchen at ground level, dining room upstairs, and additional balcony upstairs as well). 

Of course I am working a pretty full section (as is everyone else) when a walk-in party of 20 people arrive and are seated, you guessed it, way in the very top level. So I already know this is going to be LOTS of running around and stairs. As often happens with big parties, people arrive and order drinks as they please (oh also, did I mention it was happy hour on top of it?) some even throw appetizers in, then by the time you bring those drinks, more people arrive and this goes on and on. THEN you need to take orders for the group, and of course everyone wants to special prep every single thing in their meal. By the time I finish taking the orders and start the task of putting them in, a smaller party of maybe 10 people arrive in my section. So I decide to quit the little progress I made in my food entry and just go greet the table or else they would be waiting too long. Of course they just decide to order everything at once instead of letting me get the drinks and give them some time to look the menu over (plus giving me a little time to play catch up with my other party). Now I have tons of food to put in and drinks etc. Everything is fine, I finish and everything is in for both tables, but my manager approaches me and says my party of 10 is VERY unhappy. I explained I was waiting on drinks at the bar to get all their drinks at once, and all their food was in. This really bothered me because for as long as I've been working at this restaurant, I've NEVER received a complaint on my service. They were taken care of, manager gave them free deserts and damage control was done. Perfect. Everything is dandy. 

Fast forward some general running around and grabbing drinks etc. and my party of 20 gets their food. Things are going fine, I check on them a few times, bring more drinks (up and down stairs and stairs and stairs) and ask if they were all set for the bill. And, you guessed it, all separate checks. Fortunately I asked them earlier if this would be the case, so I had everything written down for each individual person, but as the night goes on, people randomly order drinks that you don't even bother writing down because you just want to get them in and drop them off. So now starts the task of splitting 20 separate checks, of course things were unaccounted for, figuring all that out, fixing it and finally it is all done. My manager approaches me again saying there was a couple who was very unhappy complaining about 1.) I never took appetizer orders and he had to come down the stairs to tell me what they wanted (um...I did, everyone just arbitrarily gave me orders, and I had run downstairs to grab drinks, I was coming back for food); 2.) They never got the honey mustard they asked for (I brought, not the 2 oz. cups we normally do, but the 4 oz. cup of honey mustard for you. Bitch); 3.) The food took too long (What were you expecting??? You had 20 orders to make on a FRIDAY at happy hour); 4.) Orders were messed up (okay, one burger was missing a jalapeno); 5.) Waters were never refilled (I had brought a pitcher to the table earlier for refills and left one with them so everyone could refill water when they needed it). Overall, it was little things they were complaining about that were really insignificant. Could I have provided better service? Absolutely. But it was one of those nights when you are so swamped you cannot be there for your table's every beckoning wish. At the end of the night I think most people were happy, and my manager was super understanding so it was okay. But having never had a single complaint ever, having two in one night was a major bummer. 

Despite all of this, I was reminded tonight why I really do love the place I work. Even though everyone was getting their butt kicked with more than full sections, they were all helping me out. When I took on a large party, one of my co-workers took over half of my section, people ran drinks and food and throughout the entire time I was consistently asked, ""Are you okay? What can I do for you?"" Near tears by the end of the night, everyone came over and gave me the biggest hugs ever with reassuring words about what a good job I did and how everyone has those nights etc. Seriously, this made me really realize just what great people I work with and  wanted to say a thank you, in general, to all of you who pick up your co-workers when their down. Despite it being the worst shift I have ever had, I was really reminded that there is a lot of good. 


**tl;dr** Very busy Friday night, swamped with tables and parties. People complain because they just can't seem to realize they are not my only table in the entire restaurant, and are a party of 20 on the fourth level of the restaurant.

It took her another 10 minutes to get back over to us, meanwhile we saw her hanging out behind the bar talking to the bartender, and we were unable to get attention. After ordering she disappeared again, after waiting over 20 minutes for 2 appetizers to come out, another waitress (who we saw doing ALL the work for ALL the tables) came out, dropped our food on  the table in a huff and left. Our waitress came over before I could even take a bite and asked if everything was ok, but she walked away before I could even respond. About 2 minutes later I finished my water. I placed it at the edge of the table so she would be able to see it. After that point  I saw her talking to the manager, she knocked stuff to the floor and other waiters had to clean it up, she was behind the bar with the manager listening to one direction and talking about her opinions about the music. I tried to flag her down repeatedly ,and stare etc her etc, she purposely turned her head away. The MANAGER did the same. I NEVER GOT A REFILL ON WATER! I tried to get other waiters and waitresses, they all looked at my empty water glass before approaching and then as they walked by quickly averted their eyes ignoring me so I could not get a refill.

But I  digress, I really just wanted to share a piece of advice that the owners handed down that helps me have a bit of grace for those difficult guests: Remember that everyone you serve (or deal with in all aspects of your life) are people with a history.

So me and 5 guys go out for drinks and food every Thursday. Same cast, rotates between 4 or 5 main mid level eateries. Think boneless chicken wings and 2 for 1 wells type of a place. Always sitting at the bar or in the bar area. 

So every Thursday, we all turn in a credit card for 6 total, and ask the bartender or server to eliminate cards one by one. First 3 cards are safe, 4th card pays 10% tip, 5th card pays 20% tip, last card pays the tab (we never disclose the tip part) 

This whole exercise lasts a minute or two depending on the bartenders current workload/ flair for theatrics. 

So help me out. Are we being dbags? Should we just figure out another way to gamble the tab like the sprinters in Miller Lite commercials?

I left for the wonderful world of  banking a few years ago, but there are somethings that I will never forget about working there.  I could go on and on about crazy customers and nice ones, not to mention the politics of this particular establishment, but we’ll save that for another post.  This first tale didn’t even happen to me, but one of my coworkers.  It’s also the whole reason why I hated telling customers my name.

This happened during the early shift, around lunch time.  We were slow, like always, but there were a few tables.  My coworker (we’ll call her CW) just got sat a 3 top of women who appeared to be in their late 50’s.  The interaction started out normal enough.  CW brought the table their drinks, took their food order, and everything was good.  She was in the back for about a minute after taking their order, when we heard yelling.

Obnoxious Lady:  CW!!! CW!!!

So CW goes to her table.  After a few seconds, she comes to the back and grabs them some waters.  We all think it’s a little strange, but forget about it soon enough.

The tables food is ready, and CW is occupied with another table.  I run it out for her, and ask them if there’s anything else I can get for them.  They say no, so I tell them to enjoy their food and I’m on my way.

As soon as CW sets foot in the back to put her other tables order in, OL starts yelling her name again.  This time they wanted some more bread.  

To avoid hearing her name echo across the restaurant, CW decides to check on the table again after they’ve been eating for a few minutes.  She asks how everything is, if there’s anything they need, etc.  OL says to her, I kid you not, “Honey, if I need you, I’ll call for you.”

The rest of the time that table was there, it went exactly like that.  They were a nice enough table, apparently, but it was just too strange.

I've only worked there for 3 weeks and have finally started to get comfortable with it despite my social anxiety. The same day this happened a dancer actually complimented me for being a good server :). While working my 1st busy night shift I accidentally picked up a dancer's beer that still had some beer left. I had been keeping an eye on it for a while and she hadn't touched it for 20 min. so I assumed it was done. I asked her with a smile if she needed anything else. She said no angrily and  grabbed it off my tray without even looking at me. I said I was sorry and I felt really embarrassed. Later on I saw a glass with two of those test tube shooters in it and I once again accidentally grabbed it when one of the 2 shooters still had some alcohol in it. I brought it back as soon as I noticed and apologized but the dancer (not the same 1 as before) was mad at me and yelled at me in front of a customer. I said sorry again and she chewed me out for taking her friend's beer earlier. She acted like I was just too lazy to check to see if it's empty or stupid. I said sorry multiple times and she said ""it's ok"" in a really sarcastic way with a fake smile on her face. I walked away and the customer tried to stick up for me but she said ""she needs to learn!"" really loudly. I'm still upset over it because I'm socially awkward penguin.

http://firstwefeast.com/laugh/the-20-most-annoying-things-servers-do-at-restaurants/

This is my open letter response to the butthead who wrote it.  If anyone has something to add to the explanation, let me know.

~Warning~ Wall of Text Ahead ~

 Servers introduce themselves by name
	Ok, we do this for several reasons:
		1. We respond quicker if we hear 'Hey Glenn' instead of 'Uh sir' or 'Waiter!'
		2. If you can't find us and another server is trying to help you, it's easier to say 'I'm looking for Glenn' instead of 'Yeah that one guy, tall sorta fat but with brown hair and I think he had ranch dressing on his shirt...'
		3. And yes, it is a way to remind you that we are a person with a name and not some smiling food baring robot.

Touching
	I'll give you that. Touching can be a little weird. But if it's an accidental arm brush or shoulder knock, you're fine.  Oh, and P.S. if you want your food, we're going to have to touch your plate and 95% of the time, our hands are cleaner than yours.

Saying everything is amazing
	Newsflash! We're here to sell you stuff! Instead of asking 'How's the burger?' maybe you should ask us 'What is your opinion on the bacon burger?'  I know that I will always give my honest opinion, but you have to ask for it.

Wait forever for water and whatnot
	I don't know if you know this but there is a good chance that you are not our only table. Also, most of us don't wear mind reading pants so we don't know when you are going to walk though our doors and be seated in our section.  There is also a portion of the population who doesn't like to drink water. So, if we brought water out to everyone, there would be a good chance that it would just take up table space.  As for the bread and chips, would you rather them hot and fresh from the kitchen or cold and stale because they were left on the table, waiting for the chance for you to come and sit?And frankly, from what I've seen, most people don't like to be bum-rushed when they sit down.  I, personally, give a table about forty-five seconds to get themselves situated before I come over to get drink orders. 

""Do you know how the restaurant works?""
	Again with the mind reading pants.  We have no clue if you have been here before.  We don't know if you know that we put jalapeños and guacamole in our tapas to make it more Tex-Mex.  We do this so you know what you're getting and what to expect. 

'You need to ask your waiter'
	Normally, if another server brings out your food, or is passing by and you need something, they will be more than happy to grab it for you... if it is something they can get.  Ask for extra ranch? Sure! Another refill of Coke? Of course!  Another beer? Not so much. At most restaurants, alcohol has to be entered in to the computer by the server who is in charge of the table. They either have a card, number, or password that they have to enter into to system in order to get a beer.  You want dessert?  Again with the magic passcode/card.  For the most part, the other servers will help out as much as we can before we have to grab your server. Just don't get annoyed when we tell you that not just anyone with an apron can grab you your beer.


Taking a knee, squatting, or sitting
	There are tall servers in this world.  There are also servers how have a hard time hearing over the music, chatting, and screaming children at 41, 23, and 11. There are guest who like to talk in to their menus.  There are also guests who like to mumble.  Those are the main reasons we take a knee or squat.  Sitting should never happen.

The upsell
	Just like you have quotas and deadlines for your job, upselling is ours.  If our mangers don't hear us telling you about the lobster mac or why the platinum margarita is better than the house 'rita, we get in trouble. It can be as simple as 'Hey you need to upsell more', to losing shifts and hours.  Just humor us by listening and politely telling us that the regular mac is fine.  

Make you feel bad for just getting dessert, drinks, appetizers
	We're not mad if you grab a dessert and some coffee, stay for 20 minutes and tip well.   We're mad when you order a dessert and some coffee, stay for 2 hours and leave a dollar.  You are taking up real-estate. We pay the 'rent' for the table by having you in and out in a timely manner.  We can't afford to waste two hours on your endless need for free refills on coffee and only get a couple dollars from it.  In two hours, we can normally get two or three tables and make anywhere from $5 to $30 in that time frame. But no. We are waiting on you to have your fill of coffee and molten cake.  Also, we may be waiting to go on break or go home and we can't leave until you do.  If you are the reason that I don't get a break and have time to sit, eat, go to the bathroom, or just plain rest, you can bet you will feel bad.  

""Do you need Change?""
	There is a reason we ask this and most of the time, it's not because we want to pocket your coins.  It's when you give us $100 bill on a $22 check. Most restaurants, servers have to bring their own change. Yeah. It's true.  I know at our restaurant, the only register we have is in the bar and it is ONLY for the bartender.  I'm asking you if you need change because I need to know if I'm going to spend 10 minutes asking all the servers if they they have change for the $100 or the $50 or the $20.  And then after all that we come back to find that either, you left leaving us the change, you're still there waiting to know how much change you're getting because you can't do math and you think that we are walking change makers, or you're there and annoyed that it took me 10 minutes to get your change because I had to go through six different people to get it. So, it's not just because we want a tip; it's to save us and you time.

Special's Prices
	We gauge your interest when we tell you about the specials.  If you're super into it, most of us will let you know about the price.  If you're flipping through your menu, picking your nose, or just overall not interested, we're not going to tell you.  Think about it; if you're not into the seafood, you're not going to look for the seafood prices.

Taking away your plate
	If you have four fries left on your plate and you have been chatting away with your buddy for ten minutes, I'm going to assume you're done.  If you're not, just tell me! I will give it back to you.  Also, don't put your napkin on your plate if you still want to eat what's on it.  That's gross.  And, if you and whoever you are with are going to the bathroom, leave something at the table so we know not to take your stuff. It's really that simple.

Over sharing
	If I ask you if you need anything else and you crack the lame joke of 'Oh can it be free?' I'll give you a laugh and tell you that 'I would love to but my education can't pay for itself!' I might tell you what I'm majoring in and what I want to do with it.  I might say that my mom has the same blouse or shoes. I want you to know that I am a person and that I do have some semblance of a life outside of work.  I know the servers who will stand there and talk about what their five kids are doing every hour of the day.  I understand this one and it can be a hit or miss with who you have as a server.

Passing off mistakes 
	We will apologize for any mistake. That's just a fact.  I can't help it if the kitchen dropped your well done steak late, it was ran to the wrong table, or the cooks burnt your chicken.  Pocket checks happen.  But you can bet that we will do our damnedest to let everyone in that kitchen know that your table should be their highest priority.  The reason we tell you the kitchen dropped your stuff late is so that you are aware of what's going on and not just sitting in the dark.  We're not passing off mistakes. We are keeping you in the loop so that you don't gouge our tip.

Going all out on Cheese and Pepper
	Yeah that sucks... Maybe try asking for it on a separate plate and add at your leisure?

Happy face checks
	If you let slip that it's your anniversary or your kid just won his soccer game, and we write 'Happy Anniversary' or 'Congrats' on your check, it's us letting you know that we were paying attention. If we write thank you, we actually mean it.  We took the time to to put that there because we are actually grateful that you were there.  We aren't doing it to be cute.  We are doing it to let you know that we are listening to you and what's going on in your world and not just ours.  

Hit on your date
	Yeah, that's not good and just plain creepy.

Napkin Folding
	Now, I can't speak for myself, but a coworker of mine did that at another place he worked for and it was a sign that the person was coming back and not to take their plate.  

'Another' and 'More'
	I didn't know that these were secret code words.  I use them interchangeably. 

Disappearing
	If you down right scare us, if you snap at us every time we stop by, or if you are just down right annoying, that's a good way to make us poof.  Sometimes, we get stuck in the kitchen, helping out and what not.  We try not to disappear but we can't always be right next to your table.  We have ten million other things to take care of.

(longish),45,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/187i7j/im_not_sure_how_last_night_could_have_gotten_any/,"I'm a trainee at this family themed restaurant. Anyway, my boss comes up to me and says ""Corporation says you can only be training for 5 to 7 days. On friday, you will test."" (Insert thick German accent)

So, yesterday I was supposed to serve a few of my own tables, plus my boss. I test terribly, so I've been nervous all week for this night. I forgot that Fridays are our ""All-you-can-eat fish night.""

So I get my first table, a three top. Two adult men and their mother. They were kind enough, I thought I was doing pretty well. Then BAM, once the dinner rush started, they kept re-ordering their fish as soon as I could get their plates out to them. At this point, I'm shaking half to death because they're getting impatient and I'm running around the kitchen like a chicken with my head cut off looking for someone to help me with our goddamn computer system. I couldn't figure out how to resend an order, and my orders weren't being shown on the line.

Cue my second table, another three top. I'm trying to keep calm and not faint from all the stress. They tell me their drink order, and I write down what I heard. Coffee, a strawberry shake, and a chocolate shake. So I run back to find someone to help me make these shakes because I have no clue. Finally, I get help, and it takes me longer than 5 minutes to get my drinks out to them. (time standard is 2). When I set the drinks on the table, they sort of raise their eyebrows at me, but they don't say anything. They aren't ready to order yet, so I run back to my other table that keeps flagging me down for refills and condiments.

 I'm supposed to suggest one of our pies at least three times. So the woman says that yes, she would like to try our new pie. Fine. I put that on the back burner for a minute, because here comes my boss, party of one, in the middle of my three table section. Shit. I'm really freaking out because the kitchen is completely backed up and I'm running 15 minute tickets as it is. (10 minutes is time standard) I have no idea what to do, because my boss asks me what kind of appetizers we have. Shit! I have no clue, they aren't on the menu, therefore I didn't memorize them. He is not impressed. Strike one. He orders an appetizer and a sandwich with a specific change to it. I enter it into the system and I'm pacing up and down the line, wondering where the fuck my reorders are. Through all this, I forgot about the woman's pie, so when I went to get my other three-top's order, she was starting to get impatient. Fine, I go back and get her the pie. No problem. Boss is asking me what's taking so long on his order. I apologize, and he goes to investigate the kitchen. I feel really bad for our cooks, but I need my orders, and the other three servers are constantly trying to take my plates out of the window.

The other table's order finally came up, 10 minutes later than it should have. I know I'm fucking up majorly, but I can't really do anything about the speed of the kitchen.

After a few more fuck ups with plate presentation at my boss's table, and the odd requests of my three-top with the milkshakes, my boss finally pulls out a chair and tells me to sit down in the middle of his meal. He tells me that I need to work on a lot of things, and lists my various mistakes. He then points to the three-top in front of him, the milkshake people, and told me that was his family. I'm cringing pretty hard at this point. I know I did bad. I forgot to ask one of the customers how he wanted his eggs, I gave one of them coffee instead of the coke he wanted, I didn't fill up my boss's glass all the way, I sloppily put ranch in his side cup, etc etc. I'm feeling terrible. He then goes on to tell me that my tables had some nice things to say about me, but I'm still unhappy. He gives me a ten dollar bill and tells me that it's on the behalf of him and his family. Great, a pity tip.

I now have to go back into training for a few more days, and retest. I'm not sure how much longer I can fuck up before I get fired.

Blah, blah,I already told you this before. (actual name of this flavor of hell is withheld.)

We have a new hire, let's call her Ditzy. As the name implies, she is not the brightest fish in the bowl. 19, pregnant, beauty-school dropout, and she still smokes although she's at least three months along. She is one of those people who are generally a pain in the ass to work with. She never finishes her side work, begs others to pick up her slack, and is not a team player at all. Aside from that, she's an *AWFUL* server. Always forgetting about her tables, ignoring requests, fucking up orders frequently, and is rude to the customers!

This story begins a week or two ago, on a Wednesday. If you read my previous post, this was the same night I was stuck with Col. Mustard. If not, I'll summarize by saying it was one of the worst shifts I ever worked.

Pause from that for a moment. We have another newish server, who arrived about a week after me. We'll refer to him as Drama King. He complains. a *lot*. Anyway, he absolutely hates Ditzy, and at first I didn't see what bit his crotch, because while she hasn't an intelligent thought roaming in her head, she seems pretty benign to me. That is, until that particular Wednesday night hell unfolded.

I arrived at 5:30. Drama King had clocked on two hours prior to me, and right away he started ranting and raving about how shitty he was doing with tips. I thought, *well, it IS Wednesday.* this special brings the cheapest crowd out. (I'm sure you know what type I'm talking about.) That night was crazy and ill-planned, with servers being sat all over the place. I was turning tables like mad, and running around to satisfy all the guests. And yet, my tips seem to be particularly shitty. Shittier than they should have been. It appeared that tables were stiffing me more often than they were leaving me money. Which was a little fishy. Drama King starts getting really fired up a while later and claims that Ditzy is stealing money off his tables while he is running food. I was a little skeptical, but I listened. I watched Ditzy follow Drama King around and wander past his dirty tables behind his back. While I didn't see her straight-out pocket the money, she was definitely acting sketchy. But I had full hands and more important things to worry about than his and my shitty tips. Then one of our MOD's exclaims that anyone who doesn't know how to work the register should not be touching it, because a server had just been fucked out of more than one register tip. I asked MOD if it had been my tips that were lost, and when she said yes, I immediately knew who had done it, and i was MAD. that vapid bitch fucked me out of more than 8$ because she didn't tell the customer to sign the tip receipt. No signature=no tip, because we cannot charge that credit card without authorization. So, my night continued in a shitstorm, with me hardly making any money.

Later, shooting the shit with Drama King while waiting for our rides, he complains that he only made 22$ that night. I had made 24$, which was completely disproportional to my sales, which were over 200$. He rants that he was there longer than I was and had twice as many tables. Now, we don't tip out where I work (no one to tip out to, we pretty much do everything), so that 24$ was literally all I got for that 4 hour shift, which was supposed to pull in at *least* 40-ish bucks.

Fast-forward to tonight, a Tuesday night. We were really slow. So slow, we were taking turns taking tables on only one side of the dining room. There were three servers on the clock: Me, Ditzy, and another server we will call Lovely. I was really bored, with only a couple of tables. I kept seating myself with new guests, but every time I went to get their drink orders, Ditzy had fucking stolen them!

I decided, fuck it, since I'm not going to get any more tables tonight, I am going to give my all to the tables I *did* have. I put that charm on, and was having great interactions with my tables, they were laughing and smiling, the whole nine yards. Yet, when they started to leave, no tips! I had been handed 2$ by one table, and had 7$ at the register. But that was it. And then I was cut, although I had only been there for about an hour. So I totaled only four tables for the night.

I moped around in the service aisle for a while, doing my side work and steaming inside about how people can be assholes sometimes. But then, in between filling fruit cups, I had an ""Aha"" moment. Every time Ditzy worked, everyone else seemed to fare lousily in tips, while she claimed to not have earned one cent. What really made me mad was that Ditzy was the closer, so naturally, she had better tables even though she sucked. I confronted her slyly about it, after consulting with Lovely, who agreed that something was up. The conversation went something like this:
""So, Ditzy, did you see any of my tables leave money on the table before they left?""

""No girl, I ain't seen none yet.""

""Really? I thought that regular always tipped well.""

""I don't know girl, I didn't see her leave anything.""

*sigh* ""Well, how did you do tonight anyway?""

""I didn't get no money yet. I only had like three tables.""

""I thought you had at least 20 by now.""

""Nope.""

That conversation went nowhere, and that change jingling in her apron pissed me off even more, because the smell of bullshit was pungent at that point. I went to my MOD and explained my situation. This was the same MOD as that one aforementioned Wednesday, so I knew she was aware of Ditzy's stupidity and lies. She was upset and told me she would phone the GM. After a while, she came back and told me that the GM would pay for my dinner tonight and investigate the issue, as this is not the only time she had been accused of being a dirty fucking thief. Well that was nice and all, but a free dinner is not going to pay for a car or tuition.

/rant. Wtf am I supposed to do about this bitch? I am pretty sure she has been robbing us of our tips, but since I have no proof, it is her word against mine. I'm not going to get compensated for those tips I lost that Wednesday, and I didn't make anywhere near minimum this night. I had to go have a little tantrum in the walk-in before I clocked out, I was so pissed off. Thoughts? Advice?






**UPDATE**:  While Ditzy doesn't work today, I think she works on Wednesday (oh lord, this again). I'll try to keep a close eye on her and put into effect the baited tip.

I'm the senior bartender at a fairly popular alternative nightclub.  Depending on the night the music is goth/industrial, house, live bands, burlesque, drag shows, we had a hip-hop night until someone pulled a gun... we cater to a wide group of people, and you aren't likely to hear any pop hits/club bangers, etc.

One night I was working we were having our quarterly throwback rave night.  I typically don't like working those nights, since a lot of people are only drinking water and so they don't feel the need to tip, but work is work so I took the shift.  My mood is apprehensive, but my facade is professionally friendly.

Doors open at nine, and about fifteen people come in right away.  The music is poundingly loud.  It's late fall, and everyone starts to take their coats off and put them on chairs around the tables by the edge of the dance floor.  The first few people are regulars, but it's too loud for small talk.

Then I see this guy coming up out of the corner of my eye.  He's kind of bigger than average, not built but not fat, wish messy brown hair and a Chicago Bears jersey on.  It takes a second for me to get to him with this mini-rush, and I notice he's just sort of staring into space.  After about a minute I get to him.

""Howdy, stranger.  What'll you have?""*

""What's your cheapest shot?""

A question every bartender longs to hear.

""Anything rail is three dollars.""

""I'll have five shots of rail."" He says, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder at the table from which he's come.

""Rail what?"" I ask, since he doesn't seem clear on the concept.

""Vodka.""

I pick up five shot glasses, and he interjects, sounding angry ""NO! WHISKEY!"" 

""You got it!"" I say, since I haven't even touched a bottle yet.

The five shots are poured, and I tell him the price: fifteen dollars.

He gives me a twenty and I turn towards the cash register.  The air is positively vibrating with drum &amp; bass, but I suddenly get the 
feeling that something is wrong. 

My bartender sense is tingling!  

I turn around to see him setting down an empty shotglass.  The last empty shotglass.  Red-faced and gasping like a drowning man, he's thrown back all five shots as quickly as humanly possible.  There's nothing more to be done.
I being to give him his change, and say ""careful there, buddy..."" as he snatches is out of my hand and turns away.

He leaves no tip.

As there's no one left to serve, I keep en eye on him, and sure enough, under a minute later he starts to hurl.  Directly onto the table.  Severely splashing several of his friends.  Grossed out, they go to the bathroom, clean themselves as much as possible while he goes in as well, presumably to throw up some more.  One of the group comes over to me, a shorter white girl, bleached blonde, with a confused demeanor.  She treats each sentence like a question.

""I'm sorry?  My friend threw up on the table? Can I have a towel? Or something?""

I hand a rag over, and she pretty much just pushes the puke from the table to the floor.  I grab the bleach bucket and being to walk over there, and they all leave as I approach without saying a word.  She left the rag on a chair next to her, dripping onto the floor.

To top it all off, I hear from the door guy at the end of the night that the guy who vomited tried to come back in later, his clothes still covered in the stuff, and one of the girls tried to get her money back.

I was due to work a 4-Close tonight (Saturday) and an 11-4 tomorrow (Sunday). On Sunday I had a very bad headache, my glands were swollen and I was very bunged up. Not an ideal way to serve tables. I phoned in sick on Friday night and told them I couldn't work Saturday. No problem.


Today my headaches have got worse, I've developed a very nasty chesty cough and I've felt light headed whenever I stood up. I phone the unit at 23:00 and the conversation goes like this.

""Hi Manager, It's Server.""

""Alright""

""I'm still not well and I won't be able to come in tomorrow unfortunately""

""You're killing us, mate. Why have you left it this late to tell us?""

""I didn't want to phone you in the middle of service.""

""We've 400 people booked tomorrow""

""I appreciate that, I'm sorry but I am not well at all""



The policy when ringing in sick is ""phone at least four hours in advance where possible"". I've phoned in 12 hours, and would have done so earlier if not for service on a saturday night. I've still left him enough time to sort cover and he knew there was a possibility I wouldn't have recovered.


The problem with the unit is it is VERY tight when it comes to wages, meaning they run the floor on minimal staff. It only takes 1 server, heck even sometimes 1 busser, and its sheer bloody chaos. I don't feel like I have done anything wrong and frankly sorting out issues like these are what he is paid to do - he's a manager. If he wants to save wages he takes that risk; people can and will get poorly from time to time and my record should tell him that I'm not simply pulling a sicky.

(Also - If you're wondering what would happen if I got shitty first-time service - I'm sure I'd adjust my tip accordingly, but it honestly hasn't happened in ages.)

My mom and my boyfriend say that I tip way too much, and they won't let me contribute to the tip if they're buying. So my question is: am I being silly?

At the beginning of this year I was working at a Jimmy Johns, and had been for a few months. I went from learning the basics to being able to run the store by myself if need be (basically taking orders by phone, running register, making sandwiches, restocking, slicing, etc.).

One night (at nights we only had 1 manager, 1 driver, and 1 in-store; I was that in-store) a customer calls and asks for a delivery. With Jimmy Johns, we only delivered within about a 10 mile radius as to uphold to our company slogan, ""Sandwiches so fast, you'll freak."" As per every customer, I asked for a phone number to enter in, as that was how we brought up previous customers' information. This was a new customer, so his information had to be put in. I asked for his name and address, and he gave it to me. As I'm not very good with directions or at the time, knowledgeable of the area, I told the customer that I had to check and make sure that his address was within our delivery range.

Man: ""Sure thing, that's no problem.""

We have a small map taped to the wall near where our phones are to quickly check where we deliver to, but the address was within a neighborhood, and as it was a basic map, I was not able to quickly find it.

Me: ""Sir, sorry for the delay, I am going to have to check with a gps.""

All I get in return is a short grunt of confirmation. Okay, well I borrow my friends iPhone and enter in the address. After about, and I kid you not, 45 seconds of me waiting for the GPS to locate the address, the customer chimes in:

Man: ""How long does it take you to FUCKING look up one damn address?""

Me: ""I am sorry sir, I am doing the best I can, I am currently waiting for the GPS to locate your address.""

Man: ""Are you a fucking moron, all I wanted was a damn sandwich, not sit here and wait for you to play on your phone, you fucking idiot!""

And this point I should mention that during this night we were slow, so the manager was next to me so that he could see the order and get started on it, but after the customer began screaming, he nodded and gave me the confirmation to hang up if he didn't cooperate.

Me: ""Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm going to have to hang up on you.""

Man: ""Go ahead you piece of shit, I know where you wo-""

*Click*

What he forgot to realize was that before he decided to scream obscenities at me, he effectively gave me his full name, phone number, and address. Not to mention, if he decided to pay by card, I would have had his card number and the ccv. Needless to say, I may or may not have used his info to post a M4M post on craigslist seeking a wild, unadulterated, unfiltered night of lust and passion...

One night I was working with this girl, Chelsea, who is very nice but gets a bit anxious when things don't go as they normally do.

I greeted a table of two couples, who stayed for a bit over two hours. They ordered apps and then entrees, and were drinking the entire time. Around the two-hour mark I went to check on them and decided it was probably time to cut them off, because the guys were starting to sound kind of drunk and they'd been drinking our strongest beer. I went off to find Chelsea and tell her. She was about to deliver a beer to one of the ladies at the table (which I was fine with, it was our least alcoholic beer and the women seemed fine, it was just the men who seemed drunk). She said ""when I drop this off, I'll tell them they can't order any more drinks unless they get more food, too."" I tried really, really hard to convince her that that was a bad idea and she shouldn't say anything unless they tried to order another round. But apparently she didn't listen. She came up to me a few minutes later and said,

""[The manager] had to go over and talk to the table. I cut them off and they were really mad at me."" I asked her what exactly she said to them, and she told me, ""I said, This is the last beer we can serve you tonight. If you want to order more food, we will reconsider, but if not we're cutting you off. We're just concerned about you because you're so drunk."" She also said something about seeing the girlfriends ""stumbling"" on their way to the bathroom. 

The manager was at the table for about 20 minutes, trying to calm them down. They eventually paid and left, and one of the guys told me he felt bad that I had to work with a girl like that. But of course they didn't tip us. The worst part is that their check was over $200, and before this incident I'd been sure of a decent tip since they all seemed to really like me. The entire time Chelsea was telling me what she'd said, all I could think was, ""didn't you do your ServSafe alcohol training??"" Fortunately it was a busy night so we weren't screwed too badly by the loss of that tip, so all's well that ends well.

(Hence the flair). On these days, a customer can order anything off the menu, *and I mean anything*, and get a free slice of pie. So you can see what kind of stress this puts on the servers.

Anyway, this particular FPW, I come in and see that I have gotten the shitty section again. This section has 6 tables and one booth. **ONE** booth. So I just knew I was in for a good night.

I have barely walked in to the kitchen and tied on my apron when my coworkers yell ""Outrageoushamster, we sat you at table 8!"" Followed by some suspicious glances and hidden smirks. I just knew they set me up with an awful table. I go glance out at the table and see three big, brutish-looking men sitting at the one booth I have. I just sort of sighed to myself and put on that fake smile to go greet them. I introduce myself with my cheery greet and am awarded with 3 blank stares. well, more like two and a half blank stares. I can tell right away something is... off with these men. One of them looks at me with a cock-eyed glance and sort of a strange facial expression like his mouth is stuck in an awkward smile/grimace. The other two look angry with pronounced foreheads. One of them has a hard time maintaining eye contact. I knew they weren't handicapped, just... different.

Anyway, before I can finish my script, they start grunting at me. I can't understand a damn thing they are saying.

""Um, I'm sorry? What can I get you to drink? I didn't quite-""

""MMHMHMcookeMHMH""

One of the guys sort of gives me a mean glare and says slightly more intelligibly, ""HE SAID HE WANTS COKE.""

""Oh! Certainly! And what can I get for you two?""

Aforementioned guy grunts that he wants a cherry coke. The guy sitting next to him is so hard to understand I just look back at the mean one until he tells me rudely that he also wants a cherry coke.

So I walk back into the kitchen to grab their drinks and am greeted with snickers. I just glared at my coworkers.

""Having fun?"" One of them smirks.

""What is up with my table?"" I ask.

""They're inbred."" She responds. ""Haven't you seen them here before?""

""Um, no. And you can't be serious.""

""I am! Those are the brothers that come in all the time. And don't even spend too much time over there, they won't tip you.""

At this point, I am determined to still try my best. Screw my coworkers, they're just being mean. Right?

Wrong.

I go bring them their drinks and ask if they're ready to order. In return I get blank stares. I tell them I'll give them a few more moments, and go greet my second table that has just been sat.

After about 3 minutes, I return to the brothers. They want their pie. Cool, no problem. I smile and say something like ""Ah, so you guys want the best part now, then?"" Crickets. Well, so much for trying to be funny. I come back with their pies, and all of them have sucked down their drinks. Before I can even set down the plates, they pick up the glasses and try to hand it to me and start grunting. ""Oh sure, let me just set this down and I'll get you a new coke right away."" Nope, subtlety is not their forte. They keep grunting and trying to give me the glasses. So, I go grab their refills. Every time I go back to the kitchen, the other servers just shake their heads and give me this sort of ""glad-it's-not-me"" smile. I try my best to ignore them.

Finally, after about ten minutes and 2 more rounds of drinks, they're ready to order. Except, I'm taking another table's order when they decide to make this known to me. They are thumping on the side of the booth and glaring at me. I finish up with my other table and hurry over, slightly pissed off at this point. 

""You guys ready?""

*grunt.*

""Okay, what can I get for you?""

*the more intelligible brother points at a dinner item.*

""Okay, and that comes with two sides and a choice of soup or salad.""

""WE NEED THIS TO-GO.""

""Sure, what sides can I get for you?""

*confused looks are shared.*

More intelligible brother (MIB): ""I GUESS CORN AN UH, BROCCOLI.""

""Alright, and for you two?""

Repeat this interaction for the next two brothers, except I keep having to look to MIB for translation. They each get a dinner entree to go. Thinking I'm done, I ask ""Alright, is that all I can get for you?""

""NO, WE NEED SOMETHING FOR MAMA.""

And so they order another dinner, this time a fish dinner. Okay, no problem. I go to put all of this into the POS, and then hurry over to my other tables because the whole transaction had taken much longer than I expected. When I finally go to the kitchen to see if my order went in the way I intended, the cooks just give me this ticked-off glare because of all the modifications and subs they want. All I can do is yell ""I'm sorry!"" and go back on the floor because I've been sat again. The brothers have been watching me do everything, and I mean everything all night so far. It's not only creepy, but annoying. They are thumping the side of the booth and grunting at me again while I greet my new table. SERIOUSLY, WAIT YOUR GODDAMN TURN. I go over to see what the ruckus is about, and they say they need to change something about their order. I pull out my notepad and ask them what I can do for them.

""WE NEED ANOTHER TO-GO ORDER.""

""Okay, what can I get for you?""

""WE NEED ANOTHER CHICKEN FRIED STEAK DINNER.""

""Sure, so that makes this four chicken fried steak dinners and one fish dinner?""

""**NO**, WE NEED SIX DINNERS, WE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT!"" 

(are you sure?) ""Oh, okay, no problem. Let me go put this in for you.""

""BUT I NEED YOU TO CHANGE OUR SIDES AND TOPPINGS.""

(ARE YOU KIDDING?? THE ORDER IS HALFWAY DONE BY NOW!) ""Alright, what would you like to change?""

So they tell me their re-modded order and I rush to put it in and then apologize profusely to the kitchen and explain what happened. The cooks are pissed off, and so am I. I try to sort through the salvageable parts of the order and make all the salads. My manager walks in to help, because now I'm behind with my other three tables. After what seems like 30 more drink refills for the brothers, and about 20 minutes, their meal is finally done in it's entirety, and my manager has to help me carry the bags out to my table.

At my restaurant, the check is dealt with at the cashier, not with the server. Even so, they keep trying to hand me a check while I'm trying to walk away. ""Oh, you can deal with your total up front whenever you're ready."" I say fake-cheerfully and walk away.

Finally, they leave. I'm telling this to my mom at the end of my shift to vent, and she looks at me and goes, ""Oh my god, you're kidding me. I went to school with their brother!"" I ask her if they really are inbred, and she just sort of nods with a pitying look. The world is a crazy, tiny place.

The other day, we had a woman (if we can call her that) come in and first verbally attack her server because we didn't have a personal size pizza on the menu for her (middle school-aged) son. L calmly explained her options: PB&amp;J pizza! Small cheese pizza! Half cheese, half whatever the parents wanted! You get the idea- extremely reasonable things. The woman YELLS at L for having a 'sucky menu and no accommodations for kids. L brushes it off and mentions it to our owner, S. S takes a walk around the patio checking on all the tables. Gets to woman, who tells her that she is a 'horrible person who must hate kids and families' and that 'she should wake up early tomorrow to rewrite the menu for hard-working families like ourselves.' Mad props to both L and S for brushing it off at the table, but both came back from the table shaking with anger.

TL;DR Satan/woman came in and yelled at every staff member she came in contact with for hating families and kids. Licked pizza pan clean, not a drop of grease left.

It was well loved and I thought you guys would appreciate it too. Here it is:


This is kind of cheating because...well, here goes:

So I was the only male waiter on the entire staff of a new Japanese restaurant that had just opened in my home town---Ru-San's, in a couple of cities in the south. I won't specify which. I had been working there for a few weeks and the owner was still working there every day to make sure the place got up and running to his satisfaction. I hadn't had much interaction with him aside from exchanging pleasantries in Japanese; all the female managers painted a picture of him as a tyrannical asshole and we were all terrified to piss him off. He was very traditional in a lot of ways, wrote poetry and did sumi-e paintings among other traditional arts.
O
His wife was also working, a middle aged, birdfaced bleach blonde with a shrill voice and a drinking problem. She had a tendency to get in the way and keep me from properly doing my job. One very busy night I am waiting tables, skillfully and unobtrusively as is my wont, and she kept following me giving me 'suggestions'. I go up to greet a table of 6 I had just taken and as I'm attempting to take their drink orders, she flaps up and starts shrieking ""MAKE SURE YOU GET THEIR DRINK ORDERS ARE YOU GETTING THEIR DRINK ORDERS CAW CAW CAW CAW""...finally I decide that I don't care about the job anymore and that she is driving me nuts. I take a wad of service napkins, hurl them directly in her face and yell ""SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME DO MY GODDAMN JOB!!!""
I go outside and await the inevitable. Ru-san comes out side, sits next to me and lights up. Looking in the middle distance, he sighs and says ""....what did the fucking bitch do to you now?""

Long story short, Ru-san turns out to be a total sexist in the traditional Japanese manner. Managers and wife get bitched out and told to stop using his name to scare me, and to leave me alone as a woman has no place ordering a man around. I got to keep my job and I never got bothered again.

The restaurant is setup in a fashion like most, where the middle of the room has tables, and then outside walls have booths. We're sitting across from each other at a table with a booth to my right and my lady's left. 

A middle-aged couple is finishing their meal and pays the check. I'm not sure if he paid cash, but I suspect he did based on what happened next. The couple get up to leave and start heading towards the exit. As they stand up, a decent amount of dough falls out of the man's pocket. I'd estimate it to be about $80 or $100 bucks (a few 20's, that's for sure). 

Unsure of exactly what to do, I get up and follow the man and get his attention as he's exiting the restaurant, telling him what just happened. While this was happening, my wife watches the bus boy quickly pocket the money that had fallen onto the booth seat and pocket it. It wasn't as if he was unsure if was part of a tip or the check, he just straight up had the look of ""oh hey, look what I found"". 

As I get back to the table my wife informs me and the couple that she saw the bus boy pocket it. The manager apparently sees something happening, so he arrives and inquires. 

My wife tells the story of how the couple dropped the dough by accident and how the bus boy scooped it up. She was able to give the manager a description of what he looked like, and was pretty certain which one, as a number of of them were out clearing other tables at this time. 

The couple meanwhile, were standing there patiently (the man probably somewhat embarrassed) awaiting any resolution as to what might happen. 

The manager then leaves and comes back and (facepalm so hard as I'm writing this ) **BRINGS OUT ALL THE BUS BOYS AND LINES THEM UP RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE** and then asks my wife to point out the suspect. My wife, wanting justice for the couple but not quick to be hostile, pointed at the bus boy and said ""I think it was you""...hoping to not act like the judge, jury, and prosecution. 

The bus boy, of course, maintains his innocence and the manager acts helpless (almost like he was in on the take or something). The manager takes down the contact info of the couple and of me and my wife, and the couple leaves feeling helpless themselves. 

Our server, meanwhile, was doing what they could to make sure our food was fine and drinks full, but we finished our meal very awkwardly while the bus boy continued to do his work at other tables and booths. 

My wife then writes to the corporate office, not to get any sort of freebies, but to make sure they knew how irresponsible it was of the manager to pull that kind of shit. We've been back to that specific location and I think the bus boy doesn't work there anymore, but I'm not sure about the manager. The restaurant offered a huge apology and gave us a $25 gift card, but honestly, we just wanted to make sure they knew the manager was a fuckhead for doing that.

I had pumped myself up for a good shift. Then I saw that my first table was this old couple that comes in everyday. The lady's always been decent enough but the man is just an ornery, finicky jerk of an old fart. Still, I said to myself I would do my best and start off on the right foot. They always start off with iced tea and water so I brought the drinks out, along with bread to get them started. The first thing he says to me is, ""Well thank god we get you today!"" which made me smile. Next he says, ""You're not any *good*, but at least you're pleasant!""  What the fuck... I fought back the urge to slap the dentures out of his mouth and I say, ""uhh... thanks?"" He says, ""Well good, you appreciate the compliment."" 

FUCK YOU, OLD MAN! I pawned them off on a coworker and vowed never to take the table again. I mean, he's a dick and I know it but damn if it didn't hurt. (Later I told my coworker and he said that old man has never been anything but nice to him, telling him he's ""a good man"" and ""looking as handsome as ever."" )


Then Sunday, I had a shift that started at 2 and my first table was a lady who had been waiting for her friend since 1:30.They ended up staying til 10pm. Almost NINE HOURS of taking up a prime booth in my section! They had lunch and paid but just never, ever left. Around 8:40, one of the ladies asks for another (free) bread basket and a cup of coffee. I do an internal eye roll but say, ""of course."" and the other lady says ""Oh, me too."" So I say, ""Okay, two coffees and some bread."" Here's the kicker, the second lady says, ""Oh I had already ordered my coffee earlier. Can I just get a fresh cup as my refill?"" 

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, LADY? Your two dollar coffee isn't going to last all day! The cream in her cup had already formed that filmy milk stuff on the surface, that's how long ago she had ordered her coffee. I looked at her for half a second too long and just said, ""Sure.""

There are those customers out there that are so picky, but not too obnoxious and make up for it in some way. Here are a couple from my diner days, (names changed):

Sam, Dolly, and their son Daniel (who has been coming here since just after he was born). They are charismatic people, come in regularly, buy above average meals and tip well. Daniel is known by all the first shift servers and is usually a big sweetheart, but gets out of hand quickly. As a cook, I cringed a bit to see Sam and Daniel come in, less so with Dolly. Sam is incredibly specific about what he want, how he wants it cooked, and sometimes the order in which it comes out. If I have nothing else going on, I can usually make it right 90% of the time, but sometimes things fuck up and he is a snide ass about things. Always with a smile, too, ""I would have probably stirred the cheese into those eggs if I were cooking."" I don't think my servers ever acknowledged that he spoke to the cooks like this, and like I said before, I was the manager so I wanted to keep his business. I liked my paychecks to include a sales bonus.

James would come in every day for breakfast and rarely alter his order. One egg, fried hard, toast with two grape jelly, small amount of grits with extra butter. It was the easiest $3 to put in the register, until the cooks get in a rush and the yellow is not cooked completely, only appears to be. Also, he would take up a full booth instead of sitting at the bar no matter how busy the shift was. Sometimes Sam and Daniel would invite him to sit with them to save a booth for us (One of their redeeming qualities).

Billy, oh Billy, I will never forget you. Crazier than a bag of cats and meth. I tried to look out for Billy. He had no family to speak of, was obviously mentally ill and physically disabled. His ranting would often remind me of an uncle of mine, a schizophrenic. Billy would come in at least twice a day, often more. His order never changed for his first visit of the day and I could have it almost completed by the time he sat down. But he was a handful, thinking nothing of hollering across the restaurant for coffee even if someone had offered it not two minutes prior. I had to tell my staff that we were not going to deny him service, though, because it was clear to me that his behaviors were due to a disability and I was not bringing that sort of lawsuit down on us. I actually came to care about Billy, and when some untoward circumstances led to him having a car accident, I stopped at the scene and explained to the arresting officer that he was under care for his disabilities. That did not stop the officer from arresting him for DUI, a charge that was dropped six months later after a judge listened to his case manager. Last I knew, his neighbor was driving him around everyday, which was a better situation.

Like most pubs who want to be ""badass"" there was a flavour of wings so hot you needed to sign a waiver. 

Although normally ordered by the dozen, these were only sent in baskets of six, and the sauce was prepared per order. We would mix in a sauce pan: some franks red hot sauce (their hottest kind) dried and crushed habanero peppers, diced bannana peppers, tabasco and a teaspoon of special 1,000,000 scoville sauce (scoville being the ""spicy hot"" scale, this was just a few units down from pepper spray). We prepared it using rubber gloves and goggles in case it splashed in our eyes.

Now I have seen some interesting reactions to these. Some people who take one bite and realize their mistake, others who down the basket and order another, and sometimes a whole table who will share the basket amonst them. I have even seen people sweat up and get teary eyed, those were the best.

As I mentioned, these were cooked in a pan as per order. In our kitchen we didn't have a designated dishwasher, most waitresses would come in and spray and wash every hour. One of the waitresses came in after we had made an order of the hot wings, like RIGHT after, and grabbed the pan we had used, not knowing A: What was in there and B: how HOT the pan was. She sprayed it with the power washer and a red steam sprayed off, the spice was airborne.

All of us in the kitchen immediatly start coughing, choking, and are faces go red as our eyes get puffy and run tears down our cheeks. We evecuate the kitchen and everryone sitting near it while two of us set up fans to blow the saucy smoke out the back door.

I work at a somewhat upscale place in the suburbs of a very large city. Work was going great until The Table came in.

Eight people come in and are seated. When I walk up to them the mother mentions they are having a going away party for their son who is in the army and is leaving tomorrow. We chat about that for a bit and I get their orders. The wait for the food is longer than expected (one chef had called in sick about 30 minutes before his shift, the bastard) so I comp their next round of drinks. Finally the food comes, everyone is happy and digs in. The meal progresses and when they're finished I stop by, bus the table, and ask if they wanted anything for dessert. All smiles, they say they are stuffed, couldn't dream of it, had cake at home, blah blah.

Print the check, hand it out, run the credit cards, and they leave smiling. The daughter and son separately come up to me and thank me, saying everything was wonderful.

Ten minutes later the trouble starts. My fellow server walks up to me and tells me that the mother had come up to him as she was walking out and said ""how dare you not give us something for my son going away party, he's leaving to risk his life for this country.

This will be a wall of text. And it will be disgusting. You have been forewarned.

Amy had the worst of it I'll admit. She had open to three today. Around 11:30 she got her first table which was a group of 16, six of them being small children. Amy recanted to me the hell that was her lunch with this group. The parents came from the local high schools 20th class reunion that was just down the road, so they decided catching up was more important than controlling their offspring. They let them run wild. 

The kids went into the section in the back room that was closed off and decided to rearrange the furniture. They dragged a good dozen chairs into the center of the section and layed them on their backs and all over each other. The back section has eight tables in it. All of them had sugar packets dumped all over them and the salt and pepper shakers from all the tables were hidden. Amy's nerves were being tested, but she remained calm.

When Amy started getting more tables in the other room where the 16 top was the kids decided to go unleash their terror on the front room. They ran around screaming. And went to the bucket of silverware and unrolled it onto the floor. Forks, knives and napkins all over the floor, probably a good 25 or so settings. Amy starts to get mad at this point but remains calm.

A little while later she has to go to the bathroom really bad. On her way, the kids are running through the hallway past her laughing and yelling. At this point Amy doesn't care, she just wants to go pee. Until she steps into the ladies room and she catches sight of the horror inside. One of the kids went and did #2 but instead of flushing it down like any civilized human being would do, they decided to get the toilet bowl brush, mash the crap all over the toilet bowl and then paint the walls in it. 

Yes, literally took the shit on the brush and rubbed it against the bathroom walls. All. Fucking. Over. 

Amy was livid. She ran to the guys room to use their toilet before she peed herself in anger. She's also kind of a neat freak, so instead of calling out the kids and their parents she went and bleached the entire bathroom from floor to ceiling. She didn't say what happened after that, but she was not happy with that group overall. 

She left at 3 and my night went alright, a lot of big groups and a lot of late tables. The second to last table of the night was a group of 15 that called in a reservation for 8:15 but didn't show up until a quarter to close. Whatever, it's summer and we don't get many good nights like this so we take it. Since I already had a 15 top earlier in the night it was my other servers turn for one. The only other space was in my section. No big deal, I already had a six and some smaller ones there. 

Until the parents of this group let their small army of tiny people run around through the dining room. The other server and I kept trying to dodge the kids while the slithered between us while we ran food and bussed our tables. This grew annoying quickly but not when the little boy they had, a  year and half old I'd say, ran into the support beam in the room. Not once, but twice. Parents did nothing, and this kid hit hard both times. Like fall down dizzy hard. The mom barely looked over and said watch out. The older brother was a better parent than her, he at least picked up his brother and checked his head. 

On their way out I had a both arms full of dishes and random other things to put away. The same kid who nearly knocked himself out twice had ran into my path and barely escaped a bloody face. I barely put on my anti-lock breaks and stopped when the kid barreled into my legs and nearly put me on the ground. That's when big brother stepped in again and apologized while his mom played with her phone and walked to the front door. I smiled at the kid and told him it was alright and he was doing a good job as a big brother. The kid still looked ashamed as he glanced over and followed his mom and dad out the door. Then when I went back to help the other server the kids had decided to turn the straw wrappers into confetti, but we were both glad that the night was over. 

TL;DR kids like to play with their own shit, fling silverware all over, napkin confetti destroy dining rooms and crash into everyone and everything they can.

The room is large, but I've been up there by myself before and was not worried about being able to handle it and being able to help out the new guy a bit. However, for whatever reason everyone decided today was THE day to go out and eat in the dining room and as it started to fill up, I knew we were going to need help. I had a walk in party of about 12 people along with tables throughout the entire room. I realize their food is taking a very very long time, and after going downstairs to the kitchen I see a takeout order for TWENTY PEOPLE. Seriously??!! Who does that? The entire restaurant is busy, the kitchen is swamped. I explain to my table the situation, and while they are not happy, they are okay with waiting as I reassure them it shouldn't be too much longer. I keep a close watch on them and make sure to give good service in the meantime. While that is happening, I notice tables that haven't been greeted and just start taking table after table. It was a shit show. Large party finally gets their food and ask to see my manager (I was not surprised). I gladly grab her, and they complain about the wait. We were busy, and their food did take a long time, so their complaint was valid. Of course they want separate checks in the end and right before I split their checks I go to grab drinks for a table that was neglected. I'm making drinks when a glass falls and shatters and splits my finger open. Great. I needed coworkers to distribute my checks because I could not handle them with a bloody hand, and as I stood there at the computer, hand wrapped in bloody gauze and thanking my coworkers, my customers from the large party come up to me personally to hand me the money and tell me to keep the change. They all said I did a great job and told my manager their complaint was no reflection on the service. Everyone tipped 50%+ on their bills. Had I known I could get sympathy tips this way, I would have done it a lot sooner! Long story short, the table really brought tears to my eyes because they were so kind to me and realized I was having a rough morning. Also, the willingness to help constantly displayed by my coworkers is heartwarming, and I cannot thank them enough. 

And some words of wisdom from one of my coworkers- ""You're only in the weeds if you care!"" Probably not the best advice, but it definitely put a smile on my face during a very stressful time.

The Gift Card Altercation,39,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19tu74/first_post_the_gift_card_altercation/,"Okay so I've been a server for around 4 years, but have been in the restaurant business for around 6.  I've worked at various restaurants including an all-american type chain, a seafood chain, and a sushi bar (my favorite so far).  Anyway I digress.

So I had been working at this particular restaurant for about a year.  I had an elderly couple come in.  Everything was fine throughout the meal, there were no problems and the couple were sweet.

However, the end of the meal was another story.  I dropped off their check and they paid with a gift card.  I ran the gift card and they still had a remaining balance to pay.  I brought the receipt back to the customer and explained that their gift card did not cover the whole cost of the meal. This was the conversation:

*Me: ""Sir, your gift card was for $17.22 and you still have $3.00 to pay
*Him: No. The gift card had $26.13 left on it.  I have the receipt here.
*Me: Perhaps you have the wrong receipt.  Our computer system recognizes remaining balances very well, we never have any problems with it.
(he proceeds to start yelling at me--it was dinner rush and the entire restaurant was full)
*Him: THE GIFT CARD WAS 26.13. YOU RAN IT WRONG. YOUR COMPUTER IS WRONG. I HAVE THE RECEIPT
*Me: *explained it again, in a different way*
*Him: NO. YOU RUN THIS AGAIN. IT WAS 26.13. I KNOW. WHAT MY CARD HAS. YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME. YOU NEED TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND.

I proceeded to attempt to get a manager, but she didn't feel inclined to help me.  I had to go back and forth between him and the manager three more times, all with him yelling at me in front of the entire restaurant.  He eventually gave up and paid, but not after telling me I was a horrible server who didn't know how to listen.

**TL;DR**  Had a guest who didn't understand the concept of gift cards and he proceeded to yell/humiliate me in front of the entire restaurant.

BACKGROUND:
My sister is well-known in my family for leaving big tips for great service. She works in a hotel and she knows how hard people bust their ass for low pay. She's known to leave $10-$30 tips (on ~$20 meals). Sometimes she'll give a normal sized tip to our main waiter and the same tip to someone who delivered our food and took extra orders.

ACTUAL STORY:
My sister was deciding on what her tip would be at the counter (where you pay) for this 24/7 national breakfast chain. (Not WH)  Our waiter was great! He didn't bother us much and was really courteous when they were out of things that I ordered in the kitchen. I also have a really hard time choosing something on the menu (which I correct by looking up the menu online before but I'm still pretty bad about it.) So he was patient with me and my sister and never let our drinks sit empty for long. Basically great service. So my sister leaves a ~$11 tip, which is basically 50+% of our meal, which was $19. (All of this background story is to tell you that this is completely normal for us.) Obviously, this was out of the ordinary for the store manager who sees this and FLIPS out. He calls the server and other manager over to show them and basically makes this huge scene. It's pretty awkward for both my sister and me AND the server. My sister prefers it to be kind of a surprise and likes to leave before they see it so they don't have to show thanks and such.

TL;DR: Sister leaves good tip, but store manager makes a huge deal and awkwardness is had all around.

I usually sit at the bar, but this time it was full so I sat at a table and had a server.

My first hint was when she didn't bring the correct drinks to me or the person I was with. We told her it was fine because (luckily) we love trying new beers. We ordered food, it was slow. Not necessarily her fault. Then, she dropped the food and didn't ask if we had everything we needed, just walked away quickly. Took her about five minutes to come back for the ""two bite check"". Took another five to get my condiment (only one), and she didn't combine trips to bring that with the next round of drinks. Not awful, but at this point I just want to eat my damn food. Then she takes away my friend's plate with food still on it without asking, and doesn't even pause so we can say we're still eating it. I ask for a box, she brings the check immediately even though we want to stick around for drinks. Doesn't ask if we want split checks or together, then tries to take my cash off the table as I'm still counting it. 

I wanted so badly to leave her a note or tell her that she should pause and take her time, blah blah blah tips on good service. But I also didn't want to be ""that asshole"". I still tipped her well, but I just hope she doesn't keep doing that shit!

Its one thing for a retail worker on Black Friday to receive coupons. It doesn't hurt their hourly wage. Sure, Black Friday is hell for them and I feel bad for them, but the coupons don't hurt their pay. Its COMPLETE bullshit as a server who gets tips off of the total to cut an already low check IN HALF. $30 dollar checks would become $15.


Anyways, clearly you had to show the coupon to us to get it. Or you can pull Facebook up on your phone and a manager would come by and look at it. We needed a manager to apply the discount anyways.

When did you have super nice customers, and what's the story?

As a Customer, what are some awesome things your server did for you? When was a time you did something nice for your server?

I'll start.

As a Server, I would always be as cheerful as possible. I usually am anyway, so this wasn't all that hard, but we've all had our days. But, I would always try to compliment on something I liked about someone at the table (lady has a pretty necklace, guy has a sweet t-shirt, etc).

If people were extra understanding when their food took a while to get to them or maybe I dropped something of theirs, and they were super nice to me, joked around with me and were just all around awesome- I would take a percentage off their bill and write a message on their receipt telling them they were fantastic people. I once had a huge party of 25 come in, I gave them 25% off because it was the guys birthday- and because ALL of them were fucking hilarious, awesome people. When he got the bill, I didn't mention that I gave him the discount, I just did the usual ""Thanks guys, have a great day!"" and walked away. Until he realized, stood up in the busy dining area and shouted at my Manager ""HEY! You've got one fantastic waitress! Thanks miss!-(to me)"" It made my day to make his day, lol.

I've also had people personally go and flag my manager down to tell them how sweet and accommodating I was to them and their specific needs. My manager hated me though, so she didn't care. I'm still not sure why she hated me so much... 

People also really seemed to like when I would suggest a certain thing to them, not because management said I need to upsell- but because I genuinely liked it. I'd ask if they liked thing or that kinda thing, and told them what was good. They would usually order it and rave how much they enjoyed something new. Feelsgoodbro.

This leads me to talk about having awesome tables and them doing nice things for me.

My very first table I ever served, I let them know. I said ""Hey guys! I'm your server for tonight, and aren't you lucky? You're the first table I've ever waited on! So, bare with me, I'm new."" And the man (60's I'd say, big jolly bearded guy) gets a huge grin on his face and says ""Oh ho! Well that's fantastic! I guess we'll have to tip you extra nice! Good luck, we're real feisty!"" and we all laughed. They ended up tipping as they said they would, it made a lasting impression on how super nice they were to me.

Other times, I love when people would practically pull me to their seat to talk to me. I had one lady tell me about how her and her husband sculpt giant pieces of wood. Like.. totem poles. He carves, she paints them. She even pulled out her cellphone to show me pictures. Which lead to pictures of her cats. It was awesome.

We are chronically understaffed and I was not given much training before I was thrown on the floor, so nearly every shift is stressful and exhausting.  Yeah, I'm making money (usually $80-$180 per shift depending on the day), but I've been so stressed by work lately that I feel my other commitments are suffering.  At this point, I have enough money saved up that I will be thoroughly in the black for the rest of the summer, given the money I will have from other sources.  So basically my job at this restaurant gives me a bit of extra cash on top of the money I already have coming in.

I just don't know if it's worth it.  I like most of my coworkers, and the customers are generally pleasant, but I don't necessarily enjoy myself during my shifts because whether a night will be busy or not is very unpredictable, so I feel I'm either bored out of my mind doing endless sidework, or slammed with 6 tables.  On top of that, the owner is crazy and unpredictable, and only wants to see the worst in people.  I've noticed my service suffers when she is there because she is constantly berating me for every tiny mistake I make, in addition to screwing up the flow of service by running food to the wrong tables, randomly assigning us tasks that take us off the floor, and then yelling at us for not being on the floor.  We are so understaffed that we usually just have two servers (and no host) for the main dining room *and* the deck, which can mean 10+ tables if both rooms are full (luckily that rarely happens).

I think I will definitely scale back my hours, since I literally have 0 days off each week.  But should I even bother keeping this job?",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,standard,True,t3_1i3k2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1i3k2m/im_contemplating_quitting_advice_needed/,

The coworker (we'll call her K) who ""tattled"" on me last time did it again! This time I couldn't believe what it was over. On Saturday night the head manager (we'll call her A) asked me to come in at 4:30 on Sunday (we had a wedding party so we were open this Sunday) when I had originally been scheduled for 5. I said I could not as I had plans but I would try to get in as early as possible. Sunday, I come into work and K begins a conversation with me. This is, word for word, how it went:

K: Look at all the candy set up for the wedding. I got to have some while I was opening and setting up.

Me: Nice! I love candy. A asked me to come in early but I couldn't because I had plans.

End of conversation.

Later on A comes up to me and says in a very bitchy tone, ""just so you know, I don't just make the schedule all 'willy nilly.' (she made quotations with her fingers) The schedule is made depending on reservations so if the reservation changes then sometimes you're going to have to be asked to come in early."" I was shocked. I normally do come in early when I'm asked. It was then that I realized that K had twisted what I said to A again and I started to get mad. I kept my calm and explained to her that I wasn't upset that I was asked to come in early. I said I would have been able to but I had things arranged a specific way for the time before work and that she can ask me any time to come in early but I will be more likely to be available with more notice. 

When K came into the service aisle after A had left I asked her about it. She said she didn't say anything to A. I told her that I knew about what she had told A in the previous story. I kept calm and said I wasn't mad at her but that I viewed her as a friend. I said I felt betrayed when she went behind my back to tell A some things that I had said before I had got the chance to talk to A first. She said she didn't mean for it to happen that way. I told her that A had come up to me two times and got mad at me for the things that she had told her about me and that I can't trust her in that way anymore. I asked her not to repeat this stuff to A as I was planning to do it myself the next day.

5 seconds later she goes in the back with A and it's obvious they're talking about me. I am not looking forward to work tonight and I'm not sure what I'm going to say to A but I am very close to just calling it quits. I don't put up with drama like this in my social life. I will not put up with it in an environment that is supposed to be professional.

(I realize that in the original story where I had ranted to K about work AT work was unprofessional. However, it was a short and quick conversation in order to release some frustration. I had every intention of talking to management about it myself. I trusted K as a friend and did not expect it to get back to management in that way. Ever since then I have been polite and kind to the people I work with. I have not vented any frustrations at work or to the people I work with... unless you count saying ""I was asked to come in early but said no because I was busy"" as ranting.

Also, for guy servers, they can't be with their child's mother, spending the day as a family because you all want to come out to eat.

I said I have a story about a big group that did everything right, so here it is!  Warning, it is a bit of a long story.

It was a normal night in Hell... I mean, the restaurant I worked at.  It was towards the end of my shift that two people I've served before and are semi-regulars come in.  ""Oh, hey, Tal, we have about 20-30 people coming in.  Where do you want us?""

**Lesson 1 of Big Group Etiquette:**  Let the restaurant know you're coming, even if it's just a call ahead.  Especially at a sit-down place, of course, but this can go for fast-food places as well.  Doing this is a big help to the staff, and it will mean we can put together a place large enough for your group faster.

Whew, okay, so I put them all in the back room.  They want me to serve them, so I do.  They trickle in in twos and threes, and head to the back room.  Because of this, I was able to serve all of their drinks by myself.  I will admit, some of my co-workers offered to help, but I told 'em I had it.  And I did, but just wanted to be clear that I took the responsibility for this big group on myself.

When everyone arrived, I took all of their orders (whew!) and placed them all.  Everyone was very patient and understanding that this was a large group, so food may take a little while longer.

**Lesson 2:**  When you're a part of a big group, be patient and understanding with your server and the kitchen staff.

**Lesson 3:**  Your server is human.  It's okay to joke around with him/her while the food is being prepared.  Also, if you have any condiments you know you'll want with your food, ask your server during this time.

This group was awesome!  They joked around with me, were patient when I needed to get refills for them, and most asked for what they'd need before the food came out.  I had a lot of fun with them.

Then the food started coming out.  My fellow servers helped bring the food out of the kitchen, but I was the one to hand out all of their food to them.  It was hectic fun, and I'm so glad my co-workers were helping me get the food out of the kitchen.  My group was patient as I handed out food and just all around a good group to serve, and were polite when they flagged me down.

Turns out, this group were the staff for a local anime con or something like that, and were talking about what to do next year.  They kind of had a meeting, and I didn't do much for them besides the usual refills/busing their tables during all this.  Again, still super polite, joking around with me, and all around awesome throughout this whole time.

They were there for a good two hours or so before they left.  When they did, I won't say how much I did get in tips, but it was a great one.  In addition to the cash on the table and tips on the cards, they also gave me some of the freebies from their anime con.  I also got a job offer from one of them, and they ALL thanked me for serving and putting up with them.  Again, really awesome!  Which brings me to the final lesson of big group etiquette.

**Lesson 4:** If you are a big group, you are taking up time and tables that a server could make money off of.  You are also a lot more work than a usual 2 or 4-top table.  Keep that in mind when you are planning to go out to a sit-down restaurant, and tip your server according to the service you received.

In the USA, tips are the way a server makes their living.  It's a way of life, and sometimes it sucks.  We can't change it.  It's now pretty much an unwritten rule that a sit-down place will mean a tip.  Keep that in mind when you go out. With big groups, it means you're taking up tables and time, and a server could usually get through a couple of smaller tables in the time it takes to serve you.

Tonight was the worst thing I have ever experienced. It wasn't the fact that a table of 20 ran me and my coworker to death or the fact that their kids didn't like the cheese pizza. It didn't matter when people randomly were showing up and attaching themselves to the party even though they were not included in the original count. AND it didn't matter when one persons burger was TOO well done. 

What mattered tonight was that my coworker, who is about 5 months pregnant, waddled herself around the restaurant for these needy people. These people saw she was pregnant, her belly clearly showing through her uniform, and they had the audacity to ask her to remove the automatic grat from their already separate checks. Nothing had gone horribly wrong with this party, just one overcooked burger, but yet these people wanted to deny this woman any form of compensation. 

I have never been more disgusted in my life. I didn't even care if I only made $30 for 5 hours of work and had to split the tip with her. BUT HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU LOOK AT A PREGNANT WOMAN, WHO JUST WORKED HER ASS OFF FOR YOU AND ASK HER TO REMOVE THE TIP. It's not like they were going to tip less than 18%, oh no, they wanted to leave NO TIP. Some even wrote on the bottom of their bills that they were mad that they were being asked to tip. In fact, one person wrote, ""I dont wanna leave no tip"", I kid you not. 

The only saving grace was that half of them did tip and the birthday girl gave us some cake and an additional $10. But even at that point, the money did not matter. I had finally encountered the lowest human beings of my life and seriously considered quitting. Not because my job is terrible or stressful, but because I never wanted to see that kind of act ever again in my life. 


Sorry for the rant, but I had to blow it off. I just...I just don't even comprehend what kind of people could do that. And yes, I understand that a pregnant woman should not be waitressing. However, she has worked there longer than me and that is how she provides income for herself and soon to be child. SO, FUCK YOU, A BILLION TIMES OVER. MIDDLE FINGERS EVERYWHERE. EXTREME CURSING.

They all get sat and I hear a two guests mouth their order to me right away before I could even ask if everyone was ready to order.  I smiled and replied with the usual ""okay sure absolutely"".  I had a feeling this was going to be a challenging table due to the language barrier.  *Earlier when I greeted them I got the ""wtf is he saying"" eyes.*  So, got the order taken smoothly and I thought everything was going well until the order came up.  I had forgotten one of the guests order **nice**.  One of the guests who had given me their order prior to the formal order (during seating) was **not** present when I took the formal dinner order.  Awesome, so I realize what I did, put the order in *fly fly* and proceeded to what I thought would be a mildly annoyed yet understandably patient guest.  nope.  flipping lost it.  Asked me ""how long in minutes"" till it came with furious and unforgiving anger.  I took it like a champ, been serving for years, I'm used to getting abused but this just ruined me for some reason.  Ran to the kitchen in full panic and told my head chef ""hey I am a flipping dumb$%^ and forgot this order can you please help me get this out fly"" *it was an easy dish*.  Their response was ""can you make a drink faster than you already can"", knowing that I couldn't be a smart ass and say ""uhh yeah"" I just swallowed all my pride *or whatever you call that feeling that makes you want to give someone a tracheotomy with your pen* and said ""no"".  After that pleasant exchange I glanced at the board and from the time I put the order in, told the guest, ran into the kitchen, 5:50 had elapsed.  Dish comes up looking amazing *thank you kitchen* in about 8 minutes.  Rush back to the table, set the plate down and the guest is gone, waving their hands around at my other server asking where ""the ^&amp;* waiter was"", he was trying to tell the guest I was in the kitchen but they were hysterical.  Guest came back enjoyed the dish, it was awkward, comped the guests' chk, they got dessert as well.  When I dropped their chk for the dessert (assuming that I charge them right?) They say they don't want to pay for dessert either.  I die and just say ""okay"", take the check put it in my pocket and pay for it.  **$%^ it**  I just felt horrible about the whole situation.

I worked in a medium-sized family-owned Greek place from my 14th birthday until getting married at 23.  Several tales I will share, eventually:

The Time I Caught the Falling Baby  
The Time I Dropped Two Flaming Plates  
May Favorite Customers, Who Paid for My Two-Week Honeymoon.

But first:

The Owner and the Biker.

Ours was an artsy and eclectic neighborhood, near downtown but not in it.  The bar across the street was biker bar, and there was frequent frivolity at our intersection.  My favorite was The Cannon; no kidding real 3-foot long cannon they shot off at New Year's and on The Fourth.  That sucker would rattle the windows.   The guys were actually pretty fun, and I never heard of any customers of staff ever being hassled.  They kind of kept the peace, actually.

The thing is, their bar only had a partial liquor license; beer and wine only.  We had the only full bar for several blocks.  So, pretty much every night, we had visits from the neighbors for quick shots.  We went through a lot of tequila.  This is all fine, as you know we made most of our profit on drinks anyway, so no big deal.

Now, I don't know what precipitated it, whether it was a complaint from a customer, the boss's mom visiting from the Old Country, a wild hair or what.  In any case, the boss exits the front as a group of bikers is ambling across the street, being easily visible from the cooking line.  He informs them that, no, they will not be welcome to come in for a few quick shots.  Not tonight, no discussion.  BAM! Tough guys shoots the boss in the leg.  It's a hospital trip, but he is fine.

That kind of ruined the whole neighborhood vibe.  We closed the small bar, so you could only get cocktails at tables.  We stopped going across for after hours beers, etc.  Since then, the bikers moved up the hill.  The bar switched to a (one-time) micro-brewery outlet, and is now a coffee house... I wonder where the Cannon is?",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1hn05n,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hn05n/tales_from_the_greek/,

But I have a lot to spill after just 4 months of working these jobs.  But first, just a little bit about myself for background.  I started serving when I was 17, and had worked about a combined 2 years between a failing barbeque place and an upscale South African place in my hometown.  And at the South African place, I had to turn down an offer to make me head server on-track to manage to return to school.

Well, I graduated this past December, and want to segue my economics degree into restaurant management and ownership and stay in my college town for a few more years.  And in late February, was hired by what I thought was a well-off Malaysian restaurant that we'll call Malaysia.  I showed up for my first day of work, and I very quickly found out this place was totally different than any other restaurant I'd ever worked in or seen.  And not in a good way.

For starters, the family running this place is absolutely dysfunctional.  The parents, let's call them Cal and Rosa, have owned the place for 22 years, and now their daughters, let's say Mary and Anne, manage the restaurant on nights and weekends while Rosa manages the place for weekday lunches.  They also have a son, Andy, who runs their other restaurant, which does sushi and modern asian fusion; let's call it Sushi.  However, the more of the family that's in the restaurant, the more chaotic it gets.  They're constantly arguing, loudly enough for customers to hear, they give contrary instructions to their servers regarding shift duties and how specific things are to be done, they frequently micromanage to the extreme.  Mary and Anne also never want to be there, but are in their 30s with no life ambition, so they are constantly on the phone, texting, and frequently will just sit at a table and eat and act like it's a damn burden if they have to take a table or apply a discount or anything.

Secondly, one of the first things I was told my first shift was ""Try not to talk to The Cook.  He doesn't like people.""  6 days a week, The Cook is there.  His English is pretty broken, he's a very angry person, and any sort of interaction with him is highly discouraged  and usually has to go through the managers.  He's also the only person in the kitchen besides the dishwasher and on weekends, we have a girl who does really basic stuff like assembling spring rolls and grilling satay.  He's a damn good cook, I'll give him that, but he has no communication or interpersonal skills and doesn't deserve to be called a chef.  And when the restaurant gets slammed, with just him back there, ticket times stretch out to 25-30 minutes

Third, as a server, we do way too much.  4 days a week, we have no busser and no hostess.  So we have to do those jobs on top of what we normally do.  Also, the restaurant surprisingly has a full liquor license but no bar.  Just an alcohol cage and no trained bartenders.  So servers have to pour wine and beer (no problem) and make specialty cocktails and fresh juices and ginger ale (problem) because we receive no real bartending training, there are no pre-prepped juices (we squeeze the lemon and lime to order) and making a drink takes a good 40-80 seconds per drink, which if you're dealing with a bunch of different cocktails for a 6 top on a Friday night, can throw you in the weeds, hard.  We also make all the desserts, do all the garnish, and assemble an entree that was recently featured in a local paper.  Along with our serving job.  We have no sections, rotation is loosely followed, and servers aren't allowed to hold a bank, make change, or access the cash drawer or apply any discounts including any of the Groupons or newpaper or email promotions we've been running.

I'm getting really frustrated because the owners and managers come down on every little mistake made, even if it's meaningless, and if I mess up, I hear about it from Rosa, Cal, Anna, Mary, and Andy.  And every lecture makes what I did sound worse.  For example, over the last 4 shifts, I've been progressively chewed out worse and worse because on Wednesday night, I didn't ring in a (non-alcoholic) drink before I served it, because I didn't have time to wait on a POS to open up.  I instead, rang it in before I printed the bill, the drink got paid for, no problem, right?  Instead, I got a lecture from Anna at the time about how it was a ""consistent problem"", then got lectures from Rosa, Cal, and Andy about how think their margins are, how the restaurant is struggling, and how they can't afford to have me giving away drinks and food for free all the time, and how it could cost them upwards of $20 a night.  *But nothing was given away for free...*

The most frustrating thing is, I also work at Sushi, love it there, but it's also owned by the family and they've told me I have to work at Malaysia if I'm going to work at Sushi.  I'm getting so frustrated with the family and how inefficient and terrible Malaysia is and how much I still have to do that I'm thinking of leaving the industry entirely and putting my degree to use elsewhere.

1368201489.0,36,self.TalesFromYourServer,1e2p1z,Help! Sketchy wage reporting by employer,41,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1e2p1z/help_sketchy_wage_reporting_by_employer/,"Sorry, but I'm not sure where else to post this.

A couple months ago I began working at a new restaurant. We pool tips, so that each person receives a share of the total tips based on the hours they worked on the shift. These tips are then given to us in the form of a check once a week that is totally separate from our paychecks.

However, when I receive my official paycheck twice a month, the wages that are being reported are much lower. In fact, they only report the difference between the $2.13 minimum wage for servers and the $7.50 minimum wage they are required to give me in total. Basically, if I work 10 hours in a week (obviously I work more, but we'll keep it easy) I earn 21.30 in hourly wages, but the legal minimum wage for that work is 75.00. My employer thus reports that I made 53.70 in tips. However, I might have actually made $150 in that period.

Now, some people are probably saying to themselves that it seems like not a bad deal, I'm getting a lot of my tips tax-free effectively. However, my wages are being severely under-reported and I'm afraid this might be a problem should I need to apply for an apartment, a loan, credit card, etc. Also, I want to pay my taxes accurately. 

When I approached our accountant about it, she told me it was my responsibility to report the rest of my tips to the IRS, something that I really doubt it true, because it seems as though it should be my employer's duty to report my wages and withhold taxes accurately. I also suspect that the reported wages affects their financials, such as for unemployment tax.

Anyways, does anyone know more about the legalities of this area? Does this seem as shady to anyone else as it does to me?

**tl;dr - Employer is only reporting a fraction of my tips to the gov't resulting in highly inaccurate withholding tax and wage statements. Legal?**

*UPDATE:* I called the IRS question line and was provided with several publications to refer to. One clearly states that ""[the employer] must collect income tax, employee social security tax, and employee Medicare tax on the employee's tips."" I have contacted the company accountant to inquire, asking for a written statement of how my wages are currently being handled (without mentioning my call or the publication.) If I do not receive a satisfactory response, I will file an Information Referral with the IRS which will (possibly) trigger an investigation, as suggested to me by the IRS agent I spoke with.

*Update 2:* I just got an email back from the accountant. My tips are now being reported, however, I suspect that this is a special deal for me, and not for everyone. I am considering still filing the report.

Some places have tip share, some places have tip pooling, either way, your server almost never takes home 100% of what you're leaving them. 
  
Where I work, we use a tip share system.  Basically it works like this: 
  
After taxes, as a server, I make roughly 2.50 an hour... but it's not just me. Just about everyone you see in the front of house makes the same.  The hosts/hostesses, bussers, bartender etc. They ALL make about 2.50 an hour.  We all depend on tips. Well, you don't tip a busser or hostess. Why would you? You see them for 2 seconds, if you see them at all.  We tip them. 
  
The amount they are given in tips (from us) is based off of our total sales.  Most places have a 3% - 5% tip share.  Meaning for every $100.00 I have in sales, I have to give up $5.00 of tips to bussers/hosts, etc.     So when you have those tables whose bill is say... $130.00...and they tip you $5.00?  You didn't just *not* make money (because that $5.00 is eaten up by tip share on the $100.00) you're now having to pay money out of your own pocket to cover the rest of the percentage. 
  
It sounds complicated, but when you're working with it every day it makes sense.  Basically I'm just really bad at explaining/simplifying things. 
  
In short, we don't get to keep what you tip us.  Yes, the amount of our tip is directly correlated with the amount of your bill.

I'm a 6ft male with a lot of muscle, so I make a lot of noise when I walk (plus, I just like to sing about things I see...) My manager is a 4'5 little woman, so she's pretty silent. She ends up going back there to see if something broke open.

A few minutes pass, and by this point I think she passed out from the fumes. So I walk back there, and she's quietly talking to our dish washer. His hands are shaking violently, and as I start turning around, he just yells ""GOD DAMMIT"" and leaves.

She locks the door behind him, and tells me she walked in on him huffing the Easy Off (aerosol super cleaner, sort of like an acid) and trying to shove all of the employee paychecks into his pants. She fired him on the spot, but we were both a bit freaked out after that. He was ANGRY.

I work at this family owned Thai restaurant, where (thankfully) the owners will treat you how you treat us.  If you're nice, then so are we, but if you're an asshole for no reason, the same applies for us.  It's nice not having to bend over backwards for unreasonable people and demands.
That being said, I usually run the cash register and seat people for the lunch shift.  It's a nice change of pace from serving, and I generally never have any issues with people.  That all changed yesterday, when this older lady came in. I'll refer to as ""blind lady"" or BL.
Me: Hi, how are you today?
BL: I'm fine, can I sit in a booth?
Me: Sure!
This is when I take her to a booth against the wall.  She taps me on the shoulder and says, ""I can't see very well, I need to sit by a window.""
I tell her that's fine, but as the restaurant was pretty much packed (it always is at lunch) she would have to wait for one of the window booths to free up. 
BL: Why can't you seat me over there?
She points to the booth in the corner (one of those massive ones that seats 6+ people.
Me: Well, I can't put you there because I save that one for bigger groups that come in.  
BL: But you don't have any big groups here. 
Me: I know that, but it's policy to keep it open for big groups.  I can't put just one person there, what would happen if a big group came in?
BL: I don't understand why you can't put me there.  You can always push two tables together if someone comes in, can't you? I need light to see. You don't know what it's like to be blind, do you? I hope you never end up blind, then you might see how it feels to be treated this way.
At this point I'm running put of patience, and there's plenty of people to help (all of them watching this happen).  I'm also pretty confused-I was never rude or mean to her, so her reaction just seemed way over the to, not to mention all the sighing and eye rolling she was giving me.
Me: Ma'am, it's policy not to seat a single person at that booth.  I won't be seating you at that booth.  If you'd like to wait, you're more than welcome to, but I'm not putting you there, so please stop arguing.  You can wait for the window table, your choice, but I'm not discussing this with you anymore.
BL: I don't understand why I have to wait when there's an open booth over there.
I turned around and started helping other people (who were all just as baffled as I was by this woman).  BL proceeds to stand up from the waiting area and stand closer to one of the booth tables by the window.  The waiting area is pretty close to the booths, and I was too busy to say anything to her about sitting back down, so I just let her stay there.  
After about ten minutes, one  of the booths gets up and comes my way to pay.  BL pushes them out of the way and sits down, with all of their dirty dishes and everything still there.  
The booth table is paying me, and when they're done, the guy looks at me and tells me he heard the whole conversation go down from earlier.  He then tells me he and his wife purposely stayed an extra ten minutes longer than they intended because of BL staring them down.  I laughed with them and told them to feel free and stay and linger any time they want.
Now, BL has rudely pushed past these two nice people to sit at the booth.  Normally I would grab a server and have them buss the table, because how are they supposed to know she's new? At a passing glance, she looks like a woman who has just finished her meal.  So I wait a couple more minutes.  After about 5-10 minutes, I walk to the back and tell a server what has happened.  He laughs and says she can wait longer.  We cleaned up and bussed other tables for a while before he went up and greeted her.
Her lunch went smoothly, but when she got up to pay, she AGAIN mentioned how she was pretty much blind and how she hopes I never end up like her.  I inwardly rolled my eyes, and asked her if she'd like me to call her a cab, because you know, she's blind and shouldn't be driving.  
WTF, how can you drive here, then complain to me about being blind??? Some people, I swear. By the way, she comes in all the time now, and I purposely make sure I seat the window booths first so that she'll have to wait when she comes in.

While staying in NYC, a few friends and I went out for some drinks. We first stopped into a fairly busy bar, and were merely checking out the selection of drafts while taking out our wallets when the bartender points her fingers at us and hollers ""I'm going to need to see *every one* of your IDs!"" in front of a small crowd. The crowd all turn around to look at us, roll their eyes, and scoff. Yes, we were all freshly 21 and young-looking, but to be clear: this bartender was not trying to lightly tease us, she was purposefully being a rude bitch. We promptly left.

From there, we were lured into a small Mexican restaurant (that goes by the name of a popular Mexican vacation destination) by a sign on the door that advertised ""$5 Happy Hour margaritas!"" The bar was packed, so we opted for a table. When we were seated, we were asked if we wanted chips and salsa, but we politely declined because it was not clear whether they were selling us an app or offering up a freebie. The chips and salsa came anyway (thankfully with no charge).

There were five of us in total, but one made it clear to the waitress that she was not ordering anything (as she had just come from dinner). We asked for separate checks and ordered our drinks. As it turns out, the ""$5 margaritas!"" are only half-sized servings and for the bar-area only (neither of which was specified on the advertisement outside). We were all properly carded yet for the rest of the meal, the manager seemed to be eyeing us down as we enjoyed our $10 margaritas. One friend attempted to get a margarita from the bar, but the manager promptly followed her and sternly told her that she would have to drink the entire thing while standing in the bar before being allowed to return to her table.

Our waitress clearly didn't think we were worth her time; she rarely checked on us, and when she did, she had an impatient look on her face.When it was time for our 4 checks to come, we received just 1... with a 20% auto-gratuity added for **5** people. We asked her politely again to split it up, but she told us that she ""couldn't."" We asked to see a manager and explained that we had asked for separate checks and that we only had debit cards, and he put on a big fake grin and explained to us that *once the check is printed, there is no way for them to split it up within the computer*. It became very clear that he was just trying to get this waitress a 20% tip despite her less-than-mediocre service *and* mere 4 diners.

After all was said and done, I left the restaurant after paying $30 for a margarita, calamari appetizer, and shitty service.* We left a scathing review on a review site and noticed many more complaints from other customers.

Has anyone else had such cringe-worthy treatment in a large tourist city, where quality customer service might not be considered as important?

I'm not stupid and/or blind. 

I used to work at a burger joint where this happened all the damn time. Not just kids, either. Grown ass men trying to pull this crap and then claim it was an accident. The absolute worst occurrence of this though, happened a few weeks ago. I work at a small coffee shop now, and there are reusable clear cups that we leave next to the soda machine for people to use for water. A few a weeks ago, a couple of kids came in after school (they looked to be maybe twelve or thirteen) and had been hanging around in the dining room for a good forty minutes at least without buying anything, just playing video games (which are free). Well one of the boys walks up to the counter and asks me if soda is free. In my head I'm wondering where the heck this kid has ever been that has free soda, but I just politely tell him that no, soda is $1.55 and the cups out there are only for water. Fifteen minutes later, I hear the sound of the soda machine. I walk around the corner, and sure enough, the kid's literally chugging Mountain Dew out of a water cup. When I tell him to pour it out, he has the nerve to claim he didn't know soda wasn't free. Kid, you specifically asked about it. With witnesses. Again, it begs the question: How friggin' stupid do you think I am?!

1362250046.0,28,self.TalesFromYourServer,19j7ut,The top 10 behaviors/habits servers hate. (Tipping is not discussed.),40,12,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19j7ut/the_top_10_behaviorshabits_servers_hate_tipping/,"These are things that most of the men and women I work with on a daily basis love and or hate about our guests. Now, I'll flat out tell you, I'm a great server. I regularly get compliments, I have regulars who come in and only sit in my section and I am consistently asked to have a manager go to my tables so guests can tell them they had a wonderful dining experience. What can I say? I'm a likeable gal (and I genuinely love people.)   So, when I have complaints, it's not because I dislike my job or am bad at it.   Just throwing that out there. 
   
  
Let's start with the top 10 most annoying things (Not in any particular order.)
  
   
1.) Complaining about things that I can't change, and then being a bitch to me all night because I can't change it.  For example: Not too long ago, I had a party. I love parties (woo!) so I was pretty excited. As people started showing up, one woman in particular looked VERY unhappy. Before I could ask, or even let her know I was her server, she stomps up to me and gestures to their general seating area and starts practically screaming at me, ""This HAS to be wrong! I called ahead and told them that I had a party coming and that we all wanted tables together!"" (They had the whole back corner of the place. About 9 tables total.) I let her know that the entire area was hers. She says ""That's NOT what I meant! These tables are NOT together, they're all spread out!"" (The tables are bolted to the floor) I then asked how many were in her party, I might find something that could work out better. THIRTY FUCKING FIVE people.    
This is NOT a banquet hall! It's a steakhouse... we don't have tables that fit THIRTY FIVE people all at ONE table... -.- 
   
2.) People who don't control their children at all.    Look, I LOVE kids. I have seven nieces and nephews and I spoil them like crazy, but if you permit your children to act like little monsters and completely ignore me when I ask that you have them sit down? GTFO. I am NOT a free babysitter. I work in a nice place. It's not a 5 star Hollywood go-to place...but it ain't no McDonald's. Make your kids sit down. Letting your 6 year old run (literally run) around the entire restaurant while you eat is NOT acceptable. Not only is it dangerous to staff (because we have big trays. A lot of the time, we can't see the entire floor) but also dangerous for your child. Kidnappers look like everybody else people. Example? The other day a boy of about 6 years of age was running around the place with no shirt on yelling ""Woooo!""   It's funny on iCarly...not where I work. 
  
3.) People who don't realize that I don't cook your food. I'm your server. I'm not your chef. Waving your steak in my face saying, ""Does that look Medium to you? That's disgusting. Why would you bring that? Any idiot can see that's not medium.""  
I'm sorry, I don't personally cut into your steak before I bring it to you. If it's not right, I'm legitimately happy to fix it. I DO want you to have a good experience. Let me know like a normal human being. 
   
  
4.) Don't...cut...me...off... I know you may not understand it, but we have secret shoppers that come to our place every month and literally GRADE us on if we say certain things at a table. It's annoying as hell, but there's nothing I can do about it. If I don't say those things? I lose at least one shift, if not more. I hate it. It's stupid. I can't change it.   So, when I walk up to your table do NOT say ""Water with lemon"" before I can even open my mouth! Furthermore, please actually LISTEN to what I'm saying. ""Hi! How are you guys doing this evening?"" ""Water with lemon.""  
   
...wtf?  You can feel like a beverage now? That's my personal favorite. I giggle inwardly and contemplate how someone can feel like water with lemon. Transparent and bitter? Hmm..
   
5.) People who come to a nicer, sit down restaurant that is on a 60+ minute wait (clearly a busy night.) then say ""I'm in a hurry, can you make it fast?""    There is a theater right across the street from where I work. This is a huge problem. It's a Saturday night, we're on an 85 minute wait and a group of six sits down that want to catch a movie later.  Date night, I get that, but PLAN AHEAD. It's not a leap to assume we'll be busy at 6:30 on a Saturday. ""We're in a hurry, we're trying to catch a movie. Can you let the kitchen know?""   Yes... yes, let me let them know to put your order ahead of everyone else's because you're in a hurry.. Oh and you want your steak WELL DONE, but somehow brought out to you in the next 15 minutes... Let me call The Doctor.. because he's the only one who can possibly get your food out to you that fast.
   
  
6.) This isn't Harlem...don't do the shake. 
Look, some people drink their beverage like they've spent the last 3 days sweating in the Sahara. I get that. I do not mind getting refills at all. It's my job. 99% of the time, I'm very prompt and I do it without being asked. However, I do work on busy nights. There's a GREAT chance that you're not my only table. So if I can't get one to you RIGHT away, just wait a few seconds. I promise I will. However, if by some chance I DO not notice at first that you need a refill, do NOT just hold your glass up and shake it at me while I'm approaching or while I'm at your table. Let me repeat... do..not..shake..your..glass..at..me.  I'm not sure you realize how insulting that is and how much it pisses a server off. Please. Just don't do it.  Don't tap it either. Not with your finger, your silverware, or anything else. Just don't.  If you need a refill and I don't notice, just let me know like a normal human being.  
   
7.) Don't take your special instructions too far.  Everyone likes their food differently, and that's fine. But when I'm practically writing a short novel of special instructions for the kitchen into the computer, it's TOO MUCH. The kitchen doesn't get pissy with you, they get pissy with ME. Furthermore, if you don't like it and they have to remake it, it's twice the pain in the rear.  Please, order the closest thing to what you like on the menu, and if you MUST, change one or two things.  This isn't the Build-a-Bear workshop, we're not encouraging you to be super creative with your meal.  
And to add on to this, if something IS wrong tell me RIGHT when you discover it's wrong. Do NOT eat the entire thing, then complain about how awful it was at the END of your meal, ask for a manager and then get it for free. Screw that shit. If your steak is wrong, immediately tell me it's wrong and I'll have them make you a new one. I check on EVERY table to make sure everything is correct for them. If you tell me it's fine, then when you're done it's magically not, NOBODY believes you. The manager might comp your meal, but he and everyone else think you were just trying to screw us over.  Seriously, if your meal is wrong, tell us.  If you eat it all, then it's on you. Not us. (Last week, I had a guy get a well done 23 oz T bone steak.  He ate the entire thing. The bone was picked clean. After they had their check, he complained that it had too much gristle and asked for another one.  Then demanded it be taken off his bill. Seriously?)  Also, if you're going out to eat...eat.  A baked potato and a glass of water isn't a meal. 
   
  
8.) Camping. CAMPING CAMPING CAMPING... Good gravy. Camping is never okay.  ""What is camping?"" You might ask. Let me explain. Camping is when you are finished eating, the check is sitting at your table (or possibly even already paid) and you just sit there with your group and talk...and talk...and talk..and talk some more.  This is NOT okay. Not only are you interfering with my work (because I NEED to turn tables quickly to make money) but you're also being insanely rude to people waiting at the door.  Sadly, most people who camp, are also the ones who complain about having to wait 60 minutes for a table.  YOU are part of the problem! You wouldn't have had to wait that long if other people didn't camp. If they paid and then left to go sit and chat at a cafe or something instead, you could have been seated sooner.  So then, after complaining about your wait, you sit and chat for over an hour after you've paid, making MORE people wait... thus making the circle of complaining to me about your wait keep going on and on.   Please, if you're finished eating and you're paid, don't sit and chat for more than 15 minutes or so at most.  It's inconsiderate.  
   
This rule goes for you and your ""joiners"" as well.
*Sits down*  Guest - ""Yes, I have a few people joining me.""  
Me - ""Great! Do you know about how long it will be until they arrive?""  
  
Guest - ""I'm not sure half an hour or so. Somewhere in there.""    
No no no. This is the same as camping...only the sitting and waiting is BEFORE you order, not after. You're still taking up my table for too long without me being able to actually do my job. If your group won't be here for a while, don't check in to be seated. Again, PLAN AHEAD.  Please, don't stop me from doing my job because your group either didn't plan ahead or didn't communicate very well.   And lastly on this topic, it is REALLY hard for me to do my job when you all trickle in.  Most servers HATE this. Let's say there's 20 of you. Three show up, order drinks. Five show up, order drinks, the first three order appetizers. Five more show up, appetizers come out while the latest five are giving drink orders and the middle five are ordering appetizers, continue until all 20 are here and the server is already frazzled and frustrated. Please...try to show up together.
   
  
9.) I know this is a difficult one and you don't always realize you're doing it, but please don't ask me for one thing every single time I walk by. Every single time. ""Can I get some more ranch please?""  ""Could I have more sugar?""  ""A little more brown gravy please?"" ""More ranch please, this isn't quite cutting it."" ""A little more ice?""  
Again, this is my job and I do not mind getting you as much as you want of any of those things, but PLEASE if you need more than one thing, tell me all of them. I swear I can get them all.  When I'm a ping pong ball between you and the kitchen, I can not get to my other tables, then THEY get mad at me because I haven't been to them in 5 minutes, because I've made 6 trips for you. Please, ask for a few things at once, and then give me a few minutes to check on my other guests. Then if you need more things, I promise I will come back to check on you.  
  
10.) Do not tell me you're ready to order if you're actually NOT ready to order.  Again, it's usually busy where I work and I have several tables. I don't have time for this conversation:
  
Me - ""Alright, are you all set to order?""  
Guest - ""Yeah, I'll have the 12oz New York strip.""  
Me - ""And how would you like that cooked?""  
Guest - ""Medium.""   
Me - ""Alrighty, so a nice pink center and your two sides?""  
Guest - ""Oh..I didn't think of that.. Where are your sides, nah you're here.  What are your sides?"" (Are you serious? We have too many for me to list every one to you, but I always do anyway.) Then start asking me and the other people at the table what we think you should do ""I don't know, those all sound good. Honey, what do you think? Do I want the sweet potato? Didn't I get that last time? Those are pretty good here... How is your broccoli? Hmm..I don't know, I want something a little more filling. Is your rice pilaf spicy?  Babe, if I get a baked potato, will you split it with me?""   
  
All the while, I have other tables that are steadily getting more and more annoyed because I'm taking forever at this one. Of course if I try to say ""I'll just give you a few more minutes to look everything over and I'll be right back with you.""  You stop me and insist you're ready. No.. you're not.  
   
  
 These are just the top ten things servers I work with complain about. Feel free to add your own.

I worked at a corporate chain and one of the policies stated that if you had someone walk out without paying you would be written up and on the 3rd write up fired. Some managers would apply discretion, others would still write you up if your patrons took one step outside, even if they came back in to pay.

I was almost always of the opinion that even if you have reason to suspect your table was going to run out the door and not pay there wasn't anything you could personally do (especially when your corporate office pushed ""the customer is always right"" line). It only happened to me twice, once someone was in a rush and genuinely thought they had paid (they signed the original ticket and called later apologizing profusely and came back to pay the next day), another was a couple that had their ticket for 20 minutes and hadn't paid and were looking around nervously.

I knew several really good waiters / servers that were fired because someone refused to pay them or walked out (the worst of those being someone who had walked outside to make a call and then came back in to pay but technically counted as a walkout).

AMA.,39,11,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hqlzt/canada_day_in_ottawa_ama/,"So, it's been a few days and I feel sane enough to post my little story. I work just under half a mile from Parliament Hill in Ottawa (exactly 750m, for the rest of you). It's Canada Day. The thing is, the ""Market"" is a hub of restaurants and bars not 5 minutes walk from Parliament Hill, so it's definitely a tourist trap. The main street is closed for most of the day and it's nothing but people. We'll usually get between 200,000 - 250,000 people downtown each year (bear in mind, that's about 1% of the population of the ENTIRE country - I'm trying to give you all some perspective here).

So, we're a bit of a nicer restaurant. Not crazy, but a couple can plan to spend around $150 for a nice dinner for two (with wine). So, because we're a ""nicer"" place, our dinners tend to be a little slower paced but with more detail (mise en place, wine pairings, etc.) Well, Canada Day is the complete opposite - it's all about the quantity. 

So here we are, trained for higher-end service, but we're about to serve Denny's style. Great. We knew it'd be crazy, but I don't think we realized it would be as crazy as it was. I didn't get a chance to even look at my watch until around 3:15. It was NUTS!!! Table after table after table after table. Not to mention, with the Canada Day menu, the table cheques were a hell of a lot less than what was normal.

We were paid okay. Some people didn't tip (tourists or people who thought they could get away with it) or tips were low (10% to 12% was the norm as people were leaving thanking us for our work saying they had a great time. Gee, thanks.) We ended up doing 350 people considering we have a 42-seat patio (Maybe 40 people inside).

The only really nasty story I have is the group of teen Russians who showed up 20 mins before the kitchen closed. They were 5 who sat at a 4-top, 4 of the 5 ordered food, 2 more showed up and they wanted a larger table. They got it, and 2 left. 10 min later, 2 more showed up and got drinks. 10 min after that, 2 more arrived and they wanted food, but kitchen closed 20 min earlier. Here's how it played out:

Them: ""We want food.""

Me: ""Sorry, kitchen's closed""

Them: ""But we really want food""

Me: ""That patio there, their kitchen is open for another 45 min. You can eat there""

Them: ""But our friends are drinking here.""

Friend of them: ""What, don't you want to serve us? Don't you want our business""

Me: (in my brain): No, not that much.

Me: (vocally):You're welcome to stay and drink here, but our kitchen is closed. If you like, I can talk to the server on that other patio where the kitchen is open to set up a table for you""

Them: ""But I want to stay here, but order that other restaurant's food"" (Essentially)

Me: ""um, no. Not happening""

It took me a good 20 minutes to explain to them that they couldn't eat from one restaurant and drink from another at one table. This all happened at the end of a 15 hour shift. I was done. Seriously, I just couldn't take it. 

So after all of this, and the stupid 15-hour day and the dumb expectations, I still made around $20/hr between tips and wage. Nothing to sneeze at, although I'm used to quite a bit more.

Here we go...",33,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1fyvu8/alright_tfys_tonight_is_the_night_that_moves_me/,"Hello guys! I've always got a bunch of stories that I've wanted to post, but never get around to. However, this group tonight just pushed me to the edge, and I need to vent. Apologies all around for the wall of text to follow.

So I work at a very popular burger chain with endless fries and tacky wall decor. We tend to get a lot of traffic during the sports seasons, since we are located in a fairly large city area nearby many colleges and high schools. Our restaurant does not have a party maximum or include gratuity on anything, *ever*. 

Tonight, while doing my normal serving business, a manager approaches me to inform me of an arriving party of 40. I will be taking it with my coworker; we'll call him R. Now, a 40 top is not that unreasonable for us - I've taken a 60 top before, so anything under 40 or so is really bearable. Besides, R and I are two pretty darn good servers, so it should be fine.

This party of 40 decides that they would like to sit on the patio, which makes us laugh, because we have seven 4-person tables outside. Nowhere near enough space for 40 people. However, the manager tells us to try to make it work. So we get extra chairs and manage to squeeze them all in. 

When they see how uncomfortable it is, they decide that about ten or so of them will go sit inside. Inconvenience for us, but do-able, whatever. 

So R and I take everyone's drink orders and get them out quickly - we manage to stay on top of refills as quick as humanly possible (which entails at least 30 lemonade refills for the children that I personally brought out). When we order the food, we get everyone's jersey number, so we can split the bills much faster and they wont have to wait. Everything goes smoothly.

The food comes out in very good time, no mistakes, no errors, nada. Everyone is happy with their food; we check back several times to ensure that it is. I overhear an older gentleman, roughly 35-38, mention it's his birthday to someone else, and make a mental note to make him a birthday sundae as a surprise.

However, people begin deciding that they want their bills. So we go to split them up and cross check them to ensure correctness, and I no longer will have time to make the sundae. Besides, everyone is standing up and getting antsy, and it's safe to assume that, since I never offered it in the first place, they are just ready to leave.

Then the bills start coming in.

First, we receive $3 on $55. Then, $5 on $58. Then, a gentleman who's bill was $23.03 gives me $23. When I realize what has happened, I go outside to ask him for the rest of the bills (had I shortchanged him the $.03, you bet your butt he would have asked.); alas, he has already left. So add a -$0.30 tip to the tally.

A Mr. Hot-Shot who decided to pick up a bunch of tabs left us $12 on $109. All in all, the bill ended up over $350, and our total tips were $32. 

R and I split that $32, then tip out to bussers, bartenders, and expos a large amount. R and I made $10 each. This is during our peak, which means that we did not receive any tables we would have, and this largely was our income for the night. 

But Mr. Birthday-Boy - you really put the icing on the cake. You had the nerve to - after handing me a less than 10% tip - throw a fit because we ""don't do anything special for birthdays"". I politely told him that I had intended to bring him a birthday sundae, but since he wanted his bill so badly and began rustling his children to the car, I did not have time to do both things. 

So guys, congratulations. You will go down in history as the second worst party I have had to handle. The eleven bucks was sure worth it.

They were very pleasant and whenever I came by to make sure they were fine, each person would smile and tell me they didn't need anything.

Near the end of the meal, one of guys walked up to the bar. He had typed out a message on his phone, telling me to meet his friend by the patio, as he had a gift for his mom.

Turns out, they were fine. The kids were somewhat demanding, but the lady made them say thank you every time they got anything from me. They weren't as loud as I remembered. She had weird requests, but always said please and thank you. She left me 20% and thanked me for the service. I was shocked.

I work in a small, relatively new, restaurant in my home town. Being under 18, I can't legally supply alcohol. There is one manager and one server who are able to get me and the other waitstaff alcohol. Keep that fact in mind. 

On to the show! 

Now, last Saturday was a dreadfully slow night. After getting one table, I waited an hour and a half for another one. So, my manger asked me to clock out, which I was more than happy to do. I stuck around for a little while, as my brother (my ride home) was still on the clock. The other server, let's call him Blondie, is a bit of an ass.

Around 9PM, a trio of my classmates shows up. Blondie quickly, and eagerly, takes the table. He quickly tries impressing them by showing off. Imagine a toddler who's just learned a card trick; that's him. After a few minutes, the chef comes out to cook their meals. Blondie, being that kid who needs the admiration of his peers, brings out a liter bottle of saké. Just by carrying it, he's violated a few state laws. He promptly places it on the table along with 4 shot glasses. He fills them all up, and everyone at the table takes it. Now, he's broken quite a few more laws. He's provided alcohol to minors, he's consumed alcohol (since he's underage), and he's jeopardized everyone else's jobs. The chef quickly finishes cooking and goes back to the kitchen. 

I followed him back into the kitchen fuming mad as well. The chef, let's call him Shrimp because he's short, was absolutely pissed off. He goes off, threatening to fire Blondie for jeopardizing everyone's jobs. I leave and let Blondie know he should talk to Shrimp and, at least, apologize for his stupidity. He leaves, then returns 5 minutes later. ""Nah, he's not mad at all... He's just whining about stupid shit."" Letting him know that he's put all our jobs at risk, as there was a table of 7 beside Blondie's. If they reported him, poof, the legal action would destroy the restaurant. ""It's fine, dude! Whatever..."" To polish off the night, he leaves with his friends, neglecting to clean the mess at the table. ""It's not my problem anymore; I'm off the clock!"" 

More examples? 

* He's cussed out my brother for not being able to take him (Blondie) to work whilst my brother was hanging with friends. 

* He took a whole week off without any advanced noticed saying he'd be out of town, when I saw him that entire week at school. 

* He's made quite a hostile environment by insulting me with any derogatory homosexual term you can think of. 

* He demands my brother and I get his tables their soups and salads, even if we're slammed with our own tables. If we refuse, he storms off and pouts. 
 
* Anytime I need a day to take off, Blondie refuses to fill in for me since work is a responsibility which I should put before everything else, even school-required community service. 

* The kid, now that his friend is working there as well, leaves his station, neglects his tables, demands we pick up his slack, and rushes all his tables just so he can talk to her. When he isn't talking to her in person, he's texting her constantly during his shift. 

* He mopes and pouts like a damn toddler if anyone of us make a few dollars more than him in tips.

* He'll call me unprofessional if I can't help him because I'm busy.

* He takes out his anger on any coworker who talks to him whenever he has more than 2 tables.

So, last spring I had been kicked out of my parents house, and was living with my brother. I really needed a job, so I walked around putting applications in, and handing out resumes. I stumbled upon a small Chinese shop that had been there for a while, next door to the bowling alley.

I go in and tell them I have kitchen experience, have my food handlers management card, that's required of ALL businesses [employees don't have to have them, but the restaurants have to have at least one person that works in the store, has to take the class or have the equivalent training via serve-safe] in the state of Michigan, (this restaurant doesn't have theirs...) and I tell them I have kitchen experience cooking and doing prep work. He tells me to come back the next day, to start work. We will call the owner Hu. His wife also works there, doing deliveries, and we will call her Ling.

The Next day

I report for my first day of work, and they have me put on an apron, and a bandana to keep my hair up, even though I have it up in a ponytail, and sets me to my first task. which is taking the fat off the chicken and wrapping it up on large baking sheets. put them in the cooler. he sends me home. okay? So it was then I was only working 2-3 days a week, for 2 hours a day, and being paid under the table that day, at $8.00 an hour.

Fast Forward 1 week

After the first week they have me answering the phone, and taking orders, managing the fryer, doing dishes. I can do all of these things, when they introduce the new task of making the Crab Rangoon. which is easy. put egg wash on 2 sides of the dough, on the very edge, fill with cream cheese, and bring the corners together. easy stuff.

After working for a week, I have discovered this place is DIS.GUST.ING. How they passed their health inspections is beyond me. I made sure I washed my hands frequently, because everything was dirty, except for the stainless steel table they did prep work on. The sinks? All they had was cold water, except for one tap that was luke warm. Last time I checked you cant do dishes in cold water for bacteria reasons, So, I set about emptying the sink, and refilling it with warmer water. when Hu comes over and asks what I'm doing. I tell him, and he says He had JUST filled the sinks with water. I tell him that you cant do dishes in cold water. Hu tells me not to worry about it, and tells me to finish the tray of Crab Rangoon sitting on the table. I could tell he was angry because of the way he was talking to Ling in Chinese, and the way he was gesturing. I sat there quietly, doing my work, feeling bad because apparently I had done something wrong.

finally Hu comes to me and tells me I need to go home now, so I take my apron off, and get ready to go home, When he tells me he would call me before he needed me again. He never called back. So apparently I was fired for wanting to do the dishes in sanitary sink water(?)

For a while I thought about reporting the place to the Health Dept. for the way they did their dishes, the ""shelf"" that sat on top of the trash can where they prepped food (it was just a couple pieces of wood overlaying the top of the garbage can) and that the rice cooker never stayed up to temp to keep bacteria from growing inside it on the rice. The floors were also never mopped, they never washed their hands. I even inquired about learning to cook Chinese food, but the most I ever got out of Hu about that was you had to be strong to handle the woks. What ever I don't know.

**TD;LR: I was fired from an unsanitary Chinese shop for wanting to do dishes in a sanitary sink...**

The special is this:

Items range from $14-$17
Includes Unlimited Coffee, Juices, Mamosas, Bloody Marys, and Screwdrivers.

Usually our group is 8 to 10 people.  As the only one of my group of friends who was a former server for several years I get the vibe that we are disliked.  Everybody else carries on like things are fine and service is just bad but I pick up on the signs.

First I know it's a jerk move to just roll into a place with 8 to 10 people. And after the first time we couldn't be sat because a group with reservations occupied the large table area in the back, I resigned to make reservations for every Sunday. By Saturday morning latest I call and they always tell me they cannot confirm a reservation so they take my name and number and say they'll let me know(that's the first sign, and they never confirm if I call again).  So we just come in and usually it's set up for us despite a real confirmation.  The table area in the back probably seats around 40.

Second, anyone who has served unlimited refills and drinks knows how stupid some people can get with it, especially alcoholic drinks.  I've noticed we're the only table that orders multiple drinks at one time(i.e. Water coffee and OJ, coffee and mamosa, bloody mary coffee and water)  I know this isn't too uncommon but I'm sure it's disliked.

Now my friends are a little scruffy and probably not entirely quiet.  But by no means are we rude or disruptive.  I'm pretty sure it's the refills that are annoying the servers the most. 

The check always has 18% included so our $150-160ish check becomes 170-185ish.  I usually put down another 10 or so with another friend so we generally tip about 35-40.  Somehow this doesn't seem enough for the refill service of 2-3 drinks per person.

Even though as a server I'd prefer you treat me like crap and tip very well than be nice and not tip.

Basically I always get a ""we don't like you vibe"" when we come. And feel that there's always a debate in the back over who's gonna take us.  Should we tip more for the unlimited refills? Order less drinks? Am I paranoid? I know the actions of a server that likes a table and we definately don't get it.

So I ring him up, get the baristas working on his drink, and then I tell him ""We'll have your drink ready in a moment, since you brought your own meal, will you be eating on the patio?""  Most people, when hearing this, understand and say something like, ""oh, yeah, I can eat out there.""  Or even if they manage to start eating before I notice and I have to ask them to eat outside, they usually understand, even apologize, and go right out.

Not this buttface.  Not only did he yell and scream and do the whole, ""give me my money back and I'm never coming back"" bit, but he actually stood there for 17 minutes (yes I timed it from the time of sale) saying things like ""I've never heard of this kind of bullshit"" and ""other places let me bring in stuff all the time"" and ""what do you think I have in here, anthrax?"" etc.  I got to the point where I just repeated over and over back to him, ""I'm sorry, I don't know what else I can say, but that's our policy and the health code's, and as manager, it's my job to uphold it.""  He kept it up for 17 minutes!!!  (I was getting to the point where I was ready to ask him to leave or I would call the police, but I waited it out longer than usual because there were no other customers at that moment that he was disturbing, and I wasn't feeling particularly threatened just yet.)

Like what, because you keep yelling and throwing the same damn arguments at me over and over, I'm suddenly going to be like, ""Oh!  You're right!  Suddenly I see the light, and I will risk my job to let you eat your greasy beef in my lobby.""

So, y'all being actual restaurant servers, you surely get way worse!!

Mostly, I'm hoping to be able to pass some good tips along to my baristas - as I know it's even worse for them to deal with this stuff, as they don't have the sense of authority the title of ""manager"" gives me (presumably).

I set up my only three tables I had for a 12 top for 5.  In time was 4:30 but I was not going to miss it.  For whatever reason, they sent mine upstairs and assured me another 12 top but rather at 6pm, a birthday party for a middle aged couple.

As the way they all go, they didn't seat until 645 and wanted to wait until the other 3 get there.  45 minutes later they order.  For the record, crudest table I've had.  I can tolerate drunks, loud and screaming babies but when you're using words like cunt and masturbating aloud in a section full of diners, you're just an inconsiderate prick, I don't care whose birthday it is.

I am already cut by the time theyre done.  Their bill is $350 plus 18% suggested gratuity.  They one check it and use $200 in gift cards and the rest on the card.  How our system works, the suggested gratuity drops off once you split tenders.  I humbly reminded him of that and even went as far to separate both slips to avoid any confusion as I always do.  I.E. ""Okay Mr. Smith, the copy on the outside is mine and yours is on the side.""

I wish them well and continue to do my side work.  I come back out to see that the drunk birthday lady who claimed to be the next joan rivers had left her bottle/present of crown royal black.  I run outside only to find another member of their party waiting for valet and pass it off to her.  Upon arriving back to the table, I find they took BOTH MY FUCKING SLIPS.  I haul ass back outside and find ANOTHER member of the party and...""calmly"" explained to her the situation (not being able to make cash, y'all were late, cant tip out, etc)

She relentlessly called the hosting couple but to no avail.  She left several voicemails and I thanked her.  To this day, that couple has not been back or called back to clear anything up.

In my bit of frustration, I rationalized that this is just a memo, a sign to stop relying on others to help pay my bills.

We went all out for special occasions, including New Year’s Eve. I was really excited that two of our regulars booked a table for six and were bringing friends and family from out of town. They were an easy-going couple, and were a true delight to serve.

Our NYE nine course tasting started at 7:30.  At around 10:30, we have dessert and champagne toast.  Several parties lingered over an extra glass of wine or champagne, but most people had left by 11:15.

Our six top waved me over and asked if we would mind if they stayed and ordered a bottle of champagne.  We don’t mind at all.  I bring freshly polished flutes, a chiller, and our last bottle of high end champagne.  I remove the foil and put in my pocket, loosen the cage, put a serviette over the cork, point the bottle at the wall, turn the bottom, and open the bottle without a pop.  Everyone’s happy.

At 11:50, they apologize for keeping us so late.  I assure them that they are not keeping us at all.  They order another bottle of champagne.  All we have left is the Cristalino we use for brunch, but they don’t care.

I was confident from my flawless Champagne presentation earlier (and the shot of bourbon I had with the kitchen after the last course).  I am not sure what went wrong.

I do the same thing.  Flutes, foil, cage, serviette.  When the cork out (again, no pop), I notice something on the edge of the table where I am standing.  Then I notice my hand hurts.  And it is bleeding.  And there is blood on the lip of the bottle.

I told them the bottle was chipped and I would get them another, discreetly wiped my blood off of the table with a serviette, and walked quickly to the back.  Under the fluorescent light of the server station, I could see that under the lip of the bottle there was a giant chip.  When I twisted the bottom of the bottle, the jagged edge scraped against my hand and maimed the left side of my palm.  It hurt.

The other server got them a new bottle of champagne, and presented it to them. Luckily, they were tipsy enough I don’t think they noticed.

Any other wine service horror stories?

TL;DR

Never touch the lip of a bottle with your bare hand during wine and champagne service.

Cons: It is unprofessional, unsanitary, and it hurts.
Pros: You get to drink an entire bottle of champagne by yourself after hours because it might have your DNA in it.  And the wine rep comps the defective bottle.

One Friday night, I had a family of four at one of my tables. The dad told me that his daughter has a dairy allergy, so she wants just plain pasta as a meal. Our most plain pasta is the butter pasta, so imagine his face when I say, Kid's butter (I SAID NO DAIR-), no butter (Oh, ok). He tells me the rest of their order and I ring it it. 

Since the girl's food normally has dairy, and I know there's dairy in and around that section of the kitchen I rang in a dairy allergy. The girl's appetizer was a fruit bowl, which is just pineapple and grapes. I came back to the table after the appetizers were out, and the dad is pissed because there's gorgonzola cheese in the fruit bowl. Her mouth starts swelling a bit and the dad wants to see the manager. Everything gets comped, I get no tip, and I presumably ruined her day

In the kitchen, the other manager is reprimanding me for not putting a dairy allergy on her fruit. I'm pissed off because there shouldn't be cheese in my fruit bowl, regardless of allergies. She says matter of factly, ""The gorgonzola is right next to the grapes"". Pretty much everyone at work told me I was in the wrong for not putting in the allergy, something I still get upset about from time to time. Although mistakes happen, I don't fully get why I get 100% of the blame. I didn't ring it in right, the kitchen put cheese in the fruit, and the food runner didn't see cheese in the fruit. Everyone sucked a little bit.

It's not exactly a horror story, but it was certainly strange.

I work at a restaurant that is pretty much pasta only. It's not really Italian, but it's close enough that people assume it is and I let them, and it's definitely not a fancy joint. It's cheap, family dining. To preface this particular story, I should note that while we are in Utah (a state with strict liquor laws) we do have a complete bar, and while customers do order drinks fairly frequently, the item I have seen sold the least is wine by the bottle. It has literally occurred twice that I've seen since I started there four years ago. This is the story of the second occasion. 

Now obviously since wine is not a large portion of our sales and I myself do not like wine, my knowledge on the topic of wine is extremely limited. This is never a problem since our customers tend to know that this is not that kind of restaurant. That was not the case with this couple. It was obvious once they arrived that they thought they were somewhere else. Definite food snobs, and they were displeased from the moment they sat down. I was struck with fear the moment I took their drink orders and they ordered a bottle of wine.

Traditionally, our policy is that either the bartender or a manager will come to the table to open and pour the wine; however, this being an especially crazy Saturday night the bartender was much too slammed and a manager could not be found, so I had to do this myself. I figured I had it handled, how hard could it be to open a bottle of wine? If only I had known. I arrived with their glasses and bottle, popped the top, and was about to start pouring when the man grabbed me by the arm and stopped me. Now keep in mind, at this point in time I have six other tables waiting for me to help them, so I just want to leave. Instead, this man held my arm, took the bottle from my hand, and proceeded to give me a five minute explanation and demonstration of the proper form for opening a bottle of wine. I was baffled. This was the only time I've ever had a customer manhandle me, and it was for something that was, in my mind, quite frivolous, and extremely rude to both me and the other guests needing my attention. Afterwards, the man was decently pleasant, and left an acceptable tip, but I am still confused by his actions to this day.

WARNING WALL O' TEXT AHEAD

It is August 17th, the day before my birthday. I requested the entire weekend off and this shift is what's stopping me from my celebration. By this time I am already a little bummed because everyone I invited to have a birthday dinner/celebration with is unfortunately unavailable. My manager is out of town leaving me in charge of a ragtag team. Here is our cast:
Angel (cashier), Mike (Barista), Whiskey (Food runner), Sheebaroo (fucking useless/ server on the floor), AmBear (server in the patio), and me (acting manager and floater). 

Around this time there was a big event happening nearby. It was the primaries for something or other. Naturally there's a crowd. In comes two men, one of whom is in a wheelchair. I see Angel taking their orders and think nothing of it. They sit in the back patio.

A little bit later, Whiskey comes up to me and informs me that the man in the wheelchair (Wheelz) didn't receive his food. I check the order and I guess Angel didn't put it in. Well damn. OK. I tell Whiskey to ask Wheelz if he'd like us to put in his order now, free of charge and will be rushed out ASAP. Wheelz says no. I go out and have a chat with him seeing if there's anything I can get for him at no cost to him or his friend. Once again he says no. All I can do now is apologize and let him know if there is anything we can do for him to let us know.

The crowd has now slowed and I'm trying to get Sheebaroo to stop chatting with Mike and get on the floor and clean. He ignores me and tells me to relax. Sheebaroo is always freaking high. Anyway, I'm getting frustrated that no one is actually doing as I ask and I've been yelled at already by the boss' son for letting everyone stand around and talk all day. Mind you I do not get paid as much as a supervisor. I am just a lowly server like everyone else.

As I am attempting to get everyone to do their job, from the patio comes Wheelz and his friend. Wheelz rolls up to me and asks to speak to the manager.

Me: Unfortunately, the manager is out of town. But I am the acting supervisor. Is there something I can do for you?
Wheelz (yelling): I didn't get my food! I didn't get my food because that girl over there (pointing at Angel) didn't listen! That's the problem with you kids these days. You never listen!
(I look over at Angel who is giving me a ""I don't know what's going on look)
Wheelz: I am in a wheelchair! I depend on other people like you. I need help getting around! I'm so hungry now. I'm starving! I need people like you to help me. (He starts crying)
Me: Sir, it was never our intention to do so. If you'd like I'd be more than happy to get you something to go. It won't take more than 5 minutes...
Wheelz: No! I don't want your food. I want you to do something about that girl! (He's stopped crying now and has stood up. That's right he's STANDING and yelling) I am in a wheelchair I depend on you guys! I will never shop here again. I have been here before and I expected alot from you. (He sits back down. Mumbles to himself, as well as whimpering. Then wheels away).

I worked there for almost 3 years, so I have more than a few tales to tell. This one is about an over-entitled, bleached-blonde suburban mom who always, *always* tried to scam the serving staff for discounts, despite being clearly wealthy.

Thankfully, I only had to serve her twice in my years there, but she cost me a good chunk of change each time. Since it was independently-owned (as in, not a chain restaurant), the managers were really rigid about certain policies they had in place to save themselves from financial loss — one of them being that if the customer didn't like the food (for reasons other than the order being mixed up) and the server didn't catch on quickly enough/replace it for them, the discount came out of the servers' pockets, rather than the kitchen staff or the restaurant paying for it. Ridiculous, I know.  

The first time I served her, she was with her husband, who was totally nice and seemed a bit embarrassed by her bitchiness. I followed procedure *exactly* as I should have and was very attentive (without being pushy). I came over twice throughout the meal, once shortly after serving the food to make sure they had all the condiments, napkins etc. that they needed and that their beverages were topped up, and once to ask if they were enjoying the meal. They had zero complaints. Once I saw that they were done eating (they hadn't touched their plates in a few minutes and the food was mostly eaten), I came over to collect the plates and ask again how everything was. *All of a sudden* there was an issue with the lady's sandwich. She complained that the chicken was too dry and seemed ""petrified"". She made such a big deal of this one word, ""petrified"". I thought it was strange that she was now complaining about the food, considering she'd said nothing earlier and she had eaten pretty much all of it, save for a few bites. I asked my manager about it, and while they normally told us not to give discounts to people who ate more than 3/4 of the food and *then* complained, they were regulars and friends of the owner, so I had to suck it up and pay the difference myself.

The next time I served her, she was just with her two (bratty) kids. They ordered a bunch of appetizers and again, said nothing negative when I went to check on them and ask how everything was. Later on, I came back to see if they were finished and she snapped at me that they were still working on it (even though they hadn't touched any food in several minutes and were all just sitting there, looking annoyed). A bit later, as they were still sitting there with the remaining scraps of food untouched, she flagged me over and demanded that I discount their *entire* meal. I asked what the problem was, and she proceeded to show me a long, scraggly blonde hair — exactly the same as her own — and tell me she found it in her quesadilla. It's important to note that absolutely no one in the kitchen had blond hair and I was the only server on duty that day, and was also not a blonde. It was quite clearly her own hair that she had plucked out of her head deliberately so she could complain. Not to mention the fact that if she had, in fact, found it in her quesadilla, it would not be so long (our quesadillas were cut into four pieces, about 3 inches each at the widest point). That would have been some special hair, not even breaking when cut with a sharp kitchen knife! I knew she was lying, but couldn't do a damn thing about it, unless I planned on calling her a liar to her face. Once again, I paid the difference.

What a cheapskate.

(6 months in a week or so) and the restaurant I work at is great, everyone gets along, and the guests are polite and generally understanding. 

My problem is:
So when I started working, the kitchen would get 1% and the hosts would get 1.5% of tip out. That’s because our restaurant didn’t have busboys and we were expected to help buss and wipe/set all the tables in the restaurant. Shortly after being hired (I think it was one month or almost one and a half), they took away the extra .5% because they said they were going to hire busboys. However, it was 4 and a half months before they finally hired the first (and only) busboy. But he only works weekends, and he doesn’t do his job. He doesn’t bus tables for at least half an hour after the table as gotten up. And when he wipes the tables, he barely glosses over the table. All of this means, that when we are busy, as we generally are on weekends, the hosts have to bus tables, except now we aren’t getting paid. The servers are starting to get upset too because even though we are doing the busboy’s job, he is still getting the tip out money. 

This has gone on for almost a month now. I still feel too new in my job to try to talk to management about this. The .5% equates to a good $15 on a really busy Friday/Saturday. Not to mention, we still don’t get paid the .5% when the busboy isn’t working. I guess what I’m getting at here is, is this right? Or can anything be done to correct this?

**TL;DR** Restaurant hires a busboy that won’t do his job and still gets paid, while I don’t.

One of the worst parts of my job was answering the phones, mainly because we don't take reservations and I don't know how many times the response I would get back was ""What do you mean you don't take reservations??"" Sigh. 

My restaurant was in the same parking lot as a mall so during the holidays it was nuts. One particularly busy day a woman calls and tells me she was supposed to meet her friend for lunch and won't be able to make it and wanted me to tell her. It was years ago, so I guess her friend didn't have a cell phone, I don't know. I was honestly stumped. The place was PACKED and we had no intercom, which I (genuinely) politely told her. I asked her if she knew what her friend was wearing maybe, to which she responded no, but that she was a 40 year old brunette. Oh yes, *that* narrows it down. I was being perfectly nice during the conversation honestly trying to figure out how in the world I could possibly help her and this woman just turns rude on me, like how dare I not go table to table asking if the patrons were her friend because she was going to bail on their lunch. Finally the woman asks me ""Well what if this were an emergency? What if I were dead??"" I responded ""Well then we wouldn't be having this conversation."" Silence. ""I want to talk to your manager"". OK! 

I get the manager who talks the woman down, finishes the conversation then turns to me, head shaking. ""Don't answer the phone anymore."" **Fine by me**",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_14tqry,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/14tqry/no_longer_on_phones/,

It was something like 8 or ten dollars on a 25 dollar check. (Less than that after we comped part of the meal.) This couple must have spent at least an hour for us to get their food right.

To explain, I primarily work on the bar but once a week I go into the kitchen because that's where I started out in this industry so it means they can rotate people off on a Sunday whilst I cover it and I also like to see things from both sides and believe it's important to know all the staff you're working with, their strengths, weaknesses and how they work.

Anyways, a lot of the stories on this sub are about how shit customers can be or, alternatively, how great they can be or how funny the FNG is and how X did Y and now Z is happening. But in the kitchen yesterday someone rang through an order, we have a ticket screen and it's all done by computers so it happens that every now and then someone just hits the wrong button on the till and we get the wrong order. That's what happened.

Now there was an amendment on one of these dishes which was weird because they asked for no chips, when it didn't come with chips anyways. I ring downstairs and just doublecheck they meant no mash on that particular dish, person who rang it through said yep my bad I meant no mash.

So we carry on, the food goes downstairs (hate having an upstairs kitchen but that's another thing entirely.) and a few minutes later I get a call that I've cooked the wrong food. Now one of the girls in the kitchen is downstairs at the time making tea and coffee because it's quiet and we're thirsty. The person who screwed up the order has the audacity to stand there and LIE and say that she didn't get it wrong, the Kitchen got it wrong.

This is a manager, lying to try and stay out of trouble- she wasn't going to get in trouble, everyone makes mistakes we understand that. But just be honest about it instead of being a dick, it's very easy to recall that ticket and show you exactly what you rang through so do not lie to us it just makes you look like an arsehole.

It's not very coherent and a bit rambling but fuck people who lie to cover their own ass. If anyone is new to the trade and if you take to heart nothing else on this sub, please remember this- if you mess up an order, whatever, it happens nobody is perfect just admit the mistake, apologise and after shift we'll be laughing about it.

Thoughts?,32,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1if23d/my_restaurant_decided_that_were_going_to_start/,"So we had a mandatory server meeting yesterday where they let us know that starting next week, we're going to be pooling tips.

My primary concern is that since I tend to have pretty high check averages (I upsell like a motherfucker) and already give great service (so I average around 22-25% tips), I'm going to end up getting fucked and lose out on income. 

In every place I've worked with pooled tips, I'd see significantly less money than I've earned on my credit card receipts, save for one of my first jobs where I was, quite honestly, a terrible server. 

My other concern is that instead of walking with cash from our cc tips, they're going to be put on our checks, which will definitely help me spend less money every night at the bar next door, but still feels weird to me.

So, one of the restaurants I work at is a modern asian kitchen and sushi place (we'll call it Sushi), that tends to get pretty good crowds for happy hour (3-6) and once the sun goes finally goes down in our dusty desert town.  This is important, because it results in essentially two rushes during dinner shift.  

Well, for the past week, the entire owning family has been out of town to Las Vegas, except for one daughter who was full-time managing their other restaurant, that I also work at.  They were scheduled to return Friday night, but at the last minute, extended their trip another day so they'd get back around closing Saturday night.  This was on top of our Saturday night bartender already having taken off this night weeks in advance for a special event in town.  This left just 3 servers up front, one who had been handed manager powers in the POS who didn't know how to use them, and zero with any true bartending experience.

Well, when I walked in last night around 5, I got sat immediately and saw the end-of-happy hour crowd was about to start swelling.  I enter the kitchen to make someone a hot tea, and as soon as I get through the door, I'm assaulted with 110 degree air and a building cloud of smoke.  All the ventilation hoods in the back were down.  They had the back door open and a fan blowing smoke out and this was still the condition of the kitchen.  Apparently, the hoods had gone down around noon, and the repairmen wouldn't show up until around 6, in the thick of our happy hour rush.  Now, to give a little perspective, the restaurant has 4 woks with custom gas burners and rings ([similar to these](http://www.dtec-catering.co.uk/pixels/pages/wok-cookers/wok-cooker-on-own.jpg)), a 4 burner saute station, a double basket deep frier, and a 48"" wide grill.  So the kitchen going full blast produces A LOT of smoke and grease.

As our rush ramped up, the kitchen caught the majority of the food orders for no particular reason other than fuck-you-bad-luck, and all my tables were thankfully(?) ordering beer and wine or other drinks I could simply fetch as opposed to grabbing T, the server who was our ""bartender/manager"", even though she had no experience with either.  The shitty thing is, T and the other server, A, had a lot of cocktail orders.  So they were playing fuck-around at the bar literally all night, trying to figure out how to make these cocktails, but getting to stay in the cool dining room.  I was stuck running just about everyone's food.  In the thick of each rush, you could barely see the crew on the other side of the line and it could not have been any cooler than 130 in the kitchen.  The cooks were pulling some kind of Hell's Kitchen-challenge shit where one guy would cook for 5 minutes then run out for air and the 4 of them would rotate doing that all night.

So understandably, there were lots of mistakes, several accidental double-fires, a 2"" piece of stainless steel wok scrub left in some lady's curry, timing mistakes on apps vs. entrees, etc.  And I was the server running everything and dealing with it all.  Out of everyone, I probably spent the most time in that kitchen, on top of dealing with my own tables all night.  After the first happy hour rush, I was doing alright, I felt fine, just coughing a little when I stepped in the kitchen, but when the 7pm dinner rush hit and I had to be back in the kitchen for food running, plating, fixing/explaining orders to the kitchen, etc, I wasn't feeling so hot.

Around 8, the hoods were finally fixed, but at that point, I had a massive headache, felt physically sick to my stomach, and had several of the kitchen guys worried because every other time I stepped in to the kitchen, I was coughing up a storm.  After I dropped some lady's iPhone on the floor in front of her and got dizzy when I bent down to pick it up, I handed off the last 2 tables I was sat with off to A and T, told T what was up, and just focused on my sidework so I could get out of there asap.

I got out around 9:45, and as I was driving away, saw the owners pulling up in their SUV.  I almost wanted to run back in because I ""forgot something"" so I could throw up in front of them, and they could see the [huge sweat-stain](http://imgur.com/sfhYE68) on the back of my shirt, but I decided to just drive home and immediately made street pizza in a bush as soon as I parked my car.  And immediately passed the fuck out for 10 hours when I got home.  

Holy fuck, I need to find a new job.  Too bad our July schedule has me working doubles every weekday except Thursdays...

Her: ""But it's on your website like this and I printed it out. It shouldn't be on there if it's not valid. Just give me my 10% off."" At this point I realize I'm fighting with a stubborn old broad who just wants to make my night hell. I may have been put in charge for the front by the owner, but I'm only a lowly server and, while allowed a good number of managerial duties, dealing with expired promotions isn't really in my list of things I'm allowed, so I go the the actual manager on duty, which is my Kitchen Manager. 

Me: ""Hey, I got someone up here who want's me to do a discount with an expired coupon.""

KM: ""What? Are you serious?"" I hand her the paper and she examines it. ""This is seven months old.""

Me: ""I know. So does she, but apparently she doesn't grasp that concept and still wants me to comp it."" I look out through the kitchen window and see her with a nasty look on her face, arms crossed and impatiently tapping her foot on the ground. 

KM: She looks conflicted for a moment. ""Just go ahead and give her the discount.""

Me: ""What? But she's acting like she's 5 years old out there about it.""

KM: ""I know, but she's going to throw more of a fit out there about it, do you really want to deal with that? I'm also not sure I can really say 'no' to this either, it's a promotional thing, you know I don't deal with that kind of thing.""

Me: ""She doesn't deserve it, but you're my boss so I'll do it."" I trudge on up to the front where I go in and give her her precious discount. ""Okay, you're all set.""

Her: ""Thank you. Now, was that really that difficult to do?""

Me: ""How's about you just have a good night, alright?"" Then I walk away and rage work. 

I honestly wouldn't have minded giving her the discount if she wasn't such a bitch about it. If you're polite then I'll work with you and chances are, I probably would've went ahead and gave the discount regardless of it's expiration date, I would just tell her I can't do it again. I just hate it when people think they have to be pricks just to get their ways, and I really wish I didn't give her that discount.

1352346046.0,27,self.TalesFromYourServer,12u7go,"Incredibly embarrassing moment tonight! I'm cringing on the inside, so who has a story that can make me feel better?",27,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/12u7go/incredibly_embarrassing_moment_tonight_im/,"Ok- so today I had a table that all ordered wings. One lady wanted 1/2 Buffalo and 1/2 Sweet-Hot. 

So I bring out what totalled to 60 wings altogether and as I am bringing out the last plate I realize that her wings (which are separated on her plate by the carrots and celery) are probably not right. I mean, she was supposed to have 2 sets of lighter colored sauces and had one light and one really dark. 

Now, if the table had all ordered normal flavors, this wouldn't have been cause for alarm- I would have done the usual (apologize profusely and replace the food if it was wrong). Unfortunately for my sense of panic her husband had ordered Super-Extra-Hot-Can't-Eat-More-Than-Three-Comfortably wings. These wings, you guessed it, have a very dark colored sauce. 

So I'm sitting there, telling the poor lady not to eat her wings because I suspect she may have a 5 alarm fire in her mouth if she does, and looking like a fool because I didn't so much as pay attention to the food I ran out. 

Side Note: I'm not in the habit of sticking my fingers in people's food to make sure it is right, and it always boggles my mind that people think I personally taste everything that comes out before I bring it out. 

In the midst of my panicking and trying to figure out how to get these 10 very saucy and spicy wings away from this lady (and how to keep from having to remake all 20, even though it wasn't my fault) I ask her to place 1 wing on a spare plate so I can see what kind it is. 

As soon as she puts it on the plate, while I am I standing right there at the table, I unthinkingly **put my finger into the wing's sauce and lick it off** only to proudly pronounce that I **have** determined it is covered in SEHCEMTTC sauce (suspicions confirmed!)

Now, I don't know why I did it. I guess I'm not very good under pressure really, because I wouldn't even have done that in the kitchen. I would have used a fork or something. 

Why didn't I just ask her to hold on for a moment while I took it to the back? I don't know, I wasn't even busy. They were my only table!

Anyway, this story has a happy ending. The table didn't even seem to be phased by my crazy behavior. Like, not at all. They didn't even bat an eye. And they left me 20%. Maybe they just thought I was slightly retarded. I don't know. 

WHY? WHY DID I DO THAT?

Anyway, what do you have for me, TFYS?

1351851219.0,26,self.TalesFromYourServer,12iaq9,The unwanted customer,32,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/12iaq9/the_unwanted_customer/,"I work in my mother's restaurant and at the young age of 17, I have grown to dislike the job I was forced in, along with that came with my dislike for socializing and smiling.

If it's one thing that will get me to hate a customer for all of eternity, it will be them touching, or taking my food. Before you roll your eyes over me being angry over a small thing, I barely finish my meals as there are no break times. This means I can start eating at 9 o'clock in the morning and finish an hour later, by that time the food has gone stone cold and no appetite left. So yes, I cherish my meals times and I will go on a raging warpath if anything interferes with it.

For this particular tale, I have a unwanted customer who enjoys touching my food and using my *personal equipment*. Whenever I bring out my laptop to study or do homework, this guy thinks it's perfectly fine and dandy to violate my personal space *touch my laptop*. To me, that is a big deal because I don't get personal space at home at all, my parents enjoy barging in my room if I was too quiet and have told me off on more than one occasion for requesting to have a lock on my door. I like my personal space and I most certainly don't like it when it gets violated, be it friend or foe.

I had thought I managed to see the last of him when I told him bluntly (still as polite as I was willing to go) that I do not appreciate him touching my food and personal items. He was offended, complained to my parents for my ""terrible service and atrocious manners"", to which I got disciplined shortly afterwards (suck it up, they said, it's wrong to defend myself). He said that he's never going to return and that we have lost a valuable customer.

Months passed by and I was significantly happier without his presence and I enjoyed getting some space for myself. 

Until last night.

I was sitting down, studying and preparing myself for an exam that was happening next week. He walks in, towers over me (I was sitting down) and stared at me and my laptop, which I closed immediately. We had a staring showdown and he was uncomfortably close to me. I was civil and polite to him for the remainder of the short conversation we had.

Him: Are you open?

Me: Yes.

Him: I want noodles.

Me: With?

Him: Duck. Noodles with duck.

Me: Okay.

I handed the order into the kitchen and had another waiter serve him while packed everything up and stayed inside the kitchen for food preparation. I told my mother that I did not feel comfortable in serving that man, nor will I ever be comfortable. Like I said, I do not enjoy in having my personal space invaded and have my belongings touched by complete strangers, a trait passed down from my brother to me.

Has anyone else have to deal with people like this?

**TL;DR: I'm not a people person and don't like strangers.**

**EDIT:** I realized I probably came off as whiny and I didn't give enough context to this situation, I apologize for that. Please note that I have finished my secondary schooling last week and that these problems won't reappear anytime soon in the future. As for the man, I am no longer certain on how I should deal with him as I'm told to dismiss it as normal ""crazy"" behavior and I shouldn't worry about it. 

1. My parents get paranoid when they leave me home alone so they drag me out of the house as much as possible, leaving me out at the restaurant for the majority of the day. They expect me to be able to work at and study at the same time in the afternoon and at night. Since I'm barely at home, I eat at the restaurant when there are less customers, but I do end up not finishing my meals most of the time.
While I have a local library nearby, it had a reputation of drug addicts overdosing in the toilets, so I can't go there either. Now, these instances of OD'ing are very rare and they do get reported in the local papers but my parents see it as a good reason to not allow me to go to the library.

2. I understand that eccentric customers exists and I'm fine with that. I enjoy interacting with them and most of the time I end up being good friends with them. However, this man was not the good-eccentric type of customer. He makes me uncomfortable just by standing and staring down at me, this is not something I want at all when interacting with *any* customer, eccentric or not. This man had actually picked up my food with a grin while I was busy serving another table, presumably trying to get my attention and on the other times he had been at the place, he would stand and stare down at me for a few minutes and it's extremely unnerving for me. 

3. My parents' paranoia have stemmed from other children they had from previous marriages. My brother was a problematic child during the period when my mother was in the process of divorcing from his father, he ran away from home frequently, been involved with gangs and dabbled in drug use (he's clean now and no longer in trouble with the law). My other siblings from my father's previous marriage have either engaged in sexual activity from a young age (around puberty, if I recall correctly) or drug use (which continues today, particularly my step-brother).
With this in mind, I understand why they would be extremely concerned about me but most times it does become problematic and I find it extremely frustrating. Since I have completed all my exams last week (finished high school), I did talk to them and they have agreed to at least knock on my bedroom door if they needed something from me. Now that I'm finished with school, I no longer have a problem in terms of my laptop being tampered or taken away and I developed a habit of eating while standing behind the counter.

4. My mother's restaurant has the normal set up of the front of house, back of house and another separate area for storage for equipment and utensils. The front of house has tables, chairs, counter and the cash register. I work primarily at the front and I multitask many jobs such as serving, cleaning, being at the cash register to give customers their bills and general maintenance. We do have workers for these jobs, but my mother can't afford to pay them for long hours so I normally do them after hours before I go home. There is no back office for me to retreat to when I do need to study, nor is there designated ""break times"" for all employees. Everyone is encouraged to eat when they need to and there is no policy of having specific servers for different tables, meaning *all* servers serve different tables to cover the other when they're eating. As the owner's daughter, I'm expected to over all waitstaff, even if I'm technically busy. So, I don't have breaks.

One day as I'm covering my tables, I see this 45aged russian man walk in through the frontdoor. 

Now theres a sign with ""Please be waited to be seated"" which he strolls past, happens all the time. I approach him, and ask with what, I can help him with. He grunts and walks over to our big open kitchen, where our headchef is preparing a table order for a Omelette with chives and onions. He then points and literally yells ""I want, EAT"".

To best of my abilities I guide him to a table, where he is seated, I try to get him to other beverages, however his just a lost cause.

As I then bring down the Omelette (Which is served in a burning hot pan, on a wooden board) I tell him that the pan is really hot, and I make hand gestures and facial exspressions as best as I can. First thing he does is firmly grab around the burning pan with his right hand. He then quickly lets go of the pan, and look at me with this burning hatred, as I'm about to be smited by the mother of Soviet Russia herself.

Now this is when shit gets crazy. He got thirsty and asks for ""Watar"", which i then go to the main bar to fetch him. Turns out he solved it himself, by walking over to a table with 4ladys eatings, grabs their can of water AND a glass. Walks back to his own table, to enjoy his very, shall we call it delightful dinner.

A few details:
 
At the restaurant I work at, all of the employees routinely work off the clock every night. We do this because they understaff to keep labor low, and it takes a long time for us to get everything done at close.

We put up with it because:

1.)No one wants to make waves.

2.) We all genuinely like and care about our GM.

3.) We might be naïve.

4.) We don't know what would happen if we put up a fight about it.

5.) GM makes us feel like it is our own fault that we can not get done on time, despite the fact that we work really hard.

I guess there is a question in here somewhere. What would you do in this situation? Keep in mind that you enjoy your job, love the people you work with, and get special treatment in a lot of ways (always getting free food, being able to set own schedule, etc.)

Have any of you went through this and what did you do?

Edit:

I live in Oklahoma.

I *am* going to do something about this. You have all encouraged me, thanks.

EDIT2:

I called the Oklahoma Labor and Hour Division. Basically, it is legal for me to work off the clock because I make enough in tips to supplement the hours I am off the clock. Which, more or less I do. I may make 40 bucks during a 6 hour shift on the clock. That's about $10/hour, which more than makes up for an hour off the clock. No violation for me and nothing to report. However, if the other employees want to, they can file a claim. I'll give them the number and let them know. At least I did *something*

I should be putting in my 2 weeks soon and will cover all but one more shift this weekend so I can say goodbye to coworkers.  
The thing is I have had a terrible general manager for the last 5+ years.  I lost all respect for her when I told her I wasn't comfortable serving a regular who was making direct sexual comments to me and she told me I didn't have the right to refuse to serve him, only the restaurant did, and she wouldn't do that because he brings in money.  

So I am thinking about requesting an exit interview with the district manager to discuss some issues and to maybe make things better for the coworkers I'm leaving behind.  I work for a corporation and previous anonymous emails to HR go unanswered because they don't care unless it could lead to a lawsuit.  I'm looking for advice. 

I want to bring up a few large issues instead of smaller incidents (requesting an anonymous survey done by staff of management, a place where all corporate rules can be found so that management can't make up rules on a whim, no more forced breaks or refusing to clock us in to save labor and maybe one or two more things).  Has anyone done or seen something like this before? How did it go?  Is anyone here a RM or DM?  Would you respond to something like this?  Am I skipping the line of command too much by going to the DM (my RM is pretty bad too)?

One day, three very large people came in. A mother, a father and their young adult daughter. When I went over to greet them, the mother grunted at me that they'd have a water and two, LARGE (emphasized because that's how she said it to me) cokes. I brought the drinks over, held up the water and asked who was having it. The mother pointed and grunted at her daughter and then proceeded to order for her.

""What is with your menu? Is anything NOT deep friend?!""

I list off the very few items that are not deep fried. 

""Ugh, my daughter can't have any of that! What about the almond chicken?""

""Yes, that's deep fried.""

""Sweet and sour pork?!""

""Yes, also.""

""Prawns?! Fried rice?!""

""Yes, the prawns are deep fried but I can ask to have them sautéed. The rice isn't deep fried but it is browned using soy sauce and other spices which can be very salty.""

""Well, that's not good enough! She's on a diet. She can't eat any of this!""

At this point, she is staring at me in absolute shock. She cannot understand why a Chinese restaurant doesn't offer a healthy menu. In  my experience, not very many do.

""I can go ask the chefs if they can grill a chicken breast as well as steam some vegetables and rice. Would that be okay?,"" I suggest.

""Go ask!""

While this exchange went on the father slurped down his entire coke and then had a wheezing, choking attack. He shouted at me as I went into the kitchen to bring him a refill. No please or thank you. 
The daughter sat with her eyes to the table, never saying a word or looking up.

All of the cooks spoke very little English and most times would not go off of the menu unless we charged the customers a large amount. I begged them to make up this customers order as I didn't want to be berated by the mother any more. To my surprise, they agreed.

I went out to deliver the good news and take the parents order. The mother once again stressed that her daughter is on a very strict diet and can't have anything fatty, salty, or greasy. She then proceeded to order two combo 2s for her husband and herself. 

All three of them were very overweight. Our combo 2s consisted of four deep fried, salty, greasy items. I couldn't believe after going through so much trouble to insist her daughter had a ""healthy"" meal, they were going to eat those combos in front of her. 

When I brought out their meals I didn't realize that the cook had put a spoonful of gravy underneath the chicken. It is common for them to do this with the veal or pork cutlets and they must have got confused when I tried to explain what the customers wanted. The mother raged at me. I offered to get a new one made but instead she asked for a stack of napkins. She used some of the napkins to soak up the gravy, which she left, soaking, on the table. 

After all that I really wanted to tell her that if she really wants her daughter to lose weight then maybe they should make it a family goal in which EVERYONE participates. The daughter obviously had no confidence and I feared that even if she did start leading a healthier lifestyle, she still wouldn't be happy with herself because of the way her mother acted.

This is the story that got me thinking:

My wife, brother-in-law and I were out for drinks and dinner at this trendy place.  A casual restaurant, part of a chain, that caters to a slightly upscale crowd where the food is decent and has a great lounge that is always busy with 100% attractive female servers dressed in lbd's and and at most 2 male bartenders. The vibe suits mid-20s to about 40 ideally. if you live in a big enough city everyone has a place like this.


 We were long time regulars. My wife and I are regulars at a few places where we know the most of the staff on a first name basis, have our voices recognized over the phones when making reservations, are nice and fun when in house but also are patient and understanding (I've been on the other side so I totally get it). We also know food really well and we always tip well.  But I digress.  We have the brother-in-law out for his birthday to this place which is his favorite on a Saturday (and it was busy).  Our server is a newer girl we don't know but definitely a pro, attentive, smart, witty, efficient, transferred from another locale. There had been some staffing changes and none of the people we knew were on that night until we were halfway through when two of them came over to say hi.  A round or two of drinks, dinner, a bottle of wine. It was fun.  We had theater tickets for a late movie after so we ask for the bill.  She drops it off with a smile and leaves to let us do our thing.  Total was $125.  I pull out two $100s, slide the fold to the edge of the table with the bills sticking out so she knows we are ready and we keep chatting until she comes by.  The strangest thing happens.  She circles and looks and assists every other table in our section but ours... for 45-50 minutes.  It was so bad that one of our regulars went to this new girls and was telling her we were ready and she'd smile and we'd overhear her saying ""just getting to that"" twice but she still wouldn't pop over. She then managed to take a smoke break all during the time we were waiting.  Lisa, one of our regulars came over and tried to put on a professional face on it but she was clearly frustrated too.  I told her not to worry, but if she could get the manager that was on that night to come over it would be great. He pops over and I fill him in, tell him I've been a server before and I know the game. (For those unsure, at this point, she was playing the tip waiting game. Knowing we had somewhere to be and paying cash figured if she suddenly took waaaaaay too long to bring change we may just leave her a bigger than planned tip. She'd obviously used this technique before. Used to work with one girl and one guy that did this they cost us all money. Good people didn't come back and made us all look like assholes). This manager guy is newer and has seen me in and apologizes and says he'll take care of us and comp us part of our meal.  I told him that I did not want compensation.  I will pay exactly what my bill is but I won't be leaving a tip tonight.  He looked like he just shit his pants and was 100% sure I wasn't playing a game or just complaining for fun. We left and tried to have some birthday fun for the rest of the evening.  


A few months later, we are at a sushi restaurant that we also frequent and Lisa and a few other girls from this place are there too having sushi and drinks.  They came over and say hi, have some drinks with us and chat. We end up spending a lot more time there than planned.  They tell us they haven't seen us in a while.  They made a point in telling us that the ""other girl"" is no longer at that location and they are so happy because she kept pissing off regulars.  We really like these girls, they are so much fun but we still haven't been back.  I have to admit, I'm conflicted.  I had a great time before and we enjoyed going but having someone try an rip you off really puts you off a place.

**TL;DR - Former server.  Had a server try to out wait us into dropping a $75 tip on a $125 bill.

My replacement? Sparky...Scooter....Pain in the ass... what ever you want to call him. Really though, his names... Sparky. At least, that's what I call him.

ANYWAY...


Today was Sparky's day to wait tables, and I got stuck back in the kitchen doing what I do best.... cooking. Keep in mind, I had been there since 12:30, and had gotten some, if not most, of my prep work done for the rest of the weekend. Out in the dining room, we have a small TV, in which the Michigan vs. Ohio State game was playing, and Sparky kept taking it upon himself to go watch TV instead of doing the one task he was given... which was sweeping and mopping the floor.  I was steddily getting pissed off, and I quietly waited for the guys in the dining room to leave when I finally had the chance to talk to him. 

Our conversation went a little something like this:
*pudgy penguin goes out and turns the TV off*

Sparky: what are you doing?

Myself: Turning the tv off. 

Sparky: what why?

Me: Because you have work to do. 

Sparky: I am doing my work, im conversing with the customers about football.

Me: No, youre wasting time, watching a football game. You need to go mop the floor.

Sparky: But, I have money riding on this game.

 Me: Your gambling habits are not my problem.


after that little conversation, he went back to finish sweeping the floor, and by that time we had another table come in, He took care of them, and then I looked up to see Sparky in the dining room, watching the game, and talking to customers excessively again. I had had enough. I went to the dining room doorway, and stood there and glared at him, until one of the customers noticed i was there, and told sparky I was waiting to speak to him. Sparky turned to look at me and all I had to do was glare and snap my fingers into the kitchen, and point. He got the hint. Finally I said to him, ""SPARKY... GO MOP THE FLOOR...."" I think he got the hint that I was good and mad, and tired of fighting with him to get him to do the one, simple task he was entrusted with.

**Edit**: I would like to mention that I work with him in this fashion at least twice a week, and I often have to argue and fight with him to get him to do his job, because he goes out and talks to customer's excessively even when he isn't waiting tables.

Let me preface this by saying that I HATE being THAT customer, the one with food allergies (gluten in this case).  I am perfectly aware of what a pain in the ass it is to make food for me, because there have been a number of occasions where I've had to make my own food in a kitchen that was not gluten-proofed. 

I got awesome service last night when I went out to a favorite burger place than can accommodate gluten allergies with my husband to celebrate the successful defense of my Master's thesis.

I like my burgers well done.  Food comes out, everything looks great, nom nom nom.   Two bites into my burger, my husband points out that it's medium-well.  Well, fuck.  I realize rationally that there is nothing wrong with a medium-well burger.  But the pink grosses me out, and once noticed, I can't unsee it and I can't eat it.  I very apologetically ask our waiter if he can send it back so it can finish cooking.  No problem he says, and off he goes.

A few minutes later he comes back with a fresh burger and basket of fries (already more than I meant for him to do).  About to dive in again, my husband stops me before I can take a bite. 

The pattern at this point in the story is that I'm too tired and hungry to pay attention to my food, which is why its good that my husband is always on the ball when we eat out.  The fries (and presumably the burger) are seasoned.  On gluten free orders the should not be because the seasoning isn't safe.  Feeling really guilty now, I wait and when our waiter comes back, I point that the fries are seasoned and pretty sure the burger also his.  He apologizes profusely and goes back to the kitchen.  A few minutes later the chef comes out to apologize and personally deliver my burger.  

They comped my burger, which I didn't nor would I have asked them to do.  I felt really horrible that I had to send it back twice.  We tipped our waiter the price of the burger, so $10 on a $15 ticket.  I know it may not seem like a gigantic tip, but money is tight so we can't throw money around.  We still ALWAYS tip 20-25% when we go out.  But I really appreciated his attentiveness and his good attitude even though I sent my food back twice.  The chef was also wonderful and amazing.

So thanks to an amazing waiter and very patient chef a night that could have ended disastrously turned out awesome.

theres been a lot of..... goofs. Usually we have the new girls work with a veteran with 2 waitresses on one shift. Thats not the case with K. She didnt get a chance to work with one of the veteran girls, because one is on leave, and the other is working a different shift. Another girl works 2 jobs, and isnt available most of the week. The last girl, she ended up being sick, and besides, she isnt experienced enough to train K. So K was mostly on her own. 

I have been trying to teach her the best I can, trying not to get frustrated. K has a hard time paying attention. She didn't pay attention to what she was told when she takes orders, and when shes ringing people out.

One of the other girls was telling her to throw the receipt away, and only keep the credit card slips. That's a HUGE no-no. Boss uses the receipts for keeping the register on track.)

I'm not really retail or a server if you wanna get technical, but I play by my own rules.

So today was my second shift working at the omelet bar in a popular local restaurant. (I know it's not technically retail but what're you gonna do?) Obviously I'm not very experienced, as I started working Omelets last week.

Anyway, while I was flipping one today, a small (roughly quarter-size) chunk of omelet fell out of the pan. This woman, watching me make her husband's omelet, remarks ""new at this, huh?""

I didn't really mind, me being new was probably pretty obvious, so I laughed and Admitted that this was only my second shift. Now, to well-off suburban housewife types, this means ""I'm a piece of shit"".

She took this opportunity to make a remark about everything I did that she perceived to be wrong. The worst was when a piece of onion fellout of the pan I was sauteeing in and she says, ""Maybe you should just stick with washing dishes"". Then later when I was flipping an omelet again she made a big show of stepping far away from the table and saying ""I'm staying well clear of this one"". After I served her the omelet, she says thank you like a decent human being, I say no problem. ""Well, actually, there was a problem, wasn't there?

This whole experience bugged me, especially because I spent 2 years in the dish pit working my ass off waiting for a promotion. Why do people feel the need to treat service staff like assholes. I've been reading this sub for a while now and now I think I'm starting to feel your pain.

My job takes me all over the country working silver service and bars, private booths etc in all kinds of events. 

So the other day I found myself at a football stadium (soccer, for those born on the wrong side of the pond), waiting around in the hospitality staff room. I was agency so I got allocated last. A manager walks in. A thin woman with shiny hair and a pleasant voice. She announces there are retail positions available and table waiting. 

She comes up to me and asks me if I had worked in *posh sounding restaurant* before. I quickly lied and said I had. Anything to avoid working retail, which means selling overpriced cheeseburgers to all and sundry. 

So I arrive at this restaurant, on the top floor of the stadium overlooking to pitch. It's an a la carte kind of joint, which is unusual for events. The crystal glasses on the table tipped me off that this was a special kind of place. 

There is a parade of gleaming-faced men with expensive haircuts and perfectly fitting jackets. This is how CEOs hear an invitation to go to a game after work. For them, I suppose, it means a five-course meal. 

I am waiting on a table of six large men who seem to enjoy double vodka and tonic with lime. They enjoyed a great many. 

And I overhear their conversation:

""Well I've not spoken to him in a few months""
""I mean, it's ok to maybe give a push if she's being stupid""
""I don't think it's right to hit a woman""
""Well you know he has a temper. Maybe she pushed him too far""
""All the same, you just don't hit women!""

I tried my hardest not to look up as I gather their used slim jims onto my tray. They reminded me of the sports team at my high school. 

The aggressive young men who would always gain popularity and power. 

That night I learned that rough young men are able to become extraordinarily wealthy.

First a little background.  I work at a medium sized, family-owned, Italian restaurant.  I've been waiting tables for about 5 years and have spent the past 2 of them at this restaurant.  My boyfriend bar-tends at the same restaurant and happened to be working this shift with me.  I also think that I should mention that I don't get upset easily and am hardly ever rude to customers.  Throughout this entire story I was being nice and friendly to these customers.

I was at work around 4, but the other servers don't get there until 5 (my boyfriend was there early because we drive together).  I had a few tables already when a older couple walked in.  I sat them in my section and got them the drinks they ordered.  Nothing Unusual.  We serve garlic bread with every order so after getting their drinks I went to the kitchen to put some bread in the oven to toast.

After coming out of the kitchen, I see my boyfriend by the host stand talking to a group of about 5 or 6 people.  We only have one table in my section prepared for a group bigger than 4 and it is already taken so I know that we are going to have to pull some tables together.  The group sits in the waiting room and boyfriend comes up to me and we start talking about which tables would be best to pull together.

We were having this conversation on the complete other side of the room from this couple and we were looking at tables near the wall across from the couple so I wasn't really paying attention to them.  I should also mention that it has been less than 5 minutes since I got them their drinks, I know because the bread takes about 5 minutes to toast and it had just finished when I checked it at the end of the story.

So mid conversation this couple stomps past us towards the door all red faced and angry.  We were both completely unaware that anything had been wrong and began to ask them if everything is okay.  They are very exasperated and say that I had been ignoring them.  I wasn't sure what they meant so I told them that I had bread toasting in the oven and I was waiting for it to finish (if I go to take the order first the bread can burn while the customers are talking).  The man says ""That's no excuse!""  At this point I just think this guy is crazy and that I don't need an excuse if I didn't do anything wrong.  I thought maybe they had been trying to flag me down, but if they were, it was not very noticeable.

So my boyfriend goes to bus the table and I grab some menus from the host stand.  When I get to the table, he has already bused it.  He leaves to get silverware and I begin to pull the tables together.  So I'm alone at the table when the lady comes back in and stands by the table like she's looking for something.  I ask if she's missing something and offer to help look.  She says she's missing a bottle of Purell.  So I look on all the chairs and even pull the table out a bit for her so she can look underneath.  We can't find it and she looks at me and says ""You did a REALLY good job of busing the table, huh?""  Keep in mind that at this time not only had I not bused the table personally, I had been very polite to her.  She stomps to the host stand where my boyfriend and her husband are standing and the couple demands to see a manager.

I walk to the back and explain the situation to the owner who just says that people are crazy and walks toward the front.  On the way back my boyfriend stops my manager and I and showed us that he still had the bottle in the bus cart (people leave this kind of stuff all the time and we just throw it out).  We took the bottle to them and they didn't say anything just stomped out of the restaurant with their Purell bottle worth a dollar.

We still laugh sometimes about how mad they got over nothing, it was such an overreaction.

Last night I experienced the worst death stare I have ever encountered in my 8 years of customer service.

I work in a very busy restaurant/bar in a beach city. Our policy is that we do not split checks. The computer system doesn't let us and it is clearly stated in the menu. We can put  certain amounts on different credit cards though. I deal with huffs and puffs and complaints about this on a regular basis so I'm pretty immune to people getting angry about the issue.

However, the other night, my last table was an 8 top; two older couples and their kids. They were seated at two separate tables (one with the adults and the kids at the other table) but were next to each other. When I walked up to the table initially, I said ""Are y'all together?"" and there were noises of confirmation. At the end of the meal when I dropped off the check, one of the women, who was nice enough the entire meal, goes ""I told you we were separate!"" As she says this, she waves her fingers as to indicate the two separate parties. I immediately go into my ""our policy is we don't do separate checks"" spiel. She immediately gets angry. She claims she told me in the beginning but obviously this is not true as I stated earlier in this rant that I asked if they were together when I first approached the table. When I  started to explain that if she gives me her credit card, I can charge a certain amount to it. She cuts me off and demands a **calculator** and a pen, along with breathing so heavily, I thought she was going to hit me. I was so taken aback by how mean she was being to me, that I actually stuttered and backed away from her slowly.

I returned with a calculator and pen and apologized for the miscommunication which she answered by snatching the things from my hands and sighing extremely loud.

I waited a bit and came back to see if they were done/needed any help. When I asked her, she looked up and gave me **The Death Stare**. It was so mean, I once again, backed away slowly with my eyes wide. I have dealt with many unhappy people in my customer service career but I have never ever been given a look like that. When I was telling this story to my coworkers, I couldn't even replicate it because I do not have that much hate inside me. She looked at me like I killed her child and I was just found not guilty.

Anyway, when I finally got the courage to go back to the table, she had added each item up down to the penny. The other couple ended up leaving me 20% but she ended up leaving me $11 on $89 although I'm pretty sure she tried to stiff me and her husband threw down the little cash he had left. I was glad the other people didn't share her feelings and I was left something on what was about a $150 check but I was so shaken up by the ordeal, I had to go smoke a cigarette before I finished my sidework and left.

Now, I usually don't let people bother me and I have definitely had people yell and scream and stiff me and I've just brushed it off. However, this look she gave me just stayed with me.

Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Sorry about the rant but I just needed to get that off my chest. ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1jh887,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1jh887/the_death_stare/,

I would love to read more stories from people who don't know the ins and outs of the industry, and hear why they were upset, or why they tipped so horribly. 

The one thing I really hate about this job, is the lack of closure when we suddenly get an attitude, or after a seemingly perfect encounter, we get the shaft. I often wish I could sit some of my customers down and ask them, ""Ummmm...what the hell was all that about?""

Maybe if there was a place that I could read stories from their point of view, I'd be able to understand better what happened.  I've been in the industry far too long to remember what it was like to be on the other side. 

I read one story once in an unrelated sub, posted by a guy who had taken his father out to dinner, and his dads chicken was undercooked.  He said the server was very apologetic and brought him a new one, but then *had the nerve* to drop off the check, and there were not one, but *two* chicken dinners on the check. He told the server, and she apologized and had them both removed.  He said he tipped her nothing, and would never go back to a place that would charge him twice for their mistake. 

Now, I bet I know what happened from the servers point of view.  She had to re-ring the item to get a new one made, and forgot to get them comped off, or the manager didn't get around to it and she didn't read the check before presenting it.  Sloppy on her part, but still, the guy left the restaurant thinking that the place was knowingly going to charge him for both his replacement meal, and the one they screwed up. 

This kind of insight lets me get a better grasp on customer point of view.  I'd like more of it.

I had been a server for a little over 2 years and am now a manager. In my two years of serving, I never had a dine and dash that was this crazy so I had to share.

A women walked into our family Italian restaurant tonight with 3 grocery bags. Not too bizarre since our restaurant is located in front of a grocery store. She said she was meeting some people so we said she could look around the restaurant to find them. She walked around for a minute and then headed to the restroom. We didn't think anything of it, just that her friends hadn't arrived yet.

When she came out of the restroom, we noticed her grocery bags were gone. We chalked it up to her setting them down and forgetting to pick them back up. She proceeded to sit down at the bar and immediately complain that there was no bartender. Since we are a small restaurant, our servers make salads and put together to-go orders. No biggie. Our hostess got the bartender.

He walked over to her and she began to berate him for not being behind the bar, saying that he wasn't doing his job, and it's not rocket science to serve food. He told her, as calmly as he could, that he was sorry. She asked to speak to the manager, so I walked over,

Since I knew what had already happened, I put on my best Barbie Waitress face and asked her if everything was okay and if I could get her anything. She stared at me blankly and said nothing. I smiled and waited for an answer and she finally said, ""No, I'm fine."" I smiled and walked away.

At this point she went back to the bathroom for a few minutes. She came back out, ordered food and ate her salad (that the bartender made of course). After her salad she went back to the bathroom, this time for 10 minutes.

When she came back, myself and another server went into the bathroom and found the grocery bags. In them were 8 mini bottles of wine, 4 of which were emptied, frozen pizzas and a soda. 

She ate a couple bites of her food and then had the bartender box it up. I asked her how everything was and she gave me this pissed off look and snapped, ""Oh, now you care."" I said, as politely as I could, ""Excuse me?"" Bitchy lady then snapped, ""Never mind I'll tell your owner when I talk to him in the morning."" While we are a small family owned business, our owner is always at random stores and never at the corporate office, so good luck getting a hold of him. I smiled, said okay, and walked away.

A couple minutes later, the bartender walked away and the next thing we know, she's gone. We, of course knew this would happen. The hostess said she snatched her bags and ran out of the front door. We went out after her, but she was loooong gone. I really wished I had the chance to say ""When you call the owner, make sure you tell him the you're the one who didn't pay for her dinner. K thanks!""

I work as a carhop at a 50s type drive in diner (sorry, no skates). I did alright in tips, about average, but thats not my problem. 

I show up for my shift, and the cook instantly starts giving me shit for being late (we were slammed, and I wasn't as late as he thought. He was exaggerating). I don't even clock in, just put my apron on and go, its that kind of busy. I ended up taking a table of Red Hat Ladies, a dozen of them, their own tickets. They were super sweet, and there to celebrate a birthday. They ended up getting free soft serve ice cream which is nice and dandy, but the chocolate is all liquid and unservable. No twist or chocolate; vanilla only.

Well, the cashier/manager/expediter decided to double check first, and low and behold the chocolate sprayed out and completely splattered me. The wall had an outline of me. In a fuss because we're busy, I go out there and inform the ladies that we were unable to serve chocolate (they loved that it was messy, even more so later after I changed my jacket to another of the same kind). 

Not to bad so far, until we slowed down. Waaay down. We get a small rush, 5  cars between two carhops, not bad. I've got my head turned back while I was walking towards the counter to double check on a car when I walked straight into a very large, square steel support beam attached to the balcony. I keep going to the counter, where I proceed to almost pass out from shock. I recovered quickly, then had to go inside to clean the blood. 

I get inside, and because I smashed my nose (and broke the bridge of it), I was unable to speak for a short time due to the shock to my sinus cavity. I go to the bathroom (which I had to pass through the whole kitchen to get to) and took care of the bleeding and got a handle. Holding a paper towel to my face to control the bloody nose and cut from my glasses, I call to the other carhop to watch my cars. She seen the bloody towel and looked shocked, but said sure thing after a very stuffy sounding ""I ran into the pole"". 

THEN the manager notices, and everyone is chuckling at me. First time in four years of business someone did that. I placed a bandaid across the bridge of my nose for the cut from my glasses, and had to keep going once my nose stopped bleeding. 

... Fast forward four hours, the tip of my nose is bruised. 5 more? Raccoon stripe across my eyes and my teeth hurt. Fantastic.

But there is always a set of parents who thinks it's adorable when their kids do this. I had a table like that once. 

Back story: I worked at a small Korean BBQ restaurant where the owners worked in the kitchen with the chef. We had an all you can eat buffet where I brought the food instead of you going to get it.

The whole night, I had my nicest face on, but these parents just watched and laughed as their 3 year old threw noodles, rice, potstickers, &amp; other finger foods on the floor AND other tables. So I asked if they would refrain from giving their son any more food since it was bothering the other customers &amp; (clearly) a waste of food. But, no, they didn't think there was anything wrong. Their son was just ""having fun"". 

So the night goes on and I'm working without any other problems. I go back to see how thus table is doing. By this point the kid had thrown about an entree's worth of food on the floor &amp; they asked for more food. So I went to put another order into the computer to be sent into the kitchen, when my boss (the owner) showed up and said that they had sent up andenough food for these people &amp; wanted to know why they weren't full. I told her that their kid was throwing food everywhere. She told me to tell them that they were cut off because of the kid. 

When I did tell them, they got all worked up and demanded to see the manager. I told them that I could do better and bring the owner. They seemed pretty smug, probably thinking they wouldn't have to pay. But when I brought out my boss, she told them the exact same thing I told them. Their child was making a mess and it was becoming an increasing problem. So they left in a big huff all mad because they thought their son hadn't done anything wrong. 

And even though this was over a year ago, I remember their bill because of the thirty tip they left. Their total had been $42.89. They left $43. For two hours, I had waited on them and their little hellspawn, with my best attitude (I was had been in a good mood earlier that day) and all I got was 11cents? I was furious. From then on I was instantly put in a bad when mood whenever I saw a person arrive with a toddler. (Not saying all kids are like that.

I have recently turned 19 and my GM promoted me to become a severer because I can now legally poor alcohol. I was and still am so excited to become a server, but every shift I've worked has been so shitty.  Tonight I was put with 3 other girls to serve a party of 70 today. These girls are good servers, helping me out and teaching me how to serve a big party.

  So this fucking party shows up. We give them our whole lounge area and take the chairs away from our tall bar tables so it make it easier for people to mingle. A little over 50 people show up, all separate bills. Every single person who came for his party is Persian and we start to notice no one really knows each other. After letting people get settled I go around trying to start tabs and get drink for everyone. Almost no bites.

  No one is ordering anything. Maybe 1/3 of the people order something to drink other then water, mostly juices or pop. I leave everyone to settle for another 10 minutes to give them more time to talk and maybe decide on something. I come back asking if anyone was ready to order food or any more drinks. Most of them say, "" oh no, that alight, *we ate before we came* "" . **UM WHAT?** You ate before you came to a sit down restaurant? ALL OF MY RAGE. 

Long story short, we barely sold anything to these people. It was some sort of meet and greet and everyone just walked around with their waters and pop and talked and asked for more water and bottomless pop, or they just sipped on their one alcoholic beverage all night. They stayed for almost 5 hours, buying barley anything. I sold 1 meal and maybe 4 apps. We had prepared for a huge party and where completely over staffed. The kitchen had more then double the people scheduled because we thought everyone was going to order food. We lost on labour with how many people we scheduled. 

  They treated the resteraunt as some place to all meet up after dinner to socialize while they sipped pop and juice. I'm so frustrated over these people, UUGGHHH. End rant.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1j36gq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1j36gq/im_so_frustrated/,
1372836383.0,23,self.TalesFromYourServer,1hjz2r,Worst experience of my life,42,19,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hjz2r/worst_experience_of_my_life/,"I'm a server at a different restaurant, but I am still SO TICKED from this experience, I hope it's okay that I share it here. 

Not only was this the worst experience I've ever had at Dennys, but this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant-ever.

We got there at around 11 at night, and there was a bit of a wait. No problem, we put in our name, party of four, and waited. Standing room only since there was a group of like, 15 before us. Still not a problem. 
Isaac the host sat us rather quickly, after the party of 15, and in the corner booth. He then sat 3 more tables after us. (Relevant later.)
20 minutes in, and Isaac stops back. ""Has your waiter come by?"" Nope. Isaac is frustrated and tells us he'll get our server. Okay. A few minutes later Isaac comes back with our Server. ""What can I get you to drink?"" We order drinks along with our food because its been about 30-35 minutes at this point, and we're well and decided. 3 milkshakes, a water and a cherry coke. 

Oh my goodness. The three other tables that were sat after us weren't receiving any attention either. Jeremy, we figured out his name after Isaac told the well-dressed couple in the booth behind us, was running behind. Yeah, clearly. The other waitress (who was taking the table of 15,) had to pick up his tables. But not ours. At least 45 minutes into our time of BEING SAT, we still hasn't gotten our drinks. He finally rushes out with our shakes, ""Sorry guys, the other machine was broken and I had to make all of these,"" a diet coke and no water. 
Our food is no where on the way. He tells us it'll be right out though. It shouldn't take an HOUR and a half for our food to come out. The table of 15 was done before we got our food. The other three tables were offered apologies and they were quickly picked up by other much more capable and competent servers. 

My boyfriends food came out, (fish and chips,) and my boyfriend pointed out he wanted a refill. Jeremy tried to rush off, but he was reminded of the original request. Cherry coke, not diet coke. They have one of those, 100+ selection machines I guess and they have like, cherry coke, diet, vanilla, orange and raspberry. Somehow Jeremy brought back raspberry coke. Also not cherry. Wtf? He left and came back. This was the most times I'd seen him in under a minute and he messed up the simplest of requests. My boyfriend knew there was no hope so he just drank it. 
Next out were two burgers. I had ordered a salad, no chicken, and an English muffin instead of the dinner bread it came with. I saw somewhere that you can substitute it for like fruit or something else low calorie. I figured a bread-to-bread trade would be much easier. Nope. Salad came out LAST, he had to double check the dressing I wanted, which was ""whatever it comes with,"" and surprise! No bread at all. Honestly. NO chicken, lettuce, cranberries and pecans. Salad dressing in a side bowl and this took over an hour and a half?? We left Denny's at 1:30ish. 
Fucking ridiculous. Over 2 hours for 2 burgers, a salad, fish and chips, 3 shakes and a CHERRY coke. Our friend finally got his water but had to ask twice. 

The party of 15 was LONG gone. As well as the three tables that were sat after us. I told my boyfriend if he left any sort of tip, I'd be so disappointed. The other couple that was with us joked about leaving 50 cents. But they left a dollar. One dollar and our bill was $48 and change. That easily could have been $8. But no. 

I work in a restaurant myself, and maybe I judge service harshly at times, but this doesn't even count as service. Isaac profusely apologized to the well dressed couple. But the 4 young adults? No we were effectively 99% ignored. We got the check faster than we got any of our food we ordered. This is outrageous. 

I just wanted to vent. This Denny's probably won't go out of business because people will keep going- but not me. Ever again. 

As a server, this ticks me off to no end. The other waitresses were clearly upset because this slacker of an excuse of an employee couldn't even pick up the FOUR TABLES he had. I can't believe he still worked there. I have gone to their yelp page and there are so many complaints about this guy. And he was middle aged, late thirties I'd say. There's no reason why he couldn't do his job. 

Anyway. This sub always makes me feel better so I hope you get some enjoyment from my suffering.

This occurred last year while I worked at a small café. 
	
There are many things I would love to say about Serena, but since this post is titled “If You’re Not the Boss, Don’t Act Like You Are,” I will keep what I have to say somewhat brief (at least, within the boundaries of the section title; whatever else I have to say on her will be in other appropriate posts). 
	
Serena (let's call her) and I started working at the café around the same time. Actually, I’d been there a week longer than she had. She seemed nice enough at first. But as time went on, I noticed Serena getting buddy-buddy with another employee (I’ll call her Beth, who was condescending in her own right) who’s been at the café for over five years. I don’t know if Serena thought that, because she’s friends with Beth, that means she can boss me around, but it certainly seemed that way. She would always tell me what to do, would get mad if I don’t do it, would get mad at me if I make a mistake on or with something… Oh, and I should mention that I was the only employee she did this to; she didn’t not boss around any of the other employees, even though I did my job just as well as they did theirs.

Serena would also yell at me for really stupid reasons; honestly, there were a couple occasions where I thought she would slap me. She would also regularly text me outside of work to complain about stuff I’d done that annoyed her.

And then the shit hit the fan when I made a stupid post about something on my facebook wall (at this point, I had forgotten that I’d friended her, but I only did that at the beginning of my time at the café when I thought she seemed like an ok person) and she blew up on me and started cussing me out. She was WAY out of control. Among the other things she said, she had the gall to accuse me of starting up “drama” and “bullshit” when in reality, it would always be her at the café going on and on about the “drama” she was dealing with in her life. 

This occurred, luckily, toward the end of my time at the café and was the catalyst for me leaving. I complained to the manager about her and he stopped scheduling Serena and I to work together, for which I was grateful, but she still found ways to make me miserable. I would practically have panic attacks whenever I knew she would be around. I swear, there was something wrong with Serena. She had this underlying current of anger that I could sense, and she came off (to me, at least) as unstable and power hungry. 

Finally I left and got another job at which I am MUCH happier. I have a few other stories about my time working at this café, too, and I’ll share them in due time (after I write them up, of course).

He had a table of people who were rude and crappy the entire meal. He then proceeds to drop off their check. They then inform him they wanted separate checks. He split the check and delivered two checks. One for around 30 bucks and one for around 55. The person with the 55 dollar check complained about a 99 cent charge on his bill which was slightly arbitrary(they also complained about the high sales tax percentage), so my friend takes the check back and gets the 99 cent charge taken off it. He then accidentally printed the 30 dollar check instead of the ""now 54"" dollar check. Dropped the same check as the others at the table by accident. So they ended up with two identical bills for around 30 bucks each.

Now comes the incredible part... These people who were so picky to notice a little 99 cent charge on their bill and complain about the taxes proceed to pay the exact same amount in cash and take off very quickly.

They leave a dollar each to combine for a total tip of 2 dollars and left the server holding the bag for a 22 dollar loss overall!!!! Thankfully our manager was friendly about the incident and took off two items so the server didn't owe any extra for the rude table.

How are there people out there that are so cheap they will pull this kind of crap? Do they not realize that someone is going to have to pay for this bill?

BAD DAY: My first table of the day consists of 3 club rats pre-gaming for their night out. One of them order double Patron Citronge on the rocks. No big deal. Bring her the drink and everything is cool.

My next table is sat. I great them and am immediately yelled at by this old lady for not having children's salsa. SALSA IS FREEE. Also, where have you ever gone to eat that has special free things? She starts yelling at me with the typical ""how dumb do you have to be to work here?"" nonsense as if the choice of free salsa is up to me. I get my manager to calm the situation and in the mean time check on the club rats.

CLUB RAT AIN'T HAPPY: I come back and ask ""How is everything?"" Lady with Patron drink replies ""Um, I ordered a double Patron Citronge on the rocks. I didn't ask for ice"" to which I reply ""Ma'am rocks means ice"". She then proceeds to tell me that I have no idea what I am talking about and that ""rocks"" means the type of glass and demands that her drink be made the proper way and be paid for by the restaurant. 

I get the manager to put out the second fire which ends with her getting her drink paid for and I receive a $1 tip with advice on the receipt for me to learn how to be a ""real"" server.

The lady with salsa issues left me no tip and a note that said that tips are not for people who don't know how to do their job.

I've learned quite a lot, but I think I have always been pretty good to begin with, most of what I have read confirms what I already knew about manners and restaurant etiquette and the difference between what servers expect from their customers and what they actually experience. I'd like to think I am one of the good ones. But I am not here to brag, I have a question or two:

1) Is it annoying when customers ask to split the check across multiple cards? If that is okay, is it best to write down the distribution on the check when the server comes to pick it up so the instruction is clear?

2) If the server is busy and I have not seen him/her for quite a while when I would like to pay, what is the best way to get his/her attention? I'm not going to come looking for you and interrupt you, so I have to wait until you come to me. Is it okay to ask another employee for help with this if I have been waiting for a prolonged time? (rare, but it happens)

And one comment: Ask me if I need change when leaving cash and you will have destroyed most if not all goodwill I have hopefully (and I like to think usually) established over the course of my meal.  I tip around 20%, often more, ~~but that question will not only leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, but it will reset the tip to precisely 15%.~~ I would still prefer not being asked by the server if he/she can keep the change, but I now understand the reasoning behind the question and it will no longer bother me.

I'm interested in hearing a server's response. Thanks.  I love you guys.

Mom and I arrived at about 9:15pm and still waiting for my brother. We order 3 drinks and some fried green beans appetizer, asking for 2 of the house radish sauce instead of 1 of each they usually bring.

9:30 my brother shows up, and by this time I've already finished my drink, and asked if waiter could bring another when he brings out the appetizer. At this point he says ""You wanted an appetizer?"" Not a good start, but whatever, bro just got here and hadn't even looked at the menu. So we remind him and forget about it.

Another server brings out the appetizer about 10 minutes later, with both of the sauces, so we ask her if we can sub the one and she happily obliges and brings 2 infact, one for each of us.

We eat our appetizer, and I manage to catch eye contact with our server who remembers I ordered a drink with that. When he brings tre drink he takes our order also. 

About 15 - 20 minutes go by, and server comes to table to ""clarify"" our order. It should be noted that he never wrote anything down while taking the order. So he confirms order and I would assume thats when our food finally started getting cooked. Another 20 minutes, and he brings out bros food. Just his. Another 10 minutes and he brings moms and a side if rice that was with my meal. 5 more minutes of watching my family eat while I look at my rice and he brings out my tilapia. No standard vegetable that comes with it, just a plate with a piece of tilapia on it. I looked at him and just kind of face palmed at this point. He asked ""does out look ok?"" I reminded him it came with a vegetable trying to hold onto any patients I had left at this point. So he asked if I wanted him to just take it back and bring it out together, and I said yes please!

At this point, bro realizes I'm losing my patience and tells me to come outside and smoke with him. I can see almost immediate the server returned with the food and its making broad gestures toward my mom. I later realized he was telling her how jammed up the kitchen was tonight... Really??

So I start to eat the food, and it sucked! It want soft and flakey like tilapia, it was dry and chewy like crappy chicken, which I told him when he asked -politely mind you. He offers to comp the tilapia.

For whatever reason, mom still wants dessert. So we order 3 deserts and they bring then out with only 2 spoons. I knew its not a big deal, but just another straw on the camels back.

The bill would have came to about $35.  I was thinking, do I have to tip this person who comes out?  I know they may be a server, but they are in no way doing the same amount of work for me if I came in and ate. 

Also, so many people have tip jars now.  The barrista at the coffee shop, the guy at the takeout pizza counter, the person at the Chinese restaurant. All most of these people do is simply take your money and maybe pack your order (except the barrista).

Does that ever upset servers?  I understand servers get tips because it is part of their income.  They take you order, make sure it is correct, refill your water, clear your plates, check on and give you anything you need.  That is a lot of work-that they don't make minimum wage for.  

These other people make at least minimum wage, even more a lot of times.  Why should they be tipped like servers, when they aren't in the same situation as a server?

I recently asked about tipping at a buffet. It seems like the servers there want at least 15%, too.  I once went out with my son and only had enough to make about a 14% tip at a buffet (thought I had more cash on me than I did).  The next time I came in, it seemed like the server I had copped an attitude.

My restaurant offered a brunch service which was worrisome as (1) we never have done such a service before and (2) there was a lot of reservations. I suspected, going into Sunday, that we'd be faced with long waits and large parties camping out. 

Luckily none of that really happened. The worst thing that inconvenienced customers was a painfully long wait for their personal omelettes. ""Sir, my omelette is taking *forever*!"" Hmm, perhaps the kitchen is backed up feeding the other 100 people in here, but I guess you could just eat any of the 13+ buffet options while you wait in the meanwhile! All, quite delicious, btw. 

My personal beef was that I was plagued with a barren section. I had the fewest covers of the six servers that were working that day. I think it had something to do with seating arrangements and the hostess' error. I raked in ~$1,000 of sales while my fellow server banked over $1,800. Any day I make over $60.00 in tips is a day you'll never hear me bitch so it was a fine way to spend my morning.

Here's where the real ""tale"" kicks in. Since I have an indomitable work ethic, I stayed on to work a double. Luckily, evening service was not buffet and less hectic. It felt similar to any other Sunday night. A little 8 pm the manager asks me and the other remaining server if who wants to take on the party of 9 that's about to come in. Without thinking I volunteer. 

The manager knows these people from before. It's families, just mothers and their children. The manager airs his condolences as he knows they can be quite the pain-in-the-ass. When they finally are corralled in their seats I take a stab at asking for their drink order. Naturally, deciding what to drink is a confusing question. I start hearing entree orders, drinks, appetizers, people changing their minds, and it's all completely out of turn. 

""I'll have steak.""

""Diet coke, then the chowder, and then the hamburger.""

""I'll have an iced tea.""

""Oooh, I forgot, I wanted a sprite.""

""Sorry, changed my mind, can I get the fish and chips instead?""

""You know what, I'll have the soup too... and a ginger ale.""

It's nicely capped off with, ""oh, and can we have separate checks?""


One time got three bingos (used all 7 tiles in a word) when playing Words With Friends, but when I didn't fuck up this order **at all**,  I was much more impressed with myself. 

The rest of the service went smoothly. The only other point of interest was that the little boys from each family was asking the bartender for quarters so they could play the arcade games. The bartender was tapped out. You'd think if you had coin-operated games you would have some way of readily supplying quarters. Nope. But I'm Mr. Alway Be Prepared Boy Scout. The kid's mother asks me for some. I don't have any one me, but I say there's maybe some in my car. At her request, I dip out to get $3.00 in quarters and a dollar coin. She is very pleased. 

Moment of truth comes when they are ready to receive the check. Being that they meet the ""8 or more"" requirement, I could tack on the forced 18% gratuity. Considering what the manager said about them and how I was burned by a european earlier in the day, I was quite tempted but decided to roll the dice. The one mother asked for the check by saying, ""we're ready for the check, oh actually, *he* is ready."" Gesturing to her teenage son. 

So I divided up check and handed one bill to the teenaged black kid and the other to the hispanic mother and hoped for the best. The kid gave me about a 10% tip and mother gave me about 23% (on a significantly larger bill) and a nice little note. In the end, I can't say that I'm too annoyed. That kid wasn't rolling in cash, so treating his family to a nice mother's day meal was probably a lot of money to him. 

I got a nice note and the satisfaction that I didn't run some teenager's savings dry, and walked out with much more than $60 in my pocket. Best 12.5 hour shift to date.

I think ours is the 2nd largest in the country or something like that, so we have an outrageous number of drunken fools who stumble around doing stupid stupid things all goddamn day.  I'm sure a few of you know what I mean.

I thought for sure my restaurant--I mean, it IS a vodka bar, but it's a sushi and burger place with a small measure of extra class--would be safe from drunken debauchery.  No, assholes seem to find their way into every restaurant and pub on this fine day of drinking, and my job was no exception.  I have two quick anecdotes:

1) One of my coworkers had the pleasure of taking on the first drunken morons of the evening.  They ordered two vodka presses.  Since this isn't the most common term for such a simple drink, he asked, ""I'm sorry, I actually don't know what that is.""  Doucheous Malfoy responded by mashing his palms together over and over, saying, ""Press!  Press!  The fucking bartender will know what I mean.""  No need to be a massive dickwad over vodka + club soda + sprite, but he was anyway.

From there on out, their bill reached $80.  Once the check was brought, the group of morons waited til an opportune moment and *fucking booked it out the door*.  They were unlucky, though, because their server was right behind them.  He took off running after them (because they were sprinting down the street).  He scared them into coming back (""Hey you!  You're coming with me.  NOW."") and they paid their bill...with a measly $8 tip tacked on.  Bam.

2)  My experience wasn't nearly as exciting.  I had a family of 5 sit in my section with one of the members looking a little unwell.  The rest of the group laughed it off, ""It's his birthday!  We've already been drinking!  Can we get two Bud Light Limes with glasses of ice?""  Not a moment later, the green-gilled gentleman shoved himself back from the table...and vomited.

Everywhere.  All over the fucking ground.  In the middle of dinner rush with my section totally full.

""Hey!  Can you get him a bucket or something?!""

Are you fucking kidding me?  Two seconds later I'm handing Puke McGee's father a to-go bag.  ""Oh, uh...cancel our drinks.  We're gonna go, I guess.""  Yeah, good thing I didn't even ring them in.  Get this fucking guy out of here.

My busser got a $15 tip last night.  Here's to you, Kurt.

It's $8.95 for adults, which for the quality of food we put out, is a steal.  We almost always have a big crowd of business-people and the elderly for the buffet every day.

A couple days ago though, a couple in their mid-40's came in, and before I could even ask how they were doing, they interrupted me (HUGE pet peeve), and told me:

""We had bariatric surgery a few months ago, and we can only eat a few ounces at a time, can we pay the kid's price?  Our doctor gave us [this](http://images1.friendseat.com/2012/11/WLS-Weight-Loss-Surgery-Card.jpg).""

I work with the owner for lunch shifts, and she said they absolutely could not be charged children's prices, then when the table asked to split the buffet (even cheaper), I had to tell them they couldn't do that either and could pay full price for the buffet or I offered some of our smaller, cheaper portion menu items that they could pack and take home and the end, unlike the buffet.

They didn't take kindly to my suggestions, got the buffet anyways, paid their bill of $19.53, and [stiffed me on the tip](http://i.qkme.me/3ukvcm.jpg).

Tonight I was closing dining room, something I had never done despite having worked there for over a year(I always work drive through or bakery...never dining room...never) so I naturally had no idea what I was doing, instead of being legitimately prepped for it I was given a half assed list of what needs to be done by the end of the night. (I love my managers to no end, but sometimes...grrrrr, she later apologized though.)

30 min before close the store is dead, with a little help I got almost all of dish knocked out before close (a rarity) and had been working on getting anything I could possibly do pre-close waiting for the clock to strike 9. 

8:45 and all is quiet.

8:57 They come for us...3 groups, not too bad. Should be quick in and out. First group all is good, 2 coffees here and gone...even with an apology for being so late. Second group, not so good...2 meals, but they eat quickly and are gone 15 min after close. 3rd group consisted of 2 ladies, one got a small coffee, and the other just wanted water.

10:00 They finally leave.

1364871102.0,21,self.TalesFromYourServer,1bhn39,I couldn't even get mad because I found it so beautifully ironic.,29,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1bhn39/i_couldnt_even_get_mad_because_i_found_it_so/,"New account here!  Hi!

I work in a very busy, very popular New Jersey diner.  You know the kind; sort of looks like a sci-fi space ship from the highway, all basked in it's stainless steel and fluorescent glory.  The kind of place where the terrazzo flooring will leave you dizzy and the service is efficient to the point where it can be misconstrued as brusque.  The place you can order red Jell-O, or lamb ala greco, or a burger at any hour.  

Diners in New Jersey most certainly always sit under a full moon.  They attract the strangest of characters.  At any given hour, there is at least one lonely soul, chewing away at pile of wet sloppy cole slaw, awkwardly making eye contact with other patrons or wait staff, hoping for some conversation.  Here is a little tale about one of those characters.

We'll call her Alice.

Alice comes in almost daily.  She is almost always alone, and she almost always sits at the counter.  I don't know much about her, but I'll venture to guess that she is in her early 50s, never married, and probably has no children.  She often wears a peculiarly stained red polo shirt, plastic barrettes in her hair, which is graying and is often slicked back into a greasy bun.  There is something slightly off about her.  Not ""off"" in the way that people from Ohio or Alaska are slightly ""off"", but off in the way that she probably has some sort of human services visitor who helps her with things such as managing her money, cleaning her residence, so on and so forth.  She might have a slight developmental disability.  She always has an abundance of plastic bags full of who knows what, and she is sweet as pie.

It's not always easy to tell these things through casual observation, so my guesses may be way off, but as much of a regular she is, no one really knows much about her.  One thing we do know: She never, ever, not once in her years of patronage, has ever left a tip.  Not. One. Red. Cent.

Under normal circumstances, this would send most servers into a blinding rage hidden under a Stepford Wife-esque smile.  However, because we're quiet certain that to a certain extent that Alice is slightly retarded in some way, we let it slide.  She's quiet, never complains, isn't demanding, doesn't talk much, and doesn't take up precious table space.  No harm, no foul.  We're not really losing anything by her presence, and to be honest, her presence is kind of endearing.  

As I mentioned, she is almost always alone, but once a month or so she comes in with a few others who I assume are friends or at least loose acquaintances of hers.  They, however, are very obviously developmentally delayed.  When they come in together, they will sit at a table, rack up at 60 dollar bill, and not tip.  They're not fussy or demanding, they're all excessively polite, but it's the principle; they're taking up precious space.  

Recently, she came around and asked the manager to inform the staff that she's collecting donations for ARC, which provides services and does outreachy and educational type stuff for folks with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  She eagerly checked to see if any of us wanted to donate, and was slightly disappointed when she found that no, no one was interested in donating.  One day, while ringing her up, the manager said to her ""Well, Alice, you know, the servers really do enjoy giving, but it would probably be more enticing to them if you gave to them now and again.  Would you like to leave Melissa (name changed) a tip today?""  

[Alice winced her face in thoughtful contemplation.](http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/determined-questioning-pondering-l.png)  There were audible gasps as we thought FINALLY, Alice might leave a tip!  Her lips parted, and she squeaked out a ""No"" as she gently shook her head.  We all sighed in defeat as we watched her scrawl her signature on the credit card slip, shaking our heads while simultaneously chuckling to ourselves.  We exchanged our usual pleasantries as she grasped her myriad of plastic bags full of who knows what, wished her a good night, with assurance that regardless of her status as a habitual non-tipper, we'll still see her tomorrow.

Background: I am a Shift Manager at a chain fast-casual type restaurant. We have an open kitchen and there are several people who are trained in kitchen and front of house, but there are many that are exclusively one or the other. As an SM, I run shifts and cover for those that can't be filled by others. 

Here's my concern;
My GM will make the schedule for the next week around a week in advance. Most times, she screws it up (leaving us with only 1 person to open when we need 3, not scheduling an opening person who has a key to get in, not scheduling enough closers). That's fine, since I expect to have to work more than what my schedule says and can come in. 

What really gets me and I am concerned about is that after the schedule has been posted she will fix things by writing in shifts on people's schedules but never tells them. She just expects them to look at the schedule and show up. It would be one thing if she asked person A to come in and then wrote it on the schedule, but many times I am left wondering if write-ins will show up or even know they are supposed to work. 

She did this to my sorority sister and then wrote her up for a no-call no-show. When I asked her about it, she had no idea she was supposed to work (she had looked at the schedule before the changes were made) and never received a phone call asking or telling her to come into work

I'm getting fed up. Is this legal?

tl;dr- my GM changes the schedule without telling anyone and gets mad when those folks don't show up for their shifts. Not sure if this is legal. Nothing in the handbook really says anything about it. ",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1kidph,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1kidph/question_about_schedules/,

I started of as a food runner. I already know most of the menu. I do need to learn the ingredients, food prep, drinks, and other menu related stuff. I have a good grasp on a lot of the side work that the servers do, since I sometimes help some of them with it. I have a little experience with food preparation and dish washing. I've also worked a catering event for them. I've bussed tables a couple times, when one of the kitchen managers asked me to cover for one of the bussers. Recently they trained me on hosting, which I still have a little trouble when it gets too busy.  
l get along great with the line cooks, dish washers, and kitchen managers. On good terms with most of the servers and hosts. Heck some of them are the ones that are telling to ask for a serving position. Have never gotten in trouble with any of the manager. I dare say, some of them might even like me. I'm not buddy buddy with people, but at the very least I'm not mean or anything to them. I just go in, do my work as best as I can, occasionally talk with some of the coworkers, and go home.  
The one problem I have is that I'm not exactly the most social person. I don't think this might be too uncommon based on some of the servers I've had in the past. I have a hard time showing/expressing emotions. Smiling itself is a lot of work for me. I often get told I look like I'm angry or something. Which does kind of hurt a little. But I have been working on this. This actually helped me when I worked/(kinda)managed a small store before working here. Most of the customers liked that I knew when they wanted to be left alone or just didn't feel like talking. And the customers that did want to chitchat about whatever, I just went with the flow. I didn't suck at making regulars, is what I'm trying to say. Other than that I just did my job, trying to please them as best I could. The whole unsocial thing also made me very calm and collected, so I had no trouble dealing with the unpleasant customers. Which I know might happen a lot while serving. It also makes me have a hard time pushing/selling things to customers.  
The thing is I don't know how to go about asking. Recently we lost a couple servers, and more are going back to school, so they are not gonna be as available. While I'm open to work any shift. I don't care if I work doubles 6-7 days a week, I welcome it. I love working. As long as I get a day off every now and then, I'm good. Also some of the host and runners have been asking to serve. How can I make my case to make them let me serve, out of all of them?  
While I want this for the money, I also want to be able to please my customers/guest as best I can and make them want to come back.

This last Sunday I served a party of 5 guys celebrating their friend's 21st birthday.  They rang up a steep tab on food and drinks.  $580 between the 5 of them.  They were a chill bunch of guys to work with, but by the end were pretty drunk, and being a young crowd around my age, I started to panic that I was going to get screwed on the tip.  
Sure enough, I was left with $50 on a $580 bill.  That's less than 10% which is cringe worthy.  Needless to say I was pretty bummed, but chocked it up to ""You win some, you lose some.""

Low and behold, two days later I come into work and my manager gives me this.  Says some guy came back and asked to have this given to me since he later realized they under tipped their server.  I was floored.  Never would have expected this to happen, but as a server dealing with a whole range of customers, this really helps restore some faith in humanity.

So to those Stanford guys, I say thank you, and if the chance ever arises, I would love to take that shot with you all.

Quite a bit of ranting but also asking for advice as to what to do with inappropriate coworkers and managers.**

I started at my golf course/country club workplace a year ago, first starting in a different department and quickly extending my role into the restaurant as a hostess and busser. I found the set days and bonding with other staff pretty cool, up until many months in when I realized that my position really isn't going anywhere and I'm basically just the servers (and kitchen staff's) bitch. In multiple senses.

**First way:** Due to my nice and please-everyone-first nature, this was quickly discovered and taken advantage of, and consequently taken for granted, too. I'm literally their bitch.

**Second way:** As a representative of my workplace, I'm consulted by many of my coworkers for reference into reservations, regular customers coming in, and so forth.. But also any other unrelated and personal topics about in-depth analyses into my life, relationships, school, etc.. and way too many personal confessions into their lives. This also brings on a lot of misinterpretation of my replies (as I'm too nice and I don't want to be disrespectful and not pretend to care or listen) and I find that 80% of the male staff have a thing for me.

**More details:** Every time I walk into my workplace, I literally get the gut feeling telling me to turn around and run out. Sounds dramatic, right? Well, on a daily basis when I'm at work (and thankfully it's not actually daily - I go to school so I only have about 2-3 shifts a week) I get harassed by my bosses and the all-male kitchen staff, constantly hear rants upon rants from the servers and additional hostesses (on our busy buffet days), and generally am forced/have taken upon myself to take on many more job duties than I get paid for. 

Since all the servers think that their lives are horrible and this job is expendable to them (totally not, when their upwards 30 to 50 years old and still haven't managed to get another job after staying at this workplace for ~3 years), I must hear their sob stories every time I work and their increasingly blunt, loud and rude comments they make on our management, their life troubles, 'bad' customers, and so forth. It has gotten to the point where I have to cut them off to welcome guests to our restaurant, since they ignore the fact people are walking up to my podium and continue on their ""... and it's just bullshit!"" rant or whatever. 

Not to mention that they are extremely lazy, and I have to do half to three quarters of their jobs since they designate me as their bitch whilst they sip their iced coffees or text on their phones around the corner from customers. It's so frustrating because we all wear the same shirt, so on many occasions customers will think or even continue to think I'm their server, and I get rude looks or remarks since I haven't gotten their pint of Stella or cajun chicken caesar salad yet. 

Last but not least, the kitchen staff. (And other department staff which all have a dick under their pants.) I have had attention in the past and current from outer-source guys, and ever since I 'bloomed into myself' I've had issues at past workplaces with near-harassment from male coworkers who take my friendliness/general respect for people as reciprocating their obvious and not so obvious flirtation. I'm always playfully teased and touched, and it seems like they all want to form a special bond with me that allows them to talk all about their lives and then inquire on mine.. at a too-personal level most times. I have a boyfriend, and 2 or 3 months into me working at this place they finally all came to realization with this. Despite, they make inappropriate comments and just assume I'm not treated fairly by not only my boyfriend (I have never led them to believe this, in any sense) but also the people I surround myself that aren't them, such as saying things like ""You're the full package"", ""You're pretty, and smart"" ""Wanna get married?"" ""When are we going to hangout? C'mon, don't make excuses, it's just going for drinks!"" ""Your hair looks so good down"" ""How are you and your boyfriend?"" ""You're just okay? You should be good, I'll make your day/night(/shift) good!"" and so forth. 

It's very stressful for not only me but my boyfriend too, and it's a topic of discussion that is becoming all too frequent. I know I should grow a backbone and tell the guys to leave me alone, don't talk to me about that, etc., but I respect my coworkers and their personal issues and social stimatisms, and I just hope I can play naive and help them beyond how other coworkers treat them - with little respect/very fake. (I'm studying Psychology, if this explains why I do this a bit better.)

This goes for telling off my lazy servers and additional hostesses too, or my naggy managers who tend to blame me for mistakes I don't even make myself. Have any of you experienced these issues at work? Primarily the male coworker issues? How did you overcome them?

**TL;DR: Coworkers and managers are lazy, inappropriate and essentially make me want to turn around and run away before entering my workplace at a golf course/country club. I've dealt with these indiscretions at past workplaces too, it seems to follow me anywhere I go. Or does it happen with you guys too? What can I do to help these issues reside, or should I just quit?**

- - -

**EDIT:** I've been a server, barista, dishwasher, hostess, busser.. you name it, in the food and beverage service industry. Prior to this job, I was at a coffee shop/cafe for 5 years where I did most of the above jobs, and was affected by the same issues in my current position but to a lesser degree (until the last year before I quit). 

I've also been a receptionist as well as a real estate agent assistant, when I threw in the towel and said screw it to the hospitality industry. Unfortunately, bosses in those industries too had taken things afar and expected extracurricular job requirements that led me to writing a formal report on one of the bosses.. which he found in my email account (after hacking it) and deleted the evidence, then harassed me daily until I quit. 

So yeah, not only the hospitality service has the shitty management or workers. I have been affected - alongside majority of you, in some ways - at every workplace I've been to, and I assume that similar things will happen in the future too. So I'm not so naive, but moreso realistic. 

As far as my current position goes, I plan to leave at the end of summer anyways, as I'm relocating to a different city. For now though, I agree with you all: I **need** to take affirmative action, through means of either ignoring/walking away from coworkers when they are inappropriately talking or complaining, and also not let the management rule over me and harass me too. 

I just hope that the owner of this place actually gives a shit as to what conditions her employees face, and what really happens on a daily functioning basis. I know at my last two workplaces the management would rather turn a blind eye and swim in their ever-expanding money pool than care as to the conditions of random employees and their experiences in the workplace.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1366591082.0,,,True,t3_1csffr,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1csffr/chronicles_of_a_pissed_off_hostessbusser/,

1362128323.0,20,self.TalesFromYourServer,19gda8,A good (And bad) story from tonight. ,28,8,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19gda8/a_good_and_bad_story_from_tonight/,"I want to preface this tale by saying that I have never been happier with my life than I have been the last few months. 

I was recently promoted to management within my company. I poured almost seven years of my life into this company- and I love everything about it. The staff is great, the owners are the best and both of the GM's I've had have been excellent teachers. Getting promoted has been the realization of dreams that I never admitted I had even all throughout my time working in this particular company. 

Just so that you understand the background a little bit more I feel like I have adapted to management really well, but as with any new job, it has its trials. 

I was always a leader within my stores and have always had a lot of drive, but I've also always known that my leadership style needs work. I can be abrupt, abrasive and downright rude sometimes. Recognizing these as faults, especially since I have become a management member, I have tried my best to work on my tone, my patience, and my attitude in general. 

As with any human being though, many times when my emotions run high, I lose sight of the control I work for. 
I can't tell you how hard it is, even though I have built up a fairly thick skin in all my time working in a restaurant (you have to right? They are so cliquey and hard live in with the gossip and all) to hear that I am horrible and rude and mean and all the other names that someone might call anyone who informed the rules. 

It doesn't help that against better judgement I was moved to a store that I was previously a server, trainer, bartender, etc at, so I do not necessarily automatically get the respect that one might expect. 

Anyway, to get to the main story, tonight was a perfect storm of events. Numbers have been not so hot, I had to pick up someone else's work who was on vacation- and I had never done that before, I have been stressing out about being as good as they thought I was in training (which is downright silly, I realize, since now I am doing the real job), I finally just yesterday moved all of my stuff out of my old city and said goodbye, and not 1 but 2 people complained to my GM about me. 

I was crushed. All this hard work I put in, moving, leaving behind friends, my old store, trying my very best every day, working with people who knew me from before and I wish would remember that I am just me and not some super scary manager just because I am mad, and hearing that people hate my guts just did me in. 

It was clear that I was upset and torn to pieces. Out brand new server, who has only known me for a few months total went out of her way and bought me chocolate, flowers, and a red bull just so I could get through the rest of my close shift. :) 

It made me remember that people really do like me for who I am, and strengthened my resolve to be the best person I could be, faults and all. 

So to Melanie, here in this semi private space, I wanted to say thank you. From the very bottom of my heart. I can probably never explain how much your small kindness means to me, and I just want to say thank you. 

I wish I could thank you at work, but I don't want to be accused of favoritism AGAIN :). I hope you see this, and I really do love your face. 

I also wanted you to see your flowers! Here they are.

This is my first job in the restaurant biz. I only worked a 4 hour shift but when I got home I had a headache and I just woke up in the middle of the night sweating. I think it's safe to say I'm a bit overwhelmed with everything I learned, or tried to learn tonight. The computer where you ring in people's orders and get their checks confuses me a bit, even though my trainer did his best to explain it when I was shadowing him tonight. Also as a guy who's not a big drinker, I have no idea which wine is which...they have so many and I really need to study up on all of them. Side work doesn't seem to hard..heard a lot of people don't like doing it (but my trainer said its easy, people just complain a lot, heh.)

Background: 23/F I work at a small local chain café style restaurant. I shall now refer to it as Cluck n Feed (a nickname my roommates father coined). I have been working there for almost two years now and have been recommended to become a new manager for our fifth location that is being rebuilt after a fire. 

Story: About two weeks ago I filed a sexual harassment complaint against two members of the Kitchen staff. I shall call them Micro and Gordo. Micro is short and everyone thinks he’s gay, but seeing as he has been asking me out nonstop and touching me inappropriately (massages, touching the back of my neck, rubbing my arms, etc) I don’t know anymore. Gordo has been touching me the same way. I see nothing wrong with hugs or little touches like on the shoulder or hi5s. But this was crossing the line touching. I’ve told them both to stop touching me over and over but to no avail. It finally got to the point where I had no choice but to talk to my manager. I told him (we shall call him Tweedle Dee) and the GM (Tweedle Dum) at the same time so that they can’t pretend like I didn’t say anything.

In our employee handbook it said that if you report anything like that, your name will be left anonymous. I guess in the new version of the employee handbook that I haven’t seen, they took out that rule and my managers basically told Micro and Gordo “Maikei said this” and “Maikei said that” Great, right? Now they know I said this about them.
I was scheduled to work this past Thursday night and my boss wanted me to close the restaurant by myself with Micro and Gordo working the kitchen. I told Tweedle Dee that I was uncomfortable working by myself with them so he was nice enough to change my shift so that I would work til 830. The one who was supposed to close, had to change his shift with someone who didn’t know how to close leaving me with once again closing by myself.

When I told Tweedle Dee that I didn’t want to do that , his response was to cancel the other guys shift and stay the entire night shift himself. This would be fine if he didn’t stay in the back office the entire time. I’m working up front and it’s a little busy for a Thursday night. I’m taking orders, making/running drinks, and running food. Everytime I go back to the Kitchen they stop talking and just stare at me. Needless to say I’m really uncomfortable. They aren’t giving me food tickets or sides that I ask for. Basically ignoring me.

At one point I have a line and I’m trying to get everything done. There’s food on the line and they are ringing the pick up bell nonstop. I finally have time to grab the food (it’s probably been sitting there for 2 minutes) and they start yelling at me saying I’m bad at my job and that if the foods cold it’s my fault and I have to remake it. I finally snap and tell them to shut up. After that they start throwing the plates of food onto the line. Basically slamming it down being really loud. 

They start calling me stupid, a bitch, an American whore (this is all in Spanish but I know those words). I am so frustrated at this point I just break down and start crying. I lock myself in the bathroom trying to regain my composure. I guess they got Tweedle Dee to finally come to the front and he tells me to go take a ten. I’m in the back storage room trying to get myself together.

I’m hungry, but I’m too scared to order anything (we get a free meal) because they are known to mess with peoples food if they don’t like you. 

For the rest of the night I didn’t talk to them. My manager ran all the food and basically dealt with the kitchen for the rest of the night. 
I could go to HR and complain but the kitchen staff could get away with murder. Complaining once just made things worse and I’m dreading going back to work tomorrow. I don’t know what to do. Should I quit? Should I just stick it out? Advice?

TL;DR: Sexually harassed by kitchen staff. Complained. Now being bullied by kitchen staff. Quit or stay?

Also, wall of text.

I'm a counter server for a ""Italian eatery"" (pizza place) the mainly operates in malls. I've been there for almost a year and a half. I don't like my job, the customers suck but I've always gotten along with my co-workers and management. Recently though, there have been things I've noticed that piss me off quite a bit.

We hired a new shift supervisor about 2 months ago, and ever since then, my GM and the asst manager have been so mean, nit-picky and lazy. When I close with the supervisor, they always leave a list of things we forgot to do closing. I have been closing for the past year, I could do it in my sleep. The things they list are things they have NEVER had me do closing before, and they only do this when I close with the shift supervisor. Nothing is ever clean enough, nothing is ever stocked enough, but I've been doing all of this the same way FOR A GODDAMN YEAR. IF SOMETHING WAS SO WRONG WITH IT, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING BEFORE????

Management has also become very lazy. If they want something done but don't feel like doing it, they make everyone else do. I can't tell you how many times I've come to work and there's no forks and knives stocked on the counter, the counter will be covered in trash and Parmesan cheese, trays stacked a mile high, no napkins, no ice. And I will say to the manager staff on the way in ""Were we busy last hour?"" and they just say ""no this is just from the day"". I don't understand why they can't just wash a few trays or wipe the counter down or stock a few forks just so I don't spend the first hour of my shift trying to get things clean AND serve customers. Once, I came in my station was a mess because no one cleaned anything up or stocked between cashier shifts. The first 10 minutes into my shift, my manager wanted me to clean the huge stack of trays first coz we were almost out, and then out of fucking nowhere, our DM shows up and bitches at me because the counter was dirty and the forks, knives, and bottled drinks weren't stocked and he wrote me up. My manager didn't stand up for me and be like ""hey, I made her clean the trays first, sorry"" and I felt like I was thrown under the bus.

We also don't get raises or promotions. I work with my dad at this job, he's worked there for 25 years and we make the same amount of money per hour, and he's never been offered a promotion. We don't even get little rewards like employee of the month (even though the company sends every store pins and gift cards to give to the EotM EVERY MONTH). My co-workers and I work our asses off, but what's the point if I feel like I have nothing to work toward? I mean, I'm not trying to make a career in mall pizza, but it would be nice if I could get a little reward for my hard work, ya know? I close literally every shift and I don't even get good closing hours, but I don't complain (at least not to them) Like today, I worked 6-9, which is a three-fucking-hour closing shift. To me, that's basically them saying to me, ""Hey, come work less hours than everyone else, and you also need to work harder"" (not sure if that makes sense but ya)

Another thing they do that REALLY pisses me off is that they always leave before the are scheduled to. Hours have been short lately even with school being out, and both managers give themselves about 50 to 60 hours a week while the rest of us get between 6 to 24. And a then they'll leave like 5 hours before they're scheduled to. Most of the people that work there live on their own and can't afford to live on 24 hours a fucking week. Since they want to go home early all the fucking time, why not give the hours they don't want to work to someone else on the schedule? They've also been calling me and the shift supervisor in early and on our days off so they can leave early for no reason and have us close. The shift supervisor and I both only have 2 days off, the managers have three. The lazy asst manager always tries to call me in on Wednesdays, which is the ONLY day that me and my boyfriend both have off and I have told them time and time again that I will not come in on Wednesdays, they don't even really need me, they just want to go home.

I have a couple friends who do the same in Colorado/Michigan. This is an amazing life and I'm so happy to have the ability to do this. 

My summer job is at a great sports bar/restaurant/club and the owners are incredible people who actually listen to any idea I have, they respectfully decline any suggestion they don't see as plausible, but more often than not they utilize my ideas. I've never had a ""shift drink"" before, so maybe I'm used to corporate standards and have been treated so poorly by them that little things you might consider standard are incredible to me, but I don't care. I'm happy. 

If you hate this job, I think you may be doing it in the wrong restaurant. You can do anything you want, if you're willing to hold yourself to a higher standard. If you're having a bad day that shouldn't affect your customers/coworkers. Call in if you really can't get out of the funk.

Me: ""Good evening, (insert pizza places name here) Pizza, how can I help you?""

Girl (said in a tone that reminded me of someone screaming while sucking the helium out of a balloon): ""Do you sell pizza?!""

Me: ""...yes."" Yup. This is going to be fun.

Girl: ""Do you sell gorillas?!""

Me: ""Really? No.""

Girl: ""Will you be my best friend?!""

Me: ""You're either going to order something or you're going to hang up right now and stop tying up my phone lines. How's that?""

1362291013.0,20,self.TalesFromYourServer,19kcvv,Serving is turning me racist.,33,13,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19kcvv/serving_is_turning_me_racist/,"This is more of a question than anything, but I'd like to hear from some black people who eat out: why don't black people usually tip more than 10%? I consistently make at least 25% when I wait tables, except if its black customers. Of course, there is a small subset who tip standard, but the overwhelming majority of black people simply do not tip more than ten, and frequently closer to 8%. Tonight it just so happened in my rotation that almost all of my tables were large parties of African Americans. I don't treat any customer any different from another, and in fact, I'm usually more careful with black customers than with white ones. I was run all over creation with a million requests for something different every single time I would come by, and also people get annoyed when I don't read their mind about what kind of steak sauce they want, or that they wnt it at all. Also, strange beverages that of course happen to be the most irritating to refill. 

Also, we don't have free breadsticks and Alfredo sauce. We are not the Fig Arboretum. Breadsticks come with certain entrees. And it plainly says on the menu with which entrees they come. Also, it plainly states that the side salads do not have cheese on them. However, every single one of these customers were irritable when I didn't provide them with free breadsticks immediately upon being seated., and when I had to charge for Alfredo sauce. And also snarled at me like I was cheating them for not putting cheese on their side salads, which they did not request before I made and brought the salads out. Of course I happily provided cheese for the salads, and breadsticks for free(but charge for the alfredo because I had to) and met every request cheerfully and in a timely manner. I even had one guy compliment my service. Right before he magnanimously tipped me $5 on a $65 dollar check. The next table had ten people wh split the bill 3 ways to avoid the automatic 18% gratuity, obviously. One section tipped me 5 on a 60 dollar total, one guy tipped me a dollar (actually 77 cents) on 30 bucks worth of food and liquor, and the third segment gave me 4 dollars off a 70 dollar total. The next table was a couple with three kids, who tipped me 4 off of 40 dollars. They also complained that the meat on the burgers for their kids wasn't done (it was medium well but they insisted it was undercooked; I did not argue, had them remade and even comped them off the bill). 

So basically, I just don't get it. Is there some cultural thing? Is it just rudeness? None of these people were ""ghetto"" or even financially disadvantaged. I have, as I said, made the rare acquaintance of someone who will tip normally or even very well, but again, the overwhelming majority of black people I've ever waited on were this way. This isn't the first that I've noticed it, but this is the first night I've had when 90% or so of my customers were black so it was very apparent to me. 

I should also note that I'm not a white boy myself, although I'm not black. Other servers say the exact same thing, no matter which state I was living in. 

I don't think that people saying ""I only tip for exceptional service"" is remotely acceptable. We make 2.13 an hour. And I mean, really,it didn't seem like they were trying to insult me, because they very proudly and friendly-like handed me the tip money or charge slip with the adjusted total.

I'm sorry about the rambliness of this post but I'm rather stoned right now. I am just genuinely curious about why this is? It's really infuriating when I bust ass for 6 hours straight and make only 45 bucks for the whole night. If you're going to say something like ""omg you're so racist omg omg omg TUMBLR'D"" please keep it to yourself. I know I'm stereotyping. But it seems to be a truth. On the other hand, I also don't need to hear ""lol niggers suck"" or anything like that. This is an actual question, not an intended circle jerk or battle over semantics and racism. I really just want to know what's up.

I probably have more, but I have since attempted to block many of these memories. ~_~ I wish I had some cool battle scars to show off, but all I got was this stupid case of anxiety.

* Worked for a local place. The head cook was a literal psychopath. Someone dropped a dish once, I would have sworn the guy was going to climb through the line and throttle the server. Screaming, cursing, stomping feet. It got to the point where every time I rang in an order, I'd have a miniature panic attack for the next five minutes, until enough time passed and I could be certain I'd not made a mistake. I think I made it there 3 months before I quit.

* Worked for a chain place. Coworker was usually very nice, but clearly a bit off-kilter, too (more of a ""burn out"" sort of feel to her than any developmental disability). When she got in a mind to clean, it did not matter that it was slow as shit and you were leaning on a counter. She'd hipcheck you to get you to move. Never an ""excuse me"" or anything of the sort. Use your mouth, woman, you're like 40 years old.

* Same chain place as above. A girl who was on a few different sorts of medicines for mental issues came in after having a dosage tweaked or a medicine changed, something like that. She was out of her *mind* -- drooling, taking orders while leaning all over the table, getting the weirdest looks from customers. My manager let this go on for *three and a half hours* on a dead-ass Sunday before he let her go home (and only because I pointed out customers were getting really weirded out by it). I felt so bad for this girl: everyone probably thought she was a drug addict, when it was her legal meds/dosage changing. D:

* Was delivering tray full of deserts to a party. Had another large party. As I'm leaning over the table to set the deserts down, someone from my other party screams, ""EXCUSE ME?"" at me. I jump, startled, and dump the fucking tray all over this table. Kid got coffee on him (thankfully our coffee was never more than lukewarm -- could have been really bad if it was hot), desserts all over floor. Cleaned up and rushed around trying to remake the desserts: couldn't attend to my other party at all (this place had horrible teamwork; couldn't ask anyone for anything). Turns out the other party wanted *napkins,* and the lady who screamed at me had the gall to be pissed I took so long to come back and check on them. Thankfully, the rest of that party treated her like a crazy person for it, so.

* Had this couple: super nice, loved the wine, were going crazy about the service. Food comes out and the woman freaks out because there are mashed potatoes and a baked potato. She ordered mushrooms. I apparently misheard her -- mushrooms, mashed potatoes? I don't have the best hearing to begin with, and loud dining room plus similar-sounding dishes. She said -- ""Why would the kitchen put two starches? WHY? WHO ORDERS TWO STARCHES?"" and was essentially acting like it was The End of the World. Suddenly, super nice couple becomes the most condescending pair of assholes I've ever met. No more niceness, just snarky comments and stony stares. Oookay. She cuts into her chicken and it's rubbery. Offer to get her a new plate? NOPE. Suddenly, even though there's nothing wrong with the husband's meal, he shoves it away from himself and ""can't eat because his wife's meal is ruined."" Comped the meal, they paid for their $40 of wine, I ended up with $1. The food industry: because you deserve to have your pay docked over a mishearing and something completely out of your control!

* Had a family of four. I'm walking past their table with dishes from another table, stacked up to my elbows (seriously) and the woman holds out her plate away from the table and says (with this precise emphasis): ""*Here*. I am *done* with this."" There's no way I can take this plate, yet she's shoving it at me and I have to grab it and scramble back to the kitchen before losing everything. Later, I realize this is the same couple plus daughters (see edit) as the above pair of assholes whose double starch on the woman's meal was The Dining Apocalypse. Fuck you, Goldman family.

* Store closed. It's 12:03. I am counting my cash for the night. People knock at the front door, which is locked. My manager *lets them in* and seats them. I tried to tell her several times over I wasn't taking the goddamn table, we were legitimately closed, etc. She makes me take the table. The people tried to order an appetizer; I threw all of their food in at once and was raging up and down the kitchen. The guests probably heard me, but honestly, whatever. I wasn't even mad at *them*, I was mad at my dumb-as-hell manager who thought it was totally cool to let people in after closing. Did not help that this was on one of those $40, seven-hour-Sundays and I just wanted to go *home*. I think that night when everything was done, I just walked out (was supposed to double check with the manager that all was done). I think she tried to say something to me the next shift and I just blew her off.

* Had a GM who hired his cousins as busboys. Said GM always ate a porterhouse steak right next to the host stand, so as people walked into the store, they'd see the GM sitting there eating. He was eventually fired. His cousins persisted -- until one of them quit, and the other was subsequently fired when a customer viewed him dipping his cleaning rag into a glass of drinking water and using that to clean the table.

* Middle of MOTHER'S DAY RUSH, my GM takes the lid off the trash can and starts picking through it. He finds a few forks stuck to the giant magnet that -- y'know, *stops the forks from being thrown out.* Begins laying into the entire serving team during this massive rush (the wait on Mother's Day was from open to close, for reals). Singles out one server in particular because he was the newest. Said server goes something like, ""I don't need to hear this as much as you need me to stay and keep working."" Didn't shut him up, but at least he left the new guy to his job. Seriously, who stops everyone during that kind of rush to yell about silverware being tossed. It was doubly stupid because none of the forks were even lost, just stuck to the magnet.

* Gave a lady a ""ginger ale"" (sprite with splash of pepsi -- 95% of people can't tell the difference and it was better than waiting 10 minutes for the bartender to fetch real ginger). She said it didn't taste right; I went to fetch real ginger and brought it back. We had glasses with actual glass, there was condensation on the glass. The glass slipped as I'm putting it down on her table. Went on the table, her purse, the seat. She *flips her shit* and starts accusing me of purposefully dumping ginger ale on her because she asked for a replacement. Lady, I wouldn't want to ginger you over something that stupid that was my fault anyway, and besides -- if I wanted to ginger you, I would have gingered you, not the table and your stupid purse. She escalates to the point of ""WHO IS GOING TO DRY CLEAN MY SHIT"" at my manager. At one point, someone had brought her a linen to clean up. She uses it, then sticks her hand out in the aisle and just drops the napkin on the floor. Spends the next 45 minutes glaring daggers at me, stiffs me on the tip, and then proceeds to return to the restaurant on a weekend basis (she may have been a regular before then, IDK) and gave me the nastiest look *every single time* she was there. Okay?

My father plays no role in this arrangement other than to help out occasionally and to receive an extremely small portion of the earnings to amuse himself in playing pool.


**The story:**

Now, the people concerning this story are not the customers but the workers. The workers are, to the best of my knowledge, long term friends and acquaintances of my mother. They're actually very sweet, kind and hardworking women who have been through hardships while raising children. My mother didn't realize this in the beginning, when she asked them to help her out as employees, just how quickly they got along with each other and that they adapted to the busy pace of working in a restaurant (they haven't worked in one for more than a decade or so). Delighted at the strong teamwork between her staff, my mother was lenient on their socializing when they're on the clock. My mother even encouraged us all to each together as a big family during lunchtime when the customer rush was over and yeah, it was pretty much effective team bonding with everyone over the table.

Despite this, my mother have also unknowingly encouraged to gather around and socialize on the clock in the kitchen. These little gatherings were sometimes quick but at most times long. At first, my mother thought it was a good thing to see everyone chatting, keeping updated with each other and whatnot, so she didn't say anything about it. Fast forward two years later, we've been getting complaints from customers about slow service and how it took them such a long time to be seated. We started to lose customers and the customers we've managed to keep were becoming grouchier each visit. My mother at first blamed my brother for the slow service, who in turn blamed me because I was there with him. In the end, my brother got fed up and said to me:

""Derpy_Duckie, it's time we start being passive-aggressive and cover our own asses.""

I didn't understand what he meant at first, but when I realized just how long they (the workers) were taking when socializing in the kitchen, I realized that I can't really rely on them to keep customers. So we made a brother-sister tag-team in serving customers. He seats them, I serve them. More often then not, we've managed to cut the time the workers spent in the kitchen by half and they're being productive once more. 

Until my knees started to hurt.

My mother by this time started cutting hours due to us losing business and I started taking up more responsibilities to ease the burden on my mother. She is also trying to make sure that the workers are socializing at the appropriate times and also at the appropriate place. By now, my mother is fed up with the amount of time they spent chatting away than they are actually working but she doesn't know how to confront them on the issue. To her, to tell one's friend's off is ""losing face"" and it's generally discouraged in the Vietnamese culture (I'm happy for any corrections to this assumption) and she also doesn't want to create any problems within the staff. Even now, they still socialize in the kitchen but they'll quickly (and sometimes halfheartedly) finish whatever task they've been assigned to avoid being told off. I now spend an hour or so after closing time fixing mistakes and doing extra cleaning so that we wont get in trouble with our local council when they're doing random inspections on us.

**TL;DR: Mother hires old friends/acquaintances to work in restaurant, the business quickly becomes a social gathering for middle-aged mothers.**

This is a bit long. ,25,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1a2cnw/i_need_some_career_advice_this_is_a_bit_long/,"I've been in the industry for 14 years including high school and college. I live in a liberal college town with a strong foodie culture and have been working at a small restaurant/cafe for 5 years as a server, shift manager, barista, and occasional host. We don't have a bar, and our most expensive entrees go for about $13. It's a very local/organic/vegetarian-friendly joint with a great reputation, interesting clientele, wonderful coworkers, and I love it. **But I only make $2k month and that is very difficult to live on.** I'm 28 years old now.

Looking for a more lucrative serving gig in our wonderful city landed me a position at a downtown slow food / craft cocktail restaurant. Amazing menu, very creative mixologists on staff, dedication to new recipes and local sourcing, casual fun atmosphere, and clientele of service industry folks, young professionals, and downtown professionals. Earning potential given the location and people I know who have serving gigs around there is about $3.5k-$4k / month. I can tell this will be a FUN and lucrative endeavor. The owner is already looking for a location for a second restaurant so they are definitely doing well. 

So obviously I want to accept this offer. I put in my two weeks notice at my college campus job. The next day my boss tells me he doesn't want to lose me, that my leaving is bad for the restaurant, and he'll make me general evening manager if I'd like, which includes a raise (about an extra $500/month), vacation pay, health insurance, etc and I can be in charge of hiring, scheduling, and have more influence in the general scheme of things. The pay raise is not super great, but I do like working there a lot, would enjoy the responsibility, and ideally (although this hasn't been discussed) would entertain the idea of taking on more of a leadership role / investment in the restaurant and possibly take it over when he retires. If the latter were possible, this would be a very, very nice investment.  Still, short term gains are paltry, and benefits aren't great (my individual health plan is a better deal than what his plan offers).

Still given the immediate pay difference, I feel like I have no choice but to take the new job offer. I'm basically going to lay it out for my old job boss that I'm getting older, I need more financial security and room for rising the ranks. I love my old place and would love to invest my time in it, but it's not financially feasible. If he throws out a crazy offer, I'll consider it.

I feel that the owner should not allow a modification to an order if it is obvious that the customer is trying to rip us off.

In a similar situation we offer juicers that are supposed to provide energy, lower cholesterol etc.  Customers will modify the drink to the point that it becomes a dangerous cocktail.  I flatly refuse to serve it if I know that it is dangerous but what about coworkers that are ignorant that 32oz of beet juice is toxic?

Then we have the customers that must have been dragged here by a SO or friends and is trying to Americanize the food and boil down their meal to plain chicken and rice, then complain that they are paying too much for said plain chicken and rice.

I just couldn't believe what had happened to me about a month or so ago.

I was working the lunch shift at a very busy sports bar in my area, and naturally, im by myself, as I am every lunch.  this couple sits at my bar,  he looks about 30-35 and she is definitely in her late 50's early 60's.  They order some sammiches and a couple beers, and once I see her beer is nearly empty I say ""Can I get you another beer, ma'am?""  

Now, I know every single one of my bar guests names and such, being that its such a touristy place I enjoy it, but I'm such a creature of habit that I forgot to mention her name because I was getting into my peak hour when I get super busy and are just doing circles around the bar. 

She looks at me with this face of disgust, and her boyfriend/son/nephew/husband/WHATEVER says to me, in a disgusted tone as well, ""Ma'am?  does she look like a ma'am?  what the fuck?""  

Obviously, I couldnt believe what I was hearing.  I Half-meaningly apologozied, I wasn't insinuating anything referring to her age, I was just being polite. (Florida or not, I'm in the south and I know how to be courteous) He doesn't see this as a fitting response and begins yelling at me.

I said ""SIR, again, I apologize, I was not doing anything other than simply asking for a refill on her beer.  If you have a problem with the way I've adressed it you can go ahead and speak to my manager.""

""Well, actually *MA'AM*  i have a problem with you and that mouth of yours.""

""Okay sir, well if you have such a problem, here is your bill, and you can kindly sign it and get out of my bar. It doesn't matter to me how many times you call me that, I won't take offence to it like you obviously have because it shows that you have some type of manners.  Too bad it isn't the case in this situation. thanks and have a good day."" and didn't even bother to look back at them again.


Unbelievable.  It became more clear to me the longer that conversation went that they were a couple, and he was showing his insecurity about her age, which is what escalated the argument. 

TL;DR people are fucking neanderthals sometimes.  

EDIT: their bill was 45.67. tip was 0.33.  yeah, those kinds of people.

We're among the top three busiest restaurants in the area, and constantly vying with the home store for #1 in terms of sales in spite of the fact that we're severely understaffed in every single department. 

Tonight I had a table of late 20's guys and gals, seemed pretty chill and easygoing. When their food came out, one of our server trainees took it out and had started passing it out when I got there to take over. He was holding a plate of fajitas, bobbing between two people trying to figure out who got it. I took the plate, said ""just mind your seating order bud. I got it from here"" then checked the ticket to see where it went. 

Here's where it gets tricky: the kitchen had made a 3 flavors fajitas instead of two so he got a free side of chicken. I had rung it in right, so rather than making them wait another twenty minutes for the right food I just gave him the free upgrade and offered to fix it, which he denied. I passed out the rest of the food, and everything seemed fine.

It comes time to close them out, and it's just over $200 and all together. I give it to the guy, having joked with them and thought we'd gotten along great. After they leave and I pick up the recipt, there's a note written to the side:

""Don't be an asshole to people who are trying to help you! The food runner had it right you put in the order wrong!""

Fortunately, he still tipped $30 so it wasn't injury added to insult. Here's the thing though: I'm a trainer where I work. It's literally my job to tell these guys when they screw up and how to do their job better. What's more, I hadn't messed up. The kitchen had. I could have shown him the hot food ticket and proven it. But instead he branded me an asshole.

This was an atypical night for me, as I usually go out to bigger bars with a group of friends. However, I wasn't feeling the socializing so I threw on sweatpants and went to a bar I had never been to before.

Immediately, I could tell that I was a minority there - the majority of customers were in the 40-50 crowd, fairly nicely dressed, and most of them very drunk (this was around 1 am). The bar itself isn't very fancy, and the shot girls are yelling, bartenders are yelling, everyone's having a good time. I plop down at the bar and am greeted with a hostile grimace. I could see it on this girl's face, because I've thought it too - ""oh, great, a little kid. Bet she won't tip for shit."" This notion was solidified when, after ordering a drink that cost $2.10, she chose to give me back my ninety cents in change. I was pretty affronted because I was perfectly friendly, I just didn't fit their clientele. And, as a server for many years, I don't deal in change and would very, very rarely bother counting it out for a customer - much easier just to eat the ten cents. I finished my drink and left her the change. Typically I'd match the cost of my drink, but there was no way this bitch was getting it.

I work at a chain, Italian restaurant famous for its breadsticks (I don't get it) and salad, so it's safe to say I've had my fair share of ups and downs. The location I work at is only about 10 miles from Moore, Oklahoma, where the tornado struck Monday - part of the reason why I've been so busy.

But back to the story though, it was a very satisfying day. I killed it. I worked a straight double (scheduled, not picked-up) and made more than I made during Mother's Day and college graduation, which was the week prior. I was getting guest compliments, big tips and smiles from almost all my tables. For me at least, as long as my guests are polite and leave satisfied, good tips will follow and I really can't complain.

Sundays are my preferred shift anyway since it's not as busy as Friday or Saturday, and I can clean up with the church crowd (don't ask me how, it's a gift); making as much or even more than busier shifts. For the day to go so well was just icing on top of the cake.

This was despite having no tables for two hours since we had to take shelter in the walk-in cooler because the tornado sirens went off. Luckily for us, the small tornado that did touch down landed west of us and we were able to re-open.

i lived in paris for 6 months where i worked in two different restaurants. i have a problem working in other places, and sadly can't perform the same way i do by my moms (which is obvious, such as that i have a lot more motivation for my own family restaurant to succeed than another random one). this causes me to not be able to stay long. i haven't worked longer than 3 months in another restaurant. 

anyway, here is my problem that i could use some advice on. anyway my moms place only has 3.5 years left on the lease. when i'm not there on the floor, things get messy and dirty quickly. sometimes i'll pick up a shift and the first 45 minutes i'll spend cleaning up and restocking random shit (teas, olive oil, organizing the wine racks, etc). it obviously pains me to see this as my mother is in her 50s and can't exactly run the floor and do her own work at the same time. 

the past few months there were some management guys from a 4 * hotel restaurant across the street that would come in after their shift to have a few beers and chill. they would obviously see me run the 18 table floor by myself very efficiently. i won't lie, i run that floor like no other. i could do it with my eyes closed - it's literally my floor. i can easily bust out 40 covers alone during a lunch rush. so these guys come every week, watch me work, do their thing. they joke about stealing me from my moms place to go work for them. they bring in the exec chef and a pm floor manager to watch me work (without even introducing them to my mother and her boyfriend [who's the chef] who were both on the floor. obviously the two original guys knew my mother from coming in so often and being 'neighbors').

so push comes to shove and i was temporarily fired from my moms place (yes, i get fired lol. it's tough to separate the family emotions). i contacted the guys from the hotel as their offer became more serious over the weeks. i talked about what they could offer me if i went with them, to which they replied we can get you in there as a 'server assistant' (busboy/runner) and eventually bump you up as spots become open. they ask me how much i currently make which is ~700 - 1000$/weekly and they say that i could make around 800 with a lot less responsibility and gain the experience and what not. so i'm like cool i guess i could work with that.

so i go, and i do my training and i start. i'm going along with it, thinking about the long run i guess. but then it starts to drag on me. why did i go to another restaurant to basically get demoted and pay my dues again? i won't lie that i have an ego when it comes to this, but then again i'm not some random kid who never carried a plate in his life. i basically grew up in this. and the money is not what he told me it would be. my bills didnt drop in price because my paycheck is lower.

so here's the tl;dr. i'm 21 years old. i have my whole life to climb a corporate ladder. i can't imagine only having 10 days of vacation a year. it pains me to see my moms restaurant not being the best it could be. it's a drag on me at the new spot to just be buing tables. i'm used to doing everything, from greeting to serving, busing, running, resetting, answering the phone, washing dishes when need be. and now i'm so constricted and i don't like it.

as i said, i have a problem holding down jobs and going from where i'm kind of in charge to so low on the food chain. i've paid my dues, and it's a drag to go to work knowing that i can't use my full potential. should i just bounce from the new spot and say thanks for the opportunity, but i can't wait to be promoted to make more money, and the style of service is just not for me? or am i being a little entitled bitch?

",23,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1atybm/food_for_thoughtwages_tip_sharing_and_corporate/,"This is something I've mulled over time and time again.  I am looking for specific input and thoughts regarding the practices of corporate restaurants in the US.  First on the list...Wages.  Now, I understand that servers earn tips, and that these tips certainly allow most of them to earn at least minimum wages.  Fair enough.  However, in many states the set wage is $2.13 per hour.  This hasn't changed since the early 90's, while minimum wage for everybody else has went up at least 7 times in the same time span.  Servers literally do not receive a paycheck whatsoever.  Their $2.13 goes towards taxes, but doesn't come close to covering what they owe and thus, come tax time, many of them owe anywhere from $500 to $2000 in taxes.  On top of that, many of them are forced to ""share"" their tips with the hosts and bartenders every shift.  Which brings me to my next topic...Tip Sharing.  This allows these restaurants to legally pay their hosts and bartenders significantly less per hour, effectively forcing their waitstaff (who make only $2.13 per hour) to pay a portion of the wages of the other FOH employees.  This is profiteering if I've ever seen it.  Completely unethical.  I can understand when a server willingly shares their tips with the staff members who helped them have a successful shift, but to force this upon the waitstaff? Absolutely outrageous. The biggest problem I have with this is simple...these corporate restaurants earn billions of dollars a year.  THEY can pay for their own employees that THEY hire.  It is absurd for the waitstaff is forced to halve the burden of YOUR employees. While the CEO takes home $6 million per year? Something has to change.

1363592634.0,16,self.TalesFromYourServer,1aiic3,Misunderstanding,18,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1aiic3/misunderstanding/,"I previously posted at I worked for my mother at her restaurant. While I don't officially work there anymore (university started), I still help occasionally so that she can save enough money to pay her bills. In addition to me helping out, my brother has also volunteered to help my mother out without pay.

I want to clarify that this particular story is of our (the restaurant staff) fault and we have taken every measure possible to rectify it for the customers involved.

A few months prior to this story, my mother hired a young man (I will refer to him as V) who had just finished his university studies and was in great need of a job to keep himself afloat. He was an international student and his English wasn't great but he knew enough to get by in normal circumstances. He was hired to be my replacement and was tasked in roles that were to alleviate the weight off my brother's shoulders. My evaluation of him was that while he was eager to learn, he was slow and I noted how he struggled to communicate to customers in English. He would make frequent errors in his orders and was prone to misunderstand customer's requests in English. I told my mother that he's best suited in taking orders from customers that speak his native language as that would prevent us from losing business and increase customer satisfaction.


Fast forward a few months when this incident took place. I had just gotten to the restaurant when a very angry woman confronted me.

Woman: I am very unhappy with the service I received today, I want my meals to pay now.

Me (extremely confused): I'm sorry that you were not satisfied, is there anything I can do to fix this?

Woman (in a loud voice): You cannot charge me for an extra two leaves of lettuce! This is not acceptable! You are nothing more but thieves targeting people under the guise of operating a restaurant. I will report you to the council and to the police.

Me: I'm sorry? Can you explain to what happened?

Woman: Forget it. Give me my bill now.


So I gave her the bill and immediately I turned to my co- worker, who we will refer to as T. I asked T what happened, as I was extremely confused at this point. I had no idea what happened prior my arrival and I wanted some context as soon as possible so that I can rectify it. T said she had no idea what happened as she was cleaning up the tables from the mini rush of customers from earlier and that it was V who took that tables order.

I asked V what happened.

Me: What happened? Why are we charging that table for two leaves of lettuce?

V: I thought they ask two plates or lettuce. You mum said charge them for two plates of lettuce.

Me: They asked for two leaves.

V: I know, I say sorry to them but they no want to hear.

The lady and her friends were still in the restaurant, finishing their meals and complaining loudly on how we're scamming them of money and they were now yelling at T, saying that they will never come back. T was upset at this point and no one knew what was going on. I went over to them and I explained to them the situation.

Me: I'm really sorry about this, there was a miscommunication and we are at fault for that. Do you still want extra lettuce for your meal?

Woman's friend: I expected better from this restaurant. You cannot just go around charging people for things that should be free.

Me: It wasn't our intention to charge you, there was a miscommunication and I'm really sorry for that.

Woman's friend: Yeah well it's not enough. What will be enough is if you closed down, that'll save other people from getting ripped off by the likes of you.

Me: Again, I'm really sorry that this has happened. It wasn't our intention to rip you off nor was it our intention to charge you for the lettuce.

Woman's friend: Whatever. (Get's up and leaves)


I will admit that this was the restaurant's fault and my mother didn't know what was happening as she was in the kitchen helping the cooks making the food. Under no circumstances have I ever thought that this was not our fault. I have spoken to V about this and after telling my mother what has happened, he was moved to BOH where he was assigned the job of a kitchen hand. The woman and her friend, while they may have exaggerated their anger, were quite justified in being upset at the thought of being charged for something so trivial as two leaves of lettuce.

like i said before, dont let your racism shine. everyone knows who tips and who doesnt, and who they want in their section. 


im just trying to spread the word, and let people vent. mainly because there wasnt a sub specifically for a server (that i could find in 30 seconds of searching.)

(or: Why I'm Emphatic About the Spurs Being in the Finals)

Let's get one thing straight- I don't sports. I don't play sports and I don't necessarily care for them. If you happen to sports, though, I support you in your endeavor/hobby. Physical activity and/or a love for your team is a healthy respite from reality. Fucking kudos to you!

This is where the almighty Spurs come in.

Tonight was Game 1 against whatever fucking team played the Spurs tonight. I really don't know the opposing team; I think it's Miami. But! I know ""we"" (Spurs, bitches!) won. I know this because I work in a neighborhood bar as a cocktail waitress. I spent 3 hours running my ass off during the game- getting drinks, running food, clearing messes- and then there was a cacophonous roar of excitement followed by every one of my 30 tabs wanting to close out.

I made a bunch of money going from room to room, upstairs and downstairs, inside and out. I made $32 an hour tonight (3 hr game, but 10 hr shift) busting my ass and trying not to drip sweat into anyone's drinks. 

This is why I ""GO, SPURS, GO!"" I want the business, I want the work. And, until I have an honest career, I want you to see me running my ass off to get you what you want so you will motherfucking TIP ME. I sometimes wish someone would videotape what I have done so that, in the future, if a prospective employer wants to know how I perform under pressure, I can just roll the tape and say, ""Do you see??""

It'll all be over when the Finals are done. But, damn, when the Spurs make the Finals, I get to pretend I'll start a savings account. 

SO! Are there any other fellow servers in here who are stoked about the Finals and what it means for them monetarily?

The other thread about threats reminded me of this (it happened last year) and my blood started to boil all over again so I figured I'd share. 

Girlfriend works at a sports bar and sometimes I'll go up to have a few drinks around when she's supposed to get off work. When I got there, she was just waiting on one last table. I grabbed a table on the patio, which was her section, got a drink and lit a cigarette. 

I noticed that her table consisted of two younger guys. They were drinking beers, so they were at least 21. They were decked out in local college gear so I rightfully assumed college students. After that, I started watching whatever was on the TVs outside. 

After awhile, I noticed that my girlfriend was joking with them a lot. This isn't unusual. She's really good at talking to customers to the point that some have ignored previous engagements to just drink and shoot the shit with her for a few more hours. I grinned when I realized the guys were talking to her about computers. My girlfriend had worked for a prominent computer company in the city for years before leaving the corporate world for serving. ""Less politics and never bringing work home is ideal,"" she said. I guess these guys were majoring in some sort of computer field and had started up the conversation. Douche #1 got bored when the topic started going over his head, so he turned to the TVs. 

This is where things start to go downhill. Whenever she would come by to check on their drinks or see if they needed anything at all, douche #2 would strike up the conversation again. I muffled my laughter when I realized he was trying to show off his knowledge. He started arrogantly talking about linux and how companies that use it are stupid and it will never work. At first girlfriend just laughs it off. That's what her company used and it had turned them into a billion dollar company. He keeps on and on, waiting on her to say something, so she finally explains where his logic is off, giggles, and goes off to do some sidework. 

By this point, douche #1 is seething. I get it, he has no idea what is going on in the conversation and that can be annoying but his buddy is the one that keeps bringing it up. My girlfriend makes a point to not mention her old job unless a customer keeps asking. Douche #1 leans over to his buddy to say something. I expect him to say something like ""stop talking about that."" But no, he leans over and says ""Every single time I see her face, I want to slap the shit out of her."" 

I had been looking down at my phone and was about to light a cigarette. I immediately see red. I understand frustration when the server talks too much, or talks about things that you don't get, but that was just too far. I had remembered that one of them had been smoking cigarettes and wondered if I could go over to bum the lighter and burn the asshole in the cheek with the cigarette. But no, that would make everything worse. Instead, I stared at the douche with what I hope was a ""cut that shit out or there will be problems"" look. He looked sheepish and started whispering in an embarrassed manner to his buddy. I was still considering walking up and decking the guy in the face. 

I saw my girlfriend through the door restocking something just inside. Once I stopped shaking in anger, I walked inside and asked her if her store has a policy about kicking out customers that threaten employees. She was confused until I explained what douche #1 said. She smirked for whatever reason, got their bills ready and dropped them off with a loud smack on the table before asking if they needed anything other than the check in an eerily robotic voice. The guys looked from her to me and sheepishly said no before quickly paying and leaving. 

I mentioned it to one of the managers the next day. They had paid with cards so they knew their names. She said if they ever came in again they wouldn't be served, but they've never shown their faces since. 

**TL;DR**: Douches attempt to show up girlfriend about computers and bait her until she disagrees. Douche #1 says he wants to slap the shit out of her when she's walking back inside. I consider burning his face with a cigarette.

I pretended to lunge, to which he mimed undoing his zipper, and said: ""you give me oral, yes?"" I immediately repeatedly yelled no, left the kitchen, and didn't return for two shifts. He thought it was funny, and I was seriously offended, and hurt.  It brought me to tears. I have been hit on, hugged, by many a drunk man, I mean later that shift I literally had an elderly drunk man trying to hug me while staggering off, but I was never brought to tears until that moment following the chef. Since they're polish, their English is limited and infrequent in use; I now wonder how many times they've spoken of that without my knowledge. I told my supervisor, hence my not having to go back for the rest of that shift, or the next one, but beyond that I don't think anything is, or will be done.

Tonight, I worked in one of the smaller rooms in the restaurant and was only responsible for 3-4 tables at a time. I was slammed all night in my section and no one was answering my questions, and I sucked it up because we were so busy. The servers at my restaurant really have a problem with the 'if you kill it, you fill it' principle so I would come to empty ice, empty bread, empty salad and have to refill it myself so I could get shit out to my tables.

After I'm cut, and am doing my sidework, the two girls I was working with in that small room tonight come up to me and tell me, ""We really don't think you're ready to be a server, and it's not your fault that you haven't been properly trained. We just don't think you can handle a busy night like this.""

I really didn't know what to say, and I let the manager know and she said it really wasn't my fault and she'd personally spend a day with me tomorrow to go through the tips and tricks. I just feel like I've been slapped in the face because I'm new?

What's your policy?,19,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hdlg4/taking_the_wrong_credit_card_copy_whats_your/,"I'm just wondering what all of your restaurants' policies are. Last night I had a table walk with all the receipts on a 100.00 bill. We switched to clip board style check presenters and apparently this is very confusing for people because I had 2 tables try to do this, but caught the last one. We wrap the customer copy around their credit card and clip it to the board, leaving the itemized receipt and restaurant copy open to sign and leave. This was supposed to *prevent* people from taking the wrong receipt, but apparently they're just more confused about it.

We cannot do anything about missing receipts, it's basically a stiff. If they just take the restaurant copy and there's an imprint of the signing and tip on the guest copy, and it is clearly legible, that is acceptable and I can get the tip. However, our new policy of wrapping a guest receipt around the card leaves this option impossible.

I ask about you guys because I mentioned the situation to a coworker and she said, ""I can't believe we don't have a policy that allows us to just take a 10 or 15 percent tip."" is this even legal? I would think not, as the intention might have been to not leave a tip and we don't have the right to assign gratuities to people just because. She sounded as though this was a policy in other places, though.

My manager felt super bad about the stiff and gave me a gift card from the office to a restaurant across the way, which made my night. :D Everything turned out better than expected!",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,standard,True,t3_1hdlg4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hdlg4/taking_the_wrong_credit_card_copy_whats_your/,

1376246265.0,11,self.TalesFromYourServer,1k5n1b,Some advice in dealing with a manager?,13,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1k5n1b/some_advice_in_dealing_with_a_manager/,"Just curious how other people would react in this situation, bear with me as it's relatively long to explain what happened. Using a throwaway since I'm not sure if there might be anyone who would recognize this story/me, since it's a fairly large restaurant.

This happened last Thursday.

So at my restaurant we have a thing where once a week we're required to work a 'utility' shift, which is working as either a food runner or as a host. No big deal, I started as a food runner, I don't mind it normally. However, after a year you're supposed to no longer have to do this, and I had been working there for a year and several months. I go in for my utility shift on Thursday morning, hoping to get out of it, thankfully I get lucky and there's actually eight food runners there for that day! We only need six at the max, especially for a Thursday day shift, so I'm figuring I should get sent home. I arrive at ten, our shift manager, (Let's call him Alex), is bringing on most of the runners, hosts, and bussers to begin doing opening duties. I ask him if he thinks he'll need me today, if it might be possible to go home since I technically shouldn't even be there anyway.

I get ignored for the next hour. Eleven o'clock rolls around (When we open) and I'm still sitting by the shift board, waiting to find out what's going on. We have 7 runners on the clock at this point, so I see no need to be there. Alex comes back up to the board and is speaking with a busser nearby, asking if two of them came in. They had not. Alex then goes, ""Well I guess I could use Archblargh there...""

For a bit of background: I've never bussed there, I have no idea of all the duties required of a busser. After being there so long, I have a rough idea, but have never been assigned to bus (Nor is it a utility shift duty). Naturally, I point this out to him, ""Alex, I've never worked as a busser before... There's runners that know how to do it..."" To which he just throws it back in my face with ""Now is a great time to learn!""

He then begins writing my name on the board as being a busser for one of the rooms. I'm pretty upset at this point, especially since we have extra runners, several of whom know how to bus. Even if he had said he just needed me to stay as a runner, I would have been fine with it.

I protest again, he just hands me the card to clock in after saying ""It's your utility, I can use you wherever I need you, I've had to work people in express (Our to go kitchen), as bussers, or wherever else we need people. They've never complained!"" The aforementioned I've seen happen, and it's always been with people who previous worked those before becoming servers, and/or the people complained so that's just clearly untrue. I'm very upset at this point, both at being forced into bussing, and his just ignoring me both about not knowing how to bus, as well as the fact that there are people who know how to that would be much better suited to it. To avoid arguing at this second, I take his card and go clock in, then go back to try to talk some sense into him about how I don't even know what I'm doing or should be doing.

While I'm waiting by the office for him again (He is down in the kitchen talking to someone), a runner, John, comes up and asks me if I'm all right. I explain what happened, and he says he doesn't care, he'll bus if I'd rather run. Alex then comes back up the steps and says to the other runner, ""John, we're actually gonna have to send you home, we've got too many runners."" all while avoiding making eye contact with me.

He then goes to erase John's name from the board, while John and I are just making incredulous faces at each other. I try to mention it to him, ""Alex.... John said he'd be fine with bussing... Do you really need me then? He knows how to do it...""

That didn't go over well. he retorts back with ""Archblargh, are you a manager? Managers decide who go and who stays, and last I checked, you are not a manager."" I've now tipped over from upset to extremely angry. Anyone who knows me will say how hard it is to get me angry, truly angry, and I was absolutely furious at that point. I start arguing with him, pointing out that 1) I'm not even supposed to be here in the first place, 2) I have no idea how to bus, 3) John even said he was willing to bus and would rather stay, 4) John actually knows how to bus in the first place.

He finally just goes, ""Archblargh, we have to talk in the office. John, go upstairs and start bussing."" John looks at me in shock, while I just tell him to go ahead, I'll figure this out. To summarize the rest of it, I end up getting written up for ""refusal to work my shift"" (What?) and I'm currently suspended until I speak with the manager in charge of servers about 'getting my utility taken off, that's not my job to deal with it.' (Despite pointing out that while I understand he has no control over the shift on the schedule, he had full control over this entire situation.)

I'm at a loss as to what to do. I started to go in yesterday to speak with the owner about this incident, ended up not doing so as one of the other servers from shift change warned me that he was in a foul mood.

What do you think I should do? File a complaint with the owner? Suck it up and just speak with my server manager? Shut the hell up entirely, I was in the wrong? I've never felt so disrespected and used as an employee until this incident, at any job I've had, especially as someone who has never once complained to a manager about anything, nor have I ever gotten in trouble for anything. The one time I do? Suspended. I'm still pretty upset about it, and this was now several days ago.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1k5n1b,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1k5n1b/some_advice_in_dealing_with_a_manager/,

An experience I had a at Corral that was Golden.  And not just any Corral, but there test market for the Midwest!

This was the late 80's. I went there after work. so it is about 3:30  I get a baked potato and the buffet. $5 total, so a 20% tip was a Dollar. Now I was a regular customer.  I always filled out the comment card with excellents and would prop it up with the dollar tip. 

Now to the nightmare:

I had been there for over 30 minutes and only seen my waitress when she brought me my baked potato 30 minutes ago.  My soda was empty i needed a clean plate for the buffet and I would like some napkins.

i was tired of waiting for her so I went up the counter and got me some napkins.  Who do I see? My waitress, her boyfriend and the manager hanging out in the hall to the kitchen. They were leaning against the wall and having a great conversation, laughing and carrying on. They did not see me.

The Assistant Manager in Charge of Waitresses (I kid you not, That was the title on her Name-badge), who I went to high school with, saw me. She came over to my table and asked if everything was alright. I told her I would like a clean plate, my soda refilled and some napkins. Oh, and if you see my waitress, have her stop by.

She got me a clean plate, a refill on my soda and napkins.  Then she sent my waitress over.

My waitress asks me if everything is alright? I say it is now that the ASMICOW took care of me.

When I left to pay, the ASMICOW took my payment. I asked her for a pen to fill out the comment card. 

Food: Excellent

Service: Poor

Cleanliness: Excellent

Waitress: Poor


Comment: It would nice if my waitress spent more time helping tables instead of with her boyfriend.


And I threw in the basket with about fifty other comment cards. Now the ASM knew me and knew that was not my normal MO.
She straightened up the cards with mine on top. TWICE

Guess what my ...waitress... did when she got to my table after I left? 

Yep. She looked for her tip. She picked everything up on the table and looked under it for the tip I normally left. She even picked up the salt and pepper shakers.  Her Tip was a talking to from the ASM, She waited for my waitress to get done looking for the nonexistent tip before calling her over. I could see this from outside before I drove away.

The next time i went I had a friend with me. When we left, we had a stack of 7 clean plates, I had a glass and half of soda. my friend had 2 and half and we had a 1/2  inch stack of napkins.  The waitress practically lived at our table.  Needless to say, we left a very nice tip. over 50%!

The missing waitress? Don't know what happened to her but I never saw her again. I heard later she was fired for similar incidents with other customer. So I guess i was just another incident for a bad waitress.",,False,self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,t3_1hpcp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hpcp8/have_you_seen_my_waitress/,

OR How I got the short end of things last night,15,3,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1g1xdl/when_do_you_apply_the_forced_18_gratuity_or_how_i/,"Last night I actually did well for a sunday. My cover count was way above the other servers that night. It was a combination of a few things; new hostess, my tables kept turning, only section with large enough tables for big parties.

Before you start getting too jealous, I did get stuck with a fair amount of precious kiddies that evening. 

But this rant isn't about kids and how they drive me insane (especially in larger groups). I'm here to discuss the forced 18% gratuity and when do you whip it out. 

My story involves a group of 11; four adults and five kids. It appeared to be two families going out to eat together, not celebrating anything in particular. I did my best to keep on top of this table, regardless of the chaos all around me. I wouldn't call that particular service A+, but there was a lot of potential for error that I overcame. If I could imagine their three biggest (and probably only) complaints against me, I'd say 

(1) I couldn't invent a menu item specially for them because the kitchen wouldn't let me

(2) One side dish was ""incorrect"" because the guy couldn't properly read off the menu

(3) ""Missing"" a salad because the kids took the wrong one

All these things can seem like big flaws on my part, and naturally the customers can never meet me half-way on any such blunders. 

The bill comes, looks like it's going to be slip down the middle between the two men. I throw caution to the wind, I get a princely 10% tip. I am not pleased. Especially considering my tip-out, my gains for a check that size is laughable. 

I'm thinking a lot of these two gentleman's decision to flip me 10% had to do with the sticker shock of, ""holy shit this total bill is well over $250."" That's what happens when you kids order entrees. Then I imagine they justified their dickery by going out of their way to focus on the negatives of the evening instead of the positives. All in an attempt to save another $10-$15.

I tend to think that two men splitting a large party is a red-flag. Other red flags are birthday dinners where the guest of honor is not paying. Alternatively, when people fight for the check, that doesn't always equate to high-tips but I think that will rarely dip below 16%. 

Without getting into racial profiling, what are some of your red-flags when it comes to identifying potential low-tippers? Especially in the group setting.",,False,self,t5_2v480,1370882492.0,,standard,True,t3_1g1xdl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1g1xdl/when_do_you_apply_the_forced_18_gratuity_or_how_i/,
