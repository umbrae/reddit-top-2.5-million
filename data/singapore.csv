This is a throwaway account, I just need some counselling and advice from other S'poreans.

A little backstory first: 

I'm an 18-year-old student in Singapore. I live with 3 siblings (youngest:10, oldest:19), my parents, and my paternal grandparents.

Two days ago at school, on Wednesday, I received a threatening SMS from a number I didn't recognize. When I reached home, my house phone had been getting phone calls from unknown numbers and people.

I later found out that my dad had apparently borrowed money from the loan sharks, and he had failed to pay off this week's payment. I waited for him to come home, but... he didn't. The little cad ran away, saying he had ""no face to face you guys anymore"". He left a family of 4 children, his wife, and his **own goddamn parents** to deal with the fallout. He came back in the middle of the night that day, but he left really early in the morning, ignoring me. I left for school, as per normal. When I reached home, my grandma told me that my younger sister (age 10) had sneaked out of the house after my dad. They apparently ran to Johor.

Today, I had more great news waiting for me when I reached home. Around 10AM, when there was nobody at home, my mum had decided to run after my dad. Leaving us alone. I've been told over 10 times that if we don't come up with $350 by tonight, 8PM, they'll come over and break our legs. I'm a student, for fuck's sake. I really don't know what to do. We've tried everything; none of our family members want to help.

We haven't called the police yet, because of two things:

1: We don't know what will happen if we do that. 

2: The police probably won't believe us. A few threatening SMSes, a few missed calls? ""Where're your parents?"" I wouldn't blame them if they thought this was a joke.

Please, if anyone can help, please comment. We just need some advice on what to do now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT**: Thank you, everyone who has replied. You guys have calmed me down a whole lot. I never knew I had so many options. Thank you once again. I really appreciate it.

**EDIT 2**: I really appreciate all your comments. My mother has returned with my sister from Malaysia, and we're going to the police soon.

Will I ever be accepted?,73,15,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/11mcuz/frustratedshould_i_stay_here_will_i_ever_be/,"I'm increasingly getting frustrated living here. I feel like becoming increasingly negative and cynical after listening to all the things people say about foreigners and Indians and Chinese in particular.

The last straw was when recently I was in the car of one of my superiors of the company I work in. And this guy was someone I looked up to. And in front of me he used terms like Permanent Rubbish and Foreign Trash like I was supposed to agree with him. He was complaining like the typical thing you find on facebook and the Asia One forums. Useless foreigners drive up property prices, he even said that we should never have given these foreigners any PR or Citizenship. He said we should be like Saudi Arabia and UAE where we just bring in the workers to do the dirty jobs and send them packing once they've outlived their usefulness. This is a educated, wealthy guy who wears a $10,000 watch and lives in a upper end condo. As someone who is considering making Singapore my permanent home (i.e citizenship), this hurt me.

I'm an ultra liberal, I am all for a united world even a world where there are no countries. Maybe this is due to my liberal California University education, but why is it so hard to find people who think alike, why am I looked down upon even by the educated, why do people use terms like trash and rubbish to describe me.

The other day I made a call to a real estate agent  and he promptly said no Indians allowed. I looked at my Singaporean friend next to me and he said ""well its their apartment, if they don't want to rent an apartment to an Indian its their choice"".

I feel like the racism is too prevalent, I've travelled all over and I've never experience any explicit racism other than Singapore. And if I was ever subjected to racism in the US,UK or Philippines I know I would have 10 locals to back me up. But in Singapore somehow racism is understandable because of the ""situation"".

I want everyone to get along, I want to live in a place where nobody sees my race at all. I lived years in countries where the fact that I was Indian was never brought up, I was just another guy. I feel like getting angrier to, I don't want to become negative living here, I'm an optimist all about world peace, that is my biggest worry, that I become racist too. So help me out r/Singapore, tell me things are improving. Singapore is my dream country, I chose it over countries that even Singaporeans want to emigrate to, tell me I didn't make a mistake. Even if I get citizenship, maybe I will just be a new citizen trash. Or even if they treat me right, I wouldnt want my countrymen to say the things they say about foreigners now.",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_11mcuz,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/11mcuz/frustratedshould_i_stay_here_will_i_ever_be/,

The level of graciousness is appalling. 

From driving on the roads to giving up seats to those more in need. I've seen able-bodied men snatch seats from women, on trains and buses. I've seen people pretending to sleep or not acknowledging their surroundings when there are people more in need of the seats. Everyone knows how drivers are on the roads here so I won't elaborate, but there's one thing I want to highlight, that is - pedestrians having to watch out for cars and sometimes worry that the car won't slow down at zebra crossings! When entering places, some people don't even bother to hold the door open for the next person when they are right behind them. Edit: when on a two way walkway keep to one side and not make people walking in the opposite direction have to squeeze their way through, even when walking up overhead bridges. When on a public bus, not seating on the outer seat when no one is on the inner one. Not standing in front of the bus stop when 10 plus people behind you are trying to look out for their buses.

This problem might have stemmed from school (primary and secondary), where we aim to be the best and not care about who falls along the wayside. It might be what was taught to us since young, by our parents and teachers and actions of older generations. It might have been many other reasons. 

Being gracious can actually brighten a person's day, and I really feel Singaporeans do need brightening up.

Thanks to all those who voted! Voting automatically puts you on my 'get' list. If you didn't vote but would like to have one just PM me to add you to the list. Everyone can get one sticker free. One person one sticker. 

If you would like to have more, we will be selling the stickers at S$2 per piece. And if you really cannot abide by the design and would like to have [another design](http://i.imgur.com/RaiF1mU.jpg) , they are available at S$4 each. Just pm me and let me know which one you want.

Collection will be on this coming Saturday 6th of July at The Central mall, near to Clark Quay MRT station. We will be at the Starbucks from 5pm to tummy rumbly time then eat and then maybe come back again to the Starbucks. If separate collection arrangements need to be made, just PM me and we will arrange another second collection date.

One last shameless plug, we are [Red Comet Graphics Pte Ltd](https://www.facebook.com/redcometgraphics) , please come visit our facebook page and give us a like. We do Posters, Banners, Stickers, digital printing so look us up if you need those things. Thank you!

Edit: Okay for those asking about postage, how about this arrangement, buy 1 sticker get 1 free and we will throw in the postage. So basically you pay $2 and get 2 stickers including postage. Same applies for those who wants an alternate design, $4 for one alternate design sticker plus 1 free sticker of the winning design and postage included. If that is okay with you, just PM me your address and I will reply with payment details (POSB funds transfer). And if that really isn't working out, we can just fall back on the collection meet up, depending on the numbers, we might have to arrange a 2nd collection date for those who can't make it.

Edit edit: Here's the 'Get' List for the self collection. If you don't see your name, just PM or leave a message here. Those of you guys who wants it mailed, I will reply to you to confirm address and payment so your name won't appear on this list. This list is just purely for the self-collection on Saturday. No worries, if you can't make it that day, we will keep your stickers till the next meet up. Speaking of meet up, this Saturday's self collection can be a mini reddit get together! Grab a seat and a cuppa after you get your sticker so you can be mirin at the others showing up to collect.

SAS security was contacted to assist with the search for Tiri in the Woodlands area and his parents have since filed a police report.

At this point in time, no one has seen or heard from Tiri since Friday evening. He was wearing blue Under Armor shorts with white triangular insert, white Nike shoes with bright green laces and black soles, black cap with sports logo, sunglasses, and last night he had on a black hoody. He was carrying a small black drawstring bag.

I'm somewhat finicky when it comes to grammar, and I've noticed some puzzling usage of phrases/words that is consistent among locals.

Examples:

- ""Please revert back to me."" Isn't this redundant? Shouldn't it be ""Please revert to me""?

- ""Do let me know if you have any questions."" Isn't 'do' implied? We might as well say, ""Do go to the market to pick up some groceries"" or, ""Do take your medication after a meal."" 

- [Referring to a future meeting] ""The agenda would be..."" instead of ""The agenda will be..."" since it should be future tense.

- On another note, why do people have a tendency to overhyphenate words? Re-send? Co-ordinator? 

My intention isn't to criticize/criticise, but I was just wondering if these nuances are adapted from British grammar? Or is this what local children learn in school? How much grammar is taught in primary/secondary school? 

I can already predict that this post will be downvoted into oblivion, but I am hoping for a few reasonable answers anyway. :)

I'm back, so here is some more info.

- Meet outside the MRT exit so that we don't bother people in the station. 
- If you can't make it at 530pm sharp, don't worry, most people just drop in whenever they can. 
- If you don't have any ideas for food or drinks just buy some snacks (Chips, something other then Chips, etc) and bring cash to add to the Booze Pool.
- Lastly here is my number (8454-8437) and my name is Daanish, but you can call me Daanish. I won't tell you how it's pronounced because I love hearing people struggle with my name :P

So I'll try to be there around 5pm so if any of you need help with anything call me, maybe.

[/UPDATE]

Hey everyone, the people have spoken, and the next meetup will be at the Botanic Gardens on August 3rd. 

We will start meeting up at the Botanic Gardens MRT station at approximately 530pm. 

It will most likely be like last time where we had a potluck kind of thing and we got alcohol delivered. The only complaints from last time were that we didn't have enough drinks to go around, so we will definitely have to fix that this time around.

If you have any other questions or want other details, just post below.

**Event type:** Potluck, Picnic, Drinking, whatever session (Just chilling, basically)

**Time and place to meet:** Exit from from the Botanic Gardens MRT, head into Botanic Gardens. Doesn't matter which path, just head into Botanic Gardents and it should be the first Pavilion you see. Look at this for reference. http://i.imgur.com/jSRAr6p.jpg

---------------------

Just bring some food. You can cook the food, or simply buy some from a store. If you can't get a dish, then you can get some party snacks like chips and stuff, or drinks.

For people who do want to drink alcohol, bring your own drinks, share a bottle with some friends. More is good. 

Everyone is welcome, just bring something for everyone to enjoy. 

If you coming, you can also indicate so here: http://redditgifts.com/meetups/4th-annual-global-reddit-meet-day/ 

We're not using that for tracking or anything, no idea who made that, but in case the Admins give out a badge for global reddit meet up again and you want one. (because internet badges are important)

You can message me at 92972726, Daniel.

I'll update this post with more details if need be, so stay tuned. 

**edit 6:15pm** so a bunch of people have arrived earlier and occupied our pavilion. This is awkward. Not sure what's the plan

**edit 7:00** Ok a few people are here, pavilion still occupied, so at **7:20** we're gonna change location to another pavilion. Refer to my previous image, it's the pavilion next to the spices,just 1 field over

People do not like to speak with you in public. I now understand that Singaporeans view this as a breach of their privacy? Where I am from, in the US it is quite normal for people to say hi to one another. I thought NYC was anti-social, but wow Singapore wins. Some guy laughed at me when I waved and said hi to him while running outside. I learned that I must respect others and keep to myself.

2. Alcohol is expensive. I really cannot imagine getting drunk too often in Singapore unless someone points me to a cheap place.

3. It seems that Singaporeans are brand and social conscious. Your standing in life and the brands you wear really make a difference while talking to others.

4. A lot of people are quite active and healthy. This has motivated me to get outside more and run. I often see people running or engaging in other physical activity despite the heat.

5. Traffic is really amazing. Very few traffic jams and nothing as bad as the US.

So just a few observations I have made while here. By the way, anyone ever want to meet up and grab lunch so I will have someone new to speak with? I promise that I am a good guy!",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_scghc,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/scghc/what_i_have_learned_in_two_weeks_as_an_american/,

I've gone ahead and reserved 40 seats under the name 'David' on **June 23rd, Saturday, 6pm at Brewerkz** for all of us.

If you're having problems finding the place, you can contact me at *9237 3187*.

If you've never been to Brewerkz, you can find it at the following address:

&gt;Riverside Point

&gt;30 Merchant Rd

&gt;Singapore 058282

The nearest MRT station would be Clarke Quay MRT. Check the maps in the station and get yourself to Riverside Point. If you keep to the side of the building that's against the river, you can't miss Brewerkz. Alternatively, [gothere.sg](http://www.gothere.sg) is your friend.

Just like last time, we'll each be ordering and paying for our own food and drinks as it comes. As Dreamwaltzer said, most food dishes are $20-30 and most beers are $10-15 so plan your ATM trip accordingly.

If you're a chronic lurker who isn't sure we're cool, I assure you that we're all equally awkward and we'll all have a grand ole' time regardless. Join us for delicious food and beers! I'm talking to you, *Sharon from my office.*

As for post-Brewerkz plans, Clarke Quay is just across the river so we can head there where I can throw a glass of gin in someone's face in a drunken haze (up yours, Chris). If you're going to join us at Clarke Quay, I'd recommend coming in trousers so you can get into clubs and what not.

I am currently facing a very big problem. It's a bit of a long story so please bear with me. 

A little bit of background first: My mum and dad has been divorced for many years. At the moment, my 3-room flat home is still under my mum's and dad's name. The Order of Court for the divorce (Court Order) indicates that the flat has to be sold at an open market. My mum and dad say that is not what they agree on with the lawyer. They were uneducated and did not know why/how did the lawyer even wrote that court order. (That is what they tell me) Anyway, I live with my mum and my dad only contacts me. He does gives the family money (Alimony to my mum, even though he gave less than the indicated amount on the court order). My family has been facing financial problems since I was 10-11. I am 24 this year. My younger brother is 20 this year and he is in army at the moment. I am currently finishing my studies this year on September. I study at CGProtege in 3D Modelling in Games and Animation.

Last year, my dad got into an accident. It was his fault, and has to pay the damages to the other party involved. I am not too sure about the details as my dad did not want to tell me much even though I asked him repeatedly

All I know is, they issue a Writ Of Seizure to my house. I know what is that because I already experienced it when i was 15. They come in, paste stickers on whatever items that is of value, and then auction off. Attempts to remove these items are illegal. Now they haven't paste the stickers. Only the letter warning the Writ Of Seizure has been issued. When I was 15, I have nothing at home of value except a refrigerator and a television. So back then, I didn't really care. I just let them take, bought a second hand tv and (where the new fridge came from I forgot, I heard my dad got it from someone, but I can't remember)

Anyway, now, I am going to experience it again. This time, I have many things that I worked hard for to get them. I saved money to built my own computer, and a laptop that my younger brother and me saved up for a year to buy. I am working part time and studying at the same time. I have no receipt or anything at all to prove all these items are mine. The flat is still under my mum's and dad's name and I understand the Court is legally allowed to seize items in my house. If it was a gaming computer, playstation or whatever, I really don't care. Just let them seize and move on with my life. However, I have no extra money to buy a new computer. I need this computer to do my assignment as all of them are digital work (3D modelling) 

Right now, I need some legal advice. I don't know what can the Legal Aid Bureau do, and even so LAB will take time and by then, I do not know whether or not I can still keep my computer for my work. It is my livelihood at the moment. I am making a living from it. 

My situation is at a disadvantage. Firstly, court order has indicate that the house is going to be sold on open market but my parents did not do so because that is not what they wanted. The court order is now being varied (meaning its going to be changed through Legal Aid Bureau) So no matter what I do, this home is still under my dad's name, meaning he has asset in this flat. 

Secondly, the accident was my dad's fault, so the other party is legally allowed to claim compensation from my dad. 

Thirdly, I have nothing to prove anything that is in my flat that is of value, belongs to me. I got no receipt of any of them. 

I hope someone can advice me on what I can do next. All I can think of is, moving all my stuff to another relative place but there is no one who is willing to help us. None of my relatives wants to help us. 

I don't want to sound weak and sobbing, but it has been bothering for a week now and I have come to a point of breaking down. I have no one to talk to. My mum and younger brother does not know this yet. 

I just thought maybe I can try my luck here, someone who is well verse in law or know a lawyer to help or advice me. 

I know this next request might seems outrageous (Sorry...) but if anyone has a place for me to move my stuff temporarily to live in until all this over, I will appreciate it. I don't need a bed or room. Just a small space for my valuable stuff and a electric socket. I can sleep on the floor and willing to fork out certain amount for utilities. If not, it's okay, sorry for such an outrageous request.

I will also post proof to show that I am not making this story up.

Recently I received a job offer from an international company in Singapore. Here is the offer:

basic salary: S$2800, fixed pension fund: S$448

I did some research and my questions are: Is it livable with this salary in Singapore? How is housing in Singapore? Could anyone give me an estimation of living costs in Singapore?

edit: downvotes with no answer, seems like Singaporeans are not really friendly huh?

edit 2: As I mentioned before, I googled a bit about the living costs but it's always good to get information from the people living there.

I am not Australian :) I managed to survive 4 years of uni with a tight budget, doing part-time job and studying at the same time in Australia. So, I think I will do just fine over there too.

I spent quite a bit of time in Aus to look for the job that I am interested in but had no luck. You need to have at least Permanent Residency to land in a graduate program. This time I am fortunate enough to receive this job offer from an international company who is world leader in their fields for the position I have always dreamed about. This is one in a life time opportunity for me. It will be hard as first but I believe with time everything will gets much better.


Thanks everyone who commented. I will keep in mind your advice. And yep, it does feel like an extension of college life :)",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,1345379045.0,,,True,t3_ygmp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ygmp4/i_have_a_job_offer_in_singapore_position_fresh/,

The good guy in me said this guy could actually be hurt, or worse. Worst case scenario hes just a passed out drunk. So I pulled over amd decided to call the police (999). This was the reply ""this is the emergency police hotline. All of our lines are busy. Please hold"". This went on for a good 4-5 minutes, when it changed to ""all of our lines are still busy. Please call us back again later"" and it hung up!

I called again, and in 3 minutes someone finally answered and took my call, saying we'll send officers to investigate. 

Now, being an EMERGENCY POLICE number, there shouldnt be any hold in thr first place. I'm not calling to chit chat and say hello, its definately an emergency and I need the police's help! I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable. What if its a life or death situation, or a robbery in progress or a car is on fire with people inside???

I'm moving to Singapore within the next year and have a few questions about Singaporean men and dating.  

Before I begin I want to emphasize that I don't mean to imply that all Singaporean men are the same/will act the same way- I'm just interested in getting a general idea of what things will be like compared to my experiences with American men. 

-What is the dating scene like? Is it more casual dating (""hanging out"") or do people tend to get into long-term relationships? Is it more common to go out just the 2 of you or in groups?

-What is the attitude toward sex/hooking up? Here, a lot of guys will think you're ""easy"" or a ""slut"" if you sleep with them on the first date or very soon after meeting. What's the attitude in Singapore?

-I'm half white/half Latina. Are men in Singapore generally open to dating other races or is there some sort of taboo that exists?

-Here in the Southern US, many people around my age 21-24 are getting engaged/married as in they are in very serious relationships.  How are guys in this age group in Singapore? Looking for serious relationships or just wanting to hook up?

-Any other words of advice for me? I'm super attracted to Asian men and am beyond excited to move and meet awesome, new people, but I'm so nervous! I'd love to hear any insight you have about dating/men/relationships in Singapore. Again, not trying to encourage stereotyping or the belief that everyone is the same, just wanting to understand the dating/cultural climate from an outsider's perspective.

It's been a while since the previous meetup, so I was thinking of throwing together one. Reddiporeans voted on the facebook page, and generally preferred May. So the question now to you is this: Would you prefer the 12th of May or the 19th of May?

Also, I'm planning for this to be a potluck/picnic thing. Everyone brings food (either show everyone your culinary skills or your good purchasing skills) or drinks. Either a potluck drinkfest as well, or everyone gets together, pools together money and orders via an alcohol delivery service. Possible locations: Labrador park, marina barrage and the botanic gardens. 


---

Your job is simple: 

(A) Which date do you prefer?

(B) Which location do you prefer?

(C) Suggestions?

(D) Alternatives?

(E) Anything else. 

Thank you and have a good day.

But what struck me as most ridiculous was when PM Lee mentioned PAP in a non-PAP constituency wondering (not verbatim) ""why should I be working so hard for people who aren't happy with my work?""

This mirrors SM Goh's comment to that NTU student last year:

&gt;""Why should I be working for people who don’t feel they belong over here?""

Excuse me, but what happened to politicians being there to *serve* citizens? I mean, I know as well as any properly disillusioned adult that all that is just a load of propaganda tripe, but when did they stop even *pretending* they're looking out for anyone but themselves?

If I may use an analogy, if a company makes a product that isn't well-received, that company would be swallowed alive if it blamed its customers for not liking a product they claim (over and over again) is fantastic and great and all that jazz.

The only corporate entity that would survive a situation like that one that has established a monopoly. And our government has most certainly established a monopoly, one that is still behind a smokescreen of false power words such as ""republic"" and ""democratic"". They've bullied, prosecuted, and bankrupted the opposition, and now they claim that we shouldn't choose anyone but the sensationalist demagogues at PAP, who warn of terrible things to come if another party is elected to power.

As if the Singaporean population as a whole is too dim-witted to choose what is best for themselves through a *democratic* election (although that word is really just become a bit of a joke around here).

Meanwhile, as they claim to be fighting for our us, they grow fat on ridiculous salaries and mindboggling pension plans. A pension that awards them 70% of their salary! And let me remind you that our MPs each draw over S$200,000 a year. $S140,000 a year once they retire just seems ridiculous. And don't even get me started on our PM, SM, and MM's S$3.7 million.

And they have the **audacity** to ask why they should work hard for people that aren't happy with their work? I think S$3.7 million in taxpayer money is more than enough incentive to work hard. Who knows, they might even make a half-hearted attempt to actually figure out why people are started to express dissatisfaction at how they're leading the country.

Apologies for being so long winded. That turned out a lot longer and more cathartic than I intended.

**TL;DR Singapore's politicians are imbeciles.**

MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC

On the White Paper on Population

Madam Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the White Paper on Population.

While the report has some compelling arguments for the 6.9m population figure projected, we all know it is based mainly on economic considerations. Had we focused on things like building a cohesive nation with a strong national identity, the outcome would likely be very different.

I feel the time has come for us to find a better balance between economic growth and social cohesion and yes there will have to be tradeoffs of economic growth but I would rather trade some of these for a cohesive, united nation where people feel taken care of at home and are confident of their future. I am not saying we go for low or no growth. Instead I am willing to adjust my growth expectations for a more comfortable life for all Singaporeans. I am confident we will still be able to pursue respectable economic growth when companies and Singaporeans are faced with a situation of tightened labour availability by focusing on improving ourselves through productivity and higher value capabilities. Finland and other small nations have done, we can do it too.

Our past decade of rapid population growth has already created too many problems which need to be solved first before we take the next step. I call on the government to take a breather for five years, solve all the problems created by the past policies of rapid economic and population growth. We can safely say that we have failed to achieve the goal set by the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, of a Swiss standard of living for most Singaporeans, except for the higher income Singaporeans including foreigners who just recently decided to make Singapore their home. So I call for a breather in this quest of growing the population and focus on improving the lives of Singaporeans and achieve that promised Swiss Standard of living for most Singaporeans first before we plan our next growth trajectory.

Taking Care of the Singaporean Core
I have a big issue with the number of PRs and new citizens we are planning to add to our population. I don't see the necessity to be as aggressive when the key consideration of the population growth is the economy. We have already added too many new citizens and PRs and need time for integration and social cohesion to happen. Looking at history, our population grew from around 2.4m in 1980 to 3m in 1990 and then to 4m in 2000, reaching 5.3m last year. Just looking at the resident population alone, we grew the numbers from 2.3m in 1980 to 2.7m in 1990, 3.3m in the year 2000 and then to 3.8m last year. So in the last decade we added more than 1m to the resident population, and the in last 25 years, which is close to 1 generation of Singaporeans, we have added another close to 50% more to our resident population. I believe this must be the fastest rate of population growth in the world and I feel this is just too much for us to comfortably go back and build a national identity and social cohesion which was progressing very well till the 1990s. Adding another 500,000 to 800,000 more PRs and citizens as proposed by the white paper will be disastrous and add to our already difficult infrastructure and social problems.

If it is economic growth we want then let's just adopt the Dubai model of a transient workforce which will give us a lot more flexibility to manage numbers in the longer term. On PRs, today we already have too many of them and they are enjoying full citizen privileges without the citizens' responsibilities. For example;
- Far too many PR boys who skip NS when they turn 18. After enjoying the privileges they have a choice of not doing NS and then leave the country. I believe only around 30% of all PR boys do NS today. Well, our Singapore sons don't have a choice but to do NS, it is an office not to do it.
- PR children study at their International system schools sticking to their home cultures.
- PRs can buy HDB flats from the open market driving prices of HDB flats too high.

So I urge the government to reduce the number of projected new PRs and citizens just to the population replacement levels and be more selective and differentiate their privileges from citizens. I have a few suggestions for the government to consider;

• The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round, reduce fees for Singaporeans not just increase for PRs.

• PR children must be made do national service - it should no longer be a choice and we should make it an offence if they don’t do it. We should not grant PRs to families who don’t commit their sons to National Service.

• HDB - if a PR buys a HDB flat from the open market, charge a levy of say $50k and allow them to sell only to Singaporeans. If the PR takes up citizenship within 5 years, we can refund the levy.

• Children of PRs should be made to study in our national schools so that we increase the chance of integrating them at the next generation.

• On the employment front, it is time we implement a Singaporean first hiring policy like what is done in some developed countries like Canada. Companies should show proof first that they were not able to fill a position with a Singaporean before they are allowed to hire a foreigner.

• Reconsider the dependents policy - I have come across a number of cases where our targeted one child from China brings in 2 parents who then bring 2 parents each as their dependents - Net is that we gain one young one child who we brought in for our future but also inherited 6 older people - making our ageing population issue worse not better.

I feel the differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens.

This brings me to the point of how many Singaporeans are feeling about the presence of such huge numbers of new citizens, PRs and foreigners amongst our midst. First for housing - there is no doubt that the influx of foreigners in Singapore has driven up our property prices. PRs are buying HDB flats from the open market which drives up prices.

Just last week I had a dialogue session with my private estates residents and one of my residents complained that a new citizens recently bought a landed property in this old estate and was building a 3 and a half storey towering house. Well the, new citizen, the owner of the house was also present and when, I spoke with him during the tea session I found out that he was a new citizen formerly from China, just gained his citizenship and bought not 1 but 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru alone. I was surprised and saddened because many Singaporeans cannot afford to do the same, and this new citizen, no matter how he may have made his wealth is able to do so.

Many young Singaporeans I talk to, especially those who have recently graduated and have just entered the workforce feel demoralized because many of the things that they grew up aspiring to have are now beyond their reach. Our aggressive growth strategies, which allowed cheaper foreign workers, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans. I remember when I started work in 1985, my salary was $1900 as an entry level engineer. After a few years I could afford a house and a car. Today, 28 years later, an entry level engineer in Singapore earns $2600, just $700 more than what I earned when I started. The mathematics is very simple, the cost of living did not just go up by 1.3% per annum the last 27 years and even more, the cost of owning a HDB flat is did not just go up by 37% since 1985.

Finally, I am perturbed by the banquet analogy used by Minister Khaw. We are talking about lives of Singaporeans. Our banquet guests come for one night and leave when the function is over. There is no turning back when we grant PR and citizenships. We must be more exact about the numbers we want to add to the Singapore population and not plan on a basis of 'hoping we hit some number"". Because if overdo things and end up with a population of more than 7m, it may be too late to stop the fast moving train of population growth when we fire up all the engines of growing the population. We missed the mark the last 10 years, and are already paying a high price for that mistake.

In my speech in this house in 2008 during the committee of supply debate on the population I urged the government to abandon the ""the instant tree mentality"" in trying to grow the population in response to the declining birth rates. At that time, I did not agree with the rate of growth pursued and we know the consequences and the hardship Singaporeans faced as a result of the rapid growth, Instant trees cannot grow strong roots and can be uprooted in difficult times. I once again urge the government to slow down and plan on reaching their population target over a longer time horizon. I don't think we can live with a 6.9m population in 2030. We may be able to handle it in 2050, no one really knows. Please abandon this 'instant tree"" mentality as we cannot afford to make Singaporeans lives more difficult as a result. I rather we err on the side of caution when it comes to growing our population. We cannot keep paying a high price for planning misjudgements.

In Conclusion, I would like to see us take a breather from re-growing our population again. We have too many problems as a result of the last breath taking population growth rate. As a government we need to rebuild the trust and confidence among Singaporeans that our citizens matter most to us and that we are willing take a break from our relentless drive for growth to solve their problems, make their lives more comfortable, give them a better quality of life and show them that any future growth of population will not create similar social and cost of living problems. At this stage many Singaporeans from all walks of life don't have the confidence that we can handle another steep growth of the population, so let's not push it. I would like all of us, including the government to spend the time creating and environment that gives us confidence in our future and one where our young can see a sense of hope of opportunity and if we fail to instil a sense of hope and opportunity for our future generations, we will not be able to root them here and build a strong national identity and a strong nation. This is what building a strong Singapore core should entail. So let's delay all plans for further population growth for now.",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_17zs3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17zs3x/pap_mp_inderjit_singh_shares_his_objections_to/,

b) The man on the other end has access to your password. This means that a social hack also has chances of succeeding.

I moved to Singapore (from Australia) a few months ago with my girlfriend, and after having done the usual tourist stuff, we're looking for new things to do and see.

We're both 26 years old living in Tiong Bahru. And we both work full-time so we're looking for things to do mostly on weekends: Like cheap local getaways, active things like sports or rockclimbing, or anything not tourist-centric. (my girlfriend is really into design and arts and crafts).

Any suggestions would be great! Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_z7w5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/z7w5n/things_to_do_in_singapore_other_than_eat_and_shop/,

This is a follow up to [this post right here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/so4m6/rsingapore_meetup_gauge_of_interest/) which in case you missed out, is regarding an r/Singapore meetup in May.

This was roughly thought out before the announcement for the global reddit meetup day was announced. There's more than a month between this and then and some people want it to go on, so it will.

You guys submitted your preferences, and here are the results:

---

**Date: 12 May 2012 (Saturday)**

**Location: Singapore Botanic Gardens**

**Event type: Potluck/Picnic/Drinking whatever session (Just chilling, basically)**

**Time and place to meet: 4pm at Botanic Gardens MRT**

**Why: Why not...?**

----

Event is simple. Just bring a dish (or 2... or 10) that is enough for everyone to eat. If you're lazy or can't cook, feel free to bring soft drinks or chips or other stuff like that. If you want Reddiporeans to circlejerk on how good what you bring is, then feel free to cook it/make it/buy it. 

The garden is pretty spacious, so apart from eating we can throw around frisbees or kick balls around. No, not that kind. 

Everyone and anyone is welcome, just bring something, kay?

I know some of you do not drink, but no pressure. Some people who don't drink are definitely going to show up.

For people who do want to drink, bring your own drinks, share a bottle with some friends, or just come with no drinks and we'll get whoever is interested to pool together money and order drinks from somewhere like [mabuk monkey](http://www.mabukmonkey.com/#/menu/4554873329) with the total funds available. 

The garden closes at 12am, so we'll have to leave before then (to round 2 of drinks, perhaps).

----

If you are coming,

Please state:

1. Whether you'll be able to make it on time or will be late 

2. What you are bringing (so 20 people don't bring coke and chips). If you would like to keep it a surprise just say the general food category that it belongs in. 

**WE ARE AT THE PAGODA/SHELTER NEAREST TO THE MRT. I'LL BE AT EXIT A WAITING FOR LATE COMERS UNTIL 5 ISH. CALL ME IF YOU NEED TO FIND ME**

As you all know, the last meetup was ""great success"" and everyone had a damn good time!
I thought that before I leave you're lovely country at the end of the month, I would try and get a bunch of you guys together for another night of laughs,food and drinks -drunken stumbling on the beach is optional. I was thinking we could hit up Clarke Quay since there's tons of shit going on there and there are a couple of pretty sick bars (Se7en Inch and Crazy Elephant are sweet). If you have a better idea of a place to go,comment and let's get this discussion going :). I was thinking July 23rd (Saturday Night after 6-7pm), what do you guys and gals think?  
  
The options so far:   

[Wala Wala @ Holland Village](http://www.worldsbestbars.com/wala-wala-cafe-bar-in-singapore.htm)  
[Crazy Elephant @ Clarke Quay](http://www.crazyelephant.com/aboutus.html)  
[Se7en Inch @ Clarke Quay](http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/bars/se7en1nch)  
btw se7en inch is not as sleazy as that article makes it out to be....disappointingly :p  
  
**Update 1**: Seems to be a lot of love for Holland Village right now with 2 bars named, Wala Wala and now [Baden](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/baden_restaurant_pub/). Looks like this is shaping up to be some fun  
  
**Update 2**: Alright so far it looks like more people are into Holland Village for a meetup. It's a little more relaxed and doesn't have as much of a tourist trap feel. Plus it'll be good busy not mad rush busy like i'm assuming Clarke Quay will be. The bars will probably alternate between Baden and Wala Wala. They are [5 minutes apart on the same road](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=31+Lorong+Mambong,+277689&amp;daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong,+277698&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=1.31174,103.794421&amp;spn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;sll=1.31175,103.794405&amp;sspn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;geocode=FbEDFAAd7MYvBikRgeiVaxraMTH9M6ZJgog47g%3BFZgEFAAdJscvBiGB7WF_My68Bg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=19) so it's a non issue. Baden is a bit of a quieter less expensive hangout joint, and wala wala has higher prices overall but also provides for a second level with a live band. What's the general preference? Post comments. For the record i'd ideally like to start at baden and abuse their happy hour and then see where the rowdy reddit crowd will want to go afterwards. Thoughts?  
  
**FINAL UPDATE:** Hey guys. So it's decided that this shindig is going down at Holland Village. For your convenience, [**here are some directions**](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=Buona+Vista+Mrt+Station+North+Buona+Vista+Road&amp;daddr=42+Lorong+Mambong&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=1.30919,103.79179&amp;spn=0.005824,0.010568&amp;sll=1.308793,103.792262&amp;sspn=0.005824,0.010568&amp;geocode=FdrzEwAda7IvBiElGrU3lFMJew%3BFYIEFAAdyMYvBilDkAyUaxraMTHsMM73UF_Pzw&amp;gl=sg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=r&amp;ttype=now&amp;noexp=0&amp;noal=0&amp;sort=def&amp;z=17&amp;start=0) from the Buona Vista MRT station to The Baden and Wala Wala Cafe. It is pretty straightforward.  
  
I'm aiming to be at Baden at 7pm (i'll be on time, this time I swear) and I'll see if we can get some space to ourselves while people come in. After everyone's there we can sorta decide on what people would like to get up to. I hope that gels with you guys. As always, I'm more than happy to help redditors out with queries/questions/need directions etc. so just PM me and i'll give you my contact details. Looking forward to a good night out!! :D

Remember the Forever Alone cone that was posted yesterday? It's from Makeshake at City Square Mall. Some people seemed interested in a milkshake meet-up and I'm an employee there! My last two days of work FOREVER are Friday (6 - 10) and Sunday (1 - 10). If you guys want to have a meet-up I'll give all Redditors a 10% discount. :D (sorry, no free milkshakes, they're trying to break even as it is.)

DISCUSS!!

EDIT: Okay here are the details!

When: Friday 6 - 10

And Sunday 1 - 10

Where: Makeshake, City Square Mall (linked to Farrer Park MRT)

Estimated cost: $5

Note: please draw a Reddit alien on your wrist and I will discount your milkshake. :) if you have to ask the cashier whether she's heard of 'this site called reddit', there is a 50% chance she will giggle and/or raise her eyebrows and say, 'Um, no?!' So the alien is the safest choice.

1355662300.0,24,self.singapore,14xumz,Why can nobody understand what I say?,45,21,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14xumz/why_can_nobody_understand_what_i_say/,"Excuse me for venting, but I just need to bitch about this. I'm an American who has been here for about 4 years. I'm not FT, not rich, live in Sembawang area, etc. I try my best to blend in. I take public transport, I mostly eat at hawker stands and try and be patient. However, it's really becoming an annoying trend in that many people don't understand what I am saying. Specifically taxi uncles or those who work at places like Kopitiams. I understand I can talk fast, so I go out of my way to slow it down and enunciate, but it doesn't seem to help.

Here is a typical exchange when entering a taxi.

Me: Hello Uncle, can I go to Hougang?

Uncle: Huh? *Actually, it's not ""huh,"" it's more like a guttural ""AAAH?""*

Me: Can I go to Hougang please?

Uncle: AHH? Havelock?

Me: HOW-GUNG..HOW-GUNG HOW-GUNG.

Uncle: Ok, you show me the way ahh?

This happens in nearly every taxi I enter, regardless of where I am going. I have to keep repeating myself, despite speaking English slowly and clearly.

Nearly every time I go to a Kopitiam, like my meal tonight which ultimately led to this post.

Me: Can I have one bubur pulut hitam?

Lady: AHH?

Me: Can I have one Bu-bur-pu-lut-hi-tam?

Lady: GHSGJHSGHJSG AH?

Me: Sure

*As she is pouring it into the bowl*

Me: Can I have extra coconut cream?

Lady: AHH? 

Me: Extra coconut cream please

Lady: Extra Ahh? *Dips ladle in to get extra juice from the pot of bubur pulut hitam and makes the dish super watered down.*

She then pours one little spoon of cream on top, when I have basically begged to have extra at this point. She then just hands it to me and says ""Ok Ahh?"" No, it's not fucking OK. However, talking to this woman at this point would just further frustrate me and probably land me on Stomp.

Another example at the Kopitiam...a different stall. I'm ordering food and I ask the man if the curry is Chicken. ""Yes yes chicken yes."" I ask, is it boneless? ""AHHH?"" Is it boneless or does it have bones in it, the chicken? He just scoops up some and holds it there for me to look at, which does nothing to answer my question.

Ok, now look. I understand it may seem trivial, but it's really starting to frustrate me to the point that it's pissing me the fuck off. I'm not stupid, I don't speak like I have shit in my mouth, aside from ""American,"" I have no crazy accent. I'm speaking clearly, and loud enough for normal people to hear. What the fuck is so different that I keep running into these same problems with people at hawker stands and in taxis? I'm paying to get food, or to use a service, and I would like to receive that food or service a specific way, that is well within reason. However, these people make it so difficult, that the entire experience just leaves me pissed off and I regret going in the first place.

Excuse me if this makes me sound like an asshole, but Singapore's official language is English, correct? Then why can't these people in these positions have a basic comprehension of it? Am I being unreasonable?

Now we need some ideas for a place to do this thing, preferably a place that can accommodate the horde that always manages to show up. Also, I think we should try to meet at approximately 530-6pm.

Now I would prefer it if we go to a different place then before, but I'm willing to go anywhere as long as the beer is cold and the food ain't go no mold.

Alright, everyone should post the date they like and the place they want, we can count it up and we'll all go there during that day.

As per [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ztv2d/22nd_september_reddit_meetup/), a meetup is happing this Saturday.

Thanks for all the lovely suggestions for the locations, but I've chosen the Singapore botanic gardens due to its more central location. Maybe someone can choose somewhere else when they're planning next time ;) It's also a nice and quiet location and we can make a ton of noise and make use of the ample space without disturbing too many people. We also can make use of the cold storage opposite for food and drinks.

Everyone is welcomed to this meetup, so please come even if you're hesitant. We're a really friendly bunch and if we were on tripadvisor we'd be up there right at the top.

Let's meet at **Botanic gardens MRT station at 6pm**. **Bring food/drinks/booze** to contribute to the pool.

Make some homemade stuff if you're feeling adventurous, and just buy snacks if you're afraid of giving dysentery to everyone.

Please also bring some money so we can pool the money together and go to cold storage to buy tons of drinks and ice to get us through the night. 

See you there! 

--------

EDIT: If you're late, we're usually at the shelter closest to the MRT station. Just follow the path from the station and it should lead you to the shelter. It's on a hill. 

**This is a picnic meetup, so please try to bring something. If it's super last minute just bring some beer/chips whatever.**

**SATURDAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF OKTOBERFEST, WHAT BETTER WAY TO CELEBRATE THAN TO COME AND HAVE SOME BREWSKIS?!**

----

My number in case you can't find us: 9022-5930 (Tim)
Spare number: 9712-5599 (Julius)

(whatsapp, messsaging or calling all work)

As far as I know [this link](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-reddit-meetup-day---singapore/) is what you guys need to be reading if you haven't already. It's slated for 9pm but if people wanted to go and get some food first i'm guessing earlier probably works too right? Thanks to the guys that picked the venue and organized this btw!  
  
edit:PM for my contact info for when you get there.

EDITDUO:PLS BE AWARE THAT THE BIG BAD WOLF BAR stops taking drink orders at 11pm and closes at 12. 
 if any of youz goons is up for something after that i'm sure some of us will be game. A few of us will be there from 7:30 onwards so see you then!

EDIT3: For all the redditors under 19, I will call up the venue today and ask whether it is cool for you guys to enter the premises and not be served booze. The spot looks like a pretty chill open place and[ not your typical bar](http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/222179_197987426913051_195386937173100_583411_2444647_n.jpg) so hopefully there shouldn't be an issue. 

**UPDATE FOR ALL THOSE UNDER LEGAL DRINKING AGE**: YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME. BBWolf is a restaurant before a bar and they just got in touch with me telling me that it's cool and they were looking forward to our party showing up. I hope that clarifies stuff for anyone who was on the fence about coming due to the age issue. **:D**


**FINAL EDIT- DIRECTIONS**: [Here is the spot on google maps with transit highlighted](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?q=226+Tanjong+Katong+Rd+Singapore&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=1.310563,103.902769&amp;spn=0.022267,0.042272&amp;gl=sg&amp;z=15&amp;lci=transit_comp).

just a reminder that we'll be going for the free flow event this Saturday. Please meet at the Sembawang MRT line (on the North-South line, ie the red line) at 5.30pm. Look out for the awkward group of people hanging around at the MRT entrance gates (the control station). Don't worry, things will get better as the alcohol flows. 

We will leave for the brewery at 5.45pm sharp. If lost, or late, please ring: Tim at 90225930 (note OP is not called Tim, so don't ring up and go MANATEED?) Or you can just PM me (this time you can go MANATEED?)


We're taking public bus from the station (bus number 962 from Sembawang Drive). Please bring sufficient cash for a cab ride home in case we stay later than the buses and trains run.

The address of Jungle Beer once again:

8A Admiralty Street, #04-27
FoodXchange @ Admiralty
Singapore 757437


Also, It is a Very Good Idea to eat something before we go, so you don't start drinking on an empty stomach. 

See you guys there!**


**PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY**

Greetings all. 

Everyone's favourite Singaporean microbrewery, Jungle Beer, is having its monthly Free Flow event at their brewery in Sembawang on **Saturday, 12th January**. It costs **$40 for all-u-can-drink** (Bargain! Where else in Singapore can you find such a deal?), and happens from **6pm till 12mn**, or whenever we get thrown out. They usually have four types of beer on tap.

So bring your drinking hats, stubby holders, quaffing mugs and we'll have a rocking good time! There's a free-to-play pool table, and if any of us feel energetic enough we might have a little /r/singapore pool tourny. Winner gets bragging rights, and a beer (which you already paid for).

Where: 

Jungle Beer, http://www.junglebeer.com

8A Admiralty Street, #04-27
FoodXchange @ Admiralty
Singapore 757437

Cost: $40

Time: We'll meet at 5.30 at Sembawang MRT station control (ie outside the gates) and take a bus to the brewery.

Eat: There's pizza we can order

Please RSVP here if you're coming.

Yet, the country seems to be struggling with basic wireless coverage. I have two wireless plans; one from Singtel and one from Starhub. Both, get atrocious speeds in Farrer Park and even in the CBD.

I called both companies who make me do a series of tests and eventually just said that the network is saturated (Singtel) and blamed it on people torrenting (Starhub). I told them ""so, how is that my problem? fix it or cancel my service"". Both companies told me they would have a ""tech"" investigate and get back to me. I never got a call back, and when I call them back 1 month later they have no idea who I am. Basically, back to square one.

I have a 7Mbps plan (Starhub) and a 21Mbps plan (Singtel). If speeds are 1% of what I was promised, shouldn't I be paying 1% of what I promised?

With Starhub, I can not cancel. Singtel allows me to cancel, but with an early termination fee.

Does anyone have similar experiences? This is basically fraud. Why am I paying for a service I can't use?

Some notes:

1. Farrer Park is where I live. I work late and typically access the internet at midnight or later. Hardly what I would call peak time. My speeds vary from 1k - 120k down and frequently just drop. I connect to 3G, HSPDA, HSPDA+, and G. It really varies, but the speed is awful in all cases.
2. I work in Raffles and while I don't have my connection drop, speeds are just as bad and fluctuate wildly. I am typically using 3G.
3. I have used three devices so I know it's not a hardware issue. Two phones and a MiFi router.",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_151mck,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/151mck/how_is_wireless_so_awful_in_singapore/,

I am a closeted homosexual, currently studying in a junior college and facing enlistment soon. I am very apprehensive of National Service (not to trivialise the experiences of my straight counterparts, but you have to admit we have got a worse deal) for very good reasons, since there appears to be institutionalised discrimination within NS against gays.

One of the biggest questions right now is whether to come out. I have done some research and understand that gays are, along with other effeminate men and whatever the authorities deem ""wrong"" (who the fuck are they to judge anyway? I digress..), classified under Category 302. The implications of this classification, however, are something that I do not know. I would greatly appreciate if anyone has input about this.

Also, I have read various anecdotes online by people brave enough to go down this path. It ranged from surprisingly pleasant with everyone being inclusive/treating it like a non-issue to really nasty. For one, parents have to be involved. While not entirely non-negotiable for me, I very much prefer not to do this. My parents are religious and this fact will really break their hearts. I honestly don't want that guilt.

In a few months, the date is not not finalized yet, I intend to take a vacation there and see the sights. I'm planning on about 2 weeks to a month. It depends on how much of my money I'm willing to divert when the time comes. 

My question is, what is the Singaporean attitude toward black people? It's unfortunately one of the sad things about being black that everywhere you go, people tend to carry a lot of stereotypes about your intelligence, social class, and attitude. So travelling as a black person can be... uncomfortable. 

However I never ever let that stop me from enjoying myself and learning new things and I never step on anyone's toes. Before traveling I always study as if I'm preparing for a final exam. I just like to be prepared so that I'm not shocked and knocked off balance. Please be frank and honest with me, I don't take any offense. Is Singapore a place where I have to be extra careful not to offend people because of my ""race""? As a person of darker skin, are there any cultural sensitivities I need to be gentle around? I never judge a place. As you can probably tell from this question, I'm used to quite a bit of negative treatment so it doesn't bother me. I just want to make sure that if there's anything to worry about, I can navigate it smoothly without ruining some Singaporean native's day or my trip.

I know this is a weird question to ask... and I hope I haven't offended anyone by asking.

**When: March 17th, 2012; 4pm to late.**

**Where: East Coast Park, Area C, Pit 7. (Carpark C1)**

**Who: ~40 rambunctious Reddiporeans.**

Food has been catered! Drinks have been ordered!

Those of you who are particularly BBQ-proficient, I'd appreciate some people helping me with the actual cooking. Whether to share or for personal consumption (ya selfish prick), you're also welcome to bring your own food and drinks.

*Music is a must!* To facilitate my screeching along with Queen's most sonorous of rock standards, someone bring along a pair of speakers. A football or frisbee might also be fun.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/D6UHq.png) is a map, with our barbecue pit demarcated by the red arrow. For reference, the East Coast Park McDonald's is at the ""Marine Cove"". Also, my phone number is 92373187 (David) so if, come the day of the barbecue, you have problems finding the pit you can give me a ring.

Now, to the sticky issue of payment. To cover the cost of ordering everything, **you'll need to pay $40 if you're eating and drinking**. I've delegated the job of collecting the dinero to Bader. As you can imagine this may get incredibly confusing so if you guys could **please cooperate with Bader by finding him when you arrive and paying him**, that'd be great. Don't make me ""O$P$"" your home!

As you're all well aware, the weather here is pretty capricious and I'm still working on a suitable wet weather program. Unsurprisingly, finding a sheltered pit that can accomodate 40 people has been a bit challenging. I suppose we can just keep our fingers crossed, but **if anyone has any suggestions for a wet weather BBQ plan, please PM me.**

**In either case, please check the r/Singapore main page at 2:30pm on March 17th where I'll post a confirmation or cancellation post once it's clear which way the weather is swinging.**

I know the Singapore race riots of the '60s seem so distant - and something that seems so unfathomable today, but I wonder if Singapore is becoming a less tolerant place than it was in the past. Maybe the resentment that fueled the riots in the 60's still remains bubbling under the surface - spilling out onto the comments section of Stomp or Yahoo! News.

Update: Switching to the competition doesn't really makes sense as highlighted by kartoos. I've decided I was paying way too much for cable anyways. I cancelled lots and lots of channels saving 40$ a month for the remainder of the contract. I think this is the best way to counter attack.

I'm a Canadian-American (Canadian citizen but spent formative years in USA) ""ang mo"" expat who has recently accepted a lucrative offer in Singapore.

I'd like to make friends with my co-workers. I'm a pretty typical North American, it seems I'm a bit more friendly and open than my co-workers.

1. Singaporeans, do you have any advice on how to get my co-workers to like me? 

2. What do Singaporeans hate most about Americans? Is being American considered a good thing or a bad thing?

3. How can I tell if my Singaporean co-workers dislike me? Do they make it obvious or discrete?

4. How can I tell if my Singaporean co-workers like me? Do they make it obvious or discrete?

5. What important differences in manners/expectations should I expect here? What is something I could do that is common in USA but would be offensive in Singapore?

I'm getting mixed messages and am somewhat confused. Maybe I'm paranoid, but it seems people are a bit more.... idk...subtle here?

Surgical mask will not help, so don't waste money. They are for respiratory droplets.


A poorly fitted N95 mask will give a false sense of assurance, and will not help either.

1860S - small size

1860 - normal size

There are people whose faces can't fit either, and will need a different brand of masks altogether.

If your N95 mask fits well, it should make you uncomfortable and want to take it off in 10 mins :)

At the end of the day, hiding in large air conditioned buildings is probably the best method.

[Gallery of Pics]

Donated Blood today,
wanted to share how it went.

I donated at 
  
Bloodbank @ Health Sciences Authority (HSA)

  Its close to Outram Park MRT Station, walking distance.

**[List of places to donate](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/wheretodonate.html?direct=1)**

You can choose to donate 

* whole blood (regular donation) **OR**
* platelets and plasma ([apheresis](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate/apheresis.html))

Apheresis is recommended for non-first timers in my opinion.

Apheresis requires large veins that will not collapse for the hour long procedure.

I tried once but it collapsed halfway. They told me to try again in 2 years.

**Highly recommended to make an appointment before going down**

-Its pretty fast, can just make a phone call or use your SingPass

-You get placed in a priority line, which speed things up a bit depending on the crowd that day.

Once inside, this is the rough flow of things.

1. Fill up Questionnaire, hand it in.

2. Wait to be called for the doctor to take your blood pressure, temperature etc.

3. Next station, they prick a finger to test your haemoglobin levels to see whether you meet the minimum. 

4. Enter the area with the chairs, and the staff will get you prepared for the procedure, pretty friendly, though it seems that they use similar lines to make donors feel at ease, better than nothing though.

5. Vein check, inject anaesthesia, etc, the actual process itself.

6. Wait for blood to be drawn out, 450 mls. My bag took 3:30 for it to be filled.

The actual process itself is very much shorter than the form-filling and waiting. Pretty fast, total time is close to half hour.

During the process itself the staff will hand you a food voucher, 
and some iron tablets to replenish your iron supply.

**If you visit in between 11.30 and 1.30pm**

It is considered lunchtime and a full meal will be redeemed using the voucher.
[**Menu for that day**](http://imgur.com/PQBHX)

Other times would just be a snack.

I also received a pretty thick notebook. Hardcover and bound pretty nicely. Came in a plastic cover shaped like a blood bag and a sticker/decal that mimicked a blood bag label.

On top of that there was also an extra gift because of donating during my birthday month. It was an handheld electric fan with a pretty cute and cool function, where it flashed ""Happy Birthday"". Good for a chuckle.

Below is the email from the friend (personal details redacted, msg me if interested)

Hi Guys,

Sorry for this spam email but it was a bit urgent. xx, xx and xx were booked to spend 5days/4nights at Nikoi, a private island off Bintan (Indonesia technically, but visa on arrival) near Singapore from  16th to 20th of this month. (www.nikoi.com)

Unfortunately xxx came down with bacterial dysentry yesterday and the doc has advised against travel. The resort offers 0% refund but does allow us to transfer the booking. If you guys would be keen or know anyone who would want to make use of it do let me know asap.

The room rent we have paid for is about 1.7k SGD. However, the couple will have to shell out about S$200 for ferry return from Spore-Bintan and another S$180 for transfer to Nikoi island. Full boarding (all 3 meals plus unlimited watersports activities) is S$90 per person per day as well.

It's a tad steep but its the number 1 rated place on TripAdvisor and we were looking forward to splurging a bit on our annual holiday but will have to give it up now :( we just want to try and see if someone we know can enjoy it instead.

Please do reply in case you know anyone who is keen.

Thanks a ton

galaxyhiker - bro I got a monitor for ya!

I am in tomorrow.  If I cant get it done before I leave I may hand the project off to the might Redditor named ""numbandnumber"".  He has volunteered to adopt all the old gear and distribute it out to worthy causes around the City.

This has been fun - great to meet you all.  Thanks for the Oranges MedStudent they were super tasty.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE Wednesday - I dont even know the date anymore.... :D

Meetup in Raffles Place Courtyard in about 30 mins.  Dropping off one last batch.  Anybody around?  I have a couple of giant Dell towers that are pretty much stripped but would make a good case-mod project.

email - pm - post - scream out your window - etc etc!  I will respond if still alive.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE almost Thursday...I think??? (who cares - clocks mean nothing to me anymore) 

At the airport sippin a jack &amp; coke in the most pimped out airport lounge i ever done seen.  This is ridiculous!  Have you ever been to LAX?  You can get mugged IN THE AIRPORT!  Changi is like a fancy hotel.

It has been a lot of fun meeting all of you.  I had a very hectic, enjoyable trip.  I gained 10 pounds... ??(how do you guys stay skinny out here)?? ....and enjoyed every bite.  This place is heaven for snackers like me.

There are still a few bits and pieces of gear remaining at my office.  I have set the stuff aside and will be coordinating the numbandnumber to pick up and distribute as he sees fit.  He is an honorable gentleman and he will do the right thing.  Very sorry if i missed any of you.  PM me and I will do my best to stoke you out.

Take care everyone.  Use those computers until they burn out and grind to a halt!  I expect your REDDIT posts to increase by at least 45% due to the increased processing power.

Come on out to California and look me up!  (seriously)

It was a neat thing to have accomplished and something we can tell people we did. Our interaction with the kids and staff from Beyond Social Services was great and their director sent me an e-mail thanking us for doing the walk and showing the kids that people care about their organization. 

A big thanks to redditor neuroplastique who met us bright and early in the morning and spent the day with a bunch of people he never met. He's a pretty cool guy who is a lot smarter than I'll ever claim to be. Dude works with brains, man!

All in all, it was a long and painfully fulfilling experience that I'll never do again!

After much discussion, consideration, conference calls, top-level meetings, deliberations, contingency plans, projections and pub talk, my good self and the wonderful apurva_p have decided on a ~~loose~~ *more solid* plan for the **Global Reddit Trick or Treat Meetup**!

So, most importantly, the venue. ~~There isn't a booking yet, but we think that **Bar Bar Black Sheep** on Robertson Quay (the location of the August meetup) would be a great location, for a number of reasons which will be explained in due time.~~ We have booked an outside table for 20 people in **Brewerkz** in Clarke Quay!

Secondly, since it's Hallowe'en, I'm sure you're wondering about costumes and the like. Well, fear not you beautiful, socially awkward reddiporeans out there for **we don't really care if you decided to wear a costume or not**. Seriously. First and foremost, this is a meetup - costumes are secondary. The point is to come along, meet a bunch of redditors, share stories, have some fun, eat, drink and be merry as much or as little as you like, safe in the knowledge that you are surrounded by like-minded and devilishly attractive people.

Of course, *if you want* to wear a costume or face paint or wear a mask, then by all means, do! Personally, I'd love to see hoobaga in a giant penguin costume *(hint, hint)* but it's up to you. No pressure, no worries.

We have a few ideas for Hallowe'en games but need to work out a few issues first. I had the idea of playing [apple bobbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_bobbing) and then thought we could make it better and a bit more local by turning it into... wait for it... DURIAN BOBBING!

How about pumpkin carving? If anyone knows where we could get decent-sized pumpkins, let us know and apurva_p or I shall bring them.

Lastly, it's Hallowe'en so there's one tradition we can't leave out - stuffing our faces with chocolate/sweets/candy! So, please bring a bag of sweets or something to share (if you can) and we shall all gorge on the sugary goodness.

~~ As I said, BBBS isn't finalized yet but it ~~ Brewerkz works because it's outside (for apple/durian bobbing), they have a big table to fit all of us and it's close to Clarke Quay if the night takes us in that direction.

Give us your thoughts, ideas and suggestions here!

i confronted him about this and he just says he's allowed to do anything he wants since it's his property, but I think he makes believe his english is worse than it is to avoid communicating with me (he's from china).

when i first met him he was so nice. now he is a fucking absolute nightmare. here are some problems i need to deal with:

* he told me that the airconditioner wasn't working before i moved in and would take $100 off my monthly rent. i agreed. now he told me that i will be responsible to fix the air conditioner or I won't get my security deposit.
* my front door has some scratches on it and he said I will need to pay to paint it. i have no idea who scratched it... am I responsible for this? it could have been anyone in the building.
* he lives on the same floor as me and always makes loud spitting noises and spits in the hallway. several people have asked him to stop and someone even posted a note in the hallway asking ""whoever is spitting please stop"". the next day there was spit on that note.
* constantly screaming at night in chinese and having loud phone conversations past midnight

I'm so sick of this and I'm only 4 months into a 2 year lease. What can I do?",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_17qwr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17qwr8/is_my_landlord_allowed_to_enter_my_apartment/,

Those reports make use of a linear estimation (i.e. assuming that PSI varies linearly with PM10 concentration). However, this is not the case.

The PM10-to-PSI is a piecewise linear function, which is defined as follows ([Source](http://app2.nea.gov.sg/data/cmsresource/20090401682645441976.pdf)):

| PM10 | PSI |
|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 |
| 50 | 50 |
| 350 | 200 |
| 420 | 300 |
| 500 | 400 |
| 600 | 500 |


Thus, it is not correct to use the raw values of the PSI for a linear estimation of 1-hour PSI. We should instead convert the PSI into PM10 values, then extrapolate from those values instead.
After conversion, the estimate of PM10 at 8pm is 491 micrograms per cubic metre, which converts to around a PSI of 390, not 452. Not that it makes it any better...",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,False,,,True,t3_1gpeh8,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1gpeh8/just_a_small_thing_to_note/,

**These BBQ slots disappear really quickly, so I went ahead and booked Area C/Pit 7 on March 17th. Mark your calendars for that Saturday, suckahs.**

Let's give Weeabos a round of applause for letting me know that he's happy to coordinate the drinks. Of course, you are still welcome to bring whatever else you want to drink and/or share; we should have some ice chests for you to keep your stuff nice and chilly.

*As for music, Dreamwaltzer has got it spot on: someone please volunteer to bring a decent set of portable speakers so that awkward silences are kept to a minimum (and my obnoxious belting-along to Queen is at a maximum).*

As a note, we'll figure out how many people are there and split the cost of the food and drinks later.

Yes, we already had a meetup there in October but that's pretty much the only negative thing about going there. On the positive side, it's very easy to get to, there's loads of room for us, they have a decent selection of beer (including Jungle Beer!), the beer gets cheaper after 11 o'clock, Clarke Quay bridge is nearby for further late-night revelries and there's lots of taxis nearby for getting home around 4 am or whenever.

Posting this from a throwaway, as my co-workers know my regular reddit name, and don't want them knowing what's going on until things are final.

There's a damn good chance I'm getting relocated to Singapore in the next month or two with my company. I'm a 27 year old white guy originally from California, but have lived in the Chicagoland area for the last 4 years. Prior to that, I spent time living in Colorado and Hawaii.

I've perused the sidebar quite a bit, but unfortunately, I'm still left with questions. If you can help me, I'd be super happy, and may even buy you a beer once I get into town!

1. Living? Where do you recommend? My offices are located near the corner of Telok Ayer and Cross St (I work in Finance, as an I.T. worker), so ideally I'd like to live no more than a 20 minute trip from there. Living in Chicago, our downtown area is lacking in the nightlife department, so I'd like to live somewhere that has a decent bar scene, but not far from work. My budget would be up to 1,100 SGD per month. Is it feasible to live on my own?

2. Speaking of nightlife, any recommendations? I'm sure I'd like to hit up the touristy spots in the beginning, but I'm also open to most anything, except for clubbing.

3. How much is a pint of beer? Google is telling me I'll need to sacrifice my first-born son and mortgage his soul to buy rounds at the bar. Is this true? Am I going to go broke buying shots for girls at the bar?

5. The fun question: Girls? I'm a single guy, where do I want to go, so that I don't have to worry being taken advantage of for free drinks? haha

My question is, is this law enforced; do people actually go to jail over this? Also, what is being gay like in Singapore? Do you have to be in fear of being caught by the police, or worse, entrapped?

Electronic-Cigarettes are illegal in Singapore? 

Aren't e-cigarettes a safer, healthier alternative to cigarettes? Common sense tells me that burning plant matter and sucking in said smoke and carbon particles through a paper tube, is obviously harsher than vaporizing a liquid that contains nicotine. 

And they were banned because, *""According to Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, electronic cigarettes were the industry's attempt to attract new users and were marketed to appeal to younger customers, including women.""*

Seriously? Women and children? They're using women and children as an excuse? Aren't they skirting around the issue?

Aren't they just afraid that the use of e-cigs (better alternative) would cut into the consumption of cigarettes? Of which are HIGHLY FUCKING TAXED. You know... like how they jack up the price by 10 times, and pocket like around 8/10 of the price tag we pay? They're clearly profiting from this, aren't they? More importantly, THEY'RE AFRAID OF DIPPING PROFITS AREN'T THEY?

If they really cared about the health of the women and children, shouldn't they be banning the use of traditional cigarettes? Is all this soft-persuasion of graphic images on boxes, anti-smoking campaigns, quitting hotlines, all just bullshit to make it *seem* like they care?

Oh, no. Of course not. Tobacco companies couldn't possibly be paying our government to sign laws that profit both of them, while at the detriment of the working population both financially and health-wise right? hahahah, nah. I'm just thinking too much right?

I guess what I'm asking for here is what would you do? I'm afraid the only info I can give is the locations and time and colour of the boot of the cab. I don't recall any numbers or names. It was an over 24 hour trip from Atlanta that I was too excited to sleep during. In fact, I've yet to sleep now at 11:00 SG time now. Although it's mostly from anger at myself now.

I am a Japanese girl who found job position in Singapore.

Living in south east asia must be exciting experience for my life. I like the warm weather here.  Local food are spicy @@ (cheers!)
But chill crab was fantastic!! (Thanks for the future boss!) 

Seems my next year in Singapore will be really great. 
Although...I am bit anxious. Specially I saw the news Singaporean people assembled to the park and against the immigration policy of the government.  Also...I am wondering people are still angry with the past war with us?  
People would not mind to be friend of mine?   (If I live in new place, I want to have local friends) 
Please give me advice about the singapore.

Many Many thanks!!

Last night at around 1.30am I [23f] had an argument with my dad - who is extremely hot-headed and can get violent when things don't go his way. So things got heated last night. He threw a ceramic bowl at me, shattering it and he clubbed me on my head twice with his fist. Then my mother came between us to stop him and he pushed both of us. 

My mother then pushed me into my room and asked me to lock the door while my father went into the store room to get the vacuum cleaner pipe and threatened to hit me with it. He later went out and only came back home late afternoon today. When my mum heard he was coming home, she asked me to go to my cousin's place to hide. 

He told my mum he will hit me again if he sees me. I'm home now and he isn't due to work. He only comes back home once or twice a week because of work, so I have a bit of leeway there.

It's not the first time he's physical. In the past when I was younger, he's hit/slapped me and my sister a number of times and once smashed my computer then redeemed himself the next day by buying a new one. All of us at home feel like we're walking on eggshells around him. He verbally abuses us, especially my mother and she's been very okay with it. 

I'm very tempted to have him charged by the police. He's not only physical with me but also with his employees. But everyone in the family, including my mum and sister, is telling me to apologise to him and let the matter rest because he is my dad. If I do want to make a report, what will happen?

I don't know how to proceed now - how to face him and continue living with him and if I should report him to the police. 

This is a throwaway account.

**EDIT, 19feb 10pm**: I didn't make any police report. I initially wanted to make one just for the record in case he hits me again. My mum and aunt convinced me not to, telling me to give him another chance and just live out my last few years under his roof with him quietly and resiliently. I haven't seen him since the night he hit me. But he's called home and asked my mum how I'm doing, showing remorse. I guess I feel better but still emotionally hurt that he hit me. At least now I know (thanks to [nvendr](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/18p1pt/dad_hit_me_last_night_what_should_i_do/c8gpjn1)) what to do if he gets physical again. My cousin told me she'll stand beside me if he hits me again and will go with me to the police.

For **S$40**, you get to drink all you can from between the hours of 6:00pm and 11:30pm.

If you don't think you're going to be drinking that much, they've been happy to let people pay by the glass in the past (although I don't quite remember how much it is per glass; I'll check with them later).

Their range of beers on tap change every now and then, but the flavors I recall are Dunkel Weiss, Flirty Fruit Pink Guava, some kind of English ale, and the delicious Kiasu Stout.

I'll be down at Sembawang MRT at 5:30pm where we can all meetup and head there by bus. Make sure you bring cash because they don't have the facilities to take any kind of card transactions.

For those of you who want to make your own way there, their address is:

*8A Admiralty Street, #04-27 FoodXchange, Sembawang, S757437*

Take bus 962 from the bus stop opposite Sun Plaza on Sembawang Drive to the Admiralty Street Food XChange six stops later. As always, if you're having trouble finding the place, call me at 9237 3187 (David).

1303803370.0,18,self.singapore,gxmas,Which maid to choose? by Ming Lee Lim ,19,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gxmas/which_maid_to_choose_by_ming_lee_lim/,"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother, I need someone reliable to help out at home.
 
My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, so I had faith in her. For several years her performance has been very good, but recently she has become arrogant and insensitive, and is making lots of mistakes.
 
For example:

1)     She flooded my kitchen –  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn’t). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won’t happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!

2)     She didn’t close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident, she didn’t apologise and just shrugged her shoulders saying “What to do, it has happened.” Fortunately my neighbor found the dog and we locked it up again. 

3)     Without consulting me, she has been bringing in strangers for my house's maintenance work. She says they charge low wages and keep costs down, but they eat my food, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don’t always want to come back at the end of the day.

4)     When she first came to work for me, I instructed her to clean the different parts of the house at least once a week. But for some time she has stopped taking care of the bedrooms of PP and H; they are now dirty and messy. I asked why and she told me that the kids had been disobedient, so she was neglecting their bedrooms as a punishment (she has forgotten that she is paid to clean all the rooms). 
 
Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, I think she is now getting complacent.  Her attitude is imperious and dismissive. She ignores my comments and basically treats my feedback as ""noise"".  I wrote to the agency about her behavior; they assured me that they are the best agency around and all their maids are “Commited to Serve” – but I think it is just rhetoric and I don’t see that in her actions. Her salary is much higher than maids in other countries, but the agency say this is to keep her honest and stop her moving to another employer. They say there is a limited supply of maids, and Singapore isn’t big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors.
 
I have to decide whether to renew my maid’s 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, and if I want her I must also accept her friends doing part-time work for me. One friend is very inexperienced, can't do basic tasks or explain what she intends to do. I suspect that she is actually underage. When interviewed, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary.
 
Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), New Solutions Pte (NSP), Super Personnel Pte (SPP) and Star Domestica Pte (SDP) - that offered me some helpers who seem sincere, genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance.
 
People say that the devil you know is better than one you don’t. But I feel that I can’t tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one? Appreciate your advice.

I am not that aware of the laws over there, but he is saying that he might lose his job if he was ever to be identified as HIV+ by his employers. Furthermore he has this notion that the support groups for these types of things are all full of 'gossips'. He is also not going to get his meds in Singapore for fear of getting tracked. So he opts for going all the way to Bangkok to do all his tests and get his meds. Which is obviously an expensive solution.

So is he on point here or is there a lot of paranoia and jumping to conclusions on his part? We are getting a bit worried because he has expressed suicidal thoughts and not taking this very rationally, which I can sympathize totally. Any word of advice? Any websites or organizations or groups that can help out? Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

The Working class usually refers to a section of society dependent on physical labour, especially when compensated with an hourly wage. I want to find out where the line is in Singapore where people is considered working class.

In societies where classes exist, one's class is determined largely by:

* occupation
* education and qualifications
* income, personal, household and per capita
* wealth, including the ownership of land, property, means of production, et cetera
* family background.

.
Pick one or more elements from each category, or substitute something to give the same effect:
.
1. Basic flavor vegetables:  Onion, garlic, chopped bell pepper. 
.
.
2. Fat:  Bacon fat, veg oil.
.
.
3. Sauce base:  Canned tomatoes, pureed bell peppers. 
.
I've also used sweet potato as a sauce base, but that doubles up with another category, ""sweet"".
.
.
4. Fillers:  Ground beef, ground lamb, black beans, kidney beans.
.
.
5. Liquids:  Use a GOOD broth, not shit. Any kind (I used chicken in the chilli for the meetup).
.
Beer and wine do OK too, but beer doubles as a bittering agent.
.
.
6. Basic flavorings:  Cumin, corriander, cinnamon, Worchester Sauce. 
.
Go heavy on the cumin and corriander.
.
.
7. Sweet:  Raisins, carrots, sweet potato, apples, cider, fresh corn (especially scrapings from a raw cob), or molasses. 
.
.
8. Bitter:  Oregano, thyme, turmeric, beer, cilantro.
.
.
9. Umame:  Mushrooms, soy sauce, MSG.
.
.
10. Heat:  Fresh or dried chilies, tobasco sauce, etc.
.
.
.
Directions:
.
Fry the flavor vegetables in the fat (put peppers in first, then onion, then garlic, based on how quick they cook). Throw in lots of your dried flavors (cumin, corriander). Add your mushrooms now too if you ate using them.
.
Flavor the meat (salt, pepper, more of the dried spices) and brown in more fat. You can add the meat to the fried veggies now or later. Pour some of your liquids over it for more flavor, and evaporate it off.
.
Add your liquids to the fried veggies and scrape the pan. Add your sauce base and other ingredients and cook it down to how you like it, stirring to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pot. 
.

It's been a while since the last official [/r/singapore](/r/singapore) meetup in ~~Brewerks for Hallowe'en~~ Indochine so I think it's about time we organised another one.

Friday the 20th seems like a good date to me since it's 2 weeks away (so nobody will be able to say they didn't know about it) and it's not so close to Chinese New Year that it interrupts with other functions and events you may have planned.

The floor is open up to suggestions for a location so please voice your ideas! We will need somewhere that can accommodate at least 20 people. Indochine, Brewerks, Baden and Bar Bar Black Sheep worked pretty well, so if you know somewhere similar, convenient and not too expensive, then let us know.

Leave a note here if you're planning on coming along too, so we can get an idea of how many we need to book for.

On a personal note, this will be my last meetup (*sigh*) since I'm leaving SG and going home to Ireland a few days later. I hope we can make it a great night. :)",,False,self,t5_2qh8c,True,,green,True,t3_o3r3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o3r3t/make_a_note_rsingapore_meetup_on_friday_20th_of/,

Here are some of my questions: 

1) What drew you guys to creating video-games? 

2) What is a typical day like in the life of a game developer in the studio you're working for?

3) What are some of the toughest challenges of being a game developer in Singapore? 

4) What are your thoughts on the current state of the gaming industry in Singapore? 
   
5) What is the biggest obstacle preventing Singapore from producing heavyweight gaming companies such as Capcom, Bioware or Konami?

My company might be transfering me to Singapore and there are some things I'd like to know of in advance

1) How tolerant in general are Singaporeans of foreigners? I'm Portuguese and consider myself white (although many would argue we aren't, ha) if that's relevant. 

2) Do you think I should visit the country ahead if I get the opportunity, before making my decision?

3) How expensive does it usually run to order things from outside the country? One thing I seem to find from my searches is that local commerce, while very prevalent, is mainly very bland. I expect I would be online shopping a lot.

4) Is pornography really illegal? Should I clean my computer before going? 

5) How necessary is a car to get around? My main objective while taking the transfer opportunity is accumulating wealth. Acquiring a car in Singapore sounds prohibitively counter productive to this goal.

My lease with my current apartment got over in April. I was interested in renewing as was my landlady and we agreed upon a price but I didn't sign anything. Then one weekend she calls and says she's getting calls from agents offering more rent so she managed to arm twist me into increasing by 50 bucks a month. Then a week later it happened again and I said nothing doing, I told her very nicely that I'm not interested in renewing and I found another place within a day. 

Now she starts hunting for a tenant but she still hasn't found one and she's gonna be losing about 6k+ in agent fees and because of a months lost rent. But she's still being very nice to me till the minute I leave. There was a lot of my stuff in the house (worth around 1.2K) that I want to sell off so on the day I'm moving out, she says instead of selling it she'll ask the new tenant if he's interested in buying it off and she'll transfer the deposit in the evening. Being the trusting naive fool that I am, I agree. 

Then in the evening I get a call saying that the new tenant is not interested in our stuff (because she assumes I'm gonna just throw it out as I don't have space for it in my new flat), so I say fine, I'll just pick up my stuff. Then she's like why don't you sell it to me for cheap.....I say how cheap....she's like I'll give you 200 bucks for all of it (this is a dryer, a microwave, a couch , a computer desk, a coffee table and a bedside table). I was like that's ridiculous.....It's worth like 1K+. 

Then she's really shows her teeth....she's like 'Ohhh I've had to do so much work here and this is broken and that was broken so you give me your stuff for this much or you come and do all the repair/painting work yourself.' and she's basically telling me that I've destroyed her house and I need to repair the whole thing.  

Now she's holding my deposit as well as my stuff hostage and saying that everything in the house needs to be changed/repaired.......what the hell do I do? Can I go to the police or some sort of consumer court?

My understanding is that pretty much everyone (except for maybe some older people or recent migrants/foreign workers) can speak English fluently, although some people may use Singlish far more than ""Standard"" English.  I also know that students learn their ""mother tongue"" in school, and so most people can speak at least some Mandarin/Malay/Tamil (depending on their race).

Do you speak English or other languages most of the time with your friends? At work? Out and about?

Does this change depending on whether the person is younger/older/the same age as you? (e.g. if you're talking to an elderly person who might not have had much schooling in English)

If you're talking to another person of the same race that you do not know (e.g. a stranger on the bus), do you use English or your mother tongue? How do you know which to use?

How about in the home environment? Do your parents speak the same language with you that they spoke with their parents? If not, was it a conscious decision to change or did it just happen?

Do you ever get into situations with people where you don't have any languages in common?

Bonus question for Chinese Singaporeans - can you only speak Mandarin, or do you know/use other dialects?

I have mixed feelings. I do appreciate the concern that social unrest would cause.

Singapore has been mostly hands off on the whole censoring-the-internet thing (for practical reasons) and I do not view this as a good precedent at all.

Therefore, a meetup shall happen. 

This is going to be like the previous one at the botanic gardens where folks just bring food and drinks, and $ to buy more drinks. We spend the night eating/drinking/talking, that's it. Super chill atmosphere where you can meet people and get sloshed (if you choose to). For those of you who are new here, Singapore does not have any open container laws. 

I know the NUS meetup is on the 14th and everyone is welcomed, but one can never have too many meetups (also this would be great for people busy on fridays, or feel awkward going to a campus for a meetup). 

This is happening on F1 Saturday and is great for people who have nothing to do then(the big race is on Sunday, so don't worry). 

The only problem now is this: WHERE SHOULD THIS HAPPEN???

If no good ideas come up for where this should happen (a park or somewhere we can chill openly) then we shall go back to the botanic gardens. Preferably this shouldn't happen at gardens by the bay, because the f1 race nearby would (probably) cause some crowding in the area.

Fiance and I have balloted over 10 times in the BTO exercises and failed. We have met up with our MP (we live in the same area) and was only advised to go through the ballot system as nothing else can be done.

Even with that, the BTO's increasing prices are becoming a worry. In our case.. a 550k flat will have us paying until we retire!

Resale is a definite nono, the current COV prices is something that neither of us could save up for even if we went without eating and drinking.

Pricing for ECs, Condos and DBSS are not in our affordable range either.

Current living arrangements with parents are doable for the short-term (My family of 5 is living in a 4 room-er, so is his), and really not wanting to resort to asking our families for loans (Just feeling that they should enjoy whatever they saved however little for their twilight years).

Why not make a trip to [Pulau Ubin?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulau_Ubin)!

So we've decided to open to all of glorious r/Singapore. The date would be the 7th of November (this year of course) as it's a public holiday. 

 A single trip there should cost about $3, so prepare $6 for a 2-way trip. We'll probably be cycling as well, walking around ubin is boring. If you can't cycle, find someone to rent a tandem bike with you! Estimated cost for bicycle rental is about $8-12 for a full day, for a good/decent bike. However you can probably rent them from as low as $2 a day. Do remember to ask for a bike lock when renting the bicycle. 

A rough plan for the day is as follows: Bring lunch and water with you, we'll cycle around for a while and stop at a beach for lunch at around 1pm. After which we can head to [Chek Jawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chek_Jawa) for a couple of hours and enjoy ourselves. [NParks' Website](http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/popup/pulau-attractions.html) says that in order to fully experience chek jawa the tide should be below 0.5m. Sadly on the 7th it doesn't go below that.. (lowest is 1.1m, at 1500H). 


After which we can continue cycling around the island and see quarries/temples/wildboars or whatever. Leave the island at  6pm, head for dinner at Changi Village (pretty damn good food there and food at Ubin kinda sucks), and head home. $25 should be more than enough to cover your needs for the whole day. 

Things to bring:

* $$

* Snacks, **Water and Lunch** 

* Mosquito Repellant (as strong as you can get)

* A hat and or shades ~~and a tailored Italian suit~~

* Poncho/Umbrella ... Just in case.

* Your favorite sun screen

* Camera! (You won't regret this)

* OPTIONAL: A change of clothes, if you want to play in the water (lol) or if you perspire like Moist from Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long blog. 

* Whatever else you think you may need


**A piece of advice: Sometimes on ubin your cellphone will pick up the Malaysian telco signal instead of the Singapore one. So please switch off your mobile internet/3G when you're on the island to avoid being ass-raped by your telco.** 


Pulau ubin is mainland Singapore's hardcore cousin.. so don't expect fairies and butterflies (ok, maybe you'll see some butterflies). If we're lucky we'll get to see cool animals unique to the island. Maybe we'll all get lost together, who knows! But that's the spirit of adventure. Please leave a message here if you're interested in going! 

I'll finalize the details by the end of the week. But expect the current date and time to be stuck to. Think about it! 



If you have questions just post below or PM me. If you want my number you can PM me too. My name's Tim. 

**LATEST UPDATE: This is confirmed to be on the 7th November. If you're driving/taking a cab, meet everyone at Changi Village Jetty at 9.45am. If you're taking a bus, meet everyone at Tanah Merah MRT Station at 9am. To get to the Jetty, we'll have to take bus 2 from tanah merah bus stop and stop at changi village terminal, then take a 5 minute walk to the Jetty. Remember to pack your lunch, we'll be eating on Noordin/Mamam Beach at Pulau Ubin. For those who have no idea who I am or how to find any of us at Tanah Merah, please PM me and I'll get back to you with my number, as well as Darren's number (hope you don't mind), in case I fail to pick up my phone (he's the unofficial co-organizer).**

Would love to live with some Redditors!,20,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/h8vd0/moving_to_singapore_for_6_months_would_love_to/,"So, I'm moving to Singapore for 6 months for PhD work. I've been browsing around the various HDB rental websites (PropertyGuru etc.) looking at places available. I just had the idea though to ask if any fellow Redditors have a room available for me, or know of one?

I'm a 25 year old Irish male. I'll be working in A*STAR, next to one-north MRT. I'll be arriving in Singapore on the 30th of May and starting work on the 1st of June. I don't mind staying in a hostel for up to a week.

I like gaming, playing bass guitar, like rock/punk/metal music, I'm into running, swimming and cycling, I love going out. Can't wait to see what Singapore has in store for me.

If you know of anything that could help me out, reply here or send me a private message.

Cheers

1) smoke smell

2) the thickness of the smoke 
so much so that i cannot even see the HDBs that arent even that far.

as such, i turned around and headed home, closed the windows and sat in the aircon.

are the indonesians clearing and burning forests again?

There's only 3 left now and one of them has been trapped. (S)he won't be getting taken away until tomorrow and they said if I can find a home for it they won't take it away.

He's been trapped for a day or so now, I've been bringing him food and water. The little guy is probably not much older than 4 weeks and he seems pretty lost without momma. He's friendly enough, doesn't act aggressive when I bring him food and probably would settle in to being a house cat pretty well. 

Please, if you or someone you know likes or wants a cat help this little guy out. I'm located near Pearl's Hill Park, but I'm willing to bring him to you. I just don't want the little feller to be put down :(.

edit- [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BCuzrPNCcAAj0De.jpg) is a photo of him.  He was trapped outside in the storm earlier today, but has since been moved somewhere undercover.

edit 2- I brought the little guy inside, he's in my spare bathroom (newspapered and with food and water).  He's a little spooked about people, but friendly enough. He's already learned the joy of ear scratchies and seems to be warming up to me a bit.  I looked at his little pee hole and I'm 99% sure he's a boy.  [here he is all dried off](http://i.imgur.com/t1glOSy.jpg)

Edit 3- someone has put me in contact with Cat Lady Wong. He will be going there to be taken care of until he can find a home.
