",118,26,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/13ebm3/do_not_i_repeat_do_not_go_to_the_artisan_after/,"I met a girl at the bar who was probably way too into me for it to be realistic. Bought her and myself a drink with cash. She then proceeded to buy many drinks for her and her friends, who then told the bartenders I agreed to pay for their drinks. I vigorously denied it, but was swarmed by three huge bouncers. I asked the bouncers if I could speak to them outside, and they told me I wasn't going anywhere. After a lot of intimidation, I gave them my card, and paid 106 dollars for drinks I never agreed to buy. When I spoke to one of the managers working at the door, he told me the police wouldn't care because the crime was less than 1000 dollars and I should just go get a hooker. Also, because I was dancing with the girl, that was considered proof to them I agreed to buy the drinks. Then they kicked me out and let the girls go.

I feel pretty violated. I want to spread the word to as many people as possible that the place is poison. I can't get my money back, but I can speak as a victim of this scam, and hope to help others to not fall for the same scam I did.

**UPDATE**: Artisan Vegas has contacted me after seeing my Yelp review and has asked me to call them tomorrow. Since the transaction still hasn't posted I can't do a chargeback till then anyway. Hopefully I won't have to go through the bank and they can just apologize and give me my money back.",,False,,t5_2qhrs,1353364813.0,,,True,t3_13ebm3,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/13ebm3/do_not_i_repeat_do_not_go_to_the_artisan_after/,

1376262280.0,79,self.vegas,1k65k0,An /r/Vegas public service announcement. Basics on how to survive Vegas from a local.,96,17,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1k65k0/an_rvegas_public_service_announcement_basics_on/,"Here are some general guidlnes for The Strip in general as I've lived here for a dozen years and work the strip every day. 

1) Guys: any unknown girl/woman who comes up and starts grinding on you is not interested in the D, she's trying to pick your pocket. Please remember that anyone intruding on your personal space should be immediately deemed suspicious.

2) You cannot just cross the street wherever you want. Please use a marked crosswalk or a pedestrian bridge. If you get hit by a car outside of a marked crosswalk in Vegas, not only will you have just been likely injured, but legally the accident will be your fault. You will get a jaywalking ticket (they will come to the hospital to issue it) and the fine will be doubled (to about $400) because you caused the accident. Any damage your body does to the vehicle will also be your financial responsibility. 

3) Anybody playing 3 card monte or the shell game on a portable table, upturned cardboard box or milk crate on a sidewalk or bridge **IS NOT** offering you a legitimate gambling opportunity. They are there to rip you off. The people who appear to be ""winning"" are in on the scam. *The people running these games are committing felonies (illegal gaming) and are only there to take your money.* **You will not win**. Common sense should dictate that as you're on the Strip, surrounded by 20-30 of the most opulent casinos in the world, some thug-looking dude on a folding table is NOT going to pay you lots of quick cash. Duh. 

4) Taxi cabs cannot pick you up off the street. You cannot stand on a curb and hail a cab. This is illegal for taxis to do and, if seen by police, the driver will be cited. You must go to a designated taxi stand at the main entrance of any Hotel / Casino. 

5) Yes, you can take your cocktail or beer outside with you but **on the strip only**. To add to this, yes, you can take your open beer or drink with you inside a taxi cab or limo, but please don't take your open alcohol with you in your own car or your buddies car and please never drink and drive. 

6) Everything on the strip is bigger than you expect and farther than it looks. Just because you can see the sign for the T.I. doesn't mean you can walk there in 5 minutes. It's more like 15. And plan on another 20 minutes of walking once you get *inside* the casino. Wear comfortable shoes. Hiking on hot concrete for 2 or 3 miles in flip flops, stiletto's or bigass wedges isn't recommended. You will have blisters and will likely sunburn the tops of your feet. Don't be ""that girl"" holding her heels and walking barefoot down the disgusting sidewalk that's been peed, pooped and puked on. The bottoms of your feet will be jet black and sooty within 10 minutes. 

7) Please remember to party within your own limits. Here in Vegas there is no ""Last Call"". The drinks keep flowing, the music keeps bumping, the lights keep flashing, the girls keep dancing and time means nothing. Many people cannot handle this and quickly exceed their own tolerance for alcohol and thus ruin their vacation. Please don't be that unconscious guy that the paramedics have to pull out of the bushes.",,False,,t5_2qhrs,False,,,True,t3_1k65k0,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1k65k0/an_rvegas_public_service_announcement_basics_on/,

1. Don't drink and drive! [Call Tipsy Tow](http://savvycities.com/aaas-tipsy-tow-program/)
2. If you want to get drunk and roam around the city [take the bus for free](http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/183367631.html)
3. Still don't know what to do for New Year's Eve? [Here's the best events guide I've seen](http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/dec/28/event-guide-new-years-eve-weekend-2012/)
4. If you just want to get drunk, here's a [$20 for all you can drink deal](http://www.silvertoncasino.com/events/vegas-event-schedule.aspx)
5. If you plan on hanging out on Fremont, [you'll have to pay](https://ticketcake.com/event/downtown-countdown-nye-2013/las-vegas/2012-12-31)
6. If you plan on hanging out on the Strip, you will be in good company (if you enjoy the company of 150,000+ people).  Last year we easily parked at the Gold Coast at around 10:30pm and walked down Flamingo to the Strip, watched the fireworks, cheered at New Years, then nearly got crushed as everyone decided to head home at 12:10am.
7. Wear a jacket, it's supposed to be about 30 degrees tomorrow night (intoxication and hypothermia make an unpleasant combination).
8. Driving near The Strip or downtown area will be nightmarish so [plan accordingly](http://www.8newsnow.com/story/20442297/strip-road-closures-announced-for-new-years-eve)
9. According to the LVA: The firing locations for the Strip firework display are the Stratosphere, Venetian, Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Aria, MGM Grand, and Treasure Island. The show is expected to last just over 8 minutes and is put on by Gucci. 
10. Or you can stay home, watch the countdown on TV...and reddit.

Anyone active with homeless outreach that might be able to help me out?",65,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1ke9rj/dad_is_homeless_in_vegas_i_havent_heard_from_him/,"My dad talks to me basically every 2-3 days. Or at least he did. When I lived down there, it was simply a matter of taking a day off, heading down to the strip or the empty lot across the freeway from Mandalay and finding him. Now, it's not as easy as I'm 800 or so miles away. 

He works (worked?) for Sierra Carpet Cleaning. I've called and talked to his boss, and he was supposed to have my dad call me. That was a few weeks ago, and I haven't heard anything since. 

It's not like him to be out of contact this long, even if he has to borrow a phone. He's been struggling for a while with (what he claims is) Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cirrhosis and cancer. I think it's more likely the effects of decades of meth use and cirrhosis. Either way, I want to make sure he's ok. 

He generally hangs out on the bridges from Trop to MGM, or Fashion Show/TI/Venetian. 

If anyone thinks they could help, I'd be grateful. 

**Edit: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/co2Il)** I don't have very many of him. He's generally skinny like the second one, but with a beard and hair like the first one. Name is Robert or Andy. May have a dirty little Toto looking dog with him. Hangs out with a long hair hippy looking dude named Joker. 

Knew I could find a good mugshot of him. [This is closer to his normal appearance.](http://i.imgur.com/nSTIJNx.jpg)",,False,,t5_2qhrs,1376615870.0,,,True,t3_1ke9rj,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1ke9rj/dad_is_homeless_in_vegas_i_havent_heard_from_him/,

Turns out that these two young ladies could not change a tire for the life of them. I proceeded to help out and after replacing the tire with the spare I wished them safe travels. I know you two will probably never read this but I just wanted to let you know that I needed this. I was feeling down and worthless and something told me to take a different way to work. Helping you out really showed me that I am worth something. I felt great after helping you out. So I guess all I want to say is thank you Gabby and Emily?( didn't really catch your name).

Maybe bake an epic shitload of cookies or something? I know some folks do cookie bakes at Christmas time for various non-profits, I bet I could wrangle them in to something like this, and if a couple dozen people make a couple dozen cookies, we'd have a crazy amount of baked goods to take up there and say ""Thanks for saving the goddamn mountain!!!"" 


Questions to answer:

- What? Is the cookie idea good, or lame? What about letters? Post cards? Hot food? Cold food? Or ""anything"" good, so long as it's a kind out showing of support? 

- Should we solicit donations from local places, like Retro Cupcakes, etc., to get in on the action? Or let it go grassroots and if those places want in, they can get on their own? 

- Where? I'm not sure where would be a good place to take everything would be... if i recall, Centennial Hills HS is the command post, no? 

- Is this a good idea, or shit? 

What're your thoughts, r/vegas??

It sounded like the 23rd of this month would be a good day to host a BBQ Meetup. So here are the details. (if a mod could add this to the sidebar that'd be great)

[Here are some pics of the space](http://imgur.com/a/EjFEA#0)

The inside is large too, in the event of weather issues, or anyone set on watching football. 

I offer... **the top 10 reasons you should attend a BBQ hosted by a Canadian.**

**10:** If you break shit, I'll probably apologize

**9:** Moose meat supplied for all those curious (no not really)

**8:** You'll likely only hear me whine a couple times about the NHL lockout

**7:** If you are embarrassed of showing off your really weak tan, my torso looks like that of a shark

**6:** House was previously owned by a pro poker player but there PROBABLY won't be Vegas gangsters looking for unpaid debts, since it is a Sunday.

**5:** You can probably beat me at hoops. But I reserve the right to hip-check

**4:** I won't cancel due to rain, since I am used to it raining every other day where I'm from

**3:** WiFi Access for those that can't live without. You know who you are.

**2:** If you're a shut-in, I won't be weird about you spending time in the house. Just no snooping in the large deep freeze! No reason! Shut up!

And the **#1** reason you should attend a BBQ hosted by a Canadian.... I can't promise it won't be a sausage fest...but if it is, it'll be maple sausage.

Seriously though. Would love to see a decent turn out. I'm not on Facebook, so if someone wants to get the word out on the r/vegas FB page that'd be sweet. 

I'll supply stuff like buns, condiments, chips, a couple salads, and non alcoholic beverages. You **bring your meat, and beer etc.**

If some could bring a side of some sort to share (extra veggies or dessert etc) that'd be great.

Just **PM me for the exact address**, but for the sake of reference it's essentially the corner of Lone Mountain road and Conough Lane. (Gated neighbourhood)

Thanks and I look forward to meeting you!

RJ

Edit:  I know you all are used to pool access more than I am, but regardless, feel free to bring trunks if you want to swim or whatever.

Edit Edit: Going to have the address posted on the Facebook event page. Watch that space.

Some of my favorite places are little local shops that don't get nearly as many customers as they deserve.  It makes me sad when places like Johnny Mcguires go out of business, and I don't get to eat there anymore.  So I want to share some of my favorite places that will probably go out of business soon.  I don't really think there's anything we can do to save them, but you should at least try them while you can.  

These are a few that come to the top of my head.  I'm sure I'll think of more later.

[Buldogis](http://buldogis.com/menu.html)
 
I've been craving a Buldogis hot dog with korean bbq beef and home made mayo on it so bad.  This place is close to Red Rock Casino.        

[Volcano Grille](http://www.volcanogrille.com/menu.html) 

This little place is just south of Arroyo Crossing, near 215 and Rainbow on the south side.  The star of their show is the sauce bar.  The sweet ginger sauce is fantastic.

[Giuseppe's](http://www.giuseppeslv.com/c-7-giuseppes-specialties.aspx)

Just north of 215 on Durango, in the southwest corner of 215.  If you like chicken parm at all, get their Crusted Chicken Mozzarella.  It doesn't have the heavy breading of chicken parm, and it is one of my favorite Italian dishes in this town at any price.

[Pho Thanh Huong](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-huong-restaurant-las-vegas)

If you want pho, go to Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain.  If you want an absolutely amazing sandwich for $3, get the BBQ pork sandwich here.  It is in a grungy little strip mall south of UNLV on the SW corner of Trop and Maryland.

It got to the point that I had to pawn a Claddagh ring I had worn for over 35 years, which my mom had given me on my 13th birthday, which she had gotten from her father who made them in Claddagh-Galway, Ireland. It broke my heart to pawn it but I figured that as soon as I was flush with a few dollars in my pocket, I would get it back. Well fast-forward to last week: I had given my girlfriend the money and pawn ticket to pick it up while I was at work and she called me around 2pm and said she had picked it up. I got home actually excited to get it back on my finger and when I opened the box, I was in shock. In the box, in place of my Claddagh ring, which weighed amost 3/4 of an ounce was a cheap imitation claddagh ring, which appears to be gold plated. I was pissed and heart-broken all at the same time. I grabbed the bag, the receipt from the pawn shop and we went back to the store. After exhausting a handful of excuses and just as many employees in my quest to get my ring, I finally demanded the manager. I will say at this point that I never became loud, obnoxious or threatening in any way. The manager told me this: ""The ring I just re-payed $150. to get was MY ring and once my GF left with the ring, the SHE probably swapped it and that's all they are going to do about it"" I told her point blank that she was a thief and that either she was a crappy manager for not caring that her staff was stealing or the she was in collusion with them. She told me to get the fuck out of HER store and sicced her security on me to remove me. I had the ring appraised - which was valued at a whole $20-25, had my father fax me a copy of the receipt from NY (yes he did still have it) and now I'm wondering if going to the police is even worth the effort.

My brother is missing and he has been since last fall. The family is worried and no one really knows what to do. There have been short periods of time where he has fallen off the map, but never for very long.



**Update**: Thanks to the internets, I've found him! (Well, sort of). Someone found a twitter account! From the looks of it, he opened the twitter account just after he sent the suicide letters and stopped using facebook, turned his cell off, etc... 

After reading his updates, he seems like he is just fine. Posting regularly (albeit some paranoia) and appears to be fine. He listed his location as ""seattle, ny &amp; chicago"", so I still don't know where he is. At least I know he is alive.

I won't try to contact him since he went out of his way to disappear and sending a deliberate suicide note and putting everyone through the ringer was a pretty shady thing to do. I was able to tell our family that he appears to be fine which has been a huge relief for everyone. 

Thanks everyone!!

I just wish I would have been able to attend more of them, and get to know you more closely. 

Unfortunately, I've had a string of very bad luck since January, and won't be able to stay anymore. Thursday morning I'll be leaving town to go stay with family in Utah and try to get my life back in order. 

I hope to return one day, hopefully in a better spot. But for now, to all the people in this city that helped me, befriended me, and to the city that gave me the best time of my life, I just needed somewhere to say  thank you. And Goodbye.

First we drove past a religious complex in the middle of nowhere, with plenty of creepy (to me) signs along the way. We continued on and saw a sign for the China Ranch Date Farm. At first I thought it was another lady ranch, but my girlfriend with her non-gutter mind informed me it was not that kind of date.

We headed towards it, down a long winding dirt road, and suddenly there was an island of green and palm trees. Completely unexpected. There was a gift shop and a few structures. We got a variety pack of dates, date shakes, and explored the grounds. Really neat.

I was just looking it up to show a friend and I noticed the Film Location link on their site:

""In 2001 Paramount Studios used China Ranch for the desert scenes of their hit movie ""The Sum of All Fears"", starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman.""

I had to give [my kitty](http://imgur.com/a/DYtbk) of 8 years to a friend while I moved to France temporarily.  We decided that my friend would provide her with a permanent home, but I was allowed to take her back when/if I returned.  My friend moved from Ohio to Las Vegas, took my cat with her, and didn't research the apartment complex pet policy. I don't know anyone in the Vegas area who could have adopted her, so she had to give my cat to a shelter.  [I think I may have found her.](http://www.petharbor.com/pet.asp?uaid=LSVG.A637219)

I'm coming back at some point in August to move to Los Angeles.  I can't adopt my kitty from Paris and I don't know that I'll be able to provide her a good home when I arrive in Los Angeles because I'm currently looking for live-in employment as an au pair again or as a personal assistant.  

I am going to call the shelter and see if there is a way to verify that this is my kitty.  If it is, I will see if they can take care of her until August, but I am sickened by the thought of Xerox living in a shelter for 4 months.  I know it's a lot to ask someone to take care of her for 4 months and then just give her away.  I'm not opposed to finding a permanent home for her, as long as it is a permanent home where someone will love her and care for her and be patient with her.  She doesn't do well with other pets.  We used to have another cat and they learned to live with one another, but in a house with numerous cats or a dog she would not do well, which is why I think she's already been returned to this shelter.

My personal list:  
  
[KoMex](http://www.yelp.com/biz/komex-fusion-express-las-vegas) - Korean &amp; Mexican fusion. I'm never on this side of town, but whenever I do I have to drop by here. I recommend the Fusion Flautas and the Dak-gogi (chicken) Quesadilla.  
[Egg &amp; I](http://www.yelp.com/biz/egg-and-i-las-vegas) - Also have two other locations in town called Egg Works. My personal favorite is the chicken, mushroom &amp; spinach breakfast skillet or the eggs benedict.  
[Bachi Burger](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas) - My go to spot for burgers and always a favorite whenever friends from out of town want to go to dinner. Kiki's Burger, medium rare with extra Garlic Chili Aioli and a order of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  
[Sora Ramen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-sora-las-vegas) -  Cheap ramen. What else is there to say? Chashu ramen with shio soup base is the best.  
[Kyara Japanese Tapas](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kyara-japanese-tapas-las-vegas-2) -  All you can eat sushi is way overplayed now. I like this place because it's Firefly...except Japanese! I try to order something different everytime, but I always order the Kushi Mori (skewer sampler).   
[Oyster Bar inside Palace Station](http://www.yelp.com/biz/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2) - It's a 24 hour oyster bar. Dozen oysters and either the Combo Pan Roast or cioppino. I usually go there on dates and split the entree with that person because it's too much food for one person unless you're SUPER hungry.  
[Tacos El Gordo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas-2) - Best drunk food on the Strip. You don't even know how many times I leave XS or Surrender and head over here to try and sober up. Adobada tacos all the way!  
[Island Flavor](http://www.yelp.com/biz/island-flavor-las-vegas) - Best Hawaiian restaurant in town. Be forewarned about the huge portions there. There's a reason why you'll only see Hawaiians eating there.  
[Firefly](http://www.yelp.com/biz/firefly-las-vegas-3) - Everyone knows about Firefly. If you haven't and you're a local Las Vegan...wat.  
[Asian BBQ &amp; Noodles](http://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-bbq-and-noodles-las-vegas) - They're known for their roast pork and shrimp won ton soup. Try the roast duck too if you feel adventurous. Super cheap, always busy especially during lunch and a genuine hole in the wall that everyone needs to try.",,False,,t5_2qhrs,False,,,True,t3_14nrgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/14nrgy/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_local_restaurants/,

(x-post from r/beer)",25,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1c8ee2/my_rundown_of_where_to_drinkget_beer_in_las_vegas/,"This is my write-up of my favorite places (so far) here in town. Thought you guys might like it too.
-------------------------------------------------------------

*Awhile Back I did a beer write-up for a new co-worker who also has a love for great beer. Here's that write-up. It's from a local's point of view, but there are some Strip locations in there too for the tourists. Enjoy!*

Who’s ready for some beer? There are a bunch of cool places in town, so here is the rundown of my favorites.

(The shortened links go to a Google search for each place. Some of the websites aren’t available at work, so e-mail this to yourself at home and you can see all the beer glory when you get there).

**Places to buy beer:**

* *Lee’s Liquor* – You’re probably familiar with this one already, but Lee’s is a Vegas staple. It’s got a huge liquor selection but is also good for a solid selection of microbrews and craft beers. I usually stop by here if I’m heading to a get-together and plan on bringing a [few six packs.](http://bit.ly/SVoat5)

* *Total Wine* – Remember Lee’s Liquor? Forget everything you’ve ever learned about Lee’s Liquor. Total Wine is the Mecca of wine, beer, and everything in between. They have everything that can be legally shipped here (so no, Yuengling isn’t available). I’m not sure what side of town you live on, but the one in Summerlin in the Boca Park restaurant/shopping area is the one I go to. All of their best beers aren’t chilled, so if you plan on going beer crazy make sure to factor in the day or two it will need to be in [the fridge first.](http://bit.ly/VXINm5)

**Places that Brew Beer:**

*BJ’s Restaurant* and *Gordon Biersch* are the big chain breweries here in town. But here’s some with more of a local flavor.

* *Tenaya Creek Brewery* – Also in Summerlin, this is one of Vegas’ most well known breweries. I’ve been there once and have tried all of their beers either there or in restaurants around town. There are only two downsides to this place. 1.) They are a Steelers bar on Sundays (go Raiders). 2.) They don’t serve food. If you go on Sunday they usually do a potluck style things where people bring in food, and I hear they have food trucks out in the parking lot pretty regularly. If you ask super nice, or just ask normal, you can probably convince them to give you a tour of [the brewery itself.](http://bit.ly/WLAC2f)

* *Big Dog’s Brewing Company and Restaurant* – There are two locations for Big Dog’s (there used to be three, but the one out near the base closed). The Draft House on Rancho is the only one of the remaining two that I have visited. 

It. Is. Awesome. 

They have their own brewed beer and house mixes (the 38-special is one I highly recommend). They are a Packer bar on Sundays, but they have great sports bar food with kind of a German feel to it. There are a lot of sausage-based entrees. I love their rib-eye sandwich and chicken strips appetizer with medium sauce. Along with their own brews, they also have guest brews from around the nation and the rest of the world. This is [definitely worth going to.](http://www.bigdogsbrews.com/pubs/)

* *Ellis Island Casino and Brewery* – This is probably my favorite place to go to in town when I’m starting the night or want really good cheap food and good beer. Really good for the price, that is. Good is relative when it's not Budweiser but it's still that cheap. Ellis Island is unique in that it doesn’t charge and outrageous amount for really good beer and it is just off of The Strip. At the Café in the casino they have a $7.99 deal 24 hours a days that gets you a steak, potatoes (baked, mashed, or fires), vegetables, a soup or salad and a 22oz glass of one of their beers (they also do root beer). I think it is the best deal in town. The deal is only available in the restaurant side of the café and will usually require a little bit of a wait, but it’s worth it. While you wait, just drink more beer. Their tall glasses of their own brews are only about 2-3 dollars a glass, which beats the $6 PBRs out on The Strip. I have no bad words to say about Ellis Island. Okay, it can be a little shady (it’s attached to a Super 8 motel), but I’ve never had any issues danger-wise. Just go there and have fun (it’s also known for the best Karaoke in Vegas in the bar area, so make sure to practice in the [car on the way over).](http://www.ellisislandcasino.com/ellis/ellis_landing.html)

**Places for Fancy Shmancy Beer**

* *Todd English’s P.U.B. (Aria/City Center)* – Attached to the Aria and Crystals (a high-end mall in the City Center), the P.U.B. is a favorite of mine for watching sports while eating good food and drinking exotic beer. They have all the varieties in a wide arrange of sizes (pint, pilsner, ginormous, can, tulip, etc.). They also have a 7 second pint challenge where you can get any beer for free so long as you drink it in 7 seconds. The only rule is the beer must start on the bar (but it doesn’t say you can’t start your face right next to the beer). The food has kind of an American-Asian Fusion thing going on, and it’s all good. Plus, they have cool bar games even though they are in more of an upscale environment. Foozball, sports, beer, food. It’s pretty much what [heaven looks like.](http://bit.ly/RMXWXu)

* *The Public House (The Venetian)* – Editor’s Note: Do not, under any circumstances, confuse this place with the abomination that shares the same name at the Luxor. That is more of a sports bar type of place, but the food is pretty bad and the beer selection is really limited.

Here is my hands down, “you can die happy if you gone here”, place. Like Todd English’s it’s a little more upscale, but you don’t need to get super dressed up or anything. The “upscale” part applies more to the price than anything. The food here is great which is why it is a little pricey. But the main attraction is the beer. They have a huge list (that you get to scroll through by iPad) of bottles, drafts, cans and cask beers. Cask beer, if you don’t already know, is the purest form of beer delivered straight from the barrel. Because of this it is usually around room temperature, but it is really good. But who has the final say on what awesome beers get selected for such an establishment? I’m glad you asked.

You have heard of wine sommeliers that have devoted their life to the knowledge and drinking of wine. Well, beer has that too. A Cicerone is the same concept, but for a much more delicious product (beer!). And The Public House is home to the only Cicerone in the entire state of Nevada. His name is Russell Gardner and he is like a beer magician. You tell him what kinds of beer you like, and what you’ll be eating, and he’ll find the beer that matches you. Russell has an amazing mustache/beard thing going on and is just a really cool guy. [Here’s Russell.](http://www.eatinglv.com/2012/01/russell-gardner-has-got-his-cicerone-goin-on/)

The Public House is my favorite beer spot in Vegas. Hopefully you’ll like it as [much as I do.](http://www.venetian.com/Las-Vegas-Restaurants/Casual-Dining/public-house/)

**Places That Eat, Sleep, and Breathe Beer**

* *The Freakin’ Frog* – Welcome back to college, where 21 year olds drink until they puke, and play beer bong to decide who will clean the common area this week. Freakin’ Frog is home to over 1,000 beers. Yes, your mind just processed that last sentence correctly. 1,000 beers. They have a walk in fridge full of the stuff that they let you go check out if you ask nicely. It’s a dive bar in comparison to places like the Public House, but it’s definitely not the worst atmosphere I’ve eaten in. They have good bar food like the “Crack’n’Cheese” (fried macaroni and cheese) and a bible/binder full of beer. They also boast the largest whiskey selection in all of North America in the second level of the bar. The owner, Adam Carmer, is a UNLV professor for alcohol (which is probably not a real thing, but he seemed to know what he was talking about). He actually invented a new technique for tasting whiskey that is crazy in how accurate it is. I took his “class” at the bar for a bachelor party (it’s like $70) and he had us try 7 different whiskies. After using his technique, you could actually smell every flavor inside of the whiskey. Cinnamon, rye, fruits, etc. It was a really good experience.  But that’s not what we’re here for right? We’re here for beer. And Freakin’ Frog is a must-see for anyone who partakes in an adult beverage [from time to time.](http://bit.ly/UrnNst)

* *Aces and Ales* - Yes, go to Aces and Ales. It has next-level bar food and great beer selection. They also have brewers that come in from the West Coast and Pacific Northwest for tastings, releases, and beer festivals (We're talking big breweries like Stone and Deschutes). They rotate their draft and bottle selection and have a knowledgeable staff that knows their beer. It's divey (and really, really dark for some reason), but they have a lot of great specials if you sign up for their e-mail list. Just today I got something from them that said if you have $20 of play you get a free 14oz Ribeye Steak Dinner, and that they were about to start hosting the home-brew competition for the area. They also show up on Groupon from time to time so you can get good deals there ($10 for $20 worth of food/drink for lunch, $20 for $40 worth of food/drink for dinner). Every kind of food I've had there is great, and they even have a new gourmet grilled cheese menu that has something like 6 or 8 different unique grilled-cheese sandwiches. Their Macaroni and Cheese, Pizza's, and Jalapeno Poppers are great. Actually, all of their food is great. I really like this place and go there for lunch sometimes since I work on that side of town. If they had a location closer to the Northwest, I'd be there every other day. This place knows beer and knows food and is a perfect location for both. 

Beer!

EDIT of my first EDIT: Fine, by popular demand, Aces and Ales gets a longer section.

EDIT2: And for the sake of all that is good and holy, stop mentioning the Yard House. Every write-up I do, someone mentions how I forgot the Yard House. I love 150 draft beers but 1.) it's a chain, and I wanted a more local write-up and 2.) these are my favorite places, not *every* place in Vegas. Please give out suggestions for your favorite places as well so I can try them out and maybe add them to my list!

I hope it's okay that I post this here. My wife and I have been trying to get away from the east coast for years and we finally decided to jump in feet first so to speak.

I hear this is where the locals hang so I was wondering if some of you might be kind enough to offer us some advice. We're planning on moving into a cheap apartment that only requires a 3 month lease. We have 3 cats so it's been hard to find a place that will take all of us. We're figuring that if we hate the place, we can move pretty quickly and will have a better idea of where we'd really like to live once we get there.

Is it crazy or stupid to get there without a job? We have enough money saved to last us a few months which we're hoping should be enough time to get established. 

So yeah, if you can offer any tips or any things to watch out for it would be much appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!

They treat their employees amazingly.",29,7,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/17gwux/telus_on_sahara_and_decatur_is_hiring_11hr/,"By far the best job I've heard of for someone with no experience and no connections.

I've heard so much about how jobs are scarce here. I know, I can't even count how many companies I applied to before hearing about Telus. Not to mention how poorly those companies treated me while I was applying. At Telus, they treat you so, so well, even before you've actually started working!

The Telus locations in the US do customer support for other companies. Right now they're hiring for Netflix. This is an AMAZING opportunity for anyone looking for a job right now (who likes the wage, obviously).

**EDIT: Here are some important things you need to know.**

This is a CUSTOMER SERVICE job. This means you'll be talking directly to customers about the product (in this case Netflix). You can do phone support or chat support, depending on which you're more comfortable with.

Before you apply, you have to complete the aptitude test. You take it in person at the Telus location from 8AM to 3:30PM. The test takes around an hour to complete. If you're fast about it, you can do it in about 40 minutes. The front desk will tell you if you passed immediately after taking the test. If you did pass, they send you to a staffing agency.

You MUST be 18 to work for Telus. This is because in Nevada, you must be 18 to consent to a drug test.

The agency takes your application and they'll tell you when the next group interview is. If you're selected after the interview process, they will call you to do a drug test. Then you enter training.

After working for Telus through your agency for a few months, you have the option to switch to Telus employment.

From a comment below: Piercings, tattoos, and unusual hair colors are completely fine. But if you do phone chat, you can't get like a tongue piercing that would destroy your ability to talk. Just common sense stuff. If you're doing chat, unless you somehow do something to yourself so that you can't type, it's all good.
If you have obscene tattoos, they just ask that you cover them.

If you want to put my name down as a referral, please PM me.

**EDIT 2: Also, they do NOT have part-time positions. After you're hired, you will be subject to random drug testing as well.**",,False,,t5_2qhrs,1359514149.0,,,True,t3_17gwux,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/17gwux/telus_on_sahara_and_decatur_is_hiring_11hr/,

A gentleman calls in and starts by saying that that he wasn't calling about the segment, but a different subject.

He thanked them for playing ""Baby Don't Fear The Reaper"" yesterday morning at 6:25 AM. His fiancee was one of the victims who lost their lives in the tragic bus stop wreck. They kept his call for a good two minutes, where he sobbingly went into explaining that he was praying to god for a sign from his wife that she was okay - or in a better place, and this was his sign. The silence from the hosts was absolutely sobering. He explained that they were married for 14 years, had a son, divorced, and were getting ready to get married again. 

The hosts were left mostly speechless. ""This call really brings this story right into the room..."" ""I don't even know if we can finish this segment. We'll be right back."" And they cut to commercial. 

I'm a grown ass man, and this nearly brought me to tears - driving to work when hearing this. So powerful and so moving. They replayed the call at least once an hour or so later.

I tried to find a recording, but I came up empty.

I play in a Stonesy/Neil Youngey band in Portland and we're going to Vegas on May 17th to play a wedding. We're flying out that day and back the next, so renting or transporting our equipment will cut significantly into the money we're making, which we're hoping will go a long way toward funding our next album. If we could borrow someone's gear, that's hundreds or even a thousand dollars less we have to spend that instead could go toward recording, and you'd really make our night.

In exchange, we can set you up with a show in Portland, a good show on a good night at a good venue. We're an established band with press and radio play and a following and good connections. We're not famous or anything, but we do pretty well for ourselves and we know a ton of other bands. Rest assured we'll be thoroughly indebted to you and will make it as worth your trip as possible. We might even be able to hook you up with some bands for any other west coast stops you're making.

Is there a band out there that will loan us some gear for a couple hours that evening? Here's what we need (and of course, if you don't have all this, whatever you do have will help):

* 3 mics and stands
* PA (for a smallish room)
* 3 electric guitars (with amps)
* acoustic guitar
* basic keyboard (acoustic piano, electric piano, hammond)

Injured puppy update!,22,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/va2wi/op_delivers_injured_puppy_update/,"As stated in the original posting (see: [reddit!](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/v8es2/this_little_guy_needs_our_help_rvegas/) for the lazy...) this little guy was hit by a car on Saturday the 16th near Flamingo and Maryland.  My friend Alex found him and took him to the local Emergency Shelter where he's being cared for under the good samaritan funds.  I first want to thank everyone for their kind messages and inquiry to this little guy.  

Sometime today, Animal Control will be moving this pup from the shelter he's at on Patrick to Lied for his three day waiting period.  Hopefully the owner will come forward and claim him, take care of him the way he should and we'll have a happy ending.  However, it's possible that the owner doesn't come forward or... and heartless as this sounds... they could come forward and decide not to take him back because of his physical ailment and inability to pay for vet bills.

Hey, times are hard.  Can't hate on anyone if they can't afford the nearly $2000 it may cost to have his surgery to repair is fractured pelvis.

Veterinarians believe he's about two years old and, yes, he's an all-white schnauzer.  When found, the only bit of dirt that was on him was on his paws, making the shelter believe he wasn't gone long from his owner.  Only as long as a day or so.  He was groomed, he didn't smell.  This was someone's pet, not a castoff that someone couldn't care for.  Which is good to know that he was loved and not abandoned.  

Because my friend Alex is an entertainer in this great city, and those who checked the last post can find his personal website, they've decided to start calling him ""Tuck.""

The doctor at Lied and at the emergency shelter know of the following both here and through Alex's facebook page and are giving this puppy a very special treatment.  He will NOT be locked away in a cage and forgotten about.  

Again, thank you to everyone who cares.  If you want to help, PM's are always nice and I can give you contact information for my friend Alex... or you can call Lied or the emergency animal shelter on E Patrick.

The plan as it stands is as follows: we will rendezvous at [Bass Pro Shops](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=maps+bass+pro+shops+las+vegas&amp;cid=15674663619949547009) at 11 AM at the [far east end of the lot](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=200845718631514859738.0004bff979f80813e0b6a&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=36.039629,-115.181721&amp;spn=0.001782,0.002642&amp;iwloc=0004bff97e819053d5e8d). This will give anyone who needs it a place to grab some ammo or other supplies (although I strongly advise you find what you plan to shoot in advance; ammo paranoia is apparently on the rise again) and perhaps more importantly, provides a place where one can unload a trunkful of guns and transfer to other vehicles as necessary without having Metro, NHP, the National Guard, the BATFE, and the Boy Scouts sicced on us. At 1115 or so we will proceed to the [shooting area near Sloan](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=200845718631514859738.0004ae2208bf71ffeef6e&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=35.856308,-115.212261&amp;spn=0.080834,0.169086). The road is fairly compacted dirt until the very last bit leading off to the spots; most cars should be fine or you can catch a ride with one of us with a truck if you prefer. I may or may not leave the meeting up part to someone like our fearless mod Chipware whilst I go ahead early to secure a good spot; that will be figured out before the day. 


Once we get all established, we will have a short safety brief before the firing line goes hot where we will cover firearms safety, range rules and etiquette, and what to do in case of an emergency. We will have plenty of ceasefires to go check or change out targets, and the more experienced shooters can help out the less experienced ones. SHOOTERS OF ALL LEVELS ARE ENCOURAGED TO COME ALONG. That's right, even if you have never shot before, we will get you sorted out and help you have a safe, fun time. Plan on 2-3 hours, or maybe a little longer. Also, we may do a late lunch or stop for a few brews afterward; that all remains to be seen.


Things to consider: we live in the desert. The desert is often hot. You should plan for this eventuality. Bring water and sunscreen. You might also want to bring a light snack, and maybe a camp chair if you like. NO ALCOHOL IF YOU WILL BE SHOOTING PLEASE. Firearms and alcohol are not a good mix. If anyone has an EZ Up or equivalent, it would be nice to have. If you have eye and ear protection, please bring it; if not, I have a bunch of safety glasses and ear plugs. 


If you have guns, bring 'em. If you don't, no problem, we will most likely have more than enough. I think last time we had at least twice as many guns as shooters, so that shouldn't be an issue. I personally will be bringing a couple .22 rifles, a .22 pistol, a .45, a 9mm Mak CZ, an AR-15, a Mosin Nagant, a pump shotgun, and a 9mm S&amp;W M&amp;P (if friggin' S&amp;W gets it back to me in time... grrrrrrr). I am happy to let anyone shoot anything they like as long as they can do so safely, and I'm sure most others will agree. I will also note that while .22 ammo is so cheap as to be essentially free, some of the other calibers can be a bit more expensive, so while it is not necessary, if you would like to throw in a couple bucks for ammo to the person whose gun you are shooting, I'm sure it would be appreciated.

If anyone has any questions, comments, quemments, or suggestions, please feel free to post them here, on the [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/redditlv), or PM me. I'm looking forward to seeing you all out there Sunday!

1322271454.0,22,self.vegas,mpfmc,"Good Dog needs Good Home! This is Reese, He will be going to a shelter on December 17th. Please help me find him a home before that. ",28,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/mpfmc/good_dog_needs_good_home_this_is_reese_he_will_be/,"Reese is a 6 year old 90 lbs. Boxer mix. We rescued him 5 years ago in Ohio. And brought him out to Vegas 3 years ago. But recently we have realized that we don't have to time and energy to give him a good life. My wife is a 2nd grade teacher and works 12 hours a day, and tutors on weekends. And I work a lot at UNLV. Reese is in his cage from 10pm until about 5pm, then he gets to go outside and play for a few hours then it's back in the cage when we go to bed. This is no life for a good dog. We started looking for a new home for Reese in July, we tried Craigslist, flyers, PetSmart weekend adoptions, all to to avail. (Who want's a fat 90 pound 6 year old dog when you can get a puppy?) And now that we are leaving on December 18th to go to the Midwest for three weeks we made the hard decision to put him in a shelter on the 17th (and we have not yet found a no-kill shelter here in Vegas that will take him). 

Reese is a good dog, he does not run, you can leave every door open and he won't go anywhere (as long as you are there) if not, he may wonder around looking for you. He rarely barks (other then when we come home). He is a little hyper sometimes, but it's most likely because he is in a cage for 18 hours a day. He is loving, and will sleep at the foot of your bed, but listens if you don't want him up there. And he is super loyal (as are most bulldogs). He loves to hike, and you don't even need a leash! We take him to Red Rock and Charlston as often as we can, and he loves it. 

The bad, He isn't very good with little kids, he doesn't growl or bite, but he is really big and clumsy and (not very smart). I also wouldn't want him in a home with small dogs either (for the same reasons). He is also very bad in cars, he tries to climb onto the drivers lap and can be very distracting, I would recommend some kind of harness to keep him back there. Other than that he is a great dog, and I hate to see him go. 

Whoever gets Reese will also get his blanket, his cage, his favorite toys, and a $50 gift card to PetSmart to help with expenses. 

So if you, or someone you know wants to stop by and see Reese, or if you know of a no-kill shelter that will take him, please PM me and we can talk. 

Thank you all for your help.

Over the course of a few days, we walked the entire length of the strip. We played great golf. We got to see the spectacle on Freemont (AWESOME!!!). The girlfriend and I even snagged some chips as souveniers from about two dozen different casinos to decorate the collage she's making to commemorate the trip.

We know there isn't much to do here under 21, but a new lasertag place opened up on Sahara and Cimmaron right next to Family Music. The only other lasertag in Vegas is LaserQuest, and now there's something closer to a lot of people in the west!

Went here this past weekend with my friends, the owners are VERY nice people, and got a great staff with them! They created a wonderful place, with a modern arcade, and an even better lasertag experience. Much better, and cheaper, than LaserQuest! They also do parties. 

Give this place some love! Hope some Vegas families can come enjoy themselves here.

I am a Water Pirate, meaning I sell those bottles of water on the strip to tourists.

I have been a resident of Las Vegas since I was 5, both my kids were born at UMC. I'm 39 now and using water bottles to make money to hold me over until I can find real work.

I, coincidentally enough, used to own several Water Stores here around the valley. One time in 1994 I got stiffed on a huge order for .5, 1, and 1.5 liter bottles and I took them down to the strip with one of my employees and sold off enough of them to cover the cost of the order I was stiffed on.  I'm not sure if anyone had tried selling water bottles on the sidewalks before that, but the Treasure Island Security was baffled about what to say, they pretty much had me move to the corner off their property was all, Fashion Show mall security never came out and said anything.

I've never been a person for public assistance, not to insult anyone who has needed it, but I feel if I can earn money through labor and skill the assistance is better left for the less fortunate to use.

After reading the newspaper article recently about the new law preventing people from operating as a business, but not for soliciting tips, I decided to become my own Job Creator, and I started handing out free bottles of water and asking for whatever tip.  When people ask me how much, I tell them the water is free, and most people tip me $1-2 per bottle but it is totally up to them.

This upset the Metro bike cops to no end because it kept me from getting one of the shiny new $1,000 citations.  I ended up getting a very angry ticket for ""storing a cooler on a public right of way.""  I was told during the entire process that I was going to jail, that accepting tips was illegal, and that they were sure I had been cited hundreds of times in our ""cat and mouse game.""  Honestly, with all of the posturing going on I expected sunglasses and a YEEEEAH when it wrapped up.

  I'm not upset about any of it really, the cooler was actually attached to my person by a safety strap I use in case I hit a bump and spill it, and I'm not one of those guys who sit in a corner yelling,""Water $1."" at people walking by, so the ""Storing"" citation is pretty flimsy, but I may just have to pay it if it is cheap enough.

So, that my story, not sure how to verify through a throwaway, but AMAA, or tell me how much you hate us water pirates.

We had an absolute blast.  The chapel (Chapel of the Flowers) was very nice, as were the staff/photographers/officiant.  

I posted about this before, but I couldn't believe the amount of characters on the strip taking pics for tips.  They're everywhere now.  And the people selling cheap light up toys in front of the fountains. It's like a carnival now. haha.

Weather was a bit cold (Last weekend, week before last).  Wouldn't have been so bad but we left 85 degree weather in Michigan to come there.  And of course, it's back to the 40s in Michigan.

Thanks again!

My parrot Bobcat J. Marley just flew out of my back door and flew away. He is a small white Goffin Cockatoo. He says his name quite frequently which just has a two syllable sound to it.

**Burgers** 
Holsteins - They make some good stuff; especially their Asian-inspired burgers. They also have alcoholic shakes. Kinda pricey though. 

**Pizza**
Settebellos - authentic Italian pizza

**Tacos**
Tacos El Gordo - adobado (spicy pork) tacos are fucking amazing here

**Pancakes**
Black Bear Diner - Their sweet cream pancakes will make you never want to set foot into an IHOP again.

**Sushi**
Oyshi Sushi - So far, some of the best ""all you can eat sushi"" that I've had in Vegas.

**Japanese**
Monta Noodle House - legit ramen joint; insanely delicious

**Mexican**
Lindo Michoacan - tasty, healthier Mexican food, with a wide variety to choose from

**Graveyard Special**
South Point - $3.95 Steak &amp; Eggs, nuff said.

Please help us in finding our dog Pequeño (pronounced Pekenio). We lost our best friend on 1/21/2013 at about 2-5PM near Elkhorn and Aliante in the Fields subdivision. We returned home after his walk and put him inside the house with access to the backyard, then headed out to eat at 2 PM. After returning home at about 5 pm, we saw that he some how escaped. Pequeño weighs about 4-6lbs, grey/black/brown coat, no teeth.  He's been with us over 11 years and requires eye medication. He also has a bad hip and tends to loose his balance. If found please call or text phone number: 702-556 6748.  No Questions asked and REWARD will be available. I ask that you please have sympathy as our companion has been with us through some tough times and is of high sentimental value to our family. We are also expecting our first child and would like to be reunited with our Pequeño. Thank you for your time.

I email the guy asking what's wrong with it, because there has to be something. He replies with the following: 

Hello,

Thank you for your interest in purchased my car! I'm selling it because I am in the army and my medical team will deploy back to Afghanistan and I don't want it get old in my garage. Also, the car is too big for my daughter so there's no use on keeping it. I'm under enormous time pressure cause I need to sell it fast, before September 05th that being the reason for selling it so low. The vehicle is in pristine condition, no accident history, no dents or dings and no scratches. Always adult driven and garaged, never abused. I have a clear title with no liens or loans. If you are interested, it's still available for sale and the price, as stated in the ad, is $2177. If you decide to buy it I will take care of shipping. Let me know if you are interested, email back.

A few words about the car:
2003 Honda  Accord  EX
Mileage: 50,300
Exterior color: White
Engine:3.0L V6 24V MPFI SOHC 
Transmission:  5-Speed Automatic
VIN# 1HGCM66553A099213
Here is some pics: http://s1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg498/honda158/

Thank you !	
Sgt. 1st Class  Sam Carroll , senior medic, 146th  Medical Battalion


He's in the army, must be a good guy right? But of course I'm still skeptical, especially the bit about shipping it to me. Why post on Las Vegas craigslist if I can't come look at it. A quick google search of his name/military information shows it's a scam. He does this all over the country, emailing people word for word what he sent me, except for whatever insane car deal he's offering there.


TL;DR: Sgt. 1st Class  Sam Carroll , senior medic, 146th  Medical Battalion is a craigslist scammer, DO NOT BUY FROM HIM!

Letter inside - add your signature!,19,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/omhpy/we_can_deliver_pipas_killing_blow_letter_inside/,"We #VegasTech people have drafted a letter to Harry Reid. We're collecting signatures at tonight's Launchup event and tomorrow at Jelly, then overnighting this to his DC office on Friday.

We're constituents of the most powerful man in the senate. Let's do this.

The letter is below.

*If you wish to sign it, PM me your name and title/occupation and I'll add it to the printed copy we send.*

--------------------------------
Senator Reid,

Recently, Las Vegas has received a lot of attention in tech and business circles as an emerging hub of creative startups, big ideas and innovative people. We are those innovators, and we're writing you today to express our collective opposition to the PROTECT IP Act.

After a long, painful recession that hit Nevada especially hard, we're working tirelessly to build companies, create jobs and diversify our great state's economy.

However, if PROTECT IP becomes law, its chilling effect on our businesses means that we simply will not be able to continue aiding Nevada's economic recovery.

We're not alone. Companies and entrepreneurs nationwide, including the founders of Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, PayPal, Twitter, eBay and Wikipedia, have come out against the bill. They have expressed, in no uncertain terms, how absolutely devastating PROTECT IP - and its House counterpart SOPA - would be, not only to the entrepreneurial spirit that has created some of the most successful companies the world has ever seen, but to the very foundation of the internet itself.

Bowing to pressure, Senator Leahy recently tried to calm the Internet's collective outrage by proposing to ""study"" the effects of DNS censorship - the most-criticized portion of the bill.

We argue that this is not sufficient, and that PROTECT IP still presents a grave danger not only to businesses, but the open nature of the Internet itself. We cite Senator Wyden, who wrote, ""Beyond the DNS provisions, the bill still establishes a censorship regime that threatens speech, innovation, and the future of the American economy."" 

If America stoops to innovation-stifling, third-world censorship tactics, it cannot compete in a 21st century economy. As your constituents, we are working hard to diversify and strengthen Nevada's economy, and we urge you to hear our concerns and put a stop to this bill.

Signed,

I need some local help with a small project and I thank you in advance for considering it!

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 10 years now, but we've been apart for the last 5 as I've been enrolled on a PhD program in a different country. I'm finally finishing writing up my thesis and should be done in less than a month. I want to tell her I'm coming home in a special way. 

I would like for her to receive a postcard from all the places we've visited together these past years. Each postcard would have just one letter in it, nothing more. Together they would spell an url where there would be a message from me telling her that I'm going home to her. 

I already enlisted [/r/England](http://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/1i2wph/hi_rengland_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with_a/), [/r/Unitedkingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1i31ry/hi_runitedkingdom_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help/), [/r/California](http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1i3bu0/hi_rcalifornia_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with/), [/r/Italy](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1i5djq/hi_ritaly_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/),  [/r/France](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1it0qh/hi_rfrance_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/), [/r/Philadelphia](http://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/1j6kcz/hi_rphiladelphia_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your/), [WashingtonDC](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1j8nc6/hi_rwashingtondc_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your/) and [/r/Scotland](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1ja8z1/hi_rscotland_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help/). Going through the different regions where I need postcards from. 

While I would like to repay for the postcard and the stamp, I reckon it would probably be really costly and troublesome to arrange for a bank transfer so I'll gladly offer a month of reddit gold as a token of gratitude for both the time and money spent with this.

We've travelled quite a bit over the years, I already had all the places assigned but a couple of the original assignees ended up not being able to do it or just went silent. So hoping to find someone from Vegas that can give me an hand! I leave the city list below in case you're living in any of the ""?"" places.

I don’t have a firm date yet, but it’s imminent and I need your help with a big issue: my cat, Baby. http://i.imgur.com/x5xm4M5.jpg http://i.imgur.com/2PpDu5y.jpg

I’m moving to the Bay area, land of high rent and long commutes. Wherever I live will be small, I will be living alone, and I won’t be there very often; I might be away from home up to 25% of the time (prospective job). On top of that, my commute will probably keep me away from home for at least 12 hours a day. Baby is about 15 years old -- she’s spry right now but these are her twilight years. I want her to be happy and comfortable, and in my care she will be neither. 

What I’m trying to say is that I’m an unfit cat-mom and I need someone to adopt her. 

Due to her age she requires a special kidney diet, so I’m willing to pay for her food. We can even discuss a vet bill arrangement. Yes, I’m offering alimony/cat support; that is how important this is to me. Please don’t have any other cats or dogs; she’s extremely social, but only with people. 

I know this is a long shot; no one wants a senior cat, especially one who probably won't coexist well with other animals. Technically, I could take her with me, but she would not get the attention or care she deserves. I'm trying very hard to do what's right for her.

If you would enjoy the company of this small, loud, affectionate, entertaining creature, please message me. I’m starting to freak a little about what I’m going to do.

I recently tried out Sammy's L.A. Pastrami, which has been highly recommended, and it was awesome. Although I live on the Northwest side of town, I have no problem driving half an hour to get to some good food. I like everything (both foreign and domestic) and even dabble in some of the more unique eating trends (like Raw food). I've eaten at most of the places on the ""Where to Eat/Drink"" list here and I'm running out of ideas. 

I don't mind if its cheap food or fancy food. I will say that I am eating by myself, so it's not likely that I'm going to roll into Del Frisco's and eat a lavish steak dinner alone. I'm taking any and all recommendations. Thanks r/vegas.

EDIT:
Thanks to everyone who has responded so far! I should have mentioned I have lived here for about a year and a half and have traveled around the food world quite a bit. I'm familiar with anything that has been on any sort of food network type show (From Lotus of Siam to Whickey Dick's...yes, WD's got on a TV show) and I am a regular at most of the local favorites (like Capriotti's and Roberto's). Anything fast food or borderline fast food (Smashburger, Teriyaki Madness) I've been to quite a bit. I'm look for your *absolute favorite* place to eat. If it is one of those places, great! I don't mind hearing people brag about Aces and Ales (East) or The Lodge (Northwest), but I'll let you know when it's something I haven't heard of. I figure if everyone gives their favorite places, then I can't go wrong eating at any of them. 

You guys have been awesome with the responses so far! Thank you!

EDITS 1-4: *see below*

Places you have suggested I will be trying out soon:

• 808 Sushi

• Bacchanal Buffet

• Boulder Dam Brewing Co

• Carlito's Burritos

• Crepe Expectations

• Fukumimi

• Kyara Japanese Tapas

• La Belle Terre Bread

• La Cave at The Wynn

• Monta Ramen

I'm pretty bored and wanted to share some of the great places we have around campus to chow down at. All are either family owned or small chains.

Filipitos: It's on Trop right next to Metro Pizza and a car place I believe

Damn good mexican food. It's like Robertos on steroids. Their Carne Asada Nachos and Fish Burrito are the best I have ever had. The only downsides are no free refills on drinks like Robertos and they have outside seating only(however, they have a drive through!)

Baja Bar and Grill: It's in the plaza with Smash Burger right next to In N Out on Maryland

It's a little dive place. Real hom-ey feel. Same guys working every day. Every Tuesday and every day 4-7 they have dollar tacos. Their tacos are amazing, it's all I ever get. Any one of them will amaze. Fish, Potato and Beef are my favorites however

Stephanos: In the larger plaza on Maryland directly across from In N Out

Home made greek food. 'nuff said. it's a little pricey, but well worth it. This plaza also has multiple other good places to eat, but they're chains except:

3PM(3AM?) cafe. Right next to Pita Pit:
Somewhat hipster. Has that cute-liberal-vegetarian-store-owner look to it. Great food at a good price. I've had the Katsu multiple times and it's never failed me. Adding onto asian dishes:

Aloha Kitchen, right next to Baja Tacos:
Great hawaiian and asian food. good deal for UNLV students. a little on the higher side for food prices but nothing too expensive. I have heard great things about their spam musubi(spelling?)

Yayos Tacos, next to Stephanos:
7/10. It's an okay place, some love it, some hate it.

El Patio(or El Fratio as some Greeks call it), in the plaza on Maryland where Chipotle, the dry cleaners, and the Coffee Bean reside:

Super cheap booze. Cheap good food. ""I'm actually in Mexico"" style atmosphere. amazing place.

But either way even a sighting would be good enough for us as we'd know what area to look in and if we can get in voice range she'll come running.   
  
As I said she escaped from the Huntridge neighborhood.  Please PM me with any sightings if you happen to spot her or a contact to pick her up if you got lucky and got her leashed. 
  
  
**EDIT: Update** She was spotted yesterday near Bruce/Bracken. She was checking out a house our friend used to live in, she was probably looking for his dogs, her buddies. The people could not get her to come close enough to nab but at least she was spotted! The hunt continues.  
  
**EDIT 2: FOUND!!!** She was found over at the Cosmopolitan. Apparently she had a gambling itch that needed to be scratched. Thank you to everyone that kept an eye out.

Yes it is a Mexican supermarket and where I go it looks like an alternate version of Food4Less. Apparently there are several locations in Las Vegas but I go to the one at 2021 East Lake Mead Boulevard, North Las Vegas, NV. Sure, its not at the best neighborhood around and not the prettiest but the prices are not to be beat. For example, onions are 5 pounds for a dollar or less, and tomatoes can be 39 cents for 3 pounds! The produce is fresh and of course better than Wal-Mart and at times expensive as hell Smiths. The bakery is not that bad,and the cheesecake and leche cake(the one with milk in the container) are superb ESPECIALLY the cheesecake. They have fresh cheeses that are pretty cheap and the meat is average price. They workers are a lot better at acting happy than other places like Wal-Mart. I got a literally whole cart full of vegetables with ground chicken and some cake slices for $64!

tl;dr Red Honda Superhawk997 (actual model VTR1000F), plates 026566, with scuffs on right side from a laydown, stolen from NW Las Vegas around 95 &amp; Craig, possibly around Sat 4/14 ~midnight or later.  Also dual Yoshimura pipes.

So longer version:  
Went out of town Friday after work ~5pm and motorcycle was still there; parked at my parking space at my apartments (if you want the apt complex name, ask me in a PM please).  Upon returning Sunday afternoon/evening ~6:30p, it's gone.  One neighbor said they think it was still there when they walked their dog around 11pm Saturday, so I'm guessing nighttime Saturday is when it was thieved.

So yeah, I guess if the good folks out there see a bike fitting this description to, I guess, post as much on here with an approximate location of where you saw it.  Hoping against hope at this point, I doubt I'll ever see it again.

Thanks for anything anyone does.

edit: [pic](http://www.motorsports-network.com/honda/vtr102.jpg)  Not sure why I didn't post this before.  This is basically what it looks like, but the pipes say Yoshimura on them, there's a full ""under-fairing"", i.e. the engine is more fully covered--it's also red--and there's scuffs and dings and scratches all over the right side (so the side you're looking at in this photo).

Have you ever thought to yourself, ""Ya know, if the zombies ever come, I wonder if I could even hit them?"" Are you a FPS junkie, but have never gotten to shoot stuff? Are you a seasoned operator operating operationally, just looking for a fun time at the range? Well, rejoice, for [/r/vegas](/r/vegas) is going shooting!

The plan as it stands is this: we will be meeting at [Bass Pro Shops](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=maps+bass+pro+shops+las+vegas&amp;cid=15674663619949547009) at 11AM Sunday and departing for the BLM land south of Sloan about 1130. Alternately, you can just meet us down there after about noon at [this location](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=200845718631514859738.0004ae2208bf71ffeef6e&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=35.828834,-115.202477&amp;spn=0.020216,0.042272). The road is hard pack dirt, so most any vehicle should be able to make it, but the last two hundred yards or so is usually a little rough. One of us should be able to ferry you up to the actual firing line if you don't think your car can make it.

Things to bring: a safe attitude, sunscreen, water or other beverages (sorry, NO ALCOHOL: guns and liquor do not mix), perhaps a snack, eye and ear protection if you have it (sunglasses and foam earplugs are the minimum; I have spares for quite a few if necessary) and guns and ammo if you have them. If not, there will be plenty to go around. While not required, if you ride with someone or don't bring ammo, a few bucks donation to cover costs would surely be appreciated. I will be bringing a range of guns: a few .22 rifles, a silenced .22 pistol, a shotgun, a couple other pistols, an AR15 and a Mosin Nagant. I'm sure others will bring all sorts of cool stuff as well.

Lastly, safety (wait, that should have gone first... oh well). There will be an informal range safety brief before we heat up the line, and for those of you who have never shot before, the more experienced shooters will be happy to help you out. Depending on how many people show up, we will have a couple people acting as Range Safety Officers. Other than that, common sense is the rule of the day. 

If anyone has any questions, you can PM me, message me on the Facebook group, or just reply here. Hope to see everyone out there Sunday, and let's go shoot stuff!

EDIT: This is also posted on the Facebook group page. An RSVP there would be appreciated if possible.

EDIT: Midnight on Saturday and despite the weather we are still a go. Meeting in the BassPro parking lot, east side. Look for a blue F-150 with an alien on the tailgate.

A friend and I are organizing a SlutWalk for Vegas (coincidently, it's called ""SlutWalk Vegas""), and we would love for you to participate through volunteer work, social support, or maybe just being a Kick Ass person who tells other Kick Ass people, spreading the word.


If you're not feeling it at the moment, no worries, we're going to be scheduling the walk for later this year, and you're always more than welcome to participate.  

Remember, fellow Redditors, you're awesome, and we're awesome, so why not be awesome together?

SlutWalk Vegas: Uniting to educate and inform because we've had ENOUGH.

It is NEVER okay to blame the victim. It is never okay to assume that because of the way that someone dresses, acts, or whom they hang out with, that it is okay to take advantage of them against their wishes. ""No"" means NO.
SlutWalk is a chance to speak out against victim blaming, slut shaming, and the all around absurd ideas that are sometimes associated with sexual violence. Since 2005, violent crimes dropped by 15% overall in Las Vegas, while sexual assault rose by 16% (Review Journal, ""Sexual Assaults Increase..."" 1/13/11)--this is unacceptable. Let's stand together and make a change.

We here at SlutWalk Vegas are standing with our sister, SlutWalk Toronto, in carrying a message of LOVE and change. We are welcoming all who want to participate, regardless of occupation, sexual orientation, race, age, religion, or gender. All you need is a passion for the cause.

If you're interested in helping us organize our SlutWalk please send us an email so we can give you information, and invite you to the meetings (which will be posted along with all other updates, once everything is up and running).
When we have the details of our event more solidified, we will be inviting everyone via Facebook invitation, Twitter, flyer, or word of mouth.

Myself and my girlfriend are visiting Vegas for a once-in-a-lifetime trip in October. It is my intention to propose to her. I was hoping to get away from the usual 'one knee in a restaurant' and do something special and unique.

We're in our early 30s and have been going out for over 4 years now. She is everything to me, and she seems to like me :). She really picked me up when I'd lost hope, showed me colour when there was none to see. We've been through hard times, family member deaths, renting some bad houses, but we've had a lot more great times, memories we've had, trips we've taken, unique presents when we know what the other would want.

It has a bit of a Romeo and Juliet theme too, we're from working class backgrounds in Northern Ireland, across the 'divide'. Some family members might not approve, some make remarks that I am not sure are out of ignorance or spite. Despite them, we see through this, respect and learn each other's background, and don't let it bother us.

She has been hinting at getting engaged for a while, and I think that on our 4 year anniversary meal she expected a ring. I've been trying to brush it off (hoping she can be patient til October :) ).

We're both excited at the Vegas trip, initially it was meant to be a European summer break, but we wanted something a bit more special, and I knew my task wanted somewhere really memorable to pop the question.

Would anyone have any suggestions on ideas for popping the question while at Vegas?
Maybe if someone knew a singer playing at a venue, that we could go and see, who could say this on microphone?

Looking forward to visiting your beautiful, fun, city!

Thanks!

I was driving east on Sahara when a guy started yelling at me from his car. He was offering to repaint the bumper on my car (the paint was coming off). He asked if I could pull over, so I did and wanted to hear his pitch, thinking he was the owner of a small car repair business or something. 

Right after I park, he comes out almost sobbing, begging me to let him fix my bumper. He was literally begging me, like his life depended on it. Told me a sob story about how he and his wife (who was in the passenger seat) were living in a motel with their 4 kids and on their last leg. He really seemed desperate and stupidly I believed him. So I let him repaint my bumper, knowing he would do a terrible job (which he did). I gave him $80 and figured it was okay since the guy needed some help.

It's only now that I could do some research that I realize it was just a scam. Other people say the scammer usually tries to impress you with credentials or strong arm you. This guy only used sympathy ploys, he never tried to convince me he was qualified or anything. I've got to say I totally bought it, I'm a sucker for sob stories.

According to him, Century Link had recently run fiber to my area (I live in an apt. complex with a housing neighborhood across the street).

Nitty gritty:

currently with cox: $140/month tv/internet/phone

his deal: $80/month tv/internet

Couldn't quite wrangle a proper internet speed answer out of him unfortunately.  He tried espousing the benefits of a dedicated dsl vs shared cable, instead of just giving me an ""X down/Y up"" number.  He did say at home he was fairly consistently seeing 1-2 MBs, which isn't bad, but he is a salesman after all.

Really just wondering if anyone has had a CL salesman around touting their fiber, if they took the offer, and if it was worth it?  Is it really fiber or some knockoff they can still technically call ""fiber"" (like fiber halfway then copper the rest, which sucks).

Also he mentioned a 30day side by side compare.  It sounded like I'd pretty much have two services coming to my house; if I cancel the CL service before the 30 days it's free, otherwise I'm paying for that month (and any subsequent months) as if it was normal service.  *This* was a real question-mark for me: how manipulative can they be with the dedicated dsl lines?  Can they give me awesome service for this comparison time then bait-and-switch once i'm all signed up?

Let's assume for the purpose of discussion, you are a disgruntled Wells Fargo customer (if you're not, pretend this is you).  

Which local credit union(s) would best be suited for someone (such as you) who would like a bank that doesn't put a fee on the balance in your savings account and using a debit card?  Various perks I'm sure everyone looks out for:  Checkbook ordering fees are irrelevant (unless it's unreasonable), return rates higher than half of one percent at all are fine, free online checking, availability of online bill pay, ATM fee reimbursement, etc.

Hope many of us Vegas redditors can benefit from this discussion.

I like to save money so I thought I would share a few tips and tricks to save money and still have a blast.

**Sightseeing**

I would definitely spend a few hours just walking around to all the casinos on the strip.  The best part about this is if you sign up for the Player's Club (free) in each casino, they will usually give you some sort of incentive.  Treasure Island gave me $10 in slot play.  Whatever you win off that $10, you get to keep.  Most other casinos have a similar incentive.

**Shows**

If you want to see a show, then check out Tix4Tonight.  They are all over the strip.  They sell discount tickets for shows that are showing that night.  Usually they are the cheapest, but I bought tickets to Cirque du Soleil and when I went to pick up the tickets at Treasure Island, I found out their last minute tickets were cheaper.  Definitely check first.

During my stay, I found out there are also a bunch of smaller, less known shows.  These tickets are significantly cheaper and sometimes free.  Nathan Burton's comedy magic is a free show at the Flamingo.  Be sure to pick up tickets in advance as they sell out fast.  Be on the lookout for these shows in coupon books (which you can find everywhere).

**Free Drinks!**

If you like to drink and you like gambling, then you're in luck!  Sitting at the penny slots, I had free cocktails constantly served to me.  Just remember to tip your waitresses!  $1 seemed to do the trick.

If you are at a table game such as Craps or Blackjack, then expect tons of drinks to be thrown at you.  The casino wants to get intoxicated so you are a little looser with your money.  As long as you moderate your drinking, you can keep a nice buzz and not lose too much money.

**Gambling**

If you are staying on the Strip then you will quickly come to realize that table games are expensive.  Most minimums on table games are $5 and $10 at Caesars Palace and the Bellagio.  There is one casino on the Strip, however that is a little cheaper.  Casino Royal, which is across the street from The Mirage and next to Harrah's, has $3 Craps and $4 Roulette.

If you really don't want to spend that much money (like me) then I suggest you take a little trip downtown.  Go to any northbound bus stop and buy a $7 24 hour pass.  Hop on the bus and get off on Fremont Street.  If you want to play some Roulette, then go to the El Cortez casino where they have $1 minimum and $.25 chips.  Want to play Craps?  Go the Western which is a little further down the street from El Cortez.  They have $1 Craps.

**Food**

If you are staying on the Strip then I suggest dinner at Ellis Island Casino at least a few times.  It is just off the strip [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Ellis+Island+Casino+%26+Brewery,+4178+Koval+Lane,+Las+Vegas,+NV+89109-4568&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=36.120717,-115.169206&amp;sspn=0.026935,0.066047&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Ellis+Island+Casino+%26+Brewery,+4178+Koval+Lane,&amp;hnear=Las+Vegas,+Nevada+89109&amp;ll=36.114165,-115.162425&amp;spn=0.026938,0.066047&amp;z=15).  Ask for the Steak Special and you will get [this](http://i.imgur.com/0YYCc.jpg) for $7.99.  Yes, that is right, you get a soup or salad, steak, green beans, potatoes and a beer, all for $7.99.

Harrah's has a ""Million Dollar Pull"" where you just go up and play a slot machine for free with the chance to win $1 million.  Even if you don't win a million, you will always win something.  One of the prizes they have is a $20 dining voucher for any Harrah's property, which includes:  Caesar's, Imperial Palace, Rio, Harrah's etc...  The dinner buffet at Harrah's is $20, so there is a free meal!

When you are downtown playing some cheap table games, make sure you grab dinner at Binion's.  Just sign up for their player's club and they will give you a buy one get one free entree coupon for their cafe.  My girlfriend and I ate a full meal for a total of $10 there, delicious.

I know there is a ton I am leaving out, so please add any tips!",,False,,t5_2qhrs,False,,,True,t3_hhqgj,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/hhqgj/my_suggestions_for_a_funcheaper_vegas_trip/,

First, for those of you have a smartphone (*specifically iOS or Android*), I highly recommend downloading the [RootMetrics Coverage Map](http://www.rootmetrics.com) app and run the signal strength and data tests wherever you most utilize your device.

Over the weekend, I decided to just suck it up and headed to T-Mobile to purchase a prepaid SIM card. For $10, I had three days of near unlimited access to the T-Mobile network so I could test the network myself to make sure it was worth it. I didn't get to test as many places as I wanted to outside of The Strip and Southwest Las Vegas, but here's what I ended up getting per my tests: 

http://i.imgur.com/wwupRHG.jpg

T-Mobile's LTE service was a mixed bag for the most part. There were times I did see four-to-five bars of LTE, but unable to test as I was driving. Their 4G was impressive and most of the time their signal strength and/or data speeds blew AT&amp;T's away. I didn't encounter any dead spots with T-Mobile on my iPhone 5. 

**TL;DR:** *I'm switching to T-Mobile by the end of the month once my mother-in-law's contract ends because I encountered no real problems a service that I would end up saving $75 a month on.*

I asked T-Mobile when would there be a larger rollout of their HSDPA and LTE networks in Vegas and this is the canned response I got:

*T-Mobile 4G LTE covers a large portion of the Las Vegas area including the area inside the 215 Loop, Vegas Strip, Summerlin, North Henderson and North Las Vegas. Landmarks and hotels in the Las Vegas area covered by T-Mobile 4G LTE include the Venetian, Palazzo, City Center, MGM Grand, Mirage, Bellagio, and New York-New York.*

Reddit, you are getting the first heads up :)",15,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1a8z5q/update_hey_reddit_i_work_at_intelligent_technical/,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1a5m4w/hi_redditvegas_i_work_at_intelligent_technical/)

UPDATE: Reddit, resumes can be sent to hr@itsasap.com. We are currently looking to hire two IT support team members. I am not the hiring manager. I'm a three day new employee freshly leaving the corporate world of IT. I confirmed from HR and the IT team we are looking, and got permission to post this on Reddit :)

The details: 
Willingness to learn, all star team work, and having a positive attitude comes before experience. You will be working in a team environment with other technicians, speaking directly with clients, and possible on-site visits. I can't stress enough that willingness to learn with a positive attitude comes first. That key element is one of the foundations that created this effective culture.

The position we are looking for would be a level 3 experienced technician (on a scale 1 to 5). For you this means some experience with servers, networking, TCP/IP, exchange, and more. I can't stress enough that willingness to learn and work in a team environment is more important, but it's nice if you have the server side/help desk experience. I don't want to say ITS creates position based on the right person, but that's kinda how it is.

TLDR; ITS is hiring two IT support members. Email resumes to HR@itsasap.com. Good luck Vegas :)

EDIT: Technicians are scheduled Monday through Friday from 8AM to 5PM. Lunch is paid for every day OR you can leave the office and do your own thing. Pay is based on experience, but that is a conversation you will have with HR. If you only like working alone, don't like speaking with clients, don't want to learn anymore, don't enjoy a positive culture, and can't be on-time I recommend not wasting anyone's time.

I am approved for a conventional loan for $225,000. We have found plenty of great homes in our price range, however, things are selling extremely fast and mostly to cash buyers. We feel like we can't compete with cash investors and homes will be on the market for less than 24 hours before they are sold. So far, we found three we wanted to put an offer on only to find the seller had already accepted a cash offer. This week, we did finally put in two offers, only to find out today that both properties went to a cash buyer.

We are to the point now that we are putting offers on homes that we haven't even seen yet (contingent upon seeing it of course) just to try to get a leg up on these cash buyers. I'm just incredibly frustrated and not really sure what to do. 

Anyone else as frustrated as we are?

Guns if you've got them, but they aren't necessary as there will usually  be plenty to go around. A few bucks for ammo is appreciated, but once again, not really necessary.

----------------------

I started a thread a couple weeks ago asking about interest in a possible meetup at a new Bar-Arcade in town, and about 20 people responded.  So I went over there on Thursday and met the really nice folks who are going to run the place, and they are excited about hosting an event for us prior to their grand opening on the 14th.

They are flexible on the dates, but I was thinking Saturday the 8th, around 4pm or 5pm would work well.  What are your thoughts, /r/Vegas?  Their occupancy inspection is on Tuesday, so we can't book anything for sure until then.  The age limit is 18, so you UNLV youngsters can join us. 

There are actually two connected bars opening.  Hi Scores is the arcade half.  They have a lot of TVs which will show all the NFL games, and include linked XBoxes.  They didn't have all of the arcade games in yet, but I remember Operation Wolf, Battlezone, Asteroids, Centipede, Street Fighter 2, Robotron, Off Road Challenge, and Ms. Pac Man.  The Players Club is the more chill half.  They have non-video games there, including foosball, Super Chexx bubble hockey, and an impressive selection of pinball machines.  The owner apparently has 50 pinball machines that will be rotated through.  

Fred, the manager, takes his food and beverages very seriously.  All of the food will be made from scratch.  He rattled off an extensive beer list, including two of my favorites, Paulaner Hefeweizen and North Coast Pranqster.  Amanda is the Events Coordinator who will be organizing this for us.  I'll try to get her here to answer any questions.

I went to a vet and the cat isn't microchipped - but I have no doubt that it's a peoples cat, perhaps belonging to someone, perhaps abandoned, not sure. 

So, I'm wondering what I do now. I would keep the cat but I have allergies (and a few dogs that would never leave the poor thing alone). I'm going to scan Craigslist for lost cats and see if he matches anyone, but after that, should I take him to a shelter? Should I just let him go - maybe he's owned, just not well cared for? Would he find a nice home through the animal shelter? Does any r/vegas'ers need a loving fluffy sweety muffins? 

Here he (she? Pretty sure 'he'. Seems to be missing his male equipment, another indication he's a owned-kitty) is: http://imgur.com/a/62NJ2#1

been asked 1,000 times but I thought this could be a helpful place to
gather a couple of last insights before my trip to Vegas this Wednesday!

So the basic details: My friend and I are going to be flying into Vegas
this Wednesday around midnight. We'll be staying there until early
Monday afternoon and thats when we fly back home (so 4-nights stay and
about 5 days of actually doing stuff). We're staying at the Luxor.

About ourselves:
Males, straight, around 25yrs. of age...

My questions are:

1) Is there anything we need to know about our hotel (the Luxor)?

2) I see that the weather is in the 70s-80s, does that mean bring
shorts? On the subject of dress — Is there any type of dress code?
Obviously if we're going out to a nice restaurant or trying to get in a
club I'm sure we're expected to dress up. But for going places during
the day or sitting in the casino is jeans/t-shirt okay?

3) Whats the can't miss spots? We plan on hitting up Fremont St. and all
the different hotels on the strip.

4) Is there an actual show we should pay for? Assuming we could only
afford to go to one.

5) Food - any crazy deals we should know about? And if we want to have a
steak dinner, where is a good place for that?

6) Poker - where should I play? Its my game of choice. By no means do I
consider myself awesome at the game but I can win $200 here and there at
our local card rooms. I'm really only interested in Texas Hold Em' and
probably just $1-2 games if those exist.

7) We're both not crazy part types but you have to let loose in Vegas.
Is there an easy-going place to go check out if we did want to go clubbing?

8) Is the best means of getting around to places—simply walking?

That's all I can think of for now. Thanks in advance for any help!

Also looking for advice on things to do:
  
* We're all mid-20s fairly nerdy types.
  
* We love to drink, not too into Clubs.

* I'm a huge foody... I hear Bobby Flay has a restaraunt here?  Other famous restaraunts worth checking out? (it may be tough to get my friends to check out the nicer restaraunts with me).
  
* I think I would like to see a show... what's good?

* Gambling... I realize the odds are stacked against me so would like to avoid playing at expensive tables.  Should I head off the strip?  Can you play games on the strip while collecting free drinks and not spend too much money?  

I read the FAQ, but your opinions would help too as there are quite a few things listed there and not much detail for the shows.

On a recent trip, I attended a strip club advertised as the ""largest"" in Las Vegas. I don't know why I expected this, but I was expecting a place with a lot of stages, multiple rooms, etc... Instead it was like a massive warehouse, with a tiny stage in the middle and a bajillion tables and chairs. The whole thing was set up as a giant lapdance and drink serving factory, with decidedly unsexy lapdances taking place amongst what looked like hundreds of people sitting around you. 

You couldn't even sit unless you were constantly ordering insanely priced drinks, according to the staff there. There was literally nowhere to plant your ass if you weren't constantly drinking. And the dancers were like predators and gave us the most dirty looks when we didn't order a dance immediately after we sat down. On top of that, they had these charming little ""bottle service"" table topper menus that had suggested bottle orders from $1000 up to like $15000+. WTF. I mean, this wasn't in the VIP section. This was at one of the hundreds of tables just slapped out in the middle of this huge place. 

It was TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible. Nothing about that environment was ""sexy fun"" at all.

Also, I shouldn't have been this naive, but their ""free limo"" service is one way. Heh heh. We started to walk back to the hotel because we were already pissed off at paying for the drinks, but realized how stupid that was and called for a taxi.

Now, back in my hometown, our strip clubs are more intimate and the general rule is you pay your cover, buy one (expensive, but only one) drink and you're cool to hang out wherever. At the bigger clubs, instead of having one massive room, there are multiple smaller rooms, each with a stage with a performer doing a dance and a tip bar. Therefore, you can enjoy yourself keeping a constant supply of ones going and end the night with a total outlay of cover, a drink, and however many ones you spend at the tip bar. In my town, this could be like $50-60. In Vegas, I'd expect to spend $100-125, maybe a little more if we got some dances, but NOT the $600 that I estimated it would take to have even a short night at the club we went to.

Is this sort of experience possible in Vegas at a place that won't make my skin crawl? Was my mistake going to the ""biggest"" club? Is there one that would fit the bill better, or am I just a cheapo bastard that isn't willing to spend enough to make it worth their while?",,False,,t5_2qhrs,False,,,True,t3_1i4uym,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1i4uym/vegas_strip_clubs_all_the_same/,
