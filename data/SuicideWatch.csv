A well known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In the room of 200, he asked. *""Who would like this $20 bill?""*

Hands started going up. He said, *""I am going to give this $20 to one of you - but first, let me do this.""*

He proceeded to crumple the 20 dollar note up. He then asked. *""Who still wants it?""* Still the hands were up in the air.

*""Well,""* he replied, *""what if I do this?""* He dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. *""Now, who still wants it?""*

Still the hands went into the air.

***""My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless; but no matter what happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you. The worth of our lives comes, not in what we do or who we know, but by ...WHO WE ARE. You are special - don't ever forget it.""***

i dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone

the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring

##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.

Just got Facebook timeline and saw something...,225,25,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ndlxt/attempted_suicide_two_years_ago_just_got_facebook/,"I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

1289335992.0,180,self.SuicideWatch,e3nth,Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,215,35,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e3nth/lessons_from_four_decades_of_depression/,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.

There is so much institutional racism all around me. Being white just seems so much easier. When you meet new people, you can just be yourself. If you make a mistake, it's just a mistake. If you're black and meeting a new person, you have to be on your best behavior because any mistake you make can be used against you to say ""Oh she's just another ghetto person"". You have to disprove every single stereotype before you can be accepted. Even when you're accepted, you constantly have to watch yourself so that you don't slip and make a mistake.

I don't fit in anywhere. I don't like rap music and the culture of embracing ignorance. I prefer folk and rock music but I feel like I don't feel accepted in that group either. 


When I was in 7th grade I used to be really into Comic Con but people we could make comments at conventions about how the character isn't supposed black. The last time I dressed up, I was dressed as Katara because she had brown skin and I thought that was close enough. I spent over 150 dollars on my outfit but more than 4 different people told me straight up that although my outfit was good, I portrayed it wrong because Katara isn't supposed to be black.

Every culture rejects me. I try to be strong but most of the time I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I love life, I just hate mine.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore.

All I can do is speak from experience. In my own unique experience myself, my husband, my other children, and other family members did not know that our son was hurting. His actions, words, and day to day activities did not give clues to anything out of the ordinary for him. He was a bright light in all of our lives. Very caring, very open.

Since the death of my son, we have experienced love and critics. We have experienced concern and anger.

I am not responsible for his death, nor do I look for sympathy or profit from his death. I cannot even tell you the destruction this has caused in all of our lives. Yes, his death is about him -- but it impacts everyone because he was so loved and so special in our lives.

I work hard at trying to connect with people who can get something out of what I have been through. Not for profit - to help. I don't have all the right answers and I struggle with even approaching the prevention subject, because how can I speak to prevention? My son died by suicide, I didn't prevent anything.

Much of what happens after the loss of a loved one by suicide is a personal struggle dependent on the relationship between the you and the one that died. The guilt can overwhelm and eat at you. It can put you in a place that your lost loved one was probably sitting in also.

I am a Mom that lost her child and is completely heartbroken by it. This has turned my entire life upsidedown and nothing will ever be right again. That is a fact - it has nothing to do with a self serving agenda. It has to do with life and death and grief and the struggle to understand suicide. You may not like my post and you may be angry by my post - but I am here to say that suicide shatters everyone close to you. Including the ones that you may not be thinking of - the one's that you may not realize love you. I know that doesn't automatically fix anything. I know that mental illness, depression, and suicidal thoughts go much deeper than just knowing that you are loved. I don't have an answer to fix it, I only have my experience of how suicide ends more than just one life.
With nothing but care and concern for each of you,

You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

&gt; Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.

He went into treatment and came home and explained to me that his medication was making him belly-sick and he had to stop taking it. He was throwing up from it, getting pale and dizzy, and shaking. 
So I couldn't force him to take it. He found a new job and said he was doing out-patient treatment. 
On Friday he left some suicide notes. He left a will. And on Sunday his body was found. 
I'm completely heartbroken. I can not eat. I do not sleep. I cry. I scream into pillows and talk to him out loud. I ask why. He left me facing an eviction that he hid from me, past due bills that meant my electricity is turned off and my water. I have a four year old son who is staying with family. I don't know how I'll tell him his ""Jamie"" is gone. 
I believe in God so I'm terrified of what happens to his soul. I'm pretty much totally lost. Worse of all, the DEA is watching me because he took pills that he had no prescription for. 
I have to carry on now. For my son. I have nothing left. I'm empty inside. Hollow and at night the silence goes on and on and he's not next to me in our bed... I miss him. And I'm angry. He had another life that I never knew about. He was so far in debt, death treats against his life for unpaid ""stuff"", and he changed my address so I wouldn't receive any mail or notices. He forged my signature on documents for court on the eviction. I feel betrayed. I'm angry. And I'm alone. So alone.

I will not say I feel 100% better, I still today am struggling with the same suicidal and self hatred feelings, but I am still alive and that's something.

One of you gave the advice to focus more on myself, and that's exactly what I did today. I woke up, crying from the fact that I woke up and was still alive... then decided you know what? Fuck this. If I'm stuck here one more day, I'm gonna make it great. And you know what? I did.

I immediately went to an apartment viewing that was semi spontaneous... turns out the apartment is literally perfect for me in absolutely every way. They even have a private fenced backyard and ENCOURAGE dogs... which would help with my depression. It is perfect. I am signing a lease this weekend and moving out of my mom's house. Huge step towards a new life.

Then this afternoon, I got a call from a job and they wanted me to come right in for an interview. I got offered a job on the spot and I start tomorrow. He said I seem perfect for the job. This is going to help my money situation as well as keep me busy and occupied when I get depressed.

Then when I came home, my boyfriend (who didn't know of my feelings last night) called me asking to take me on a in-home date including him grilling dinner and us watching a movie and me sleeping over.

If you guys hadn't have put so much effort in keeping me alive last night, none of these things would have happened. I can't say thank you enough. 

Again, like I said, I'm still dealing with a lot of issues and its going to take time, but since I didn't off myself last night, I feel like the universe showed me today that yes, you have the opportunity to have good things happen to you if you just stay here. 

Again, thanks so much to all of you. I cross my fingers that these new developments will help encourage me to stay alive just a little bit longer.

So I took some of the comment's advice. I chilled out and met a guy who wanted to hook up. When I got back to my dorm, I had already been feeling a bit sick, that coupled with the fact that I was thoroughly disgusted with myself for enjoying hooking up with another guy made me throw up. I spent the next twenty minutes punching my concrete wall so hard my knuckles started to bleed.

I can't do this, I don't want to live anymore if it means I have to be gay. It makes me physically ill to my stomach if what society's telling me is true: I can't change this. I don't want to be gay more than anything else in the world, I would be okay with being bi, hell, even lying about it would be better. Everyone keeps telling me it would be wrong to get in a relationship with a girl if no sexual attraction was there and if I can't even do that, I don't want to live anymore.

Society would accept me, my friends would all accept me, but they would never treat me the same again. My parents are convinced that homosexuality doesn't exist, that its all based on environment and upbringing, they wouldn't hate me or throw me out, in fact they're the least of my concerns.

Its me mainly, I don't want to be gay. I tried it and it made me sick at my stomach, I hate everything about it from the culture to the fact that I can't live my dream of being married to a beautiful wife with children without somehow being a ""bad person"". I won't accept this, I don't give a shit if you call it self-hatred. I talked to a suicide hotline, they basically talked me out of it and told me the same thing as everyone else, you can't help it. I talked to a guy at our school's LGBT support center, he also said I have no choice in the matter. If this is truly the case then I'm done, fuck it. I will not live my life ""being"" gay and I will not live my life celibate.

Edit: I know this is cliche as hell, but I wanna thank everyone for the encouragement. After about half an hour of reading comments I ran over to the gym for a quick workout sesh and I already feel loads better. For now I'm not gonna worry about it anymore, if suicide is an option, as one of you pointed out, I have a self-determined amount of time before that to do whatever the fuck I want to find out who I am. On top of that, Purple_Antwerp's words really made me realize that I need to man the fuck up and not label myself so I can really find out who I am.

Don't just announce ""I'm here to help"" and don't solicit PMs.   If you really ARE helping out here, anybody lurking because they're afraid to post will find you. ",140,18,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/,"**We have tolerated (with concerns) this type of post in the past but it's becoming excessive.  Based on discussion among the mod team and [with the community](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x80ja/what_does_sw_think_about_the_im_here_to_help_pm/), our consensus is that these posts are not helping the community, and we're going to start removing them.**

Our reasons are:

1.  The vast majority of the ""let me help"" type posts come from people who have little or no history of constructive, visible contributions here at SW.  Therefore, there's no way to tell much about their ability to give supportive and useful responses.  In particular, having survived a period of suicidality and recovered may *sometimes* make you good at suicide intervention, but sometimes it makes you terrible at it. The bottom line is that we have no way to vet our helpers except through their *visible* contributions to the community.  

1.  Speaking of visibility, we're pretty sure that the 90/10/1 rule applies here at SW just like elsewhere on the Internet.  So, if you help out by commenting on a post, chances are you'll provide support and comfort to 10 suicidal people instead of just 1.  

1.  People talking to our suicidal OPs and lurkers offline can easily become [overwhelmed with situations that are more intense or dangerous than they can cope with](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x80ja/what_does_sw_think_about_the_im_here_to_help_pm/c5m438s).  If the conversation happens with the whole community, we can share the burden.  In real-life high-risk suicide intervention situations (e.g. hotlines), there are always multiple people involved because nobody can think of everything, and *everybody who's helping needs support themselves*.

1.  Soliciting PMs is particularly dangerous because it creates expectations that you may not be able to fulfill.  A lot of the risks associated with getting personally involved with suicidal people, as outlined in [our ""don't share contact info"" post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/dmu24/why_shouldnt_i_share_my_contact_information/) in /r/SWResources apply to these situations. If you invite PMs and then fail to provide *all* the help that somebody needs, you're likely to leave them even worse off than if you'd done nothing.  A disappointing experience with seeking help is the last thing that somebody at risk for suicide should be put through.  

1.  The highest value of the SW Community is that the interactions happen out in the open where people can be anonymous, but where the help and advice and can be critiqued and debugged by the community.  This is why we are much more strict in enforcing our guidelines for the people offering help, and more lenient with those in need of it.   No matter how wise and experienced you are, sometimes you'll say the wrong thing, or miss saying something important that needs to be said.  Again, in real-life situations, the primary responder always has somebody looking over their shoulder, listening in, and offering suggestions.  

1.  People seem to make these posts in lieu of responding to the OPs who have taken the emotional risk and posted their stories.  Imagine what it's like to make a post where you put your pain and fear out there, and get few or no helpful responses.  Then you refresh the front page, and somebody has *ignored* your post and made a generic ""I'm here to help!"" post.  

1. These posts are essentially redundant; SW by nature is a place where everybody's either here to get help or give it.  Since our volume is small,  these announcements always use up a slot on the front page for a while and take visibility away from the posts made by people in need.  

##All of this is ***in no way*** meant to discourage anybody who needs help and doesn't want to post from asking someone in our community to talk via PM.   If you're scared to post even with a throwaway account, please look at the comments and ask somebody who looks like they're someone you can talk to, or message the moderators.  Also, if you get a PM request asking for private help, we are **absolutely not** suggesting that you say ""no"".  If you get a request of that nature that you don't feel equipped to handle on your own, please message the moderators and we'll do whatever we can to assist.

I chickened out, stepped down, and pathetically wept myself to sleep.

Tonight, I just finished baking a pumpkin cheese cake. My beautiful wife is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a fleece blanket and watching A Christmas Story.

My five month old daughter, Lily, is asleep in her crib in little red reindeer foot pajamas that say ""Baby's first Christmas.""
Tomorrow we'll wake up in a house we own. I'll cook breakfast, and we'll celebrate our first Christmas together as a family.

I'm newer to Reddit, but not new to the internet. Message boards, and anonymous friends give us somewhere to laugh, vent, cry, and scream. They've got me through some really dark times.

I've always struggled with depression, and contemplated suicide, and even took some pills as a teenager, but never gave it any sort of serious attempt. 

A few months ago my normal dark place got even darker. Everything in my life seemed (and still seems) like shit. I'd been thinking about suicide every single day, and I had been researching the methods. I finally decided what I was going to do and I went out and bought some helium tanks, some plastic tubing, and an oven roasting bag. I bought all the things needed to deliver my death. I would be unconscious within 30 seconds and dead in 20 minutes. Now I never wanted to feel like this was a decision I made in haste, so I left the supplies in the back of my car. I wanted to know the option was still right there, but I didn't want it close enough to taunt me on a late night where I knew all I had to do was slip a bag over my head and be done with it all. 

There were a lot of times I thought about going out and getting it over with. I thought about renting a nice hotel room so the last things I'd hear would be the crashing of waves on the pacific shore. Other times I thought about just driving to a remote parking lot and doing it in the car. I'd be far enough away to be undisturbed, but close enough to be discovered in a somewhat timely matter. 

Today, in a disturbingly calm manner, I finally decided to bring the supplies in and get everything assembled, so that when the time came I wouldn't have to fuss with much. So, I went out to my car, and started carrying in the items. On my dining room table sat my DIY suicide kit. Pictures of balloons and words about children's birthday parties adorned the side of the boxes. Most people who bought these were looking forward to celebrating another year of life, and I bought them with the intent to do just the opposite. 

For some reason, as I pulled the tubing from the Home Depot bag, I couldn't help but think this was just not right. Something about being so calm and collected while doing this just made me pause. I looked at my receipt. It was beyond the 30 days allowed for in the policy, but I wondered if I could get my money back. It was this one thought that made me decide that what I was planning to do wasn't right for me, at least for now. The fact that I thought about getting my money back. Something like that doesn't matter in death, so why was I concerned about it?

Right then, I said to myself, ""I need to find it in myself to give this one more shot."" I called the store I purchased my helium from and told them I had a couple of sealed boxes which I ended up not needing, and asked if they would make an exception and allow me to return them beyond their date. They said, ""No problem."" I was allowed to change my mind. Now I can't say how long this will last. Something terrible may happen to me tonight and tomorrow I may be buying those tanks again, but I know that I at least have given myself another day.

I just wanted to post this as maybe it would make someone else think, ""I'm going to give it one more shot.""",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_16d25h,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/16d25h/i_returned_my_supplies_for_suicide_today/,

Please read.",122,10,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/khqx0/in_honor_of_my_brother_he_committed_suicide_a/,"My brother killed himself a year ago.  We were very close, and it has been unbearably hard on me, my family, and countless friends.  I wanted to come here and tell my side of the story.  And tell the brutal truth, not just the emotions felt.  I want those who feel alone or loved to know what it is like for us who are left behind, not as a way of laying on guilt or belittling your feelings, but so you know what life is like after you are gone.  I will give a small backstory of His life as a jumping off point, but mainly I am focusing on my story.  

He was 32.  He had Bipolar Disorder, which didn't fully manifest until his last 3-4 years of life. He did try twice before to kill himself.  The first we didn't know about, and he was thankful to be ""saved"" by a stranger.  The second was serious, but he came to in the middle of it and realized it wasn't what he wanted.  He crawled to a phone and called 911 himself.  He was a grown adult, he lived 4 hours away from the family, and he did not want us treating him like a baby.  Standing over his shoulder and jumping at every inconsistency in his life not only felt wrong (though unavoidable), but I know it only made him feel worse and fed his depression.  So I tried to back off and give him some room to make mistakes like a normal person......  

I noticed his lack of presence about 3 days before his birthday.  No one else had mentioned it, so I tried to remain calm (it had happened before, and he had been ok).  He had been struggling very hard with money, and I thought maybe he had shut his internet service off.  I decided to wait to call.  I figured if I hadn't heard concerns from anyone else, I would wait until his birthday, because I had planned on calling him then anyway.  So his birthday rolls around, and when I try to call he didn't answer.  I knew this would happen, and the feeling of dread rose worse in my stomach.  Then his ""girlfriend"" sent me a message, asking if I had heard from him.  She hadn't since nearly a week before.  I knew then what I knew 3 days earlier, but I tried to keep up hope.  I started contacting people I knew who lived around him, asking anyone if they had seen/spoken to him or if they could go check on him.  No one could till the next morning.  At 7:45am, I received a phone call that I never, ever wanted.  A neighbor went over and found him.  I still don't know exactly what happened, because according to our mutual friend, the neighbor and his SO have not been the same since.  They stopped talking to anyone familiar with Him.  The man even ignored my mother when she tried to introduce herself and apologize for what he had gone through.  My mutual friend was given the horrible weight of having to call and tell me.  I can't imagine how difficult that must have been.  Being 4 hours away from each other, all he could say was ""I'm so sorry"" over and over.  I cried harder than I have ever cried in my life.  I then had to call my other brother and let him know.  Then me, my husband and 4 yr old, my 
brother and his wife, and my mom's SO had the displeasure of going to Mom's home and letting her know.  She was completely unaware that He had been ""missing"" for nearly a week.  We woke her from her sleep, and I watched as her surprise of seeing me grew to uncomfortable worry as each new person came into the house.  The horror in her body language as she slowly realized what was going on was heartbreaking.  We never even had to say anything.  Parents should never have to bury their children.  They especially shouldn't have to know that their beloved child had been so lost and miserable that they felt the need to end their own suffering.  What an utterly helpless feeling.  I watched a good person be reduced to nothing, full with the feelings of failure.  

Skip past the full day of crying and the haze of disbelief  as we made endless calls to hospitals, police stations, morgues, funeral homes, etc.  Skip past being told that the body had been there for an undetermined amount of time and had started decomposing.  Skip past being told that the body was unidentifiable and the forensic investigator was waiting for dental records to make a positive ID.  Skip past being told that, ""There isn't anything left that you could identify.  And even if there were, I would never let you.  You don't need to see this.""  Skip past knowing that there was no chance to ever see him again, even just to hold his hand and say goodbye.  

The next day we made the 4 hour trip to his house.  I rode with a bottle of Pepto in my hand and a never-ending feeling of complete nausea in my stomach.  I had the tiniest bit of hope because no one had yet mentioned the thing I feared.  I figured it would have come up in all the talks.  We were the last to get there, and once out of the car, Mom asked me, ""Are you ready?""  I truthfully answered, ""No.""  Then she said it.  What I was more worried about than finding anything.  She said, ""Now, they said it smells pretty bad in there.""  OH. GOD.  I had held it together as well as possible during the ride, but that..... I didn't want that.  I broke down instantly.  I ran to my mom's arms and sobbed uncontrollably.  Your sense of smell is the strongest in being tied to memories, and I didn't want to have to experience walking into my brother's house and smelling his dead, rotting body.  No.  But too late, there was nothing to do about it.  The smell was everywhere.  The entire house was filled with the aroma of death.  It wasn't quite what I thought it would be.  It was like a mouse that has died somewhere in the corner of your house, but not quite.  It was both better and worse than I was expecting.  Better because it wasn't as pungant and sickly as I thought it would be, but worse because of the uniqueness of it.  I never got to see the spot where he died.  Not fully.  Mom and my brother walked back ahead of us as I slowly meandered the house, remembering him.  Seeing his house untouched made it seem like he wasn't really gone, just out.  In the room, Mom was just staring as people tried to get her out, and my husband shielded me from going in.  He told me that I didn't want to see it and didn't need to.  I wanted to, but it's probably better that I didn't I guess.  

Fast forward to the next day.  We came back with supplies in hand, and this time armed with menthol rub for our noses.  I don't have to mention the regular milling around, not knowing where to start on cleaning up and looking at all the things that reminded us of Him.  But on this day, I experienced the most surreal moment of my life.  By the time my husband and I got there, my mom and her SO were in the process of cutting out the carpet where he had lay.  I only saw the underside of it.  But even at that, I saw the large circle of blood that had soaked through.  Apparently there were maggots covering the top.  Everything had seaped through the carpet and padding and onto the concrete below.  They took the carpet outside to air out and to help with removing the smell.  Then my mom got a bucket and sponge to scrub the floor.  I told her she didn't need to do it, to let me clean up.  But she wouldn't let me.  So I sat on his bed and watched.  Looking down at my mom, on her hands and knees scrubbing up the blood of my dead brother, I felt removed from the situation.  In all honesty, it felt like watching a crime drama on TV.  It was the sort of thing I had seen on TV and in movies many times before, but it wasn't what happens in real life.  People don't experience that in real life, so it couldn't be real.  At one point, she said to me, ""I think I know why I am ok with doing this.""  After I asked her why, she replied, ""He was my baby.  When he was little I cleaned his diapers.  I took care of him and cleaned up after him if he got sick and threw up.  This is just one more thing I am cleaning up.  He was sick, and I am helping him by cleaning up the mess.""  It was heartwrenching, both grotesquely melancholy and beautifully rational.  (As a side note, there are companies that specifically do this sort of work.  Everyone failed to tell us this, and we didn't find out until after we were done.)  

But here is what I really want people to know.  After we found out and settled some, I made an announcement about it on-line.  I was blown away by the response that followed.  Countless people, probably 100 or more in just a day or two, poured in with messages and comments.  Some were your run-of-the-mill sympathy.  A sort of, ""Oh hey, I knew that guy in school.  He was pretty cool.  That's sad.""  But some, most actually, were truly devestated.  So many people wrote to Him or me, pouring their hearts out.  SO MANY PEOPLE LOVED HIM.  He had no idea the affect his death would have on others.  Friends and family, some who I knew, some who I didn't, completely heartbroken over finding out.  A number of people wrote to tell me how He had been the person who got them through their own tough times.  He had saved so many of his friends and had offered an ear or a voice to them.  I don't think he ever knew how much people cared about him.  People from all aspects and ages of his life.  He thought he was alone, and nothing could have been further from the truth.  I have never in my life seen such a reaction to someone's death.  It's been a year now, and his acct is still active with thoughts of love and remorse.  Not a week goes by that someone hasn't written to him, just to say they are thinking of him or how there is still a light missing from their lives.  So many messages of people saying, ""I wish I would have returned your call,""  or ""I wish I had known how to help you better.""  He had so many people to turn to for help, had he just tried.

It wasn't some kind of crazy gay porno or anything. It was just some messages to a friend and some posts I made on social media. 

I've known I was this way for a while but I never could let my parents know...or any of my super religious family for that matter. They lost it when they found out. Mom cried. Dad yelled. I was thrown out on the street despite the fact that I told them I have no where to go. Absolutely no where. I stayed two nights with a friend of mine but it's not something I'll be able to keep up since his parents will be home in a few days. (They were on vacation and he lives with them.) Since then (Monday night up until this point) I've been sleeping in my car in a parking garage. I have no food whatsoever. I have no gas whatsoever. I can't believe my parents just wrote me off like this. 

I even tried to call my mom on Tuesday hoping it had been enough time to calm everything down. I asked her if I could at least come have dinner or something and they said no because ""my dad doesn't want to sit across the table from a faggot.""

I'm just so hurt and I'm somewhat ashamed of the fact that I'm attracted to other guys. I guess it's because I've been brought up being told it was wrong. 

I really don't know what to do or think. I can't understand how parents not only kick their kid to the street with only 30 minutes notice. They won't let me come back and told me they'd mail me my clothes but everything else was technically theirs because they either bought it or supported me which took money out of their pockets so essentially they believe even the things I purchased are theirs. (Computer, guitar, dog, etc.) They won't even give me a meal or answer their phones for me. I just don't understand how they're perfectly fine with their only child going hungry and sleeping in a parking garage. 

I don't have many friends but now I feel even more alone. My family was the only social communication I really had and now my cousins aren't even allowed to talk to me (They're under 18.) Not only do I see no way of fixing the situation, I'm not sure I want to. My parents are obviously horrible people but that's all I had.

Officer _______,

My name is Id_rather_be_eating.  You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/drugged out of my mind.  I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me.  

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was.  You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am.  There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night.   I had a relationship end with a girl I moved for after only six months, financial problems, living a fairly lonely existence, and a number of other chronic issues.  Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much.  Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years.  I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II.  It has the highest suicide rate among all forms of depression.  

Most of that night comes back in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined.  You are very clear presence throughout that memory though.  You were professional, compassionate, and from what I remember, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours.  To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me.  You weren't supposed to.  I'm glad you did.  Since then, I've gone through quite a few changes.  I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life.  I feel shaken, humbled, and good.  

I have no idea what your life is like.  I don't know if you love or hate your job.  I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you were just as lonely as I was.  I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life.  You were a calming presence for my family when you eventually talked and they wish to say thank you as well.  I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, long time and if that's the case, if you forget me among the hundreds of others you help, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and somewhere, he thinks of you often.  I will never forget you.  

Again, thank you.

Quite a lot has happened since I last posted here. I'll start by saying that I'm not actively looking for a quick/painless/easy way out anymore. Over a week ago I was out with friends when I blacked out again. Until that point I was just living life like I always would, and I was planning on doing that until I felt like I couldn't take it anymore. But now I blacked out, and my friends were there. Apparently I was shaking and coughing up blood and I basically scared the shit out of them.. I hadn't told about my situation yet. I woke up in the hospital only to hear that it's also spread to my lungs (hence the blood). So the 1,5 month I had has been cut in half. Weirdly enough that was the least of my worries as I had to explain what was happening to my friends. Doctor-patient confidentiality prevented them from learning about what was happening while I was out and they wanted to know. There was no point in lying anymore (I didn't actually lie before..I just didn't tell them..unless maybe when they asked me 'what's up' and I'd reply with 'nothing much').

Telling them that I have only a few weeks left was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. In the hospital, hooked up to machines and what not. I had to tell them that I had cancer. -What kind of cancer? -Braincancer. -That's fucked up. -Yeah. -How long till you're better? -.... I won't. Not the easiest of conversation to have..

Anyway, fastforward a week, and I've been released from the hospital (there's nothing else they can do, and I'd rather be out of the hospital). That OceanSkys guy who's also dieing kind of inspired me to not end it myself. He's having a great time and to see everyone care so much makes me feel a lot better. I signed some papers that will keep the doctors from reviving me if my heart stops, and to pull the plug if I ever turn into a vegetable, so I won't have to worry about that anymore. I've been having a good time with my friends and will be until the end. As for my bucket list..it remains empty. There's really nothing more I'd like to do than to hang out with my friends. Although I might loan all the money I can at a bank and donate it all to charity..it's hard to collect debts from a dead guy, haha.

Anyway..just wanted to give you guys an update, as there were a lot of people who took the time to reply and I really appreciated every comment. I might be on for a couple more hours today and some more tomorrow to reply to new comments, but that's gonna be the last you hear from me.

1362447045.0,99,self.SuicideWatch,19odnn,From a survivor; what happens to your family,116,17,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/19odnn/from_a_survivor_what_happens_to_your_family/,"I know this forum is mostly individuals who are on the verge of suicide and seeking help but I want to offer the other side; a survivor who hasn't been suicidal but lost someone to suicide. It's one thing to say ""don't do it for the people you'll hurt"" but I think it's another to hear exactly what you will do to your family. Please take a moment to hear my story and consider the value of a life.



On June 2nd of this past year my mother came home with police. My dad had left a suicide note in his car at a personal location nearby and was missing. When people use the expression that someone's words felt like being physically hit it is not an exaggeration. When my mom said he'd left the note I almost fell over. He'd been fighting depression for a few years but it was under control, how could this happen? My mother had brought the police back to our house to get clothes with his scent for the police dogs so they could find him. After collecting clothes my mom left my brother and I at home while she returned with the police. You don't know how long hours are until you spent them wondering if your dad is dead or not. But even the agony of waiting doesn't compare to having the door finally open to see your mom with just two words; ""I'm sorry"".

Then comes the part most people don't think about. The police report where you have to prove you weren't involved. Those horrible phone calls where you hear your mom have to say over and over ""I'm so sorry, Ricky is dead"" until you feel like you're going mad and have to go anywhere that isn't there. Then the people start visiting. You spend the next week when you're at your most vulnerable being constantly surrounded by people who you have to comfort instead of vice versa. Picking out coffins or urns from people who only want to sell you things and don't give a damn about your loss. Talking with pastors for the service. And then...

It's over. Everyone withdraws and you and your family are alone. The world outside keeps moving even though yours stopped days that seem like years ago. You spend the next few months learning this ""new normal"" as people slowly forget what happened. Nothing is ever the same. Small things will remind you of who you lost. From what I've gathered speaking to other survivors, when it hits you varies but at some point it will hit you and it will hit you hard. I personally spent the better part of a college semester incapacitated and unable to give a shit about anything.

Does that mean I blame my dad? Of course not. I know how much he was suffering (now). Do I wish with all my heart he'd been able to find another way to cope? Every day.

Please. Let someone help you. If there is anything I can do for you, tell me. I don't want anyone else to feel the way my dad did or go through what my family did.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_19odnn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/19odnn/from_a_survivor_what_happens_to_your_family/,

Who knows, this might help.",123,26,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/14l1dk/i_overdosed_in_may_heres_what_happens_at_the_er/,"I am bipolar type II and have borderline personality disorder. I overdosed in May. I was found about half an hour after taking 20 klonopin and 20 lithium. Here's an excerpt from my email to my friends, later:

""In case you've never overdosed, it's a completely awesome, non-gruesome, and all around enjoyable experience.

That's a lie. Now I will (lightheartedly, so it's not so scary) describe what I went through so you won't overdose or you can forward this section to any other loved ones who even hint at overdosing. It would've deterred me if I'd known what you go through if you're one of the high percentage of people who fail at killing yourself via pills.
 
First, you are ordered to drink two cups of actual liquid charcoal. Yes, the shit you cook hot dogs with. (As my brother later joked, ""Was it at least mesquite?"") Anyway, once you chug that shit like it's the worst 4loko you've ever tasted (it's worse than that) approximately one minute later you puke it all up. Everything you ever had in your stomach goes BLACHHHHH out of your mouth and it's gross as hell. Then you're supposed to drink this clear juice (I forget the name 'cause I was groggy by then... EZ flow? ironic...) that's a super strong laxative. At that point I was on the verge of passing out, so they decided to give it to me another awesome way - through my NOSE. I know, you're probably wondering how this magic trick works. Well, they shove a tube down your nose, down your throat (insert really disgusting blow job-esque gagging noise) alllll the way down into your tummy. And then they pour cold liquid down it and it's just... so much fun. Definitely recommend it, fun way to spend an evening, blah blah blah it sucks.
 
Meanwhile! I got stuck with so many needles I can't even count the bruises all over my arms and hands at this point. When I saw my brother after a few days we took him on the ""bruise tour"" to try and count, but there are legitimately too many. My mother recently suggested I tell people who ask about them that I am ""really into bondage."" Umm... okay. They are very specific, medium sized bruises, so I don't think I'll be able to pull that one off. Suggestions for alternative lies are welcome as long as they're not ""Say you're a heroin addict!"" Oh, and later in the shower I found a gigantic, bright blue bruise on my gut. I was completely unaware of how I got it until my mother told me they injected me with anti-clotting medication through a giant needle while I was passed out. Well, okay then.
 
Anyhow. I'm vaguely aware they took me in an elevator and up to the intensive care unit. I had an IV of saline and an IV of the laxative into my nose and an IV in my hand for blood drawing and heart monitors hooked up to a machine and a periodic inflating blood pressure cuff and my own tv, all to myself! I watched an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force around midnight. Be aware, this show is even weirder on many drugs. Then I slept for approximately 12 hours, though I'm told I woke up sometimes and insisted on being disconnected from my many wires so I could use the real bathroom and not a bedpan because I WANT MY DIGNITY DAMN IT and said really mean things to my mom and the nurses. Oops. They had me sign a form to admit myself voluntarily to the psychiatric unit and then apparently I accused the woman of bullying me into it? Oops again. Apparently I was possessed by the devil - later I kicked a chair and said ""fuck you!"" and I do not remember that. Cool.

So then I graduated to the delicious clear liquid diet, which was room service in fact made up of (you guessed it) clear liquids. Mmm. Then I slept more and eventually graduated to real food. The lame hospital chocolate cake slice made me a little bit glad to be alive. That statement is actually true.""

In conclusion, kids, be prepared. Most people fail at overdosing, no matter how hard you try. Many end up in comas, brain dead, partially brain dead, etc.

I'm not great now. I still struggle with so much shit. I may attempt again in my life, who knows. But it was the roughest thing to go through yet in my life.

A book that has gotten me through other times when I wanted to kill myself has been ""How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying To Kill Me"" by Susan Blauner.

1323024819.0,97,self.SuicideWatch,mzysm,From: a sister left behind. ,108,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mzysm/from_a_sister_left_behind/,"My little sister just killed herself. She (I'll call her Nicole. Not her real name)  had just turned 18. She was supposed to graduate high school this coming May. She was supposed to go to college. She had just gotten engaged. She was pregnant. I promised her I would help her take care of the baby while she went to school. I let her and her fiance live with me. I tried my best to make sure she wouldn't have to worry about anything. Apparently I failed. 
Our mother died when I was 17 and Nicole was only 4. Her father took her for a few years until I had graduated and was financially stable enough to seek custody. I was denied twice, but allowed visitation rights. I felt almost like a father forced to pay child support for a kid I didn't get to see. One night when I had Nicole at my house, I drew her a bath. I thought she'd enjoy a giant jacuzzi tub full of bubbles (who doesn't?) As soon as she stepped out of her clothes to get into the tub I noticed bruises all over her little body. 
Especially on the inside of her thighs. 

I saw red.

I called the police, they investigated and a very long painful ordeal followed. To make a long story short.... he ended up in prison and I got custody of Nicole. 

The years passed with Nicole becoming more and more erratic and depressed. She started drinking when she was 13. That's also when she started cutting. I noticed blood on her pants once, but just assumed she had started her period unexpectedly one day. I didn't think for a moment it was because she was cutting her legs open. Eventually she ran out of unmarred flesh and moved to her stomach. And then her arms. And that's when I noticed. I confronted her about it, and she told me to ""fuck off"" and ""mind my own business."" So I arranged therapy and counseling sessions. She fought so hard against it but I begged her to try. I told her it might help, because I didn't know what to do. She told me I was ""fucking useless"" and she should have ""stayed with dad."" That hurt me most, considering everything he had done to her and all I tried to do was help. But after a lot of fighting, she finally agreed to go. In therapy, she was unresponsive and bitter, or she would make up stories to tell the therapist rather than actually talk about her problems. 

When she was 14 she started skipping school a lot (I got a lot of phone calls from school wondering where she was) or when she was in school she would fight with everyone. Some people tried to bully her, but I think she was the real bully. I had to attend conferences with her teachers and the principle, she was suspended a few times, I got angry phone calls and visits and emails from parents of girls Nicole had beaten up and stolen things from. Grounding her didn't work, and I was so nervous to do anything that might hurt her or trigger something that I mostly just put up with it all. 
When she was 15 she started dating a 23 year old. I was definitely not ok with this and told him to leave her alone or I would call the police. She sneaked out with him one night and broke into a neighbor's house to steal things to pawn for drug money. Yes, drug money. I couldn't believe it when the cops showed up at the door. I convinced the neighbors not to press charges, but I did press charges myself against the boy. This did not sit well with Nicole. She ran away. 

I immediately reported it and she was returned only 2 days later, but I had absolutely had enough. I knew it wasn't totally her fault and that she was hurting so much and needed help that I couldn't give her. So I did something that I probably shouldn't have. 
I admitted her into a psychiatric hospital. I brought her blankets and pillows and her own clothes and pictures and books from home so she wouldn't be horribly bored. I brought her pizza during visiting hours so she wouldn't have to eat the hospital food. I tried so hard to take care of her but she refused to even look at me. She only said three words to me the entire 3 months she was in the hospital. 

""I hate you.""

This crushed me. I told her how much I loved her every single day. I didn't even buy myself a new *bra* in 5 years because all my money went to taking care of her. And I mean every last penny of it. I slept on the god damned floor of my bedroom. I didn't buy myself a bed so she could have a big canopy bed and a computer in her room. I ate baby food (only 20 cents a jar!) for lunch at work so I could give her lunch money for school. I sacrificed everything to take care of her. And I never blamed it on her. That was my choice. I did my best to make sure she didn't KNOW how much I was struggling to take care of her. I gave up my 20s. I'm in my 30s now and haven't been on a date since I was 19 so I could always take care of her. But the only thing she could say to me was ""I hate you?""

I let it go. I just kept my head down and kept trying to make her happy. She started dating this boy I thought was bad for her but I said nothing because he seemed to make her happy. She started smiling again. I heard her LAUGH. I hadn't heard her laugh in over a year, and even then I think it was more of a sarcastic laugh than a genuine one. She was doing a little better in school and back on track for graduation. I hated the boy but I let him move in with us when his mom kicked him out because he was creating positive changes in Nicole. She still barely talked to me, and never apologized for the comment in the hospital, but I let it go because I was so overjoyed she was finally doing ok. 
Then she told me she was pregnant. She seemed manically happy about it... like the happiness was artificial. But I figured I was overthinking it because it was so rare that she was happy I just didn't know what it was like. Then her boyfriend proposed to her. I thought it was a bad idea considering how young they were but once again I said nothing. 

Two weeks ago, I woke up to screams. His screams. I ran into their bathroom and saw him on the floor holding her. She was limp. There was a puddle of blood and a straight razor on the tile next to the toilet. He kept saying ""WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT THE FUCK?!"" over and over again and crying. I just stared. I wasn't completely processing what I was seeing. It's like my mind just went totally blank. I vaguely remember going to the phone and calling 911. The whole day and the day after that is kind of a blur. Ambulance showing up. Police asking me a lot of questions. Being at the hospital. Doctors and social workers telling me I have to start planning the funeral. It's like everything was moving super fast but in slow motion all at once. I didn't cry until after the funeral. Watching her casket being lowered into the ground. Then it hit me. And it hit me hard. 

Today is the first day I've come out of my room since. Nicole's fiance moved out. I'm not sure where he went. I think he told me from the doorway of my room before he left, but I was barely paying attention. 

She left no note. No reason, no explanation. I can't understand it. I tried so hard to help her and to love her and take care of her. Then she just... gave up?! She had reasons to hurt, but how could she have just ended it like that? Didn't she know how much she was loved?! 
She was going to be a MOM. She was going to be a WIFE. And she was my whole fucking world. I don't have any friends. I don't have a lover. I have my boring job that I dealt with so I could have money to care for her. I had plans for my life that I gave up on so I could take care of her, and she just left me. 

Now, I've said all of this for a reason. You all hurt. You all probably have very good reasons to. But I beg you all... think of the reasons you have to stay. Think of the people that you would be hurting if you gave up. Please don't do to your parents/lovers/friends/family/etc what my baby sister did to me. 
She's gone now. She feels no pain. She just left me to deal with it. It was cruel of her. So now I'm stuck thinking about all the times she told me she hated me. She never told me she loved me. She never said thank you for a single fucking thing. And now I've wasted a *decade* of my life and it obviously didn't mean anything or help at all because she still quit. 
And I will never know how she really felt about anything or why she decided to opt out. 



Basically... whether you recognize it or not, there is someone who loves you. There is someone who cares. And there is someone who will be fucking *devastated* if you killed yourself. So please don't give up. You're not just giving up on yourself, you're giving up on everyone who cares about you. You're giving up on a future that could be beautiful.

I am currently in the states while my brother was back home in India. He had some plans to startup a business and had been working really hard at it. I had called him yesterday to discuss his plans and ended up telling him it was too risky. He agrreed to give it up. Three hours later I missed a bunch of calls from him. After calling him back he started telling me how much he loved me. He was clearly drunk. He apologized for a bunch of things and asked me to tell him a good memory of us. He also asked why i didnt call him more often. I was busy driving so I said I'd call him in 5 mins. I did but he didn't answer any of my calls. I thought he went to sleep or something. This morning my parents called to come home ASAP. He committed suicide.

I don't really know how to deal with this. I didn't even say I love you to him when I said I would call him back. I am currently at the airport on my way back.

In the majority of cases, it's comments like:

&gt;stay in this world. There are soo much things you didnt do or saw. You have the honor To live. Go out. Walk around listen to the birds watch the beatiful nature. No one ever could take you the beatifulness of the nature. Life is wonderful. Set a goal. Try to do things you would love to do. Hope you will be fine again. Everyone will help you and with this post you shows that you want help. There are soo many people in the world that want to be your friend.

&gt;You should try going for a walk. Think of nothing but the birds and others sounds of nature around you. It will clear your head. Also find one person who you trust to listen even if it's not your family and talk to them about your problems. It will get a big weight off of your chest and you may even find that they don't hate you as much as you think

&gt;Such infinite minutia to enjoy on this planet. We are on the cusp of witnessing an awakening of minds to each others, a true understanding of life, and not distractions.

&gt;You are not unwanted, you are not useless, and You are obviously not stupid. To be honest, I don't trust meds. Never have, never will. Worked for a few people I know. I never needed them.
I'm sorry you feel so down. You shouldn't be unhappy. I know that feeling of losing control, and it happens to all of us. Depression is hard to deal with, but death isn't the way to deal with it.

And so on. Let me clear something for yourself - we do not want to do anything. We don't want to wait. We don't want to see unseen. We don't want to enjoy nature. The only thing we want *is to feel happy*, and usual human activities *do not make us happy*.

See, the average human mindset really differs from depressed and, especially, suicidal person. Average humans starts his day by waking up, stretching a little bit, saying hello to sunshine and everyone who lives nearby him, and then proceeds to do his chores. Suicidal person is woken up by feeling intense pain, both physical and mental. He lays on his bed. Maybe for a half of hour. Maybe for an hour. Alone with his thoughts, his hatred on life. And if the intense urge to go to the toilet defeats him - he stands up, barely resisting to scream from soreness in his limbs and eyes. 

See the difference? 

By the way - being suicidal does not makes you highly knowledgeable about the topic, either. Every one is suicidal for their own reasons.

Never. 
     I'm a recovering alcoholic, almost 2 years sober, and I have to deal with the temptation to drink all the time. When I drank was the only time in my life when I met people (college), but that usually led to trouble. 
     I have no motivation because I've already set myself up to fail.

I grew up in a house where we were NEVER hugged or kissed or told we were loved.

Long story short, someone who I thought was my friend ratted me out to the cops and doctors, and I spent a week in the fucking crazy-house against my will ""for my protection."" That ""protection"" isn't covered by my insurance, and as such cost me over$12,000, leaving me with maybe $30 to my name in assets, and my student loan payments, my 1-year lease that I just signed, and my utilities (phone, electricity, Internet, etc.) all due today.  Oh, and no job and no chance of getting one because I just got fired for being crazy and spent a week locked up in a crazy-house.  I am bankrupt.  I have no job, I have no friends, I cannot trust the people I thought were my friends, and I have no money to pay off any of my debts.  My ""friend"" sure did a good deed by stopping me from killing myself, didn't he?  Look at how much BETTER my life is now that I got the ""help"" I so desperately needed!

Fucker.

Oh, and to answer folks' questions from last go-'round, my boss-boss called me in last Thursday to talk to *her* boss (my boss-boss-boss, then) and someone from HR last Friday (a week ago, then). I specifically asked if I was in trouble, and she said no; there had been no complaints about my work whatsoever.

I went in, dressed in my best suit, having no idea what was up but thinking it might be an interview for a promotion.  It turns out they'd gone through my desk and found suicidal writings on my notepad.  They told me I was being fired for writing down my suicidal thoughts on company time and company paper, and that I'd need a doctor's note before they'd consider hiring me again.  I told them that this job was the only thing keeping me going, and that if I hadn't been suicidal before, you can damn well bet I was suicidal then.  That's when the pink piggly fat fucker from HR handed me a suicide hotline number and said words that I literally could not hear because I was so goddamn angry.  I tore it up in front of his jowly balding face and asked if I was free to go.

I punched myself in the face on my way out of the lobby, and **that's** when the undercover cop who'd been waiting the whole time swooped in and threw me out of the building.  I got a visit from the police later that afternoon, but I was clean and showered and my apartment was in order and I lied through my teeth to them, so they only gave me a warning not to be suicidal again, *or else*.  Right around then is when I called the fucker who I thought was my friend, and within an hour of hanging up on him I was under arrest and locked up in the crazy-house.

I'm not sure what lessons to have taken from this episode.  Here's what I think I've learned:

* Never show any sign of weakness, ever, to anyone

* Society hates suicidal people, because **we** know that we can leave whenever we want and they resent us for that 

* Trust No One

* There are worse things than dying, and being forced to stay alive against your will--and being bankrupted in the process--is one of them 

* Suicidal people are the perfect victims for bullies such as employers, doctors, and so-called friends, because they can do whatever the fuck they want to us, charge us money we just don't have for it, and earn the praises of society for both ""helping someone in need"" and sticking it to suicidal people.  Also, we don't fight back.

Now I just need to figure out how to die in a way that inconveniences as many people as possible.

Of course, I'd *looooooooooove* to hear any theories for why I shouldn't kill myself now, seeing as *every single time I've wound up deciding to stay alive my life has gotten worse*.  I really would like to see /SW's spin on this turd.  Tell me how I'm supposed to get on unemployment benefits after being fired for cause, or how those benefits will ever be enough to pay for any of the bills I have.  Tell me how I can escape everything by declaring bankruptcy despite having no money for a lawyer and being unable to discharge student loans except by paying them off or dying.  Tell me how I'm supposed to sue my employer even though they'll say they fired me for poor performance rather than being cray-cray, or how no lawyer will take the case for as little money as it represents, or how goddamn long it takes to get a case through court.  Tell me how I still have my youth or this is just a goddamn phase or how ""it sure looks like you're having a rough time, but hang in there it gets better."" Yeah, tell me **HOW IN THE FLYING FUCK THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER, OR WHEN, OR FOR WHOM.** Tell me how goddamn thankful I need to be that I have a Real True Friend who looks out for me, even though my ""friend"" ratted me out to the cops and is the reason I have a criminal record now and spent the week in the crazy-house.

And I'm not trying to insult any of you.

I want to help.  I want to help these other people.

And I want us to help them more effectively.  

Please consider this question:

When YOU are feeling upset about something, what feels more helpful in relieving that upset: having someone *listen* to you while you work out your issues in your own mind and speak them?  Or being told by strangers a bunch of reasons WHY you should not feel upset?   

The overwhelming majority of posts in this topic are the kind of thing you wouldn't get in a face-to-face or a telephone call, they're very collected, organized, thoughtful, but more effective engagement could be made through smaller chunks of dialogue.  A real conversation.

My worry is that there are a lot of people helping out by posting what they think a suicidal person would want to hear, without considering the possibility that a suicidal person might just want someone to listen to them.

Instead, that suicidal person is barraged by opinions, statements, commands, anecdotes (some of these are very empathic, which is good) from faceless strangers suggesting that ""No, you shouldn't"" or ""No, please don't"".  * I am worried that they came here hoping to find an ear, and instead they find a thousand mouths.*  

What I am advocating is that you can be more helpful by asking pointed questions.  Questions that guide them toward introspect.  This approach is based on a simple truth: That *no one can solve your problems but you*.  Questions that get them thinking about their situation and how maybe it's not so bad.

* What made you feel this way?
* When did this start?
* What would you like to see or do differently?
* What do you wish you could have done?
* Is there anyone you know who might share that interest?
* What do you wish they would have said about you instead?

It is more effective to ask a question that guides them to probe themselves deeper.   Get a response.  Ask another question that guides them to probe themselves deeper.  Get a response.  Repeat.  

In this way, you demonstrate that you are listening, and genuinely interested in the problem.  Not only that , but it encourages the suicidal to **find their own solution to their problem**, which is way more relevant and motivating than having someone else command you to do something.

In this way, you can help them without imposing your opinion of 'what they want to hear'.  If they want reassurance, this approach will get them to ask for it.  If they want a solution, this approach will guide them towards the exact issue they need help with.  If they just want to rant and vent, it will be made obvious by this approach.  Let them tell you what the issue is!  Sometimes our first mental draft of a problem isn't the actual issue, it's just a symptom.  Only by letting them get to the root of it can *the correct problem* be solved.

**TL;DR** Listening is better than talking.  [More](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=reflective+listening)

She's just come out of a mental health facility where she stayed for awhile in order to get some help.  She has battled with deep depression for years, but kept her pain and agony mostly to herself. I'm her best friend of 20 years and even I didn't know what kind of pain &amp; darkness she was dealing with.   

Last night she told me that she came here one night when she was at her lowest point. She had a plan. She was ready. Her plan would not have resulted in a cry for help, it would have ended her life, no question.  

It was the compassion &amp; understanding she received here that made her decide to get help instead of taking the quick way out.  Some wonderful person took her to a private conversation and spent a lot of time with her.  

This is a direct quote from my friend, ""They reached in through the darkness and offered me a helping hand when I needed it most."" 

My friend is a kind person with a big heart and is well loved by me, her friends and her family.  I don't know what I would have done had she not found some help here.  My friend is now on medication that has made all the difference for her.  She has her life back.  YOU did that. YOU started that process. 

I want to personally thank each and every one of you who volunteer your own time (and hearts) in order to make a difference for other human beings you don't even know.  It cannot be an easy thing to do. I want you to know that YOU make a difference.  This mattered.  YOU matter.

I have been there.  I have done that.  I have been in the place you are now.  The dark place with no light at the end of the tunnel.  The place where the only way out is to eat your gun.

DO NOT DO IT.

I have five guns.  I haven't shot myself with one yet.  And that's because I'm happy with who I am.

I am also gay.

That's why I came within minutes of killing myself seven years ago.  I found a friend who, even though he didn't know it at the time, stopped me from doing it.  And I'm so happy I did.

It may seem like you have no way out, that there's no one there for you, that the solution to everything is to remove yourself as the problem.

YOU ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.

I can't tell you how hard it was for me to come out.  What I can tell you is how great my life has been since I did.  You might think you have no life, no friends, but YOU DO.  There are people who will miss you when you're gone, I guarantee it.  I would be one of those people.

While I am gay and my primary aim is to help fellow gay men in hardship, that is not the end of my aim.  If you're gay, if you're depressed, if you're feeling like nobody can help you, LET ME KNOW.  I'm not going to waste your time trying to pitch life to you.  I am going to tell you that your life is worth living.  Ask me how.  I want to hear all about it.  I can't offer platitudes without knowing you, but I can give you my phone number.  I can talk to you all night long.  I am a pilot.  I can fly myself to where you are, wherever in the world, RIGHT NOW, and I can help you get out of the situation you're in.

I make no guarantees or promises other than this:
YOUR LIFE IS VALUABLE.  THIS WORLD WOULD BE WORSE OFF WITHOUT YOU.

You might not believe it now.  But I can show you why it's true.  Why your life is worth living.  Message me, and you'll get my phone number.  I don't care if it's 5AM like it is now--I will talk to you.  You are that important.  Don't doubt it for a minute.

If you think you've exhausted all your options, and have gone beyond your last best hope, FUCKING CALL ME.  It will take just a few minutes out of your life, and your life will become so much more valuable as a result.  Not just to you, but to everyone who cherishes you.  Even if you don't know who they are right now.

You will.  Call me.  Let me know.  Let me help you.

I do. But as I read through all of these ""don't do it and here's why"" posts that have flooded /r/SW recently, all I can think is, ""Damn. This person clearly knows nothing about depression.""

""Just snap out of it"" is one thing I keep seeing here. ""Hey, I was depressed, but then I got my shit together and now I'm happy! You can, too!"". In another post I read something along the lines of, ""Even if you don't have a **legitimate** reason to be depressed, remember that it's completely normal to have thoughts of killing yourself.""

What?

Okay, look. I know everyone here just wants to help. That's great. Amazing, in fact. Reddit is such a great and caring community, and I mean that in the most sincerest of ways. But if you don't truly understand depression I ask you-- no, I *beg* you-- to just stay silent. 

Offer support in the comments, of course. Ask questions. But do **not** pretend to know what it's like to be depressed and *definitely* don't act like you're a qualified psychologist.

It's true that everyone gets depressed from time to time. ""She broke up with me, my life is over!"" or ""My kitteh died, I'm so sad!"" are normal ""depressions"" for us all. Clinical depression, however, is an entirely different issue. Just because you've been sad before does **not** mean you know what true depression is like. And when you try to give ""hope"" to people suffering from it based on that misconception, well, you're doing more harm than good.

Clinical depression that leads to suicidal ideation is a very serious psychological disorder. Serious thought of suicide is not normal. The deep hole, the black dog that is clinical depression, is not something one can simply snap their fingers at to get out of. 

My friends, I know you all mean well. But please, stop making posts that belittle this curse. While I admire the fact that you want to help I feel insulted by many of these recent posts from people who think this is just a game that is limited to only adolescents. I am 30 years old and I have struggled with depression my entire life.

Instead, why not just hang out in the comments sections of /r/suicidewatch/new? Just talk to those who are seriously depressed and suicidal. Offer an ear. Give positive feedback.

But this recent spate of ""Hey, I was sad yesterday because my dog died but now I'm happy! You can be, too!"" posts need to stop. If you haven't suffered from true clinical depression, you have no idea what it's like.

There were a number of reasons I made the attempt that are spelled out in the letter.  I'm Biploar type II.  I'm posting it here as someone who was in a really bad place, thought I had no options, made it through an attempt, and is unbelievably grateful for that fact.  If you're considering suicide, please ask for help.  I was incredibly lucky.  Things get better.  





Officer ________,

My name is time_better_spent.  You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/asleep/drugged out of my mind.  I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me.  

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before even getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was.  You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am.  There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night.   I got dumped by a girl I moved for after only six months, financial problems, living a fairly lonely existence, and a number of other things.  Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much.  Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years.  I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II.  From what I read, it has one of the the highest suicide rates among all forms of depression.  

Most of that night comes back to me in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined.  You are very clear presence throughout that memory though.  You were professional, compassionate, and from what I remember, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours.  To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me.  You weren't supposed to.  I'm glad you did.  Since then I've gone through quite a few changes.  I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life.  I feel shaken, humbled, and good.  

I have no idea what your life is like.  I don't know if you love or hate your job.  I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you are just as lonely as I was.  I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life.  You were a calming presence for my family (who I heard you talked to) and they wish to say thank you as well.  I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, long time and if that's the case, if you forget me among the hundreds of others you help, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and that somewhere, he thinks of you often.  I will never forget you.  

Again, thank you.

I am 36 year old married man with 2 kids aged 6 and 4.  I recently discovered Bitcoin during the the big spike that was on the news. I bought them when they were around $200 each and I was extremely disappointed when they went down to around $100.

I wanted to find a way to get more value for the coins I had bought and recover the loss in value. Then I discovered Satoshi Dice. I found you could gamble with your Bitcoins and double your money. 

Well, I started playing a bit - won around $5,000 worth of Bitcoins, and then lost about $20,000 worth. I was so ashamed of my loss that I dug into my home mortgage fund and gambled $40,000 away. Within 1 week it was all gone.

My wife does not know at this point. She will probably find out when the letters from the bank start coming. I have no other savings. I have let down my family and myself. At this point, I am considering slitting my wrists.

Posting it here in case any of it resonates with people hurting right now.",92,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10chyb/i_wrote_this_affirmation_for_myself_to_read_when/,"No matter what is going on right now, everything will be all right. In spite of all the bad moments, all the times you want to cut up your wrists with a straight razor and swallow every last pill, to claw the hair off every smirking woman’s scalp and dig your nails into the vulnerable pale wrists of every boy who ever hurt you, it will all be fine. There will still be good moments, even great moments too.

Even if you are reading this at a time of heartbreak, even at the death of a loved one, even facing your own death, know that everything will be all right. Nothing is ever going to end up as you expect it to, but you will come out of all of this just fine if you keep a cool head and a semi-positive disposition.

When the whole world feels like it has wronged you, remember that your choices in part put you where you are. That’s not your fault either--you chose for a reason, and choosing is never wrong. And you have the power to get yourself out of these situations, just by seeing the positive. Even if you’re seemingly really and truly trapped—be your captor a physical illness, the ever-present depression, the impossible colleague, or the waiting game of romantic half-commitments—remember that you will get out. Everything changes. You’ll never be caught for too long, especially if you put your mind towards untangling yourself. Let go of the self-pity, and learn to accept.

In that same vein of acceptance, remember that you are just like everyone else. You deserve to live. Even if you don’t fit into social norms and categories as neatly and find it difficult to integrate well socially compared to others, you are as equipped to deal with all situations just like other people can. Even if you get dumped by the one you trust the most, you can and will start over.

Remember too that other people are just like you. They get hurt for stupid reasons. They say things they don’t mean. They’re ignorant sometimes. Sometimes as fragile and defensive as you feel. Apply patience. Try not to be so hurt by what they do. Their actions and words don’t have to affect you unless you let them.

Finally, you have to stop thinking about ending your life altogether. While you do have an acknowledged form of chronic pain, emotional though it may be, it is controllable. You are the one keeping yourself in the dark. While it hurts to live, you know that the main reason you want to die is to (finally) affect other people. To make them acknowledge you at last. But you can only truly do that with your active actions. If you die, you’ll just be forgotten. You know that there’s too much you don’t want to miss, so why bother even considering ending it?

Remember that it isn’t always like this. When you’re happy, the pain stops. Stop trying to die and learn to live for those moments. You’re already physically dying, so start learning to live.

I was 18 and a senior in high school. It was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. She was a best friend of mine but stupid things had gotten in the way and we had grown apart. I encourage each and every one of you to reach out for help if you're hurting in some way. Your life is precious and you are special. Your friends and family will be profoundly impacted if you do choose to go. You might not think it'd be such a big thing or that they'll get over it eventually, but for me I'll never be the same. Every birthday, holiday, death day, burial day, special occasion is another day where I look back on it. Sometimes I feel guilty, sometimes sad, sometimes I'm just so pissed off. There will always be that dark spot in my consciousness. The questions, the whys, hows, whos. Most of the time I'm okay and I feel like I've accepted what has happened. But sometimes I get struck down with the overwhelming grief. Her mom had made a memorial video for her facebook page and I watched it. I was enjoying all the kiddie pictures and whatnot but then it had her voicemail message play and I lost my shit. I bawled for hours and replayed the message over and over and over again. The pain is very real and hurts just as bad even after 5 years. I just encourage you all to reach out and prevent this type of heartache. I'm not saying what you're going through isn't very real and very painful, I'm just saying find another way through it.  I would give anything to see my friend again. To hear her laugh, to straighten her hair, to have watched the newest Harry Potters because we used to go to the opening day together, to read effing Breaking Dawn with her (even though its terrible) because I was the one who first lent Twilight to her and she loved it. It is silly but these little things bother me the most. The missed opportunities and fun stuff. That's what hurts. Missing what could have been her life.

They always run. It takes a while sometimes, but they always run.

I keep trying to prepare my mind for the life of isolation I am doomed to. Now and then it.. looks like for once, I'm not a freak or a monster. But then she runs. Cuts off contact. Every time. For the third time. Different people. The problem is me.

I don't know if I can get there. I've been strong enough to endure a lifetime of abuse, and every abandonment, but this may be the last I can take.

Maybe I could tailor my mind for that solitary life. But I'm starting to think I'd rather die.

They were far more receptive than I expected, and next year I'm going to move away and have a fresh start at a different school. For those of you out there who are thinking of killing yourselves, *please try and communicate with your loved ones first.* You'd be surprised at how far they might go to help, just to ensure that your life isn't at stake. 

Also, in thinking of various suicide methods, I ended up concluding that none of the ones attainable in my situation were 100% effective, and thus not really worth trying. So I've decided to give life another chance. 

Life isn't easy, and there are many times when it just plain sucks. But thinking of how to end it is usually not a productive endeavor either, especially not when there are most likely people around you who care.

i'd cut myself, extremely shallowly, but the cops saw blood and flipped out. i was handcuffed, put in the back of a police car despite my cooperation, and driven to a mental hospital where i was forcibly held for a week (five days without the weekends counting). i missed a midterm and countless responsibilities. all i wanted was someone to talk to, and there was NO ONE there. there was a doctor i saw once in five days. we were to sit and play cards with each other or read romance novels. that was it.

i was denied the chance to go to my scheduled therapist's appointment or speak to anyone outside of the one phone they had in the common area. my own cell phone and personal property were all taken from me.

Girlfriend cheated and ripped me apart while telling me,79,8,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15u964/im_at_the_bottom_girlfriend_cheated_and_ripped_me/,"I've posted here a few times before with different accounts. Not that it matters. I have been extremely depressed and suicidal for a long time, but it usually comes in waves. I know some people will probably skip over this or roll their eyes thinking its a typical ""my partner broke up with me"" thing, but this is just the topping on a horrific cake to me.

On New Years Eve my girlfriend ignored me. I wanted to spend it with her, but it didn't happen and I spent the night alone, getting drunk. I knew why she didn't want me around.

I found out the next day that she had drunken, unprotected sex with her male roommate that night. And to twist the knife, she told me she loved it and did not feel sorry about it. And intended to do it again.

She then systematically ripped down every piece of self esteem I had remaining, pointing out all of the things she sees as flaws and justifying them as a reason she did what she did.

I don't know if I left anything out. I can barely think. My body feels like it's on fire. I have felt this before, but never this intense. There is no hope. I admit I am a fragile person with some issues, but the person I loved and cared about most stabbed me. Repeatedly. I am in total disbelief. I can't put my mind in a place where I can understand how this could happen and how she doesn't feel bad for it.

I want to be dead. This is it. I've fantasized about it so many times but I simply want it now. I am way too fucked up to live. Every single insecurity I have was ripped apart by her and pointed out with a spotlight. Every little piece of self loathing that floats around my brain was amplified 100x.

This is it. I don't believe in god, but a few months ago, the last time I was in it this deep, I made a plea to the universe to show me that I should stay here. Here it is. The sign I was waiting for, to tell me that I should die. It won't get better. It gets fucking worse and worse. I have never hated anything as much as I hate myself right now.

I'm simply a disgusting, worthless piece of shit. I can't believe she even gave me a chance. I have been the best I could possibly be. I really tried. 

And I still love her. My mind is so twisted. She ruined me and I still love and care about her. I hate myself for that too.

I can barely see anymore so I'm done writing. I don't know how to deal with this. My entire body feels like its on fire. I could never explain this feeling in words. In the deepest pits of depression and hate and self loathing I can physically feel it in my body. It feels like I'm cooking from the inside.

I was unsure of my schooling, lonely, and basically through with this terrible thing I came to knew as life. I came here, and some wonderful redditors gave me some motivation to pick up the pieces and move on.

Within this month, I transferred to a major that I might enjoy more. I dropped and withdrew from all my courses this quarter so I have time to reflect and time to analyze what I want in life, rather then go through the motions as I have the last few years. I also have worked with my doctor to find the best choice for my medicine at this current stage. I also have decided to branch out and be more social, hang with friends more, and even met back up with a girl I had a crush on long ago. Things there are going swimmingly and better then I could have imagined.

This lack of stress and the feeling of being cared for by anybody, including friends, family, and redditors have really helped me. 

I just wanted to post this as a thank you to those who helped me out, I was seriously minutes away from ending my life, and now I am here, and I have improved greatly. Depression and suicide still cross my mind far more then I wish, but its far less then it had been.

Life is wonderful, it may be hard to envision in the worst of times, but it does and it can get better. Just reflect upon yourself, and reach out to others who care, whether it be a doctor, girlfriend, or even a redditor, we are here for you.

You guys are all amazing, and I love every one of you. Its pretty bizarre to say that Reddit had saved my life, but essentially it did. 

Thank you so much,

1294836186.0,71,self.SuicideWatch,f0uzz,I went into a mental health facility to get help. They called the police on me within ten minutes of me being there...,79,8,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f0uzz/i_went_into_a_mental_health_facility_to_get_help/,"I have been looking to get help since last june. I found a therapist that didn't know how to do his job very well so I never saw him again. At the beginning of December I dragged my ass out of bed at seven thirty in the morning to walk into a mental health facility and get help. They turned me down and told me they couldn't take me as a new patient because I didn't live in the right county. I live in the same fuckin' county as the facility. To tell you the truth I think they turned me down because I'm white and every single employee there was latino along with every single patient...

So, immediately after that happened I drove to another mental health facility half an hour away from where I live. I walked in and told them I was looking to get help. At first the lady told me they couldn't take me as a new patient that day and to come back the following day. Then she asked me two questions. First, she asked if I had ever had problems in the past with depression. I said yes and that I have been on four different anti-depressants before but wasn't currently on one. Then she asked if I had a plan to kill myself. My exact words were, ""If I was going to kill myself I *do* know how I would do it."" 
Now, I don't know if that's an exact yes but I do know that if I'm ever asked that question again I will tell them I'm not going to answer. She said ok and pulled me back into her office. She asked a few more questions like if I was schitzophrenic and what not before telling me she was going to call the police. I looked her in the eye and said, ""What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I came in here to get help and this is how you help people?"" I ended up telling her that if she called the police it would just make things worse. I told her that I walked in on my own to get help and that calling the police wasn't necessary. She said ""Ok, well let me get two other colleagues of mine."" She ended up bringing in another guy and another girl to come and talk to me. The guy ended up telling me to follow him into his office. I followed him and he sat me down and started talking to me about what was going on in my life while the second woman just kind of sat there. The first woman who originally said she was going to call the police wasn't around anymore. After talking to this guy for three minutes the second woman left and five minutes later the police knocked on the door. It got really fuckin' bad and they started asking me questions about my ""plan"". I told them they were fucking idiots and that if this was their way of helping somebody then they needed to re-think their line of work. The police kept asking me if I was going to initiate my ""plan"". I started to watch what I would say. They asked if I was a danger to myself. I lied and said no. I kept telling everybody there that they were fucking morons and finally asked one of the police officers if I was being forced to go somewhere. He told me that they were called to take me to the emergency room but they couldn't since I apparently wasn't a danger to myself and that if I would have answered yes to any of their questions they would have forced me to go. I got up and walked out while everybody in the whole place was watching. I kept telling them to go fuck themselves on the way out. I don't think I have ever made a bigger scene in public. 

Reddit, I fuckin' went to get help just like YOU GUYS TOLD ME TO. And this is what I got for it and from it. I created a throwaway account the last time I made a post to suicide watch and I don't remember the user name and password so I created another one. I remember all the comments. ""Go and get help.""... "" I'm so sorry to hear you're going through a hard time. You have to get help for yourself."" Yada yada yada. I do have to thank you I guess. Because if it wasn't for you I would never have walked into those mental health facilities. But I got fucked over for literally asking for help. 

I haven't left my room in a month and a half since the beginning of December when that happened. I litterally haven't left my room at all except to go to the bathroom. I don't eat unless the other person I'm living with brings food to my door... I'm pathetic... I sleep from nine in the morning untill five at night. I don't expect you guys to help and I don't want it anymore. Help may only be a four letter word. But that four letter word is much bigger than what people can actually provide. If you consider help to be just a good comment on reddit suicide watch then screw you. Anything you guys have to tell me I already know. Everything you guys have to say I have heard. Sorry if I sound like a jerk. I have tried SEVERAL times to get help for myself... I'm done trying to get help. I'm not going to call those bullshit hotlines... I'm not going to go and see another doctor. I'm not going to find another therapist when I have been to five in the last three years. I have read so many posts on suicide watch and it bums me out to know my situation is a bit worse then what alot of other people are going through... Yeah I have lost loved ones and yeah I have lived in some pretty fucked up situations. Sorry if that sounds selfish and self centered but alot of times I read other peoples' posts so I can get a grasp on what their going through in order to not feel so bad about my situation. I have gone through alot of what other people go through and post about. I have dealt with love and death. I have dealt with lonlyness. I have dealt with homelessness. I have been through enough to fit a whole other post to suicide watch to say the least. I have dealt with so many things. Once again I'm sorry to sound selfish and self centered...

I downed a handful of clonopin, took a few swigs of vodka, and found a knife that my roommates had missed hiding. It was dull, so I started hacking away with a shaving razor. I didn't get deep enough, and, soon enough, I passed out.

I was hospitalized for a week. I was miserable. Things in my life... they suck massively right now. My life is changed forever.

But while I was there, I saw a lot of people who were hanging on to lives that seemed even less worth living than my own. People who could barely function, could barely even talk without going to sleep. People who could never remember their names, or who were hearing voices telling them to kill people. Guys who would shit themselves and not realize it, but who would sit there at group therapy and talk about how sad they felt because they didn't want to be in the hospital, they wanted to be out in the world having relationships with people.

It was depressing... and it was eye opening.

A lot of these people were there because they had SERIOUS psychological disorders. There was no way they would ever, ever have a normal life. They would remain in mental wards and institutions until the day they die. There was no hope for them to have what we would consider a ""normal"" life... yet they still had people who cared about them, could still name things that they liked about themselves (even if it was just, ""I'm nice to people""). I came to really care about these individuals.

And I realized what a fool I was for being so conceited as to think that my absence from this world would not affect anyone else; that the problems I was facing were enough to rip me out of the lives of those who cared about me. I thought about how devastated I was when my aunt committed suicide, or when my best friend suddenly passed away.

I thought about all the low-income, struggling students that I most wanted to teach, to change, to help... and how, without me, they might not have that chance. Even just the homeless guy on a park bench who might want somebody to talk to--that I wouldn't be around to sit down and have a conversation with, to brighten his day.

SW, I was here that night. It was a throwaway, I think. My whole world has crumbled to the ground. But the truth is, your life does not end here. Don't let your current state of mind fool you into thinking that EVERY SINGLE INCH of your life is worthless. Even the stupid little inch that you don't think matters is important. This world is a fucking terrible place, and not staying around to do your part to make it better is an insult to the rest of us. There ARE people who care about you. By removing yourself, you are leaving behind more pain in the world. By using the resources that you have (us, and look in the sidebar), you can improve yourself. You can't make the sucky stuff go away. But you can change the way you react to the sucky things that happen. Shit isn't going to stop happening. Awful, horrible, life-shattering shit goes on every day. That's why we need you. We need you to demonstrate your strength in the face of the absolute worst adversity you have ever seen. We need you to bring your stories to the people who need to hear them, and to let them know that it gets better.

You are a wonderful, individual creation. You might not realize it. You might take it for granted. But where you are right now is the most important stage of your life right now. You can forfeit and waste all of your potential, or you can take a step in a new direction, push on--as *painful* as this step can be--push on, and help others push on, because we need you, because you need us, because we all need each other more than we actually realize.

I love you, despite all of your shortcomings and flaws. I love you all, no matter what reasons you have that you think I shouldn't. And you can discount what I say, and you can insult me, and you can be cynical and angry all you want, but that's not going to change how I feel. You have such potential. Your vision is just clouded right now. Please at least consider what I have said. Please, stretch your mind just a little bit to the possibility that these words are true. You are not a waste. Your world has not ended. Your world, your most important chapter, begins with you making the choice to press on through the most difficult time.

Let my anguish have some meaning. At least let the hell I've gone through do something for you. I am thankful that you are alive.

There's no internet at mental institutions, haha.  Here is a link to my old post: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1if5i1/today_is_the_day_my_note_is_written/

What basically happened was that when I was on my way to work, the police showed up at my house.  Since I'm assuming another redditor called it in, I just wanted to say thank you.  It has been a tremendous week.  More on that later.

Once the police showed up, they talked about the situation, my dad came home, yada yada yada.  Eventually I was placed handcuffed in the backseat of a police car (bucket list check!) and transported to a place in Milwaukee.  They asked questions, and it was basically a waiting game to see if I could get transferred to a more local and specialized treatment center, which is what happened.

From there, I got an ambulance ride to the new place.  It was weird the first night.  But I got used to it.  It was a new situation, but adjusted quickly.

I don't wanna say all of the boring stuff, but I definitely feel better mentally.  I'm on meds now (Prozac).  I've got the coping skills.  Definitely not going where I was before again.  Who knows where I could be if the police had not intervened.  I can definitely say I'm glad to be alive.  I've met lots of great people in the past week who've helped and accelerated my recovery.

If you are reading this, then I am either dead, or was unsuccessful in my attempt.  If the latter is true, please stop reading, as I am disclosing this information on the grounds that I am in face deceased.

I would first off like to apologize to my mom and dad.  You have both been nothing short of amazing parents, and always put my wellbeing in front of your own.  It pains me to realize that despite the incredible efforts you made to give me every advantage possible, I was still unable to survive my own demons.  I doubt anything I can say here will convince you to not blame yourselves for this, but I promise it was nothing to do with either of you.  The most powerful force keeping me from doing this sooner was the thought of what it might do to you two.  Unfortunately the pain eventually because too great, and I needed to act more selfishly.

I’m also very sorry to you, Logan.  You already lost your mom to this and I know losing a close friend in the same manner must be terrible.  I can only hope it doesn’t drive you to do the same.  There are a lot of people that love you.  Please try to be stronger than I was.

As for why I chose to end my life, I suppose it’s the same as anyone else’s reasons.  The pain and mental anguish I experience on a day-to-day basis has become greater than the resources I possess for dealing with that pain.  I feel extreme emptiness.  I no longer have the passion or desire to do the things I once enjoyed.  Although I have just 7 credits remaining in my degree, I don’t think I can do it.  I’ve lost the motivation to do anything.  I’m lying in bed right now because I don’t want to do anything else, but I don’t even want to be lying in bed right now.  I don’t want to do anything at all.  I don’t want to exist anymore.

I feel as though nobody understands me.  I once maintained an idealist fantasy that love could save me from my demons.  I thought love could finally make me happy.  I was right, and it did.  But that was taken from me years ago.  I thought I could have it again, but I was wrong.  I was so wrong.  Living in the face of this failure is too tumultuous.  It’s just unbearable.  I can’t rely on others to make me happy.  But, I can’t be happy on my own.  So, what does that leave me with?

I know I’m acting selfishly.  I know I’m inevitably hurting others around me.  I know I’m a coward for doing this.  But, I’m only human, and humans are selfish creatures.  Why should I keep myself alive solely for the benefit of others?

I have faced this before.  I have dealt with anxiety and depression for the majority of my life.  There was always some force keeping me alive.  There was always a part of me that still wanted to be alive.  I believe now that part of me is losing, and I don’t think it’s strong enough anymore.

Thank you to everyone who showed me kindness or support.  Your efforts did not go unnoticed.  This is nobody’s fault but my own.  I hope I am remembered well.

I love you all.  Goodnight.

I'm not planning to commit suicide right away, but I have been having suicidal thoughts. There's more to it, but the title is a lot of it.

I know this whole subject is a big joke, because of the movie, 40 year old virgin, and the whole ""forever alone"" thing on reddit, but for me it's not a joke. It's been a misery my whole life. If only it could be as simple as the thing in the movie. In my case, there was some bad shit that happened when I was a kid that I don't want to get into, but anyway, it's complicated. 

Sometimes I'm almost OK with it. I occupy myself with other things. Then for some reason I want it again and I completely suck at dating. Furthermore, I have a deal now where I only want women who are plainly too young for me. I see women my own age and they look like old women. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but I can't help it, that's how it is. I go on dating sites and see them and just say fuck it, I can't go there. Also I don't just want to get laid. I would love to have a girlfriend.

I've had a few younger women who acted for a while like they might be interested in that way, but it never went anywhere. Either they thought better of it, were just messing with me for fun, or I read things into it that might not have been there. 

I have this idea in the back of my mind that one day I will find a prostitute that I'm attracted to, get what sex I can till I max out my credit card, then kill myself. I don't know if I will actually do it, because I think of the people who care about me that I would hurt, but dammit they all fucking have someone and I don't. Or they at least have had someone.

I've been a long time lurker of here and /r/depression and I've read all of the helpful advice all of you give to help others. And I'm so glad I have.

I saw a text post on a friends blog about her saying goodbye, she was going to kill herself, and I started panicking. It was sent 20 minutes ago. I started texting her like a madman, leaving her all these beautiful messages on why she needed to stay.

I feel like such a jerk for all the times I've read people's stories online with doubt or cynicism in my mind, because I understand now that when you're victimized it feels like nobody in the whole world believes you or that it was ""that bad.""

I haven't left my room since I made it home last night. I've gotten out of bed to get my laptop and some Gatorade, and to use the bathroom, but that all felt like running a fucking marathon. I really think I'm going to end up killing myself and I've never been suicidal before, but I'm very serious now.

It's too much of an uphill run from here. I don't want to report this to the police - I've seen how rape cases are handled, my friend reported her rapist in high school and the police ruined her life just as much as her rapist did. Her family spent RIDICULOUS amounts of money for no conviction, for my friend to get dragged through the mud and traumatized even more. To top it off, I'm a guy, and a feminine gay guy to make it even worse. I'm sure I was just asking for it, made a victim of myself, or really wanted it, anyway - I can't imagine a jury convicting, especially in Texas.

I haven't talked to anyone, not even on facebook. I've ignored calls and texts from my mom, sister and boyfriend. Even if I don't end up killing myself, I'm going to have to break up with him - I can't drag him through this with me, and I can't imagine ever wanting to have sex again... there's no point in making him share my pain when there's nothing he or anyone else can do to help. My everything hurts, and every time I close my eyes I see it again, but all distorted, all screaming and suffocation and pavement scratching and just thinking about anything makes me want to throw up.

I have attempted twice before and had thought I had them in check. They aren't.

Second, I am a pedophile. I have been attracted to underage girls for my whole life. It's not exclusive, my wife JD, is attractive. It's not my real cravings. I am the father of one boy, and we have one baby on the way. I have gotten very close to not being able to stop myself before and this scares me most.  A few years ago through some good and bad luck I came extremely close to be arrested for downloaded child porn (there was an investigation and a questioning, luckily I had encryption). That lead to the second suicide attempt.

Third, I'm very close to being fired from a job that I hate for reasons that were my fault. This I can't talk about too much for anonymity's sake. I only have self taught skills with no external verification of then (degree, certifications, etc). If this happened then our family's prospects are close to zero. We both make ok money but not enough to keep us afloat if the other didn't work. I will not be able to get another job making nearly the same amount of money.

Fourth, I desperately want to get help for the pedophilia and some other distressing mental issues, like paranoia, panic attacks, depression, social anxiety, constantly being tired, suicidal thoughts and generally not being able to focus. If some of these issues However there's something nagging in my head that if I do go for help it will be reported. I have mental health insurance, which is not the thing holding me back, I'm worried that some information will ""leak"" and people will find out. I would ask a doctor about the rules regarding the disclosure of their records, but how do you ask ""Do you report people who are pedophiles and are concerned that they may act out thoughts?"" without telling them?

Subconsciously I think I'm trying to eat myself to death and have gained 40 pounds in about 3 months, the extra weight is making me more depressed.

Paranoia is really strange, it's not that an authority is out to get me. It's that people I know and love are constantly manipulating me, even if I can otherwise know pretty well that they aren't.

Anyway, I feel myself getting close to another attempt... I've chosen car crash into a perfect I-beam on a bridge. No date yet. When I have a date is when I know I'm serious.

I posted my story on Reddit, and a few kind souls suggested I go camping and gtfo of dodge, so I did.  During my adventure, I realized that none of this was my fault, and I can't blame others. That is what the weak and cowards do. I am moving on with my life, and recently enrolled in college. I am crying right now and would like to thank you all again.

A: You suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and you want to relate with others who might understand.

B: You want to help people in the A set, either because you've been there before or you're just a damn nice guy/girl. 

I happen to be a hybrid of both A and B. Probably a little more A than B. 

Anyway, I've been reading and contributing to this subreddit for about a year now, and from what I've seen, there is nothing but strength and compassion throughout this small community. 

If you are in the A group, I don't have to know who you are to be able to say that YOU sir, or madam, are a badass. You are alive today despite the constant allure of death. Every day lived is an achievement for you. 

If you are in the B group, you are almost certainly under-appreciated. You might have helped me through a rough time and you continue to try and assist others. Whatever your motivations, thank you. 

For a lot of us, this life is fucking bullshit. It's filled with darkness, pain, isolation and despair. Things never seem to get better and everyone around us seems to be having a better time being alive than we are. 

But when I log on to Reddit and check in on SW, I am _always_ impressed with the level of maturity, empathy, communication and understanding that takes place here. It bolsters that tiny, dying ember of hope I have that humanity has hope after all.

I remember you at the hospital, holding my son, looking at him with quiet wonder.  We had a year and a half left with you then, which I did not know.

I remember that last phone call from you.  Just a voice on my answering machine.  Saying goodbye.

I remember the phone call from dad and the voice on my answering machine again, telling me to call home.  Now.  I remember his voice breaking as he struggled to breathe out those words: ""Jordan's dead"".  They weren't real.  They couldn't be real.  I refused to believe they were real.

I remember the military service and the twenty-one gun salute.  I didn't like that, I blamed the military for your death.  I remember walking to your gravesite in Arlington and gasping for breath between sobs.

I remember when I finally accepted your suicide, spoke to you beyond that veil of light, and felt joy instead of a black empty hole in my heart.  That's what love feels like.  Death cannot touch it.

To clear up a few questions, I have never cheated on my wife, nor done anything that could justify a divorce. I have written this whole text a bit quickly and under the emotion. Yes, we did had little fights, but nothing really serious. Some dates are back to november. I simply don't understand...

EDIT2: Background information: I am 35, she is 33. I work full-time in a consulting firm and am considered very good both by coworkers and clients. I thought I would clear this: after all gifts were opened, I was seriously mad, then I remembered kids were there. I told her: ""I don't understand. And I really don't understand why you did this in front of the kids"". I told her I wouldn't argue in front of the children and that is when she left, telling me she did not feel safe anymore and would go with her parents. She told me she would tell the children and I almost agreed since they would have more people to be with, but I seriously feared she would attempt something. ""The kids stay with me,"" I said. We argued and she finally left. She said she did not feel safe, I felt she was going to party. I am not a violent person. We did had minor fights in the months before, but nothing serious. **I have her phone number. I tried to call her twice and she did not answer. Should I try to call her again? Please tell me. I have no idea what to do...**

EDIT3 Thank you to the downvote patrol! You've made my situation worse and prevented me from getting potentially valuable advice, all this thanks to one person claiming it's fake. Thank you very much and merry christmas, really.

EDIT4 I have been advised by a close friend of mine to go file a police report. This might be important for what is happening next. I have called her again and got no response. He told me not to call her again to prevent the harassment issue. To the best of my knowledge she is with her family so I could call there. My own friend wouldn't believe what happened and called me a liar several times, so I guess I cannot blame Reddit for what happened. I have gotten rid of everything that could potentially be illegal, including an old bong (I don't do drug, but I see the potential issue), some old data and strong alcohol. My biggest fear is for my children. I will keep this updated if people are interested, looks like I will have a long night.

EDIT5: Thank you SO much for everything so far. Lots of things happened since this morning including a meeting with the police. I never saw that coming. I was so dumb. So exhausted. I now know much more about what and why this happened. I am very busy right now (not that easy to find an attorney on a saturday, especially the day after christmas) and will update this as soon as possible.

Occasionally they are dark and depressing. I've tried to offer support and engage him in conversations about life, but it never gets very far.

His posts last night were pretty dark. I sent him a message before I went to bed and he wrote back. I chatted with him a bit today on facebook and he seemed okay. Then he posts this pic.

From what I've heard, his mom is into drugs and his dad, while he seems to mean well, can be real hard on him and sometimes a jerk.

He has a series of posts he told me about where he has ""Conversations With The Devil"" as opposed to ""Conversations With God"".

me: Where are you
Devil: I'm just an idea
me: So you're everywhere
Devil: And at all times

me: Do you choose your workers
Devil: Only from the ones God gave up on. They have potential
Me: Do I have potential
Devil: Yes

me: I've tried killing myself 3x
Devil: I know,but you still need to fulfill your path on Earth. Your pain will define who you become for me

I don't know what to do. I don't know him or his situation well enough to really get involved (and I'm scared to). I don't even know his address or phone number, but I also don't want to just sit by when I know there are options.

Before you comment, please look to the sidebar and click through [SWResources](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/). Read the other comments, read the posts, get a feel for how OP is feeling. There is no blanket response that will apply to everyone, though there are generally elements that should always be included. The most obvious of these is the suggestion to seek professional help, as we here at SW cannot diagnose or prescribe any sort of medicine that will probably be the long term help that an OP needs. There are others but I'd like not to focus on them because as I said, our OPs deserve individual responses to their individual situations. Some are very similar, some are wildly different, but if you're going to comment on any one it deserves your attention and your care.

Really, most importantly, **think** before you comment on something. Don't offer advice on how to commit suicide. Don't urge that someone should. If you have nothing but negativity to offer, then this is really not the subreddit for you. We deal in hope here, even though there seems to be very little of it around these days, *especially* for OPs. Think to yourself: ""were I in OP's shoes, would I like to hear this""? Read the sidebar for things which will get you banned, and understand that this is a heavily moderated subreddit by necessity.

And finally... thanks. I've been here two years and as the community has grown we've seen good commenters come and go, and some have  been around a lot longer than I have. If you can even lend just a little time here, thank you. It doesn't get said enough how truly wonderful this community is, and I say that as a mod and as someone who has been helped by SW a number of times.

I have a tweet scheduled to be sent in 30 minutes, telling people where to locate my body and that my daughter is asleep in her room.

My daughter just woke up, her hugs are nice, it feels good to have someone completely love me unconditionally and honestly. I just don't know if it's enough - I don't want this life. This isn't how I  envisioned my life being.

I can't help but listen to [this song](http://listen.grooveshark.com/s/Where+d+You+Go+feat+Holly+Brook+And+Jonah+Matranga+/1NOMby) repeatedly - my wife cheated on me and ran off across country. I was raised in a normal, happily-married, family - my only goal in life was to have a family that I loved, that loved me and that I could care for. I have obviously failed in this endeavor and the pain in confronting this failure is too much to handle.

I think about it constantly - I'm a shell of a person, every day is the same shit over and over: wake up at 5, take my daughter to daycare, get off at 5, pick her up, cook dinner, put her to bed at 8, wallow in my own sorrow until midnight, repeat. Every goddamn day it's the same exact shit and I'm fucking tired of it. If I were dead, her mother would get $750k, she'd go stay with her - her problems would be fixed and I wouldn't feel this pain anymore.

My wife and I are trying to work through our issues but really, how much can you work through when your thousands of miles apart? What kind of relationship is that? When the trust has been broken, how do you rekindle it from thousands of miles apart? Do I even really want to rekindle that trust or am I just a complacent fucking tool, getting taken advantage of?

I need your help reddit - I honestly don't want to do this but I don't see a way out. I'm tired of being a single father, I'm tired of being cheated on. Every day is worse than the last, every day I go deeper and deeper into the darkness, I'd rather just get it done with while my daughter is still too young to understand,

I can't just take off to some sort of camp/medical group - who will take care of my daughter? Obviously not her mother. I'm paying for 2 households right now and my decision comes down to keep wallowing within this filth (to earn a paycheck) or relief (and let them live off the life insurance).


**Edit**: I called the 1-800 number FreeRadd posted, got in touch with a very nice person that just listened to me. I've taken down the noose, going to bed and my daughter and I are going to go out and have some fun this weekend (Chuck E. Cheese, I imagine, as horrible as that sounds to me - she fucking loves it).

I'm in a deeper depression than ever before and it makes me regret not acting on the suicidal urges I had when I was younger. I want to fall asleep and never wake up. I want to be involved in a fatal accident. I want to take all the painkillers I saved up from years of oral surgery, lie down and see what happens.

How do normal people do it? How do they make life worth living? How do they keep going, day by day, without being crushed by all the sorrow, dread and guilt? I’m so miserable at the end of the day that I start bawling the second I get in my car, and I don’t stop until I physically can’t cry anymore, long after I get home. I put on a happy face as much as I can, but all the while I’m holding back a flood of tears and the ever-increasing urge to harm myself. 

My coworkers have noticed a change in my job performance and I hear them gossiping about how ""lazy"" I’ve become. How can I tell them that the reason my work has suffered is because I am constantly holding back the urge to climb up to the roof and jump off head first? Its escalated to the point where I've become something of an office joke. The second I turn my back I hear insulting comments about my professional and personal life. Yet they won't fire me, I assume it's because they're too lazy to learn how to do what I do.

If this is all there is, all that my life will ever come to, who can blame me for not wanting to live it? Every day I think about my own death, whether it comes tonight or in 60 years. I’ll be dead before too long and an ass print in an office chair is the only legacy I’ll leave behind. If that’s the case, why even bother taking up space in the world?

I sit behind the same desk every day, making people I hate richer by the minute, putting on a smiling mask while I crack and crumble on the inside. When I’m at home I think about the challenges of the next work day and the dread wells up inside me until it saturates my every thought. Sometimes I find my fingernails digging into my back, arms and legs until it chunks of skin pull away. The pain offers a moment of relief from all the horrible thoughts that constantly bash themselves against inside of inside my skull. 

Every weekday morning there’s a panicked screaming inside me that says “NO! Not there again! PLEASE don’t make me go back there again! PLEASE!” …and then I walk inside. I stuff the panic and the dread and the self loathing deep down so I can pretend that everything is fine. 
It gets harder every time and there’s no end in sight. At least my draining, crushing, demeaning jobs I had in the past were temporary and I had an end date to look forward to. This is permanent. This job, or all the others just like it that I might able to get in the future, assuming I live long enough. Same shit coming from different assholes. Forever.

She got drunk and passed out and was raped by a guy. She told me about this and I told her if she ever found out to let me know and I'd take care of him. So I am in an organization that mimics the military academy at my university, we shower, eat and sleep with all the guys in my company 7 days a week. I find out that she knew all along that it was one of her friends that had sex with her when she passed out and he is one of the guys in my company. I already hated him because he used to tell her (when we first met) that I was a piece of crap and she shouldn't date me. Well then I find out she had sex with him again after some coercion (she was sober enough to know what happened - but was forced into it) a few months after the first rape. 

This is completely jumbled because my emotions are running high right now... ask questions if you don't understand.

Well I tell her we need to tell someone and get him kicked out of the university. She won't do it because she doesn't want her parents finding out.

I can't eat or sleep. I am usually very athletic and I have gotten out of shape drastically due to my depression since I found out in August. I keep begging her to tell because I have gotten some serious psychological damage from this. She was still friends with him after both times and we even met through him in a weird way (long story). I just can't go on. I get sexually aroused when I see him or think about him (this disturbs me VERY deeply). I just don't have any will to live if she won't tell and get him kicked out. 

I know it sounds selfish but I feel like she should tell even if she's scared her parents will find out, which I think it would be private anyways. 

I have told her I am suicidal now because of this, I'm about to start hurting myself because I am so sad now. I want to cut myself to help me feel better.

I'm done living here. My life is virtually meaningless. I doubt anyone will take the time to read my story, but here it is for anyone who cares.


My Girlfriend of 2 years left me a month ago. She is pregnant with our child. My whole life I've wanted to be a father and have a family. It's literally been my dream. When I found out she was pregnant, I went and got a car, an apartment, and a factory job working the grave shift. It sucked, but it was worth it. Tomorrow she is going to get the ultrasound to determine the gender. I won't be going. She has ignored the countless calls and texts I've sent her the past two weeks..just begging for her to just talk to me. I love her more than anything in the world. This is soul crushing and heart breaking. I can't stand it. She told me she hates me now and we will never be back together. That was the last I heard from her.

I hate my life. I'm packed all of my stuff home from work today. I'm never going back there again. I can't keep working there. I am going to kill myself because otherwise my parents will have to pay my child support for me, and they don't have the money to. I don't want them to have that burden.


I doubt anything I've written even makes sense..I can't think right now I haven't slept in 24 hours. I will only be on this earth for another 12 hours. I don't even know why I posted this....I felt like I wanted to tell someone..anyone. I won't tell my friends and family.

Not too long ago I came to /r/suicidewatch looking for some chit chat about my life, even though I knew I was going to kill myself very soon. Posting on here was a way for me to come to terms with a lot of my problems, and look for a tiny spark of hope that maybe someone would uncover for me. I never found my spark of hope, actually nothing I read, or any of the advice I received helped me out. 

A day after making that post I began to write my suicide note, very detailed, and very thorough. My suicide note was so thorough that I had literally listed everyone in that had impacted my life, as well as a good bunch of notes I had addressed to them. I thought doing this would let people know how truly sorry I was for going out like this, and how much I really cared for them. I spent anywhere from 6-8 hours working on this very detailed note. 

After writing my note I headed off to Home Depot to pick up the supplies I needed to kill myself with my car exhaust. I did the setup on my car, and was ready for my last night of sleep.

I woke up at 5 am to begin a complete cleaning of my house, I wanted everything to be perfect for when people found me. Midway through cleaning my house, I realized something, ""If I would put this much work into searching for help, maybe I would get it."" I stopped right there, took my suicide note and decided to go on a walk as I reviewed it. I started to look at all the people I cared for, and noted how much I actually cared for them. Even people who were not part of my life anymore, such as my churches preacher, my mom's best friend's grandmother, and many names of people who I don't even talk to monthly.

Many of my problem revolved around money, I had someone fail that literally cost me a lot of the money I took loans on. The debt had piled up to close to $40,000 after it was all said and done. Money was the reason I wanted to take my life, the fact I had lost so much, owed so much, and would only be looked as a disappointment to those around me. I will say here that I had quite the subtle ego, I faked being humble so people would admire me more (it was so egotistic). 

As I was on this walk, I was thinking about how much my mother would miss me, I was worried that she would be too heart broken to move on for years. This is the reason why my letter to my mother in my suicide note was six pages long. I decided I would walk over to my mom's church and visit the preacher. I had actually wrote something to our preacher, even though I was no longer religious and never would be. 

I wanted to talk to him, and relay to him to tell my mom how much I really loved her. I went into his office, and debriefed him on the situation, especially the part where he could do nothing to stop me, and if he called anyone on me it would only make me go in a more brutal fashion. After explaining him the situation, it was hard for him to wrap his head around it, he had always thought I had things together, but he really had no idea this was coming. 

After a long discussion, he asked if he could get in my car and take him somewhere. I thought it was an odd request, and I'd figure he would just ask me to take him to a religious place, where he could give me a speech. Instead he took me to the bank, and he withdrew enough money for me to get out of this horrible place. In so many words he trusted me to pay him back at some point with my business, and never told a soul about this meeting.

If you told me a I would still be alive today, I would have to highly doubt it, I was literally 100% prepared to die, even more so. The moral of this story is to not use your loss of hope to get what you want, it's to reach out to people who really want to see you live, no matter how unlikely you think it would be. My ADHD has created a lot of self doubt, and they may be why I was so reluctant to look for help, but low and behold the first person I ask to help me, solves all my problems. 

So before you give up, and it's all said and done, look at the lists of people who would hate to see you go, and just go talk to them no matter what makes you want to leave life. I was literally eleven hours away from being dead, and breaking many more lives than just my own. Today, I can't believe I wanted to die, all I want to do is live to help others now that my life is under control and has new meaning.

I know what you're probably thinking at this point ""Oh he's just a teenager, just some hormones"" Well no, that's not it at all. I can still remember being depressed when I was somewhere in 3rd grade? Somewhere around that time. I just don't see the point. My grades have always been shit and I've barely scraped up to pass every year. I mean, there's no doubt your entire future depends on your grades throughout your life and I can't even see myself getting the local community college. I have just around two weeks of school left and me passing? No, not gonna happen. I can't tell anyone that I'm depressed these days. My friends are barely so and don't care enough to do anything. I'm a compulsive liar, an idiot, and a overall failure to my family by this point. Even if I somehow managed to drag myself through middle school and high school there's always going to be my grades over my head, constanly reminding me I have a shit future waiting for me. So why not end it now? Just save myself the extra bull in the future and by the time anyone who cares about me, even a little, can just move on and forget me by the time they're out of high school.

I wanted to die for the same reason as a lot of young adults: I thought I had no future, I thought no one would notice or care, I thought no one would over accept me or love me for who I really was. My parents were in the middle of an ugly divorce and my whole family was breaking apart. I told myself one week before Christmas that I was pathetic and had failed at everything in life, so why not do the world a favor.

I would have died too, after overdosing on my anxiety medication, had my mother not got off work early that night and found me passed out in the bathroom covered in my own vomit.

She never told me that I broke her heart, or how much she felt she had failed me as a mother, or how I had almost stolen from her what meant more to her than life itself, but I saw it in her face when I woke up again in hospital. I saw it - but I didn't understand it. Not yet, anyway.

Jump ahead just over a year, and I was finally in a relationship with a childhood friend I had been secretly in love with for years. She was kind, intelligent, insightful - a truly amazing young woman...only she didn't think so. And for a brief time of madness, neither did I. We were doing long distance which proved taxing from the start and we were stressed out over college and jobs. One day I finally threw my hands up in the air and told her we needed to break up. We had a huge fight and I said that I wished I had never met her. I never meant it for a second. I loved her more than anything else in the world, but in a moment of utter stupidity, I lied. That night she called me at 11:00, 12:30, 1:00, 3:00. I didn't answer. I was too angry to answer. I told myself I would answer when she called the next morning.

The next afternoon I got a call from her best friend instead.

This was about 18 months ago now and I finally feel I am coming to terms with what happened. But I will never 'get over' it. As others who have lost loved ones to suicide will tell you, there is no amount of rationalizing that permanently relieves the guilt you feel, and for a year after her death, there seemed to be no end to the blackness that my life had become. I've tried to forget, but after coming here, everything came back all at once and I had to fight back tears. I just want you to read my story and think about the implications of your actions. If you EVER feel, as I did, that no one will notice or care, please remember that someone out there cares more about you than anything else, even if they don't admit it or realize it at the time. I care. Please don't hesitate to message me anytime if you want to talk, no matter how embarrassed you feel.

I'm going to kill myself.

I'm going to fall.

I'm going to do it after seeing my mental health counselor early next week.

It's better that I die.

This isn't my first time planning my end.  I faced a decision when I turned 20 to either kill myself or take action on my transgender feelings which had been plaguing me since… about as long as I can remember.  I went into it knowing damn near everything about the process, having researched it extensively.  I've tried keeping my expectations low knowing how unreasonable expectations can cause problems.

I'm 24 now.  I was on hormones for most of the last four years, making little progress.  At this point I can't even afford them.  I've been taking my expired spironolactone in a desperate attempt to keep my testosterone down.  I don't believe it possible for me to come to terms with my body.

I pick my skin severely, mostly on my right arm, stomach, face, and legs from torso to knees.  This started in high school, which was quite stressful.  I mostly pick in the bathroom, which has been a constant source of stress as long as I can remember.  I have issues pooping, or, well, wiping.  I wipe until I feel clean, inspecting the toilet paper after each wipe.  Typically the toilet paper is blooded by the time I'm done wiping.  Family and friends have noticed this behavior, at one point friends made it a unit of time measurement in school.  I've given this an awful lot of attention throughout my life, developing as efficient a system as I could to minimize it's impact.  I use exactly two pieces of toilet paper per wipe, wrapped around three fingers twice, if it's not terribly messy you can fold it again after the first wipe for a second.  Spitting on the toilet paper also does wonders (for the baby wipes folks or whoever).  I'm sorry about the detail.

I'm incredibly bothered by farting, I make every effort to fart on a toilet.

I have many friends who are wonderful and genuinely care for me.  I can't talk to any of them about any of my problems.  I can't burden them.  I hate to burden anyone.  I'm scared if I don't kill myself I'll end up burdening the people I care about more and more.  I can't allow that possibility.

I've been seeing a counselor person since I was planning on killing myself last, some months ago.  I was talked into going to an emergency room by a suicide hotline.  Misinformed that they wouldn't be able to hold me against my will.  Once I was informed I did everything in my power to fight it.  I don't feel there's any coming back from that point.  I am terrified of loosing control of my life.  With the intervention of some friends they settled on getting me into an outpatient program with a promise that I wouldn't kill myself in the interim.

I don't feel the counselor has helped, or the doctor I've been seeing for meds.  I've never believed much in medication.  They initially had me on citalopram, which has apparently shown efficacy in treating dermatillomania.  I didn't feel that was helping, and didn't particularly enjoy the side effects.  They now have me on lamotrigine.

I hate myself for all the stupid decisions I've made.  From 18 to 23 I've been employed as a web developer, offered an internship with the school district following a programming class which was largely PHP and moving on to better jobs after that.  I was making more than my parents, I had money saved, I felt secure in that aspect of my life.

Then I lost my job.  I wasn't fired, the company ran into financial trouble.  I was told to get onto unemployment by my boss, and I started it the day after.  I didn't collect on any of it for the next 9 months, burning through my savings instead because of my obsession with not wanting to be one of those people who exploits the system.  I was just stupid.  I've been stupid a lot.

I've held a few jobs that didn't last long since then.  It's been very hard finding work.  I wasn't able to handle the stress of my last developer job.  I've completely lost faith in myself as a programmer.

While I hold no love for myself, I've done everything I could for others, to the best of my abilities.  I've been doing an older neighbors laundry for a long time because she has trouble, I've tried to not let her pay me, but she insists.  She is wonderful.  She is concerned for me and frustrated by my behavior, which is entirely reasonable.  This is why I can't share with people, it just hurts them more.

I never know what to fucking say.  I've never shared this much before.  It's not like I haven't tried to get over this… I know I'm weak… but I'm not entirely without hope, or I wouldn't post here in the first place.

I *am* going to kill myself. I'm not crying for help or attention, I just want to share my story before I go. I really have no one to talk too, or tell this story too; I just really want to get this off my chest before I go.

When I was 15 (I had just turned 15 a week before this), I went down on this girl. I didn't want sex or a BJ; I just wanted to pleasure her. Turns out she was 3 days from turning 13! I had no idea at the time since she looked my age. She was my height, had large breasts for her age, and had herself a nice little bush. So there I was with this girl who was really showing me some attention that none had ever shown before. The last thing on my mind was asking for ID or doing an age-check. We really hit it off until her mom found out and called the cops and said I raped her.

I got locked up for a couple months while waiting for my trial. Luckily her mom was pulling so much shit out of her ass it was obvious she was lieing and I got off. She was saying things like I had locked her daughter in a dark closet and forced sex on her, when the closet had no door-knob, there was a window, it was 2pm, and we never even actually *had sex*. So i got off on rape, but because of our ages I still got fucked over for sagitary rape. Though different then rape, people didn't care. I get in trouble for something with the word ""rape"" in it and I'm a rapist in everyone's eyes. Sagitary rape? He must beat women and rape them!

It really sucks being brought down to the level of a rapist. That's something that just doesn't go away like that. I had threats, fights, my house vandalized, girls avoided my like a plague, people who I thought were my friends turned, and I got more then a few death threats. Needless to say I decided not to go outside that much. I've spent a most my time alone since then, and even though now that things have finally blown over, the effects are still here 11 years later.

Everyone that knows about that incident are either dead or have moved. But all that time I spent alone has really screwed me up. I can't socialize, make friends, hit on girls, or even talk to random people normally. I've been really trying hard to be more social, but it never works, I always come off as a little bit weird *and I know that*. I go to bars and drink alone never meeting people. At school I sit alone and never meet anyone. I try and start conversations or reply back when people talk to me, but something always gets screwed up. I've come to the conclusion that I'm never going to make any friends or meet a girl. I've also come to the conclusion that I'm not going to be one of those pathetic 40 year-old guys that are in the same position I am in now, so I'm going to end it here before it gets that far. Fuck, I can't even make friends on the internet! I have AIM open all the time with not one fucking friend, thinking one day I might need this, I might meet someone to talk with...yeah right. I've stayed positive up until this point. When talking with others I *do not* talk about anything like this; I keep it positive and don't seek pity.

I have left a some details out to keep this short, but that's really about it other then what *really* pains me now I guess. I haven't even had so much as a hug in over 10 years. At school when I see people holding hands or opposite sexes talking, it literally brings me physical pain in my chest. My thoughts become more and more negative and violent everyday, and sometimes it scares me what I might do if I snapped. So I'm not going to let it get that far. The only things I want in life I have finally realized I'll never obtain; kids, a wife, friends, and happiness. There is no reason either other then the fact I just can't talk with people in person vary well. I'm in a pit of loneliness with no way out and no one knows I'm here. There's no help.

In one week I'm going to stand on some out-of-the-way train tracks and let that giant piece of steel crush me. I think it will be a fitting end. I honestly don't even remember what it feels like to have the soft warmth of another person holding me in a hug. Every time I think of that it just kills me inside, I fucking hate those painful reality-checks. So since I don't know soft warmth and love, I'll end myself in a violent impact of solid steel.

**EDIT:** This will be my last reply. You are all vary kind, but your intentions are misplaced. I'm not seeking people to talk too or help. I have been trying 99% of what people here have mentioned for *years*. This is also *not* a decision I have made lightly. You see I love life. This world we live in is awesome. So many different people, cultures, landscapes, hobbies, arts, sciences, and more. I love it all and I'm sad to leave it, but that's *my* decision. 

You see, I'm like a fish out of water. Mentally, I dont posses the skills I will need to survive in this world. I'm 26 and I've had one job. When I apply for work my applications look blank, empty, and unappealing. My schooling was being paid for by the government because my father was injured in Vietnam -- this was cut off when I hit 25. I can't get work no matter how hard I try, I can't afford school anymore, and my parents are losing their house in a few months. To put it simply I'm going to be homeless, I can't find work, finishing school is no longer an option, and I'm just plain depressed about my inability to properly communicate with others on a *normal* level. It also sucks knowing I will never look into a females eyes and see love staring back at me. Sometimes I wish I was like 500 lbs with a 3ft red neck-beard, zits, horrible hygiene, and a huge scar across my face. Then I would at least have a reason to be avoided.

When I die I'll be happy with the fact that I tried as hard as I could for as long as I could, but I'm really out of options. I don't even really care that much any more though, I have nothing to look forward too and nothing to drive me any more. I did learn something in this thread though, I'm not after happiness any more, I'm after peace...I just want peace. With all the effort I've put into improving my life these last 5 or so years there hasn't been ONE thing that's improved. Statistically I think *something* should have gotten better, or at the vary least shown some sign of improvement -- it hasn't. If you are playing a game that you absolutely suck at, you can only keep at it for so long before you just turn the damn thing off. Understand?

I thank you all but this isn't a bad thing, not by a long shot. Life just isn't for everyone and I'm one of them. I only posted this because I wanted to tell my story to *someone*. I've never told this to anyone before and I just really needed to let it out. If anyone is reading this that is considering suicide know this -- if you have a job, a special someone, or a group of friends who care about you, I would strangle an infant with my bare fucking hands to know what that feels like for an hour. Most people have things they can look forward too and improve -- I'm no longer one of them. I'm actually happier now then I have been in a long time. Knowing this pain isn't going to matter soon is a real relief. It's like I can finally relax without constantly caring about these things I so desperately wished I could have obtained. Right now I'm calm, relaxed, and happy. This is bringing me peace.

P.S. You are all vary nice people and I hope I didn't mislead any of you. :( Don't think that you have failed in any sort of way either -- you didn't. My mind was made long before I came here. It was nice talking to you all but it changes nothing. The fact is I *need* this. If I don't then I'll probably just turn into some pathetic homeless drunk that has completely given up on life.

I was really suicidal up until recently, and this is what got me over being suicidal.

A boy at my school, let's call him Jonah, hung himself a couple of months ago. He was 16. Everyone is still really sad, and everyone in my grade really isn't the same. His brother, let's call him Michael is 14. He is the one who found him hanging in his room.

A few months before Jonah died, Michael's friend committed suicide as well. Apparently the friend was a friend of Jonah's as well, and that is partly the reason Jonah killed himself. Then just two days ago, Michael's ex-girlfriend killed herself too.
I didn't even know his friend or ex-girlfriend, but I know people who were friends with them, and they are devastated. Their families' are devastated. Even I am devastated, and I hadn't even talked to Jonah much before he died.

I understand that depression is bad. I have been through depression too, and wanted to kill myself.. but I just see how much this is affecting Michael. He used to be so happy, and now I see him, and he's just always sad. I don't think he will ever be the same. I think he's traumatized for life.
I'm not saying it's selfish, but just think about it.. how would you feel if it was your friend or your child or even just an acquaintance? People care about you more than you think. I know it can be hard, but there are other ways to get through it, even if you're just sticking it out, waiting for the end.

But after posting and talking to a few people I realized that I was willing to give life another shot. So I tried my hardest to live again and break out of depression, but things just got a lot worse.

It got so bad that I was actually ready to kill my self with a few methods I found online. I was even able to actually find some one online who was willing to sell me pills to help me kill my self as well. But before going through with any thing, I thought about you all who helped me and realized that I was battling depression the wrong way. Instead of trying to help my self I realized at the last minute that I needed help from other people. And while I'm not some one who enjoys other people helping me I realized it was my last shot at life.

So I wanted to thank you all because last week I finally told my parents about me being suicidal. I didn't have the hope or courage to tell them but I finally did because of you guys. My father got me a therapist and I checked in with them today, and while I still don't feel 100% I think going there will help me a lot.

I don't know who you are, but I can tell you that I love you, just because I know how difficult life can be, and that no one deserves to be miserable.

So, you might be wondering who I am, I'm just another, troubled child of the world. Dysfunctional, depressed, anxious all the time; you know the works. 
I'm 19, I go to a therapeutic high school, and have like many others I have struggled with self-harm, drug abuse, suicide attempts and ideation. I've been hospitalized a good 4-5 times and I go to a mental hospital/institute every day for school. Everyone I know struggles with depression or some sort of disorder. All of my friends have gone through the same things. 

I know the most amazing, spectacular interesting people in the world, and they are all dysfunctional and troubled like me. I don't know a more amazing, interesting community then the people who share these issues.

I know people who have tried to hang themselves multiple times, overdose, and well.. I even know someone who shot themselves and survived. In fact that person is my best friend, and knows me better then anyone. 

If you're considering taking your own life, I just wanted to say, you're loved, you are cared for, no matter who you are. Life is difficult, and depression (no matter what anyone tells you) IS NOT a choice. You don't choose to be depressed... It happens. Suicide isn't a choice, it's a decision you will never be able to change. 

I know life is hard, but you can get help, and I won't lie. It isn't easy. The thing with depression is you get comfortable with it, you don't want to change, you can't change; you just seem to be stuck with nothing to do, but you can get help. It's the hardest step to recovery but I know it's do-able. 

If you need help the first step, (as hard as it may be) is to stop, and go talk to someone, get help. Talk to a councillor, talk to a therapist if you can, if you're at the point that you can't stand it anymore, go to the E.R. 

Life can be different, I promise. It will be hard, but you can survive. I wouldn't lie to you.

thank you, reddit. i dont have the words to express how thankful i am. but you have helped me a great deal and i appreciate it.

thank you again. take care, everyone. (sorry for the formatting, i keep forgetting that reddit formatting is different.)**

Dear Dad,

As I write you this letter, I keep looking back to the email you sent me in the fall of 2011. ""If you think you’re in ruins, you’re the cause of it."" You are right. It is completely my fault that I am in ruins. I am thirty years old. When you were my age, you had a steady job and a family. When my mother was my age, she was almost halfway through her Ph.D. We were a family.

I have nothing to show for myself, and the pile of debt I owe gives me panic attacks on a regular basis. I will never pay it off. Even if I were to become beautiful and finish my degree and secure a decent job, I know that no man would ever want to marry me and be attached to someone who owes so much money. I am a loser. I threw away my life for nothing.

By the time this letter reaches you, I will have perished. I am not sure why I have bothered to continue living this life for so long.

It is a shame I relinquished my insurance policy back in 2003 or 2004. Though I suppose no money would have come from it, as policies due to suicide are not honoured.

My mother is quite ill, as you are aware. It is too early to tell if the cancer has gone away, but I absolutely cannot bear the thought of being an orphan once she passes away. I am sure you have essentially disowned me and that I am a mere afterthought. I do not know what you think of me, and I do not think I want to know. The truth is painful. I have my stepfather and his family, but I do not want to be a burden on anyone. I am always in the way, always causing problems, even when I try to do the right thing.

I would appreciate it if you could assist in handling my matters in [name of city]. My cats will have been in the care of someone else by the time you read this letter. I have filled out all the forms for student loans so that the debt will be gone. You just need to send proof of my death along with the forms. I tried to pack up as many things as I could. I am sure a professional company can do the rest. I have requested to be cremated and that my ashes will be scattered into the Atlantic Ocean. This is my final request.

I have been dealing with this mental illness since the age of 12. I know I am an awful person and have nobody to blame but myself, but to be in pain for 18 years is just cruel and unbearable. I am beyond the point where I feel sorry for myself. I have resigned myself to the fact that I am not destined to have a good life.

I hope you and your family will live in happiness. I hope nothing but the best for [my half-brother]. Please do not be hard on him as you were on me. I do not blame you for the way that I am now, but I feel that I have been the utmost failure to you. I will never forgive myself for it.

Regardless of all that has happened between us, I love you. Take very good care.

1353259571.0,53,self.SuicideWatch,13ekan,I should not be alive. I was meant to die that day.,74,21,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/13ekan/i_should_not_be_alive_i_was_meant_to_die_that_day/,"I am currently detained under ""Section 3 of the Mental Health Act"" at a secure hospital. I have some leave to my parents house so I am able to access a computer.

2 weeks ago an opportunity presented itself where I was able to leave the ward and so I quietly gathered my things, took a bus to the city, purchased 96 paracetamol tablets and a litre of vodka.

I knew I had to find somewhere secluded and vacant in order to successfully put an end to things. I wanted nobody to find me.

Now, I know paracetamol is unlikely to kill you shortly after taking an overdose and that the actual process of dying is extremely painful and traumatic, but at this point I didn't care. I knew I could never bring myself to jump off a bridge or step under a train and I certainly didn't want to cause an accident and so this was the only accessible method I had (I had wanted to take a heroin overdose but had neither the money or the contacts). I also knew that I am allergic to the antidote they give you in order to prevent the damaging effects of paracetamol.

I was absolutely certain I was going to die. I cannot find the words to properly express how I felt that day. I felt like a ghost.

So, once I had everything I needed, a popped every pill I had and began swallowing them with the vodka. About 60 pills in, I remember looking at my hand and seeing it shaking violently, I felt drunk, but something seemed very different this time. Once I had finished all 96 pills, I felt an intense wave of serenity and calm flood through me. My vision began to fade and I remember everything turning ""silhouette black"".

It was at this point, when I knew I had reached the point of absolutely no return that I thought suddenly occurred to me;

**what if I had waited one more day?**

What if I could have had one more delicious meal? One more loving encounter with my parents? One more laugh at a stupid joke? I have abandoned everyone I know and I will never see them again.

I didn't panic or suddenly seek help. I just remembering thinking *what a waste*.

The next thing I remember, I woke up in hospital in intensive care.

It turns out a taxi driver had badly needed to relieve himself and had pulled up against the side of the road. After walking through the bushes to find somewhere private, he found me; unconscious and covered in blood (it turns out I had been vomiting blood).

An ambulance was called and as we raced to the hospital I began having a seizure followed by respiratory failure. I was put onto life support and my parents were called. They didn't know what was going to happen.

If it hadn't been for that man who found me, I am completely convinced I would not be here now, typing this message.

I have lived through this experience and now I know:

**SUICIDE IS NOT AN OPTION**

If I had died that day, it would not have changed a THING. None of my problems would have been solved, I wouldn't have felt the ""relief"" I was so desperate for, that would have been the end of everything. I would have entered the abyss, the nothingness, the eternal end.

If you have ideas about killing yourself or any serious plans, ask yourself; *what do I honestly think is going to happen as a result of this?*

If I ever find myself in a position where I feel as determined as I did that day. I will immediately tell someone.

I was different then everyone else and always felt alone and that no one else really liked me. I was fortunate that none of my attempts at suicide were successful and I eventually worked out my own reasoning for not. I am now married with 3 children and living in the same town.  For the last 6 months I have become aware that my 16 yo son is beginning to have a lot of the same feelings of isolation and depression that started me on my downward spiral.  We have talked a lot about his feelings, but I haven't been able to get through to him.

This past Wednesday I received a call that my son had been hurt in a skiing accident.  It didn't sound serious at first and my sister, who was chaperoning for the school, was with him and would ride with him to the hospital.  A few minutes later I received another call from my sisters phone, but it was another chaperon who was letting me know that things had gone downhill and that they were now calling for a helicopter.  She advised me to just pull over and wait because they weren't sure where they were taking him yet so I pulled into a parking lot and my world stopped moving.

After an eternity, my sister called me again and told me to drive towards the resort.  They still didn't know which hospital they were going to, but they knew which city it would be in and she would ride with me so I didn't have to drive alone.  I was able to hold it together again because I now had a purpose.  When I was half way there my sister called again.  The helicopter was almost there and if I was able to make it there in five minutes I would be able to see him before they left, but I was at least 10 minutes away and that would be pushing it. So I broke down again as I pushed the limits of night time driving on a country road.  I was going entirely too fast through a small town when I caught the eye of a friendly state trooper who pulled me over with less than a mile to go.  Fortunately, it only took one look at me and my rambling explanation for him to take immediate pity on me and let me continue.  I finally arrived at the resort parking lot where the helicopter had landed and sprinted to the ambulance.

I rushed onto the ambulance to a scene of utter chaos.  My normally laid back and easy going son was a monster.  6 people were crammed in the ambulance trying to hold him still enough to put an IV in.  He was screaming out in terror begging for someone to help him because these strangers were attacking him for no reason.  I had been an EMT when I was younger and knew that his altered state of mind meant trouble.  I pulled myself together so that he wouldn't see the fear that was coursing through me.  I stroked his hair and told him in as calm of a voice as I could muster that Daddy was there and that he would be ok.  He looked up into my eyes and nothing registered, I was just another stranger to him.  That destroyed me, but I couldn't show it, and I was in shock the rest of the time on that ambulance.  They finally got his IV in and were able to sedate him and put an air tube in to protect his airway.  As they made the final adjustments needed to get him on the helicopter I kissed him on the forehead and stepped off of the ambulance and fell apart.  My sister picked up the pieces and drove me to the hospital which was an hour away.

We got to the ER and met up with my wife and my son's mother and her husband.  We waited for an hour with no real news until they finally told us they were moving him to ICU.  They ushered us to a new waiting area and left us in the dark room for another hour.  Finally, they came in to talk to us.  His scans came back clear and his xrays looked good, but because of how he was on the ambulance they wouldn't know if his altered state of mind was temporary or permanent until they took him out of sedation which wouldn't happen until the next morning.  They let us into see him for a few minutes of pure torture.  He was a shell with tubes sticking out every which way and no indication of if he would ever be himself again.  Then they gave us the worst news, they handed us a sheet of paper and said we wouldn't be able to see him again until noon the next day.  After a long night of a little restless sleep we were informed that they would start removing him from sedation at 6:30am and take the tube out of his throat soon after.  At 7:30 they let us go in and see him just for a few minutes.  As soon as we went into his room he piped up with an inside joke between us and I knew he would be ok. 

We spent the rest of the day watching him slowly return to the boy we all knew and loved and he was released late that evening.  The next day was a revelation to him.  As soon as he got access to his cellphone and a computer he began to see the truth of how much he truly meant to everyone.  Both his phone and Facebook were filled with a constant stream of concern and care for him.  I was able to have a deep conversation with him that evening about how I noticied how much he means to a lot of people.  For the first time in a while he seemed to notice and acknowledge that he wasn't alone in this world.  I know that there will still be tough times for him still, but I felt that we had won a small battle.

I hope that you are able to find this revelation in your lives without going through what my son did.  Each and everyone of you have people in your lives that love you and deeply care that you are well.  Each and everyone have people in your lives that YOU love and deeply care about.  Please seek these people out and let them in and win your battle.

1357182847.0,53,self.SuicideWatch,15v6pg,I just want the pain go away...,65,12,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15v6pg/i_just_want_the_pain_go_away/,"I apologise if I don't format this right, but I've never made a reddit post before. I feel so selfish and whiny, because I know that so many people's problems are so much worse than mine, but I'm just groping blindly at this point for something, anything that will make me feel better. I've talked to lots of therapists and other people on the internet before, and nobody really could help. I don't even know why I keep trying anymore. I just want to stop hurting. I'm sorry if I'm rambling because I haven't eaten or slept in a couple of days and I have a really bad headache.

Ever since I was a little kid, I've known something was defective about me. I remember lying awake in bed at night at the age of 6 or 7, feeling some sort of unidentifiable despair. Even though I didn't really know what was wrong, I knew it was something that couldn't be fixed. As I got older, I started becoming more and more depressed and disgusted with myself, especially my appearance. I figured out the reason shortly after puberty: I wanted to look like a girl. I tried to shake off these thoughts for years, but now I'm 17 years old and I'm living in agony. I know I'm probably being overdramatic and whiny about it, but this has been tormenting me more and more over the years and now it's almost too much to bear. I used to try to distract myself with books and video games, but now not even that helps. I can't watch/read anything that has any sort of happy people inside, because I get painfully jealous of them, especially the women. I can't eat, sleep or bathe anymore unless forced to. I can't even look in the mirror anymore without bursting into tears, and I lie awake in bed at night crying, wishing that I'd been born as a girl. I've reached the point where I'm thinking about suicide multiple times a day and seriously considering if everyone would be better off if I just ended everything now. 

I know about hormone treatment and transitioning and all those things, but the fact remains that even if I last long enough to start living as a woman, my family will reject me. They're extremely conservative and religious, (by Canadian standards at least), and by coming out to them I'll have to make my parents choose between supporting me, or having the support of literally all of their friends and family. My extended family is even more conservative than my immediate family, and the only friends that my parents have are people from our definitely not LGBT-friendly church. I know that I should live my life for myself, not my parents, but the fact remains that I'll never be happy without their love and support.

Even if I do get past these hurdles, I don't think I'll ever be happy with my appearance. I know that hormones can do a lot, but I'm rather heavy-set, and my facial features are far from feminine. I've seen pictures of people who turn out fine anyway, but I'm sure that there are tons of people who don't and just don't put their pictures on the internet. I'm sure nobody's going to want to hire, be friends with or date someone who looks like a guy in a dress.

I've tried speaking to a lot of people and nothing seems to have helped. I haven't found any therapists who could help me, and I haven't been able to follow any advice that I've gotten online. I'm not very independent from my parents, so going to any sort of support group or special therapist/clinic is out of the option, and I don't know if I'll be able to wait the two or three years it will take for me to become independent from my family either... I know a lot of you are probably grossed out or bothered by my condition, but I've really exhausted all of my other options as the moment. I've been having thoughts of suicide ever since I was 10 or 11 years old, but they've gotten so much worse over the years that I'm now regularly considering whether or not it would be better for me to just end it all. I know it would hurt my family, but coming out would hurt my family too, and at least this way they'd have some sort of support network to help them. I just feel so disgusting and ugly and worthless and I just want the pain to stop. I'm sorry...

I'm writing this in the hopes of cutting down on certain trends I've noticed lately in these two subreddits that I hope won't grow larger.  But I suspect that, due to a certain thread and the repercussions, there may be something of a sudden influx of new readers.  Possibly just to peek, possibly to stay, possibly to seek help, possibly to give it.  First, I would like to address those who are popping in to peek or to help:

Please don't assume that the people posting here just haven't been shown how good they've got it *compared to some*.  We are aware that there are other people out there with problems.  That does not fix ours, which are just as real as anybody else's.  We need encouragement and empathy, not guilt trips and shaming techniques.

Please don't assume that those of us who speak of the wish to die/kill ourselves have never considered the impact on our friends and family. There's a good possibility we have, but our minds have convinced us that once we're gone, they'll either not notice or quickly recover. Regardless, whether we've considered that side of things or not, we are not at the point of wanting to die because we are selfish human beings. We are there because we are in such great pain that we don't know how to cope anymore and are willing to take that final step just to make it stop. Consider it euthanasia for a disease nobody else can see. There may be - there very possibly is - a cure that will allow us to live with depression or even overcome it. That cure will never be ""well you'd be a jerk to do that to your family, just how selfish are you?"" Reminding - or even convincing - someone that they are loved is a good thing, but it should be approached with a non-critical POV to avoid feeding the voice of depression.

Before you start posting responses to people with some very severe problems, consider [doing some research](http://www.depression-help-for-you.com/helping-someone-who-is-depressed.html).  It doesn't take long, and it can make a *world* of difference in whether you help or hinder.  There is a lot of good information, both there and elsewhere, but let me stress two ""don't"" points:

* When helping someone who is depressed, don't criticize the depressed person. One of the symptoms of depression is to have an overly critical attitude towards one's self. If you criticize the person, you will strengthen or reinforce this self critical attitude, further lowering his or her self esteem, and making the depression worse.
* When helping someone who is depressed, don't expect the depressed person to overcome his or her depression all by himself or herself. When depressed a person can't ""pull himself or herself up by his or her boot straps."" The depression relates to chemical changes which have taken place in the brain. A person can't just change his or her brain chemistry back to normal.

There.  That's done.  Now, a message to those of you who are here looking for help and support:

Try not to use the following words/ideas in your post:

* this is such a stupid post
* I'm sorry to waste everybody's time by typing this
* I'm such a whiner, I don't have real problems
* I'm sorry my post is all messy and long
* I must be weak and a failure to be talking like this

Getting your fears out is good, but so many of you start your posts out *apologizing* for posting in these subreddits *which are here for the very reason you are posting*.  It would be AWESOME news if the details of your post ended up being a temporary setback and the rest of your life is perfect.  Meanwhile, if it's not, the sooner you post, the sooner you start draining the poison out of your mind.  Read through some of the posts.  See how many people who are just like you have passed through here, posted an apologetic note, and received strong encouragement and advice.  Depression and SuicideWatch are here for *you*.  The thing that would be *bad* to do would be to *not* post and ""try and get through it alone.""  Depression loves it when you isolate yourself - so don't give it the satisfaction!

Also, remember that there will always be trolls.  It's a sad fact of life, and it's one that you must face.  The best response to a troll is to *look away*.  Don't respond to it, don't react to it.  Downvote it and then pretend it doesn't exist.  The majority of us want to see you get better, and the few dissenting voices among us are not worth listening to.  In fact, the more they echo the thoughts you yourself have been having, *the more wrong they are*.

I won't tell you not to do it, but I what I will do is try and compare my pain to yours, because on Sept. 12, the most important person in my life killed himself. My boyfriend, Michel. You can see him here [[pic]](http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs221.snc1/6832_162670774921_502514921_3635325_3420951_n.jpg), he's the one in the black shirt.

We'd been going out for over a year, I was 20, and he had just had his 19th birthday, on August 29th.

I won't tell you how he changed, how he went form being a person full of joy and eager to have fun, to how he became as depressed as he was. But what I'll tell you is, what it's done to me.

I now see a psychologist 1 - 2 times a week. I don't have any motivation to do anything, including eating. I don't have any motivation to sleep. I generally stay awake for 36 hours or so and then sleep for about 16 hours.

Everytime I wake up in the morning, I instantly wish I was back asleep. I don't know where the time has been going, and I don't know what I've been doing with the time. I can't keep track of anything anymore, and I feel as if I have nothing left to live for. I don't do anything, at all. All I do is smoke, watch TV, surf the internet, and sleep.

He meant everything to me, the world. I spent all of my time with him, we did everything together. We even lived together. I loved him so, so, so much. I've stopped crying everyday, but now when I do cry, it's so violent, it shakes my body and I start to choke.

I could go on, and on. But I don't blame him for *anything,* none of it. That's how much he meant to me. The low end of the average statistic is that every time someone kills themselves, 6 people are directly affected.

I have never been as alone as I am right now.  I have no one else to talk to.

The girl I love decided to date my bestfriend.  I've known each an equally long-amount of time.  About 7 years. She's going through a divorce, and I've been there since even before she got married.  Matter of factly, I was in that god damn wedding.  I helped her through all that shit, from her and her husbands first fights while still in a relationship to the death-throws of their marriage dissolving.  I've been as good a friend as anyone ever could.  Friendzone.  All that shit, blahblahblah.  I did not like her this far back.  I was involved in other people.  Wanting more than just her company came about a year ago.

I wasn't going to act on it during her divorce because that would have been grody, and I never would have imagined she would be able to cheat on her husband like she is doing now.  She's going through a divorce, sure, but still was hooking up with my best friend while he lived in the home.

My best friend knew too that I liked her.  Totally shit all over my cereal with that one.  That guy even kicked my teeth in while we were drunk, and I have my front teeth chipped still.  I can't handle the rage I feel over it.  It feels like vibrating and I just want to kill every nice thing in the world.

She was very curious as to why I decided to stop being friends with the guy she's dating.  I gave her my reasoning, and never did once lie to her.  I told her the truth, just not all of it.  I had assumed she'd of dropped me by now, because of how I was behaving toward my friend whom she is dating.  I figured she would have just left me alone in exchange for her relationship with him.  But she did not.  In fact she grew more affectionate, and I grew more and more confused.

I figured there was two paths from my actions of discontinuing being friends with whom she is currently dating and remained her friend; and they were that A) She would leave me alone, because I knew that I would never be able to do it on my own free will, and I wanted so much for her to leave me alone.  Or B) I would have to tell her the whole truth and that I really really like her.

And so it came down to B.  I had visited Florida the week before and sent her all sorts of pictures and spoke with her a lot while I was down there.  Several hours a day.  When I returned to my homeland, I knew things were going to happen.  Sure enough, she wanted the real answer.  She felt like she was to blame for my and my bestfriend's discontinuation, and I did not want her to feel that way.  So I told her that I was jealous.  I told her I was jealous because I like her.  I wasn't going to do anything or act on it or even bring it up until she had her shit squared with her divorce, but I had never got that chance because she hooked up with my best friend before any of that happened. That I was bitter.  I want to be mad at her.  I know a lot of it really is her fault, but never would have been if it weren't for my feelings.  

When I told her, we sat in the room in complete silence and she started to cry, and quietly reassured herself that she liked my friend.  Three hours.  Eventually we got to a concluding phrase and I took my exit.  We hug when we part ways for the night, but she hugged me and wouldn't let go of me.  We stood holding each other in her living room for as long as I could keep my breathing controlled.  I had to pry her off of me.  When we pulled away, she had her face turned very far away, presumably to keep me from kissing her, or to keep her from kissing me.  

It's been a week.  We still talk every day.  She said she didn't really know how to respond to me, and I told her that it wasn't anything that needed to be rushed.

I feel so alone that my love was not accepted by someone whom I tried my hardest to keep safe, to protect, to feel important, for so many years.  Love has never been too kind to me.  Each and every one of my long-term girlfriends were cheating, crazy bitches.  I feel not worthwhile, not worth my salt, when I try so hard to make people feel good.  To make things better.  To sacrifice myself for others.

I know that I won't be able to continue this, deep down.  I can't take care of her knowing I'm taking care of her for my friend's benefit.  It's selfish, and I have a hard time accepting that.  I want to invest my love in someone that will offer a return, but it's been so hard finding that.  It's been so hard that it feels like it's not them, and that it's me that's fucking up so badly.  Not just lady-friends either, but friends in general.  I get along with co-workers and colleges wonderfully well, but it's all shallow.

I just I don't know really what's up.  It isn't just this issue, either.  This is just a catalyst.  The shoestring that broke with no time left.  And I'm just so tired of trying.

I'm pleasant to be around when I am around folks.  Smiling, laughing, supportive.

Stumbles over to strike his kin

",68,18,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mkwry/if_you_are_thinking_of_committing_suicide_please/,"I too have considered suicide, you are not alone.  I would like to tell you my story and hopefully help you to not make the worst choice imaginable.

I grew up in a very conservative household.  I was never allowed to go out unless my parents new the parents of my friends and we were chaperoned.  This happened until I was about 15.  My dad was what you call a ""dry drunk,"" meaning that he grew up with a drunk for a father, subconsciously adopting his parenting methods for his own.  I was always told I was wrong if whatever I was doing did not identically match the methods of my dad.  I grew up with no motivation to do anything because I always thought I was wrong.  Sometimes I wished my dad was an actual drunk so at least if he beat me physically, I would be somewhat tougher.  But verbal abuse was my prison.  My mom was too scared of my dad and did nothing to stop him even though her methods of parenting, as I would find out later, were mostly perfect.  Anything anyone did in my house would be double checked to make sure it would not anger my dad.

As for my schooling, I attended an extremely small private school that went all the way from kindergarten through high school.  So small, in fact, that at the most there were 4 kids in my class.  We often shared classes with the adjacent classes (for instance, a class that was taught to the 7th and 8th grades simultaneously).  This meant that we were stuck in an atmosphere with next to no diversity.  My friends were only the few that were in my grade and the grades near mine.  I also happened to be the weakest and the ugliest, mix that with no confidence and you have the perfect storm for emotional turmoil, a.k.a., me.  However, I was raised to please people.  I seemed like the happy go lucky kid that was everybody's friend.  I happened to believe this myself sometimes.  You have no idea what bottling emotions at that level does to someone.  I was constantly teased for every mistake I made because I was the guy that you could push around.  Whenever I did try to fight back, I was only beaten even farther into submission.  As I went through high school, life started getting a little better.  I was given a few more privileges and started making more friends.  High school was actually somewhat decent.  Even though my dad was still making the home life miserable, I could deal with it better.  As college approached, life finally seemed good.  It was the summer before my freshman year and I had the hopes of becoming a civil engineer at URI.  I even got closer to my dad.  But it was the calm before the storm.

My second weekend at college I got a visit from my dad.  The car was packed with all his belongings and the family dog.  He was leaving to live with his family in Virginia (I lived in Rhode Island).  I found out that my family had a huge fight during my first weekend in college.  We had family fights before, but apparently I missed the Armageddon of family fights.  It was so intense that the neighbors started coming out and watching with phones ready to call the fuzz (or so I heard).  This started the worst year of my life.  To make it short (because if you got this far, I would imagine that you want this to finish) I sank into a deep depression that took my grades and drove them into the ground.  I was on academic probation the first semester and the second semester was even worst.  I came back to my home after the first year was over to find out that my job was taken.  I also was told that my mom, sister and I were going to have to sell the only place I have ever known as home and move to Delaware.  My world was changing rapidly for the worst.  This is when URI sent me a letter saying that because I did so badly the second semester, they were kicking me out.  I dropped the letter as I read and became frozen in despair.  I entered the deepest depression of my life.  I love stand up comedy, rock and roll, ice cream, playing guitar; but none of it could even make me smile.  The only hope I had for a positive change in my life was now gone.  I had thoughts of suicide before, but now was the only time I actually had the will to execute the thought.  I walked to my parents' room to get my dad's shotgun ready, only to find that he took it with him to Virginia.

After I thought about it, I decided to do something that I never did before, get some fucking initiative.  I sent a letter to URI as an appeal for dismissal and then I went job hunting.  Also, I decided on my own terms to see a counselor.  By July I was happy.  I found a job through a friend, I was able to hang out with friends because my asshole dad was 600 miles away, there was hope that we were going to stay in RI and I was re-accepted into URI's college of engineering.  Life was better.  However, we became broke and I was unable to afford to attend URI and we had to move to Delaware.  My friends and family prepared to see me dive into depression again, but one thing was different: I didn't give a shit and I was happy.  Why?

I learned something.  Life is not about pleasing others or living up to their expectations.  Things change and you have to deal with those changes.  I simplified it into something I call ""The Three L's.""  Let me show you.

1) Learn:  No matter what situation you are in, you can always learn something.  Think of the phrase ""Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.""  I know why my dad was a bad parent.  Therefore I learned how not to act when I have kids of my own.  I learned that you don't need to please everyone (like I said before).  I learned a lot of things and I know you can too!  You can use any negative situation and learn from it!  Hell, you can learn from positive ones as well.  Learn all that you can!

2) Love: Love what you have!  And I know you have plenty to love!  You are reading reddit right now, which means that you have amazing machinery.  Love those around you.  At the very least, you can love the fact that you are alive!  I know its cliche, but it truly is a miracle that you are a living being.  There is so much to love that you might not even notice!  I know that sometimes it's hard to see the good in some things but I assure you, there is good out there.

3) Live:  Live with what you have.  After you can see what good there is, it is easier to live in your situation.  After you learn and love, you now have new knowledge that you didn't have before and appreciation that can give you the extra push to explore something new!  We have but one life to live and that life is short in the first place, we must live with vigor to explore not only the world we live in, but ourselves as well.  

I know you might be going through a very tough situation, but I assure you that you can get through this and emerge through the other side in happiness.  I now live in Delaware with no friends, no job, no education and, most importantly, no worries.  Let me apply what I have said to my own life as an example so that you might be able to do the same.  1) I LEARNED that in order to be a good father I need to give my kids room to learn on their own.  I can get good education for a cheap price and I can go any time.  Friends are easy to make, just start talking about things you like and see if you spark an interest.  It goes on and on.  2) I LOVE that I have a roof over my head, pillows on my bed, a computer that can access any information or communities that I desire.  I have family that cares for me and that is willing to help me.  I could talk about everything, but I will stop for now.  3) I am now LIVING a close to stress free life even though there are so many things wrong with it.  I am becoming more active as time goes on and I can feel things changing for the better.

To summarize: Don't give up, you have the power to control your future and you make it what you want.  If you live in misery, you will be miserable.  Learn, love and live; you can do it!  Here is something I do when I get downtrodden: I look at a random object and think of why it is amazing.  At first, it might be hard to do, but once you get the hang of it, it can instantly help your mood.  If I could put everything I said here in one word, it would be, ""appreciate.""  Life has its downs, but it also has its ups, once you find the right track, you can be on the fast track to ups.  Please, if you have any questions, PM me or leave them in the comments.  I want to help you as much as I can.

Remember, Learn, love and live.  Your fellow redditor and friend, CivilCJ

It was his second or third such event and the school had decided to give up on him.

Because he always used over-the-counter pills, a bunch of us believed he wasn't really trying to die, just calling out for help. In retrospect, we should have realized that he was using those pills because he couldn't get his hands on anything stronger.

I dropped out myself at the end of the semester, and got a room in a cheap boarding house on the edge of campus. I talked Chuck into moving into the house with me because I thought it was better than the alternative, which was living with his parents, whose house was nearby but who seemed incapable of dealing with any human emotion, least of all his.

After a couple of months of living on his childhood savings account, another friend of ours named Harry, also a dropout at this point, decided to move out west, and talked Chuck into coming with him. They settled into a one-bedroom apartment. Harry took the bed and Chuck settled into a permanent spot sleeping on the couch. This didn't surprise anyone who knew Chuck. He had the lowest self-esteem of anyone I have ever called my friend.

Chuck found work in the new city but it was always terrible work, like sitting in a bulletproof booth at an all-night gas station, getting threatened and spat at by psycho customers.

Almost a year went by. I was still working in the college town, while Chuck and Harry did their respective things out west. We talked on the phone a lot. Chuck always seemed so lost, and wandering into situation after situation that only made things worse, like those gas station gigs.

Then came October 1980, and word that Bruce Springsteen was going to play a concert on his tour for ""The River"" in Chuck and Harry's town. They drove Chuck's beat-up car back to the college town, to see some friends, they said, and to give me a ride to the concert.

Only Harry wrecked the car the night before we were supposed to leave. We were stranded. We had our Springsteen tickets, but no money.

That is, until Chuck came to the rescue. He made a couple hundred bucks appear as it from nowhere. He bought me and Harry two AMTRAK tickets back to the west, and said he'd follow us out as soon as the car was fixed. We promised to pay him back.

We all went to the train station the night we left. Chuck and I sat on two of those hard plastic-shell chairs at a corner of the terminal and laughed our butts off, telling stories and just shooting the breeze. It was wonderful. I was starting to think Chuck was going to be OK. He seemed so much more at ease. It wasn't until afterwards I realized why: He had made the decision to die. That must have felt like a huge weight off his shoulders.

So he got me and Harry out of town on the train and went back to his parents' house. And on the night of Oct 20, 1980 he drove their car to a park where he had played as a boy and shot himself in the head.

The call came early, and my head was still ringing from Springsteen's fabulous 4-hour concert the night before, and everything I had ingested during it. I was on Chuck's couch, using his pillow and blanket in a futile effort to find, as Kris Kristofferson said, a way to hold my head that didn't hurt. Harry answered the phone.

It was Chuck's mom, matter-of-factly informing us of his suicide, and asking us to please return his personal possessions to them as soon as we could.

I will never forget that hammer shot of astonishment, of realizing for the first time that he really had it in him to take his own life, that I had been wrong all along. And now it was too late to fix it.

I remember stumbling out of the apartment and walking three or four blocks to a neighborhood bodega, not so much to buy anything but because I needed to get out. I walked in and the store owner immediately started yelling at me. I didn't understand what he was saying -- it may have been a language I didn't know, or maybe my brain just wasn't processing the sound of his voice. But I got the message from his outstretched index finger: Get out. It was only when I turned to leave that I saw my bloody footprints all over his floor, and realized I had left the apartment barefoot and stepped on something sharp at some point. I never felt a thing. Except for shame. I tried to apologize but the owner just kept pointing at the door and yelling.

I used to get sad every October, without really understanding why, and then I'd remember that the anniversary of Chuck's suicide was coming up. This went on for maybe 10 years. More recently the date has come and gone without my really thinking about it. Though I still think about poor Chuck all the time.

Sometime in the past year I realized, for the first time, that Chuck, who was a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, killed himself on the anniversary of the plane crash. That sent a chill through me.

And of course like so many humans, round numbers stick out in my head. So the 30th anniversary has been front and center in my mind these last few days.

We were both 21 that day. I suppose he still is. I have a wife and kids, and have worked a bunch of jobs, including one I have right now that I love. I've been fortunate to see a lot of the world.

I'm typing this on a laptop in the basement of the house I've owned and occupied for more than a decade. I've seen and done so many things I am grateful for having experienced, while Chuck has lain in a grave not far from his parents' old house, frozen in time forever as a sad, confused kid.

If you're out there Harry and you recognize yourself in this story, sing out. It's been too long.

Everyone else: hug the ones you love for me and Chuck today. And if you have a friend or relation who seems unable to get free from their demons, hug them extra. You may not be able to fix whatever's wrong. That may just be the way it is, and there may be nothing you can do. It's taken me 30 years to truly believe that.

I wish you an easier time.

I have bipolar I and a very shitty life on top of it.  I am stalked by my ex who is completely psychotic.  She follows me around Reddit down voting everything I post and tells everyone I beat her when I didn't because she knows it will make people feel sorry for her and it will hurt me.

I'm in love with a woman who would be perfect for me.  Problem is, while I walked three hours each of three days, two ways, to see her in the hospital, her boyfriend wouldn't go see her and only called to bitch her out as she laid sick for a week now.  That is, until he heard I was going there.  He *does* beat her, puts her down constantly, does not get her insulin, will not let her see a doctor until she is deathly ill, and will not allow her to do anything to better herself.  Guess who she picks?  I walked three hours there today, and when I got there I found out he was coming, so without a break I walked three hours back.

I have children I never get to see.  I am disabled, have no vehicle, own my own home and get by fairly well all things considered.  My children are my world, and I call them as often as it seems I can without annoying anyone.  But although my child support is paid, I haven't seen them in two years.

I could go on.  My life, in every way, is fucked -- except that I am not homeless.  I am one of the lucky ones.  But this is an old place and is falling apart.  Without the money to fix it, I will be homeless some unknown time in the future, at least for a transitional period.  I'm college educated too with two degrees, but can't find a job I can hold.

Bipolar leads to suicidal thoughts.  I'd be locked up if I admitted to an authority that I have a foolproof, painless plan for how to do it and know I could.  **BUT FUCK THAT** 

I **WILL NOT** die.  You know why?  Because of the crapfest that is my life, I've only given you folks a tiny sliver of a glimpse, and this shit has not killed me yet.  I will feel better.  I will hit the up part of my bipolar cycle.  I will be glad to be alive.  And I know I will.

So, suicidal ideation is no excuse to actually use gesture.  And to all of the people out there, know: It will get better.  No matter how good an end to the hurt sounds, even when sentenced to a life of guaranteed repeating hurt, it **will** get better.  Remember this.  Repeat this.  Think of all the times you wanted to do it, and all the times after that you were glad you didn't.  You've won this fight so far.

Fast forward two years:
I thought I met someone who loved me, but I met a disturbed, mentally ill alcoholic who was controlling and emotionally abusive. I was addicted to and codependant on him and I quit my excellent, secure, well paying job in a moment of dilusion thinking I was going to move to Hawaii and get married. I finally broke up with him in February because I couldn't take it anymore.

I say this not to trivialize the feelings or pain of anyone who posts here, but only to perhaps help remind you that no matter how bad you hurt there are often people who would react like this if you were gone. You are someone's sister, brother, friend, coworker, etc. This matters. It's all we have. 

Each person is unique, but when I've felt suicidal it's been because I couldn't fathom a way out of my situation/feelings/hurts/regrets. (yes, all of those at different times.) It wasn't because I actually wanted to never exist again. I've always thought life was beautiful in some ways, but it seemed like there was no way to cope. If you feel like that now, stop. Try to think of at least one thing you enjoy. Try to think of one person, maybe even your freaking mother, no matter how annoying she may be, who would react like this person did if you were gone.

Her only child will never come back. And neither will you if you end your life. This place is filled with too many people who won't face their problems. People who struggle and agonize over their own are the kind of people this world needs. Don't quit. People who are discerning of mistakes and self-aware of pain are the people who can help end this world of violence, self-inflicted or upon others.

It's incredibly selfish to pass my pain on to my family, but the dead don't feel guilty about killing themselves, they feel nothing, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

You know why I love going to sleep at night? It's because for even the tiniest bit of time, I get to shut out my crippling social anxiety and depression. No worries about family, no worries about the future or the past, no worries at all. 

The worst part is my dad has been riding my ass about getting a job to 'help' my social anxiety, as if the prospect of being around people (something that makes me so incredibly paranoid and anxious) is going to help me feel better. I don't want a job; Work is tiring, and I'm already tired of being tired.

I've never experienced love, you can see that by checking out another post I've made in a different subreddit. I'm just a shell of human just hoping that something kills me, wishing something killed me with every fiber of my being.

And I don't think it shows either. I mean, I joke around when that's appropriate, I smile most of the time (genuinely), and have close friends whom I love. But in moments like now, I feel so, so bad.

But jesus fucking christ, I have it so god damn good, yet I have suicidal thoughts. And that makes me feel like a little shit.

I am 16 years old, I live in the UK and I am done with everything, As tempting as it is, do not say I am too young to know what pain is, I have seen things in my life that have worn me down, I have been moved from country to country, city to city as a child. I am asian, and for that I hate the god i no longer believe in. 

Don't get me wrong, I take the best out of each situation, I was as strong as a rock but this rock has been crushed, I am not a idiot, in fact pretty smart, I have been a  programming for over 3 years, on a freelancing site completed hundreds of projects and have hundereds of positive feedbacks, made tens of thousands of dollars of legit money over the years working for big companies all over the world, I have implemented one of the biggest Insurance companies API , a pretty complex task, Of course none knew my real age. I tell you this so you do not take me for an idiot who faced some problems and is going to end it, I am not one. 

I just listened to a song and the lyrics said: 

""I feel like a arab among english man and a english man among arabs""

That is so true, While I am not arab I can very well relate to that, I cannot bring a child into this world who is the same colour as me and ruin his/her life. The truth is, I get it , being racist is so easy, it is fun! but what do you think I have done to deserve it? Do you think i choose to be this colour? Do you think I choose to be in this country while I do love it more than anything? Do you think just because I am brown, I am going to kill innocent people? I would die without question at any time just to save a child from pain. But I have been called a terrorist too many times to count, I know how the system works, I know exactly what a teacher gets for randomly shouting out ""Lazy fucking Arab"" at a student, Nothing. 

I am not perfect, I have fucked up many many times, which is the reason why I am done, my girlfriend just left me as well after two years and a half of being with her, every day. I loved her more than anything, My dad left my mum, me and my two little brother and sister few days ago as well, I thought about doing it this morning but I still had a few things to finish, so i read the site u guys recommended to other people and i thought ok i will wait a few hours, in this few hours I have tried to talk to anyone i know, i tried everybody in my contacts and nobody gives a shit, my best friend, a girl who I would die for anyday, she even texted back with a ""Busy today maybe next week"" .. I got no family, no one in this country, I live at the heart of racism, 99% white , highest BNP vote in the UK, I live in hate. But i do try, I think maybe if i keep being nice to them, maybe if i hold the door despite them being a mile away, maybe if i help the old man with the garden they will see everyone is not the same, but they never do. 

So reddit, next time you are going to just hate someone, think about it twice, for the love of god, think about it twice. 

I am off to the gym for one last time, I want to feel the iron beat me down, the iron is the only thing which is honest, people tried to pretend they care when my dad left, they tried to pretend their sorry when my girlfriend cheated on me in front of my own eyes as i cried, they tried to say sorry when i lost everyone i had , but the iron, the iron is honest! it beats me down the same everytime I go , if anything it feels heavier, it has no sympathy , it is always there, so for the last time, I will let it beat me down as squat to the floor. 

Sumitted through vpn, server will be rm -rf / 

EDIT: 

Thank you guys, i just got back and i was expecting this post to be buried, and downvoted, I so wish i knew you guys in real life, All i wanted today was to talk to someone, honestly I would have done the same, not just for them to listen, I would have listened as well, I tried everyone I know, every single number, and nobody, not a single person was willing, That really just took me under, made me feel like no one gives a shit, and these are the people who know me, people who i took a beating for, people who I have honestly helped and cared for all my life. For some reason, it makes me sick to my stomach thinking that no one, not a single person cared, I never hurt anyone, NEVER. 

I have promised my self to wait until midnight maybe i will calm down, maybe she will text back, I really don't know.

Just a disclaimer, this is not directly related to suicide. I already made one post searching for him a few days ago, but I promise this is the last one. If you can upvote this so he will hopefully notice, I will be most grateful. Again, I will delete the post later.

Estonian guy whose name I don't know yet: we last spoke last wednesday, 4th of January, when I was at work. We were supposed to have a serious conversation when I got home. But you vanished completely leaving me very anxious. I'm assuming one of four things:

1) Something bad happened to you, in which case you won't read this anyway and there's nothing else I can do. I hope to hear from you later though, I won't just forget about you.

2) You changed your mind regarding my proposition and were too afraid of speaking to me after your breakthrough or didn't know how to tell that to me. In that case, it would have been better if we just spoke, you said no, and I would not be left anxious for many days not knowing what happened. I'd be glad if you just came to Skype to clarify this for me, and I'll be okay with whatever your position is. (for anyone concerned, this proposition is in no way related with suicide.)

3) You somehow forgot my reddit name, and my skype username, and couldn't find a way to contact me. In that case, it's **swthrowaway** on Skype and I've been online all the time.

4) You were a very, very sophisticated and convincing troll, and a good actor for that matter, who dedicated many hours to speak with me through voice and then IM for some attention/fun. If that's the case, well, you won. I hope playing with another person's feelings made you feel better about yourself, but next time remember that it's at the cost of another person's sanity.

So either way, if you could just come to Skype, I'm **swthrowaway**, and talk with me for one minute to clarify things, whichever the reason you vanished was, I will not feel as shitty as I feel right now.

I've never posted to /r/suicdewatch. I don't doubt that there are a lot of you out there posting looking for someone to connect with. I'm sure this is the worst you've ever felt. I'm sure you've been dealing with it for a long time. But know this...you don't want to die or you would have done it already instead of posting to a subreddit. I'm not trying to take any of that away from you. I get it. I've been there many times. No one is trying to take those feelings away from you and you are justified in feeling shitty if things are really going that shitty. I just want you to consider things from the point of view of someone who has been there, attempted, and survived.  Multiple times.

I've attempted suicide. Three times. The first time I chickened out and called 911 right away.  No harm done. The second one was much more serious. I had health problems for a good year after my second attempt.  My dr's said I was lucky not to have sustained brain damage. I know what it means to be fucking miserable. Thankfully I've never had access to anything like a gun because when I'm in that frame of mind, I'm incredibly impulsive. I always went for drug overdose. I know it's a shitty way to do things. It's like a last ditch effort. But after months of being so depressed I can't even get out of bed I was desperate for anything that might work. I was paranoid. I was hallucinating. My thoughts would race. And then I would just become so incredibly numb that I would just stare at the walls in bed for days at a time. Eventually if that went on long enough I would probably try cutting myself to feel anything. Not just emotionally numb, but physically numb. And then the whole cycle would start over.  Trust me.  I know where you are coming from. I know what it is like to feel THE WORST YOU'VE EVER FELT...

And I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be that way. There is lots of help available for those who seek it. Even those who are seriously mentally ill or dealing with a serious drug addiction...there is help (I'm both seriously mentally ill and have done drugs). You think you're all alone, but you have strangers on the internet willing to take time out of their day to post some words of encouragement. That's just the first step. Next you have to go to professionals who are trained in how to deal with this sort of thing. Post on reddit, if it makes you feel better. Let someone know how shitty you're feeling. Call a suicide hotline. Go to an ER if you think you really are a danger to yourself. But do not fuck around with trying to commit suicide. You don't want to do it. You want help and that is why you are here.

You only have ONE life. No matter how shitty things may seem you are responsible for finding happiness and fulfillment. People can help you get there but you have to WANT to get better. I know...you are probably thinking that of course you want to get better.  You want nothing more than to get better. But think about what a big life change that means for you. It can be a little scary. Sometimes we hold on to our bad habits. It is not your fault you're depressed but you can't let it become a way of life for you. It shouldn't define you as a person.

Let me tell you, surviving suicide is not pretty. I've attempted on all kinds of drugs including lithium and Tylenol. Both of those times nearly killed me. I attempted recently with Tylenol. I was done. Anything had to be better than living another day feeling that depressed. I wasn't eating, I wasn't sleeping, I wansn't even showering or brushing my teeth. Days bled into one another.  I cannot tell you what a mess I was. I wasn't going to work. I got fired for not showing up. I literally did nothing but lay in bed and sob. So I decided to take about 75 Tylenol PM. Fuck it...I knew it was going to be painful and wold take a long time, but I just could not stand to spend another day feeling like that.

Well, if I was miserable before it was nothing compared to how I felt after I took those pills. Tylenol PM makes you trip. Miserable, weak, tripping on Tylenol PM while I wait for my liver to shut down...it was painful. I vomited blood. I still didn't call 911. I drifted in and out of consciousness. At some point I became aware that I couldn't do this. It was too painful. Nothing had to be worse than slowly dying of a Tylenol overdose. So I called 911. Thank God it wasn't too late. I have no idea how long I was laying there until I decided to call. I had no concept of time. But THANK GOD it wasn't too late.

I was in the hospital a long time. I have damaged my liver. I was also on a heart monitor. When I finally was released it was to a psych ward.

Have any of you ever been to a psych ward? It is the most depressing place on earth. All you do is sit and watch the clock all day so you can talk to a dr for a few minutes. You don't get any real answers. You just need to not be an immediate threat to yourself or others. Everything you do is watched and noted. It's enough to make you paranoid. Every little thing you do or don't do, any emotion you show...everything you say could mean the difference of staying there 2-3 days or 2+ weeks. You do not want to go to a psych ward. The people there are fucking crazy. Not just I want to kill myself crazy but real honest-to-fucking-god psychotic. Not all of them, obviously...but there will be a couple there. I was there with a guy who kept cutting off his fingers. He would always try to touch me with his mutilated hand. I was also there with a girl who thought people we're getting inside her head and controlling her thoughts. She was my roommate. She never shut up. She kept making calls to the cops from the community phone and having them come out for bullshit reasons. People are there because they're a danger to themselves...or others. You might just be depressed but you never know when someone else is going to just snap. Don't think shit doesn't go down in mental hospitals. I've been there many times and I can tell you...shit happens.

So after a while you are released and then you have to pick up the pieces of your life. You think people are going to let you forget about this? No fucking way. You are always going to hear about this and everything you do from now on will be judged accordingly. Friends, family, everyone. Attempting suicide does damage to relationships that cannot be easily repaired. No one is going to trust you. You will be under a fucking microscope from now on. It's fucking embarrassing. No one wants to have to live that down. Not to mention if you've missed time for work due to being in the hospital. No, they can't fire you for it outright, but they will look for ways to cut you if they can. It won't be related to your attempt, but you would never have gotten let go or disciplined otherwise. It has happened to me.

When I woke up after this attempt I was so fucking depressed. I just lay there day after day. Seriously did not move from the same spot for weeks. I didn't do anything to take care of myself . All I could think of is that I wish I had been successful, that I shouldn't have called 911. Yesterday I got up for the first time. Took a shower, ate something and then immediately wanted to go back to bed because I realized I still had to face the shit storm that ensues after a suicide attempt. It's going to take a lot of time to heal from this physically and emotionally.

Don't do it. Just get help now. Call a suicide hotline. See a doctor. Even go to an ER if you have to. Checking yourself in as voluntary to prevent you from doing something works out a lot better than seeking treatment for something you already did. You're not in there as long...just enough to get over the hump. You will have no lasting physical damage. Your relationships will sustain much less damage that way. People will be proud of you for making the right choice instead of ashamed of you.

For those of you who are thinking that they will do something much more definite and final than overdosing...well, I can't tell you how that will work out. I've never done anything more drastic than overdosing. But I can tell you that there are better ways out there than suicide. I still wanted to die every day for weeks after I came home...but the longer I had to think about it the more I realized that it's not so much about wanting to die is it is just not wanting to feel so bad. To want to feel like I had control over something in my life. That's why it felt like a good decision, to feel like I had control over dying. But there are ways to achieve that control over your life you just need to give yourself a chance. It's a long, hard road. I've been going through this shit for 13 years now. But here I am and I either have to make the best of it and try to be a happy and productive human being...or just give up and never leave my bed again since dying is obviously not an option for me. And it shouldn't be for you.

Just just don't fuck around...it's not a game. If you need help, we are here for you so post away...but when you get done posting take some further steps to help yourself. No one can help you unless you want to help yourself.

1301334271.0,48,self.SuicideWatch,gda1i,A fellow redditor saved my life on Skype. We just abruptly stopped talking for good. ,51,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gda1i/a_fellow_redditor_saved_my_life_on_skype_we_just/,"I am severely depressed. It's debilitating. I'm in an outpatient program now. A couple of months ago she asked for help on Reddit and I thought I could help so I responded. Doesn't matter what she needed help on, but we chatted on Skype for a few weeks and many hours were spent sharing. She does not live anywhere near me, but it was nice to feel some kind of ""connection"" to a new person. It became to feel like we were friends. 

One day a close friend and I talked about the turmoil in my head. Those of you who were in my situation know of the pain, loneliness, sadness, frequent crying and feeling of pointlessness. Simple hopelessness. I told her that I just wanted the pain to go away. Being a sympathetic person she said that she understood why I would wanted to end it. Despite knowing better, I convinced myself that I had her approval to end the pain. I was lonely and scared but determined to let it all go black. 

That night my skype companion was online as I was making preparations late that night. I told her my intentions and proceeded to swallow handfuls of different benzos. I was not in a rational state of mind I know now. She pleaded over and over with me to get help. But she was on the other side of the world and could not do anything other than that. I was determined to go through with it. I even had a quote from one of her favorite bands that I wanted to send to her to say goodbye. She kept typing urging me to get help. I was scared. I was alone. I realized that my final words would be seen by this person so far away. 

About 15 minutes after i swallowed the pills I still felt nothing. Years of Benzo use and abuse for anxiety built up a tolerance in my body. It was happening more slowly than I expected. I was even more scared by now and so alone. I asked her if I could video chat with her so I could just have a little comfort of seeing a live person before the benzos kicked in and I tied the plastic bag around my head. She obliged for a minute or so, but stated that If I wanted someone to watch me die I would have to find another ""pervert"" to do it and disconnected the video. All I wanted was to see another person's face for a little while. I would have disconnected when i started feeling the effects of the pills. She continued to persuade me to seek help. I could almost feel her desperation and concern by reading her words. 

I hate myself. I don't care about myself. When I wake up after sleeping I feel anxiety and disappointed that I have to be conscious. But this person whom I've known for a few weeks seemed to really care. The guilt that comes with Depression came surging in. I didn't care about myself, I wanted to die. But the main reason I couldn't do this earlier was because I knew my death by suicide would affect deeply all the people in my life that have not given up hope on me. My warped interpretation of my good friend's understanding of why I wanted to die some how made it seem that she all all the others that care for me would be okay. I hated myself not them. I hate life but I could not inflict the kind of pain I felt in my head to those I actually cared for. The thought of them made me reconsider my actions. 

In the past I isolated myself and withdrew from a lot of people. But there were some that never gave up on me. If this person so far away seemed to care, then what about the people in my real life? I used to think that my suicide would make everyone's life easier because they would not have to deal with me anymore. A line of text or two from this person I only knew over the net turned that around. My death by this means would destroy the lives of people who genuinely cared for me. 

So I called for help. Transportation to the nearest hospital was only a few minutes away. Vomiting, Stomach pumping and charcoal and some drugs stopped the effects of the benzos. Blood and liver tests showed no permanent damage physically. After a little conflict with the staff I convinced them to get my phone from my personal effects. A few phone calls several text messages informed most people.

My phone had a skype app and when I logged in, she was online but I left a quick message anyways to let her know I was being cared for.

Then the sadness and crying came back.

They transported me to a mental hospital for suicide watch. They let me go a few days later after I convinced the psychiatrist that my actions were selfish. Ending my pain could not justify the effects on those who still cared about me. 

When I was released I tried skype again. she was offline. offline all the times that I checked 2 -3 weeks so I knew she blocked me. 

A few days ago she sent me a pm on reddit asking if I wanted to chat again. A few hours later we were on skype. I was going to tell her about her role in my (hopefully) recovery. But when I asked her why she wanted to chat again, she simply stated that she was intoxicated and high from going out the night before. So I figured I'd find a better time to bring up such a heavy subject. 

For two days we had intermittent contact. Small talk really. Then I was ready to dive in. I got her attention and then dropped the subject because I didn't have the words for what I felt. We continued small talk until a few hours ago. 

I fucked up. My suicide attempt obviously messed shit up and probably traumatized her. A few hours ago she said that she wouldn't talk to me anymore she found someone else to help her. To cut things short. I mentioned our friendship. She basically stated that we were never friends. It hit me like a sledgehammer. I basically laid it out, I couldn't cause her anymore conflict. If she didn't want to call it friendship fine. If she didn't want to talk to me anymore then fine. I hinted again that I am alive today because of her, but never said it outright. I couldn't, because I dropped too many bombs on her already. I reminded her that I wasn't well, I think because I wanted her to know I wasn't rational when I did what I did. A hail Mary pass. But before I threw the ball down field, I realized what I was doing. I'm still sick. She never knew the real me. So if she didn't know me then, how could I be her friend? 

So I summed up her point of view and added some of mine regarding our ""friendship"" and continued to say that if she didn't want to talk to me anymore then I would find no need to continue future conversations. 8 minute later the word appeared on the screen ""Okay"". The last thing she said to me. But I couldn't let her believe that I never thought of her as a friend in the short time we communicated. I let her know what made me think we were friends and my admiration for her as a human being. Then following her wishes, I agreed that we weren't friends. Then promptly blocked her. I hope she does to same to my account. I can't make anymore stupid decisions based on irrationality.

Since freshman year, my grades have been perpetually low. I made a passing attempt at improving them in sophomore year but my grades have fallen back to Fs. I can't stop thinking about how bleak I am making my future. My teachers don't usually acknowledge my grades. Most of them ignore me. Some of them have given me passive aggressive lectures, telling me that I am never going to leave this town, let alone county, and that I am the worst student that they have ever had. I think they're telling the truth. I used to want to get into UW Madison but everybody knows that I never will. I can tell because they've long since stopped bringing it up. Today one of my teachers took me out into the hall and said ""I've got to ask you a serious question. Are you on drugs.""? He then proceeded to berate me. The other teachers who care to talk to me are no different. Everybody I see is doing better than me. I want to be somebody but, I know that will never happen.

",49,6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ui35i/do_i_deserve_death_long_not_for_the_faint_of_heart/,"Suicide has been on my mind a lot lately. For years, I've been having some pretty intense visions of my suicide, but not frequently. These past few weeks, though, I haven't gone to sleep without seeing them.

Why? Because I am a rapist.

Yeah. Just gonna let that one hang out there.

How'd it happen, I imagine you asking. Well, my entire life has been filled with stories of abuse. 

When I was 5 or so, a friend of my older brother convinced me to play with him, sucking his dick, etc. Nothing major, kinda pushed it into the dark and didn't think about it ever again. 

When I was 9, my parents were divorcing. My then 14 year old older brother was full of anger and took it all out on me. He would hit me, punch me, molest me. My parents knew about the physical stuff. I doubt they knew the many times my older brother nearly raped me. They sent him away to live with my mother while my father kept my self and siblings.

The damage was done, though. I broke, and ended up molesting my younger siblings for a year. I thought it was normal. I thought it was fine. Until I got older, when I buried it in the dark and stopped thinking about it.

When I was 15, I got access to the internet, and like any 15 year old, I searched for porn. I didn't like seeing the old models, so I looked for younger. And the Internet provided. Did I mention that I struggle with pedophilia? I'm mostly over it now, but it was tough when I was 17-18. That's when the hallucinations of my death first started.

When I was 16, I fell for a girl, let's call her Jo, with a boyfriend. He was the creep in the class with a massive jealousy complex. He would become controlling of her if any other man would try to even talk to his girl. I thought it was pathetic, but harmless. Until she told me she had been raped. 

I have never felt such rage until that point. I wanted him dead, or for her to tell the cops. She wouldn't. One day, I nearly got into a fight with the man and would have tried to do some damage had the truancy officer not walked by at that moment. 

I wanted to do something, but Jo wouldn't let me do anything. I broke off that friendship in rage, unable to help her. It was the only time I've truly self-harmed. I had to punish myself for failing to stand up for a friend.

When I was 18, I stared dating my now ex-fiance. We hit it off, we loved each other. It was wonderful. She was two years behind me in school, so I went off to college while she stayed to finish high school. We'd be together forever! It was going to be perfect. That's what I thought until the 8 hour drive to my college became a reality. I should have known that was going to break us, but it took me 3 semesters before I dropped out to be back with her to salvage what was left. 

She graduated high school and we moved in together. This, surely, would help fix the problems, I kept thinking. But we both worked different shifts. We never got to see each other and were too exhausted to really live our lives. 

Almost three years to the day of when we started dating, we called it off to try to cool down and give it some time to regroup. I thought we were just taking some time off and would be back together again. She thought we were completely done. 

She slept with a friend a few days after that. I broke. I literally broke. I became angry, resentful, fearful, hateful. She still thought of me as a best friend, so one night, we were cuddling and I forced myself on her. ""She was supposed to be mine"" I thought, so I took what I thought I deserved. 

That is the last memory I have for a week and a half. 

The next memory I had was of my father trying to knock my apartment door off its hinges with the cops trailing behind him. Apparently that morning, I had forced myself upon my ex again and she was afraid that I would kill myself.

She wasn't too far off, once I heard what I had done. 

My father took me back to his place to keep me under suicide watch for two months. My ex went to the police, but told me she wouldn't press charges if I worked to turn my life around.

I worked and she dropped the charges.

I got a better job, went back to school, and have been doing a much better job at my life than I had been previously. I've even gotten close to a few friends. No relationships, but it did get serious. 

The problem? The two women I got close to were victims of abuse. 

The first had been molested by her older brother for years. Her and I had dated for a week in high school, but her kissing another boy made her feel like she had to leave me. I never found out that detail until years later. 

She had essentially thrown her life away, being a sex toy for whatever drug-addled shit-stain would keep a roof over hear head. Her getting pregnant during that life lead her to find a man who could provide for her, getting her out of the shit life she had before. 

She didn't like the man she was living with, so she reached out to me, who had always kept her as a friend, even through everything. One day, she needed to get away from the fighting between her and her boyfriend. So she came to me. She became my best friend for a while, and we helped each other heal some. 

She ended up moving away from my friendship when her boyfriend found out that she and I were sleeping together. Oops. She stopped talking to me after she went back to her boyfriend, and it hurt. No self-harm that time.

Another friend was a girl who had been four grades behind me. I met her first before I met many of my other close friends. After years of sporadic contact, I began talking to her frequently. Several months ago, I learned she was living in the same apartment complex as me, so we would hang out and just have fun. She would gracefully ignore my advances enough so I stopped. She saw me as a brother. Someone she could trust. 

One night, she revealed how her sister's husband had blackmailed her into having sex with him when she was younger and the whole mess of problems that caused her to have, from PTSD to excessive drug use. She was messed up, but it helped me realize just the extent of abuse I had suffered. 

She is currently my closest friend and will likely be taking me to the community mental heath center in my town. Assuming I survive that long.

The last had been another girl I had dated once in high school. She turned lesbian after she dumped me, but turned straight again a year or two ago. She then found herself strung along with several controlling, abusive men who essentially used her as their sex toys. 

She got in contact with me a month and a half ago and we became good friends again. She's a bit of a nympho and she took me into her bed. I enjoyed it and so did she. One night, I woke up with myself trying to get with her and becoming angry at the ""no"" signals she was sending. 

I was shocked, afraid that I would loose control again and become just another abuser. I left. I ran from her place to sit in my own bed and fear for what I might be.

Ever since that, my depression has gotten worse. The visions of my suicide have become more vivid, and much more frequent. I have realized that I've been suffering anxiety attacks every few weeks. I am messed up.

No one seems to notice, though. The people at my work think my recent change in attitude is the stress of the newly remodeled restaurant as well as some sexual frustration. Otherwise, I look perfectly normal. 

But every night as I lay down to go to sleep, I keep seeing myself taking a dozen pills and washing them down with the currently untouched fifth of gin sitting in the kitchen. 

So, keep going? Or is this miserable sun of a bitch too far gone to be kept alive?

EDIT: Thank you so much for your outpouring of support. This means so much to me. I'll be taking this thread with me to therapy. It helps me touch on a ton of issues I need to resolve. Hopefully they'll put me with someone who can properly help me.

EDIT 2: It is strange. Having surrounded myself with those who have also suffered abuse, I began to question whether my own abuse was even all that much. It turns out that my pain is entirely valid. Knowing this may be the first step to fixing myself. When I begin admitting that the pain is real, I can start to see it and fix it.

The title speaks for me. I just tried to hang myself in my closet. After another fight with my mother, I sat in my room for a while. I looked at the cord on the floor and at the clothing rack in my closet. You can do the math. (I've attempted to kill myself three times now.)

Obviously, I didn't finish. The only thing that stopped me was my little brother knocking on the door. I stopped, and now I'm crying. I've been to therapy, have taken anti-depressants and have even talked to a support line. Nothing helps, I just feel useless..

TL;DR I tried to kill myself, little brother's door-knocking stopped me, nothing helps..

I just don't feel like living any more, I've really just had enough. I've felt this way for years, but not for a different reason. Previously it was just because I lacked the will, and much preferred the idea of death than life. Now it's due to stress and anxiety.

I'm only 17 years old and in highschool. I have a pile of work needing to be done, but I just procrastinate, I **hate** the work I need to do, and I avoid it. I'll end up being forced to slap something together the hour before and fail all my classes. It's either I end it here, or spend the rest of the year hating life, fail highschool then spend the rest of my life with a shitty job, hating life. 

I know my family will hate this, I understand, but they'll move on. I haven't even seen my mother in years, when she left me. I haven't spoken to my father in days, and even when we do talk, it's just generic things, and him making me attend school.

I don't really feel scared of death, I'm also fairly confident that my method will work. I plan on injecting 500+ units of rapid acting insulin - my father is a diabetic. 

In about an hour I'll inject the insulin, then lie down and die watching one of my favorite movies, fall asleep then never wake up, it actually sounds perfect to me.

Not really sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just want someone to talk to about it before I go through with it...

Anyway I have tried everything I can think of. I have tried about a dozen different drugs in various combinations (Zoloft, Celexa, Welbutrin, Effexor, Cymbalta, Abilify, Seroquel, Mirtazapine, Lithium, Buspirone, Clonazapam, Fish Oil, Emsam, and Latuda)
I have also tried a number of types of therapies with 4 different therapists, a two month long 'intensive outpatient' day program, and 11 days in an inpatient program
As a last resort I tried ECT, both right unilateral and bilateral, with ever increasing intensities. This seemed to help slightly and I was put on maintenance ECT as I repeatedly relapsed immediately after stopping. Overall I probably had close to 50 treatments, but because of memory loss I can't say for sure. I had to stop school during this period and eventually quit going to ECT as, besides making me loose the memory for the previous year and a half, it made me loose all memory in between each session, so I could not realistically finish school or hold a job while undergoing ECT.
Needless to say I've tried everything I can think of and as the title says I am out of ideas.
I'm a Pharmacist and am pretty good at searching the medical literature. By doing this I have heard about ketamine but the very short duration of action makes it seem like its worthless. The only other thing I could find that has ever been reported to work in people who have failed ECT is using opiates for depression, but as I'm actively and continually suicidal my psychiatrist would never consider giving me access to a drug I could overdose on so easily.
Any Ideas? Anyone been in similar circumstances and ever improved?

Basically I feel like I have legitimately tried everything and that at this point suicide is the only way out.

This is my story.,52,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/16uxh8/little_sister_commit_suicide_11_days_ago_this_is/,"On January 7th 2013, my little sister O.D'd on prescription pills and drown herself. There were no signs of depression, no clues leading up to the incident. Family events over the holiday season were great, she didn't show any signs of sadness. The week leading up to the incident was family oriented, a happy time. The night before she even went to Cirque Du Solei with my parents. Nobody picked up on it.
She loved to help people. Talking with all her friends now, I realized she was helping many people overcome depression and avoid suicide. All her friends said she was anti-suicidal. We only realized she was taking anti-depressants the day of; when we found the bottle next to her body. She had been taking them for a month and a half; late November. Her friends knew. They told us that Aggie said the anti-depressants weren't working anymore but she didn't want to switch because of the initial cycles of the drug made her sick.

I want to say that the anti-depressants caused the death of my little sister but I know there is more to that. I discovered through chat conversations that she had been depressed for quite some time. But we never knew. She had a previous case of depression when she was 14 but things got better and better for her. She was more physically active, outgoing, and started making more friends. I just don't know how it got so bad without anyone noticing.  I keep thinking to myself, if only she told us, if only she showed us some signs of depression we could have been able to help her.  She didn't.  I believe it was because she didn't want to burden us, didn't want to let us down, didn't want to be monitored and treated differently.  But without us knowing, we were never able to help.  Every day was a normal day, for us.  If you have depression, please talk to some one about it.  Don't think that you will burden them by bringing it up. People are generally kind hearted, they will help if you seek it out.  If you really can't talk to anyone, please excercise regularly.  Find a hobby or a sport, something that is completely out of your normal routine and persue it.  That's what my little sister did.  She of all people started taking Kickboxing, Jujitsu, public speaking classes and she seemed much better during this time.  It was when it all stopped during the holidays.   

People with depression, past and present, can you tell me what it was like? Were you able to talk to family about it? Did you keep it a secret? Did the anti-depressants cause an increase in suicidal thoughts? What happens when you the anti-depressants suddenly stop working?  

I posted the entire sequence of events leading up to when we found my little sister in the bathtub that night in the link below.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life. She lies to their faces in front of me, and I have to get lectured every time I see them about something stupid my mom told them I did.

1363038014.0,45,self.SuicideWatch,1a3u23,State of SW: The mod team needs your input!,50,5,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1a3u23/state_of_sw_the_mod_team_needs_your_input/,"As there have been more posts lately about how the subreddit is being run and about what changes should be made, we’ve decided that it would be a good time to discuss what *we're* discussing and get some feedback. This is going to cover a lot of varied topics, including some potential changes, and an opportunity for random suggestions to be made. 

Before we get to the fun stuff - a few reminders. 

**Reminder One** 

We are **not** a hotline and cannot guarentee an answer to every post or a timely response. Sometimes it gets quiet here, sometimes a post gets buried, and sometimes we mods have to sleep. (We're working on fixing the sleep bug so that it will no longer interrupt our work. Bear with us.) 

**Reminder Two** 

Moving discussions to pm is not something we recommend for multiple reasons. We have a lot of lurkers here that read what others post and are helped by replies to things they haven't posted. In addition, keeping things out in the open so to speak gives others a chance to chime in, to see new points of view that may help them, and takes the pressure off of people trying to help. *Even the professionals at suicide hotlines do not handle phone calls by themselves. They always have someone there to support them and offer input.* 

**Reminder Three** 

Please read the sidebar before you post. It has all sorts of cool stuff in it, and we've worked really hard on it. A lot of the things that we have to remove could stay up if the poster had read the rules and made a few small changes. 

**CHANGES WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

Right now we are talking about how we can improve the subreddit and take advantage of some of reddit’s cool features. We would love to know what you think/if you have any ideas about how we can do this. 

1. Flair. We're talking about it. What kind of flair would *you* find helpful? What would be unhelpful? Do we need flair at all? 

2. Self-posts only. We're considering turning the community into a self-post only subreddit. Links would still be allowed - BUT they would have to be in a self post with text accompanying them that explains the link. Things like 'Click here' wouldn't count, but explaining why you found it helpful and then linking would be. What do you all think? 


3. As you may know, reddit is now using wiki pages. What sort of things do you think would be helpful on ours? Do you have something cool we could use? 

**THINGS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WILL NOT BE DOING**

These are less fun, but we thought we would preemptively explain why some suggestions just aren't going to happen. 

The downvote button stays - we can't actually remove it, but we have the ability to hide if. However, it is very easy for people to get around this change and continue to downvote despite the change. If the admins give us a way to truly disable the button instead of hiding it, we will revisit this. 

We will not be setting up an IRC channel, a message board, a chat room, or anything of the sort. We've got our hands full here, and don't have the ability or the time to moderate them properly. Any such thing that shows up is going to have no moderation or an entirely different mod team - please keep that in mind if you find one and decide to visit it. 


**YOUR TURN!**

Now that all of the serious stuff is out of the way - what do you want to see in this community? Is there a change that you think would be good to make? Do you have a suggestion? Now is a great time to let us know!

( I remember the exact day and hour, but rather not be too specific)
We were driving. or, I was. Winter conditions. Not entirely sure what exactly happened as my mind has blocked out most of it. I keep remembering trying to avoid something and running off the road. Crashing, it all goes black. I awake to this crushed and indescrible feeling. My head is facing towards the passenger seat where my friend. My only friend ever. My best friend. The guy who saved me from my own hell of a tremendously horrible home situation and school.. Had no friends, picked on the entire first year because I was poor and filthy. Little I could do about it with a drunken father and mother. He and his family moved into town when in second grade. He didn't care about all that. Sat next to me. became my friend. And there I am, unable to move, unable to look away, forced to watch him die. listening to him beg me for help. See his eyes, his crystal blue eyes, close never to open again. fuck, I just have to close my eyes and I'm back there again. The rest is somewhat blurry as I fade in and out of consciousness. I get away with 7 broken ribs, most of them broken several places. some internal damage, collapsed lung, both legs in my right foot broken. and some more destruction. nothing of it hurts remotely as much as the memory. lost my liscens, as if I ever want to drive a car again. tried getting into prison. instead got a shrink to deal with my guilt and probation time. His parents tried to help. His father told me he forgave me, but he couldnt forget. They tried to help me in the rehabiliation time, but it got clear to all of us that they just couldnt bear to be around me. So I pushed them away, havent seen or talked to them for 19 months. 

Im done fooling myself that life is worth living. Im done trying to hang on for the sake of hanging on. Life holds nothing for me but pain and suffering. an endless and viscious circle that has left me a shattered and destroyed useless human being with no other desire than for everything to be done. Come new years eve Ill hang myself and finally do what everyone else has hoped I would do for several years.

Edit: I have no idea why I made this post, what I was hoping for. guess mostly someone to talk a bit with, get this off my chest to see. I mean, what do I have to lose, less than 2 weeks to live anyways. This whole experience is troubling. I dont kid myself into believing the internett is all warm and cuddly, but the harshness and cruelty Ive recieved in these short few hours has actually made me wonder why Im even waiting until new years eve. still, thanks to those of you who tried. Im not good at accepting help, I know that. its not something I understand completely as Ive never experienced kindness other than from my friend.

She has been in the hospital since then in ICU and was recently put in a private room. So she lived, and she's speaking and sitting up in bed. She's alive, which is all I prayed for.

Unfortunately, she sent her suicide note to me via text message. I called her immediately to try to talk her out of it, of course, got no answer, called 911. This has irrevocably linked me with her officially. The cops showed up at work the next day and *tried to suggest evidence of a sexual relationship between me and the girl*. (The girl was sixteen at the time, now seventeen. I'm fifty.) The girl and I were close friends at work--I was a father figure to her, had lunch with her, had coffee, tried to counsel her. Predictably, her occasional response was ""you sound just like my mother"" before storming off in a huff. I counselled her not to get involved with the guy who eventually became her boyfriend. He's 24 and she was 16 at the time. That means statutory rape for him, if they catch him.

I have lost friends at work over this, because the cops came to my workplace to interview me. None of the female staff members will talk to me, because they assume I was sleeping with this girl.

Today, I tried to visit the hospital to give the girl a handwritten get-well card. I was told that she did not want to see me. I assume she has heard about the police and that I have become an ""embarrassment."" I was escorted out of the building and threatened with arrest if I returned. I am afraid and alone, more afraid than I have ever been in my life, and I have no one to confide in.

I am close to suicide. The girl is no longer in danger, but I have lost her, and furthermore feel as though I am about to be arrested for statutory rape myself (instead of the boyfriend, oh the irony). My job is shaky because I cannot concentrate at work. Nervous. Irritable. And I have lost a good friend.

I am scared. *Please help me.*

There's ALWAYS family or a friend or SOMEONE who will be crushed by what happened. Never commit suicide without talking to someone you're comfortable with and know very well because I guarantee that they will try to either talk you out of it, or tell you why you shouldn't. Suicide is such a horrible thing, for any reason or cause. Nobody deserves to take their own life. Things will get better, I promise.

I got the music picked out and I am loaded with T3's and Crown royal to make it painless. I have been watching this subreddit for some time now and just want to tell my story. 
My parents divorced when I was 3 in 1980. My grandparents moved in , dad got custody because my mother is a drug addict and a slut. My grandfather sexually molested me and used to beat the crap out of me. He did it to my dad too. In school I was bullied non stop , called a fag. I always had bruises, the teachers always looked the other way. When I came home it was more shit. At least the bullies didn't make me suck them off. 
When I escaped home at 17 and went to the city I got a job and got on with my life. When I turned of age, I went to the bar for the first time, and got hooked video poker. I had so many issues already and got hooked the first night. Gambling took away the pain. At least at first. I blew all my money and started stealing , mostly fraud. Ended up stealing over a million, but they could only prove a little bit and did a year in jail. Got out of jail with the addiction , met a girl got married, had a kid , and still couldn't beat the addiction. She ended up leaving me, I started frauding again and have warrants for my arrest. I also discovered at 34 years old I am a gay male. I tried so hard to keep it in the closet and hoped those feelings went away. All my so called friends would flip out. I really havn't come out to anyone, but have had sex with guys. I don't have a job , I can't pay the rent, I can't see my kid because I am $1000 behind on child support and I have had enough. I can't do it anymore. 

My last advice is please don't bully others. If you are a teacher please , if you see it happening , stop it. 
I have seen gambling ruin so many lives. It isn't worth it. Please world, why can't people just work hard ? Gambling is such a scam and reprogrammed my brain. I know others who have ended it because of gambling. Please world, just ban this gambling shit already. 

Please stop the homophobia. Some of us are gay.

Don't molest kids. You don't understand the damage it causes. 
Please , do something about starving people , it is 2012 and people are still dying from hunger while we all enjoy our luxuries in North America. 

I will not be responding to anything else for obvious reasons. In fact I won't even be able to read your comments.

I can't afford to go get help, no one will support me into going to get help. I WANT HELP, but I just can't get it.  I went to people I thought were going to be there for me, and they weren't. 

Reddit, the truth is.. No one will miss me. Not a single soul. There's no one in my life at the moment who I could even consider an associate, let alone a friend who will be there for me. 

My relationships with people are so destructive, I'm constantly yelling at people unable to control the anger, if not that I'm usually crying myself to sleep. No one wants to be around that, and everyone that was at one point has proven that and has left. 

My parents are out of the picture. They never cared, only memories I have as a child is being sworn at, hit, talked down to, etc. They never supported in anything. 

So reddit, I've come to my decision. I will be ending my life - and this may come as bad news to you, but please understand that this seriously is the ONLY WAY to silence my mind.

If we, the suffering, could form support groups—if we could create bonds forged and tempered by anguish—perhaps our weakness could be transmuted into strength. Having lost the will to live in this world, perhaps we can contribute to making something better. Having seen the ugliness, perhaps we can create beauty.

There is risk in this. There is a chance that rather than lifting ourselves up we may pull each other down.

There is also the risk that, in gathering vulnerable people together, some may try to exploit or manipulate them when they are at their most defenseless.

Unlike AA, however, it is my personal belief that those of us who have suffered the desperation that has driven us to confront the ultimate question of whether life is worth living should not meet with a sense of shame (or even humility) for our failure to adjust to the world as it is; but, rather, with a sense of pride in having the sensitivity and intelligence to question the purpose of a world of lonely striving, and, possibly, with the seed of an optimistic ambition that, in unity, we can find a better way of life for ourselves and each other.

**EDIT:** OK, while not unanimous, it's clear there is interest in this idea. 

Several people have brought up issues of liability, lack of professional accreditation, and the risks of failure and predation by trolls or cults.

I, of course, agree since I mentioned the risks in my original post. 

But I believe that despite the risks, and with AA's model as a reference to borrow from, the legal and moral dangers can be managed.

I also think the potential rewards far outweigh the risks.

(Perspective from a former suicide hotline counselor.),49,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b9x5a/dont_fucking_do_it_perspective_from_a_former/,"Here's the deal.  If you're contemplating suicide, and you're even reading this, you're one of the good ones, and the world needs you, and as painful as your existence may be, you have a shitload to offer the world, so do whatever you need to do to get through the night, and find some help tomorrow.

How do I know?

Because I was a counselor on a major suicide hotline for YEARS!  (I finally burned out due to the crazy but NON-suicidal callers, but that's another story.)

Here's the deal. I took calls from suicidal people for many years, and NOT ONCE did I think the world would be better if one of the folks I though was serious about it actually chose to end their lives.

No, I never had the pedophile call in, wondering if he should hang himself, rather than causing untold additional children untold additional pain.  I never had the serial killer call in, wondering if he should eat a bullet instead of killing another hooker.

No, I had the sad, lonely, and confused, all of whom were pretty fucking AWESOME (if temporarily sad, lonely and confused).

Depression IS a chronic illness.  You may be thinking, ""I'm not depressed, I'm just so fucking bored, and I'm over it.""

I know sport, that's HOW DEPRESSION FUCKING WORKS.  You may be one of the ones that thinks you're smarter than the therapists, so let me lay it out for you: here are the symptoms of Depression:

    *  difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions
    * fatigue and decreased energy
    * feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness
    * feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism
    * insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping
    * irritability, restlessness
    * loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable, including sex
    * overeating or appetite loss
    * persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that 
do not ease even with treatment
    * persistent sad, anxious, or ""empty"" feelings
    * thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts

(I would have thought it was obvious that I didn't make up this list myself, and cut and pasted it, but since I've been accused of plagiarism (instead of laziness) by one of the commenters, the above symptoms are courtesy of - http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression)

Any of those sound familiar?  Really?  Help IS out there, and the helpers AREN'T stupid, even if they DO work for nonprofit agencies (which may be contrary to your readings from Ayn Rand, etc.).  There are capable people and they can help.  It may take more than one or two meetings to find someone you can work with, but there is someone out there who can help you.

Honestly, depression IS the most treatable mental illness, and sadly, it's also the most fatal.

Don't be too proud to get help if you need it.  Once you get things sorted out, THEN you can get back on track and change the world.  You can't do jack shit if you're dead.

Please, if you've read this far, call 1-800-Suicide, or 211, or look at the list over to the right and call one of those numbers and get the help you need.  You're one of the good ones, we need you alive!

On top of that, my mother ""does not want me driving during Winters and snowstorms"", so obtaining my license is simply out of the question until Spring rolls around, it seems. In terms of work, even with odd-jobs or (for this time of the year) shoveling/snowblowing, there is absolutely nothing to be done in terms of a monetary income. But...that isn't what is bothering me. In fact, I have enough money to live off of for a short time.


What's bothering me is the fact that my mother has been mentally and emotionally abusing me in a number of ways recently and I have no way whatsoever to stop it. She is the type of person who will blatantly ignore you and talk over you if you are talking about a subject she does not want to talk about (ie: if I were to bring up the way she was treating me and how I feel, I would likely be abused some more and yelled at until I succumbed and dropped the subject). I've reached out to a few friends and family members I have but there is nothing they can do, as most live hundreds of miles away now. 

Not only am I abused, belittled, and disrespected, I am treated as though I am a child. 11 PM is ""lights out"", which basically means that she will come into my room and tell me how awful of a person I am and continue her relentless yelling and remarks regarding how useless I am until she either yanks the cords out of the back of my desktop or unhooks and hides the router. She has also threatened to put a hammer through my computer monitor on more than one occasion. I cater to this ""rule"" or ""curfew"" she has placed, but even 27mg of Melatonin hasn't made me tired; I toss and turn until about 3:00am every single night, with terrible thoughts..


..which is the worst part of it all - the unprovoked and uncontrollable suicidal thoughts I get, primarily regarding how easy it would be take another family member's rifle out of it's bad hiding spot and the ammunition out of the closet to end the suffering and torment that I have to deal with day in and day out. I honestly have no control over the thoughts or feelings, and that's what makes it scary, but I really do not think that I would act on them. My thoughts never involve harming her in any way whatsoever, just myself.


Somewhat unrelated to what is happening now, I have told her I had suicidal thoughts in the past, approximately a year-and-a-half ago. Her only response is, ""You wouldn't do it."" and then continued to watch TV while I sat at my laptop in tears.


I don't know why she is the way she is. I realize I do not have a job, but I have offered money to her to pay the bills; more than enough to cover a year's worth of all them. I do everything from shoveling, mowing, cleaning, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, making sure things are in proper working order, doing dishes, making dinner, taking care of errands, etc... The list goes on. It doesn't matter, though. None of it does, as she is unappreciative of everything I do. She will just yell more if these tasks go undone.

I originally came to SW as someone who wanted to see what it was to get into the rit and grit of helping people, see what it was like to help someone who was facing real life problems.

I talked to people, and eventually started to enjoy helping everyone in a safe area. I eventually came across [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oq1r7/debt_depression_and_downfall/) a couple of months ago.

I felt like I needed to help a person out when I had some to share, I'm not sure if he is better now, as the last post was some 3 months ago.

But as times change, so did mine, I feel into depression as I moved inter-state to leave my whole life for another. I thought of suicide often, not as a way out but more of a easier solution than fighting for what I wanted.

In the meantime I had been told by people to stop what I was doing as it might do something bad, I was foolish and stopped.

So as the thoughts of depression and contemplating suicide flowed over me, I remembered of the place that I had given people support.

I came back on here not to long ago, and damn.. I nearly cried my eyes out as the genuineness and kindness that is displayed on these posts. This has given me hope when I needed it.

I decided to hit rock bottom. A bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigs in one night, fight club (kind of a woe-is-me amplifier for me), and a suicide note all typed up. I took a photo and went to sleep. 

I woke up the next day and...something clicked. I looked at the photo. I was disgusted. So I worked out and bought a book on programming (something I want to do but lacked the ambition). I cleaned the house. I applied for jobs, since I'm unemployed. 

Overall, productive. I decided to try again the next day. Working out hurt, but the endorphins just pumped me up. I did this for a week. I gave up smoking and drinking. 

4 days into it I seemingly came out of my funk. Now, 7 days later, I'm me again. My old self. Ambition just pouring out of me. Today I bought a pack of cigs and smoked one. It was awful, representing to me everything I've overcome. I gave the pack away. 

I'm back, dammit. I'm fucking back and it feels great! Nothing is stopping me now. I've thrown away the suicide note.

1287562376.0,41,self.SuicideWatch,dtqry,/r/SucideWatch - please convince me not to kill myself.,54,13,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dtqry/rsucidewatch_please_convince_me_not_to_kill_myself/,"I've been considering writing this for weeks, but it's a late night, I'm tired and I've considered what I'm going to say carefully. Here is an itemized list of why I am considering suicide as an option, as well as a little background.

**I have suffered from depression for years**. I have been depressed for as far as I remember, which probably puts it around 2002-2004. I have tried two different anti-depressants and was dissatisfied with the effects, as while people I know said I seemed happier, I didn't feel happier. I have also gone to therapy twice, but have felt it wildly ineffective, as I was 12 the first time I went, and the second time was earlier this year. I had just found a job and was quite excited about it, but more on that later.

**I can't forget anything**. I think of myself as a pretty nice guy, though I can be a total asshole, as well. For some reason, I can't remember any of the positive stuff that's happened to me, only the negative. I've also done some really bad shit in my life, in the name of puberty, that I'd like to forget, but can't. 

If you want to be objective, skip over this section. If you want to know the details, here they are: eight or nine years ago, I made out with my sister. In 2004, I molested my step-sister, though I doubt she remembers, as I haven't seen her since. Before you call the police, I was 14 at the time and would have fucked a table leg if I could have, and she was 11 or 12. Around 2002-2004 I also downloaded and watched and pleasured myself to child pornography, and I justified it to myself because I wanted to see kids closer to my own age in sexual situations.

I'm sure several people would want me to kill myself (or want to kill me themselves) based on this alone. I make no excuses today for any of these things happening, and I doubt anyone remembers. Still, I do.

**I really, really hate myself**. There is nothing about me that I really like. I grew up as the fat kid, and it doesn't take a scientist to figure out that all that teasing and name calling and generally hostility through 13 years of institutional study is going to emotionally cripple a person. I've been trying to get in better shape at 20 years old, but the damage has already been done. It's turned me into a cynical douchebag with no patience and anger issues.

**My life has no direction**. After high school I went to college for a year and a half before I dropped out/got kicked out. I didn't really care about any of my classes, so I was pretty much forced to take them. I left my university with a 0.89 GPA. I would (ironically) like to be a paramedic someday, but it seems so far away right now.

**I am pretty much unemployable**. I've been fired from every job I've ever had. In my entire working life I've probably only made $4000. I worked at a juice place in 2006 and was fired after a month for screwing up. In March, I worked at a hardware store and was fired after three weeks for dicking around. In May I worked at a clothing store and was fired after two months for unknown reasons. I recently tried to get a job at the radio station where I've volunteered for five years but they gave it to some jackoff who had only been there for two. Worse yet, my mother also lost her job (I live with my family) and so my sister has been using all her income to pay the bills (even though she only works at most 16 hours a week for minimum wage). *I have been unemployed for three months and I hate it*.

**I suck at being social**. If I could afford to do so, I would probably be an alcoholic. I have never had sex, I've never had a girlfriend, hell, I've never even been on a date. The only recurring social situation I face is playing Rock Band once a week at someone's house, which is the same thing we've done almost every week for two and a half years.

**I feel like nobody loves or respects me**. When I had the opportunity to do so, I bought my friends extravagant birthday gifts because I wanted to do something nice for them and got almost nothing in return. Specifically, after spending $180 collectively I received a $13 CD and $9 worth of energy drinks. The worst part is perhaps the utter indifference they felt - one person claims they didn't even want the game I gave them, yet they haven't tried to return it or trade it in. Another person sold off the more expensive of the two games I gave him two weeks after he got it. Both these people have revenue streams and can easily afford something in return. I am fully aware that this sounds really petty and that people have other shit going on, but at the end of the day I am left feeling nothing but taken advantage of.

The only thing I do with my family anymore is argue over the stupidest, most trivial things. I probably would have killed myself years ago if I wasn't so worried my mom would blame it on herself. My dad wouldn't care because they divorced when I was four and he moved to another country shortly thereafter. I haven't heard from him in two years. I hope he's dead.

**I have made several plans to kill myself**. I have a feeling this is the biggest risk factor. Not really any need to get into specifics unless someone wants to.

If you've made it this far, you have my respect, and I'm going to guess despite all this pathetic whining you still want to help me.

I know there's a lot of shit outlined that I have to deal with (it took me fifty minutes to write this post), and I'm not saying it's more important than anyone else here. Please help me, because I'm afraid one day soon I'll wake up at 1 PM, unemployed and depressed and unable to deal with the terrible act of existence.

I am 26 years old and have been looking for a job one and off since I was 19. I started going to college at 19 and that has been my primary focus. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school and only. So my Dad told me to focus on education and he would take care of the rest. I still tried to get a part time job in the mean time. I have had very few interviews and since going to school full time, my schedule wasn’t what many employers liked after a few years of this  I started to put in fewer and fewer applications figuring I’d not get hired. Fast forward to 24. I am almost done with school, so I start putting even more applications in, yet again I am met with even more rejection. I tell myself constantly not to give up that my time will come.  I finish up college at 25 and I prepare myself for the job hunt. This time I have an open schedule, I have a bachelor’s degree, that should show I wasn’t being lazy right? I was going to school I did something to occupy my time. After having 12 or so interviews since December, I am starting to hate myself more and more. Every time I put in an application I get this feeling of dread. I go to check on my applications and that doesn’t help, neither does not checking on my applications. I research interview questions, I always dress presentable. With each failure at finding a job I find myself wanting to just end it all. I don’t want to be a leach on society. I don’t want to end up having to live on food stamps or welfare. I want to work, I want to take care of myself. People say I am aiming too high because I have college education. I get rejected by even McDonalds. I APPLY EVERYWHERE!  I’d rather just die. I want to die. The rejection is getting to me.  I just can’t take it anymore and my brother mentioned he has a 9mm because I heard a funny noise one night sometimes I am tempted to look for it and just shoot myself. I fantasize about stabbing myself through the wrist when cooking meals.  I just can’t take it anymore. All I want is a job  and to be able to take care of myself in some way.  I am sorry if this makes  me look weak. I just have no idea of self worth anymore at all. I feel like a bum.

But I'm just so tired. 
I've contemplated it so many times and i'm slowly being pushed further and further to the brink.

Ultimately, i don't think i will do it, at least for now. 
I have a little sister, a grandmother, pets, and friends who i care about too much to leave.

But I don't know what else to do.
I'm just so tired.
I don't know where to go anymore in life.
I'm graduating and I'll be headed to prom soon, next year I'm off to a really great university. I have a pretty good life compared to a good amount of people, but most days I feel too sad and tired to get out of bed

I feel like I don't deserve to live here, that I'm just a waste of space and everything I do is awful. I have a wonderful group of friends and a great little sister but I can barely leave my room and when I'm outside I spend so much time in the bathroom just crying and trying to breathe

Every day I contemplate suicide. I have all of the materials ready whenever I choose to use them. I plan my steps out, where it will happen, how, what I will write as a note. I want this so badly it hurts but I care too much about some people and it's preventing me from ending my stupid life.

I don't know what's wrong with me, but whatever it is, I can't tell anybody because I don't want to place this burden on them (which is why I'm telling you guys)

I guess one question i have is, should I drop all ties? I don't know what else to do. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to hurt others with my death. Do I just hurt them enough for them to leave me, and then die alone without hurting anyone?

Another question I have is: what is wrong with me? I know my dad's decided to leave our family behind to live with his mom and sister's family instead. I know that my mother's a pretty emotionally abusive person, as is my grandfather. They've told me that I'm a waste of human life multiple times, but I guess as of these past few years everything's sort of piled up and I just don't know how to deal with it all anymore. 

My issue is that my life, while not ideal, is not as awful as a lot of other people, and yet that doesn't stop me from wanting to die. Why? Am I just selfish?

EDIT: Wow! I really didn't expect all of these answers! thank you so much, everybody. Just wanted to update everyone on stuff. So for a good amount of my life I've had problems with self harm. I'd scratch myself a lot and I had a pretty severe eating disorder due to a really intense coach and being called a fatass by my parents at a super young age. Today I actually made myself eat with people rather than hiding in the gym locker rooms and telling my friends I had too much homework. One thing that helped as much as these sweet messages was this guy at school. I was kind of minding my own business and I usually remember to smile so people don't feel all that worried over me, but this guy comes up to me and sits next to me for this movie we're about to watch and says:

""I know you're upset and you have a lot going on with you right now. Have some of my candy and don't be sad!"" 

I mean, I ended up not really eating the candy and telling him I was just tired, but I was so surprised to see someone that I'm not even all that close with come up to me because they saw through the shit I pull with people. It made me feel better.

I'm still in a really awful place at the moment. I had a moment of weakness and self-harmed and purged my lunch, which sucks. I also still really want to die, or just not really be here, but spending time with my sister and my cat definitely helps me ignore these feelings. 

So I guess for now, I'm still really messed up in the head for stupid reasons, I still want to die, but I know that as long as I have someone to care about, and as long as I think people might at least care a little about me, then I'll live. 

I'm scared of the day where I just stop caring about the people around me and go for it though. It's going to happen one day, maybe sooner then I think, because despite how much I care for some people, I still have this tired, empty feeling and it's killing me. I want to die so badly, but at least I know that for now, I'll suppress these urges. 

Thanks again for all the wonderful messages :3

I must have blacked out before I read anyone's comments from my original post, but I apparently slept until my residence hall's fire alarm went off, then I tried to get up and hit my nose on my desk chair and got a really bad nosebleed. They thought I had a concussion at first, I'm not sure exactly how they figured out it was a suicide attempt but I drank charcoal and was given an IV. 

All that happened while I was unconscious. The first thing I remember is waking up in the ICU and just barely being able to walk to the bathroom and shower. Spent the next four days there, then was transferred by cop car (in handcuffs, no less) to a psychiatric hospital three hours away because that was the only bed they could find. 

I spent about a week there, got a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and anxiety and a new cocktail of meds that I think will actually help me and actually learned a lot (note: if you ever end up in a psychiatric hospital, try and take notes for the group sessions. It helped me remember a lot of things I would have otherwise forgotten.) 

Spent the night at my cousin's house who coincidentally lived in the same city in which I was hospitalized. Had plans to take the train back to a town right outside my college's town the next morning, but my scumbag stomach was all, first train ride ever tomorrow? The stomach flu sounds like fun right about now. I decided to try and go anyway, so my cousin dropped me off on her way to work, but between being sick and anxious about being ""that passenger"" I kind of forgot to breathe; when I found out the train was delayed for like 12 hours and I'd basically be stuck in the station being sick all day I had the most debilitating panic attack ever. Oxygen had kind of stopped going to my arms and legs and they just became paralyzed, numb, and tingly. I felt it in my nose, too, and my vision started to cloud up. I seriously thought I was going to die. Never had anything like that happened to me before so I just screamed for help until someone realized there was an actual problem here. And that's how I ended up in the ER AGAIN for most of the day. I was able to catch the train back, though. That was last night.

Everything was going his way. Good school, Good girlfriend in general just Good. Thats what i thought because he portrayed it like that. What he showed us was amazing, even though that it was just a front, he was actually a tormented soul who kept his emotions trapped even though he always forced a smile on his face and thats what ill remember. He was battling some demons probably thinking no one would understand so he didn't tell anyone.. I wish he had told someone what he was going through, maybe he thought no one would care, but truthfully everyone would have helped, his death came as a surprise to everyone.. everyone i know is in disbelief his family, his friends all crushed by the news. I wish i had written this before so he could have seen.. but if this could help someone to re consider and consider that life is more valuable then death. 
 
So Please if you are having Suicidal thoughts or plan on attempting it please re consider there are so many people who care about you. Even if you feel that there isn't, and maybe your having problems, maybe life isn't going your way but just remember you can and you will get over your problems. Do something you love, go somewhere you haven't been, try something new. Live to Love.. Live to Laugh.. Live to Live.


If your having any thoughts off suicide please inbox me. If you feel no one cares trust me I care, I may not know you but i will listen and get to know you.

If this could make one person reconsider i'd be forever grateful, he'd be forever grateful.

1350424155.0,40,self.SuicideWatch,11ld0i,So a suicide hotline just hung up on me...,44,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/11ld0i/so_a_suicide_hotline_just_hung_up_on_me/,"I wish that was a joke. I can't help but recognize it's funny, anyway. I've been dealing with some form of depression/anxiety for six years now, and that was the first time I'd ever phoned a hotline. I phone a few. One I was on hold for sixteen minutes without getting through to anyone, the one that hung up on me lasted roughly 5 minutes without reaching anyone. Then the automated system hung up on me. 

Obviously, I'm not offended by an automated system, but you would hope that one used for the purposes of SUICIDE PREVENTION would not mess up in such a way as to cause negative feelings. 

Anyway. Why I called them: 
I've been living in a new city (ie. not my hometown) for a few years now. I became involved with various communities (I'm sorry for keeping this vague, but I have the worry that my family will somehow see this and try to call me. Bless them, but I can't stand talking about this to them.) but found my anxiety getting worse and worse. (As another sidenote, I've been told that I become very clinical when talking about my emotions, like I'm trying to divorce myself from them. Me typing this sort of proves that, I suppose.) 

I would be invited to things, and sit on my bed curled up unable to go. Then make up some vague excuse as to why I wasn't there. You can't just say ""oh, I'm sorry. I did want to go, but I'M SCARED OF PEOPLE."" It really doesn't make any sense to anyone but those who have social anxiety as well. So my anxiety has gotten worse and worse over the years, and that caused depression because I'm not able to interact with people in what I feel is a normal, proper way. I've been on anti-anxiety medication for about 2 years now, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. At least, until I go off them completely (as I have in the past) and start having real panic attacks. Then I go back on them. A fun cycle! 

So recently I had an interview with an agency that wants to represent me in the entertainment industry. I completely fucked up and showed up 20 minutes late, I got lost, took the wrong train, etc. They were very mad at me. They said they're reconsidering taking me on. Oh, and the more I talk with them the less I think I want to be there. They're asking for money that I simply don't have. I'm dirt-poor, working 2 part time jobs and living in a house with people that I don't know, although I guess they seem very nice. They just aren't for me. 

So I walked out of the meeting feeling like shit. This is it. I don't want to sign with them, they don't think they want me to sign me with. I'm so fed up. Tired of being jerked around (it took months of phone calls to get to this point with the agency). I'm not sure why I'm in this city.

Look, I realize that other people have far bigger problems. I can tell that just by skimming through this subreddit. But I'm hurting. I feel incredibly poor and alone. I don't want to go back to my hometown, and this feels like the only place for me. I want to improve my life, but can't figure out how or muster the energy to. I hate talking about this. I hate talking to my friends, because sooner or later I wind up talking about this. And I hate that. I hate how weak I am, and I hate myself. I wish I was happy, but I can't figure out how to do it. 

Even when good things happen to me, and they do, I can't feel happy. I recognize that I should be happy, but to be honest I just don't give a fuck. I don't know if I'm suicidal, I guess I am if I called the hotline and bothered to type out this huge fucking thing. I guess I have been since high school. I didn't even realize how depressed I was at the time, until recently when I've talked to people who knew me in high school. Anyway, I had this plan that by the time I was 32, if I couldn't look back on my life and think of a sustained period of feeling happy, then I was perfectly within my right to kill myself. I'd tried, right? Given it a long go. Well, I'm still a ways off from 32, but it's harder ever year to even make it that long.

Depression.

That's a taboo word these days, isn't it?

""Depressed? What do you have to be depressed about?""

It seems like everybody knows your depression better than you do, doesn't it? Which is weird. The word depression induces an awkwardness as if it's an indelible mark of shame on your reputation as a person, much akin to wearing a post-it note from your mom everywhere you go that says ""I'm glad you stopped wetting the bed."" 

It's difficult to get rid of it. It's difficult to be happy about it. It's like part of you that's unrelenting and, like cancer, could sprout up against. And you become afraid of it. Afraid that you might relapse. That you might...somehow be weak enough for it to conquer you once more. 

Personally, I'm not afraid. Rather, I embrace it. Depression to me isn't a fever that consumes me anymore, but a tickling of the ribs. It makes me laugh. **My depression** makes me laugh. Don't confuse that with your depression. I own my depression, and I'm proud to acknowledge it. Why? Because I've passed it. I've reached over to my depression, gave it a hard look, and laughed at it. As if it meant held little power. And it does hold little power. So when you talk about depression, don't forgo the thought of discussion your own. Because it's part of you. It's made you stronger. When you know extreme sadness, then happiness is bliss. And when you know bliss, there's absolutely no reason to ever get familiar with extreme sadness ever again.

So. Feel proud of your depression. Feel proud that you've conquered something to massive and internal. Feel proud to tell others that you suffered through it. And even if they don't understand in the same way that us SuicideWatchers do, feel proud that you were able to admit to it. Live through it. And come out much more stronger than you entered it. 

You're all amazing people. It's a damn fine thing that nobody goes through the same unique situation. Because when you come out, you're unique. That's right. You are unique. Cherish that though. Be proud of yourself. ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_y2wzl,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/y2wzl/im_relatively_new_here_but_ive_seen_enough_for_a/,

Nothing has changed and none of my very basic goals have been met. I've made my way from Georgia to Washington in the span of 13 years. All I have to show for it is being burned out in every way possible. I hate interacting with people, I hate moving around. I'm sick of being kicked out of place after place because it's impossible to keep a job in the economy without a degree. I hate being told a new reason why I can't, every time I try to advance my life. I hate being in this world alone. I can't even afford to go visit my Dad's gravestone. I hate how every time I sit down and make a plan to better my life it doesn't work out. I now know that it's impossible to make life better. The next sack of shit that tells me that things will get better will be punched in the face by me. I'm sick of the bullshit lies that therapist tell you. I'm sick of the lack of understanding people have too. I know after I kill myself no one will still get it. I just want to leave the world. I'm over it and my willing to want to live has died off a long time ago. 

I don't even know why I posted this here. I've read some of the other responses in this thread. It's all just clichés and pseudo intellectual tripe.

There is no future for me. I'm so damaged now I won't be able to pass another job interview. I have no social skills left. I'm burned out. I do not want to end up homeless another winter.

And I will, but first a few ground rules. 

1. I have disorganized schizophrenia. My post may wander all over the place, breaking the rules of time and space and handing out medical metaphors that are true, except when taken as a suppository.

2. That's not a promise. I was also once a writer and I can still assemble something like a working awareness of my audience. 

3. That awareness doesn't make me a fucking liar. I can be honest and yet also make an effort to improve your reading experience. 

So, if you've made past all the hostility, cheers. You are determined. Pull up a seat, take a drink, and allow me to tell you why I hate you. 

Yes, you. 

You see, I want to be you. 

If I can be honest? I think I'm a little bit in love with you. 

You're everything I've ever wanted to be. 

You doubt I'm talking to you. Maybe you're wondering how long it will take me to prove I can't possibly mean that I admire and wish I were you.

Tell me this - 

Can you organize your room? Can you follow the plot of a Friday the 13th movie without needing to read subtext into which disposable character is which? Do your wildest, most optimistic plans for the future include being able to find your way back home without getting lost if you take more than one turn?

But hey, if that was my only problem, you'd probably believe me. Why wouldn't you? Who'd boast about something like that?

When was the last time you ran away in horror from an orgasm? How far did you get before you collapsed, unable to move? How many hours did you spend crying afterwords, certain that feeling any comfort from the woman who tracked you down and just held you made you a sexual predator?

Oh, apologies, did I say that I ran from ""an orgasm""? I meant the word ""orgasm."" 

Sorry about that. 

So yeah, I have unusual issues about sex on top of the disorganized schizophenia, which itself a rare disease.  It's really hard to understand why I have them, since after all, I'm a heterosexual male. 

Society rewards us for being shameless sex seekers, doesn't it? 

So I'm probably lying and just want to get laid. 

No, seriously, that's where I begin losing people. Who'd believe there is a straight male who is terrified of sex...literally terrified...

Well, heterosexual sex, anyways. 

At least if the guy initiates it. Or thinks about initiating it. Or thinks about sex with someone who hasn't given permission for him to think about it and spelled out, in detail, how to do so.

Because that's a kind of rape, isn't it? The image of them you create in your mind can't meaningfully consent in any way. She will do whatever you ask her to, an image of the one you're attracted to, behaving like your personal sex slave.

I don't know how anyone can possibly not be disgusted with that, but to each their own. 

By the way, I'm a radfem. I'm trying to not hate all men, but it's so very, very, hard. 

At least all straight men. 

So, here we are, and I'm a self-loathing heterophobe. 

Chances are, you're not that kind of worthless hypocrite. Chances are, you face human sexuality with dignity and grace...just kidding. I'm sure you have horror stories. But you handle it better than me. And despite it, you still like humanity enough to prevent suicides. 

So, kudos. 

You're a hero to someone. 

And that, of course, is why I hate you. 

Because I will never, ever be you. 

Know what happened when I finally came out of the pretending to be asexual closet about my sexuality? 

I was told there was no closet. 

I was told I was a liar about ever being in the closet. 

I was told I'm not afraid. 

I was told I'm mocking people who struggle with phobias. 

I was told I was hilarious. 

That was on r/ainbow. In an unrelated thread where I was trying to relate to a gay man with transphobia, to help him over come his fears. It was an upvoted post, until someone decided to be a dick about the word ""heterophobia.""

Apparently, an unreasonable hatred of straight men and a terror of ever expressing my sexuality in any offline context doesn't technically count as heterophobia. 

Also, heterophobia doesn't exist anywhere except in my diseased mind, because the christian faith is all about sex positive reinforcement, especially in conservative American small towns, and anyways, no mental health professional ever would tell me my fear is a gift from God or that I don't need to worry about my fears because ""it's not important"" and ""why would it ever come up?"" with the unspoken implication that no woman on the planet would ever want to fuck someone as fucked up as me. 

Thing of it is, and I can understand r/ainbow not believing on this one - maybe r/suicidewatch will agree with them on this...

A lot of women tell me they want to fuck me. A lot lot. 

I'm a guy who can male bash, won't reduce any woman to a sex object, and I admire women who are honest and express their sexuality in a positive way. I also jump a mile into the sky when they do so and try to play dead in the crater when I land. 

Can you imagine how many women abuse their newfound superpowers for evil? I mean good. They assure me of this! Know how you conquer a phobia? By habitation. Everything they do, from demands for cyber and phone sex to ordering me to masturbate to their bodies is just in the name of science! I mean helping! 

So yeah, there may be a great deal of enthusiasm there. My phobia might be an issue sometimes. 

I mean, no offense to the internet, but all the cyber and skyping in the world is no preparation for offline. And love. And all the women I hurt, by being afraid of their greatest gift to me...offering me themselves.

They never offer again. The fear of sex claims another victim. And so it spreads...

I watch the ones I love torture themselves for offering me love. 

So, have we clearly established why I'd want to kill myself yet? 

No, I guess not. 

I mean, just because I'm mentally ill with an exotic disease I've not given near enough details about to properly scare you with, and I can't figure out how to establish that my disease is one with no happy endings...

And just because I'm so terrified of sex that even thinking an impure thought about the word ""orgasm"" is enough to trigger a reaction more appropriate for a returning soldier...

And all my friends with a sex phobia cured theirs by being women who wanted sex bad enough not to say ""no"" when people begged them for it. They're in loving relationships right now, so don't even think about making the obvious suggestion.

Know the worst part of all this? Not the literal worst part. More an ironic final note on it. 

I sound like an MRA and a forever alone. 

And I have no way to end this, that will provide any kind of closure. In my mind, my inner attorneys and I are still writing up a legal document to all possible responses and objections to all this...

I'm sick of defending myself. I'm sick of being forced to jump through hoops over and over again just to prove I'm in pain far and above what most people will ever experience...and others experience every day. 

And I'm sick of at the end of it all, the answer is always either ""It gets better! Good luck!"" or ""I don't believe you. Do you think we're fucking idiots?""  

So, that's who I am. We haven't established yet why you can't help, but this is running long, and I am enough of a host to spare you a novel's worth of answers I've already been given that just didn't work...

Or made things worse.

My uncle had died and I was needed at his house immediately. I was at his house before the news hit me, as I approached the front door what I saw forced me to confront reality. I stepped over a grey, white and mostly red sticky mess of what had once been the brain of a man I'd grown up loving. He'd climbed to the roof of his home and shot himself in the head, what I saw were the pieces of him that trickled down to the porch in front of the front door of his home. Ten years later I can still close my eyes and call this moment in vivid detail to mind. I was irrevocably changed that day.

He was 40 years old. His daughters were 18 and 15, both very much caught up in the drama of their teenage years and both forever wondering if the wisdom they have now could have saved their father then. He left behind a wife who I have not seen sober since that day; she's remarried to another alcoholic and the two of them are slowly pickling. He left behind five siblings, who'd grown to count on him to be there for them in their troubles, even though he never seemed to want something in return. He left behind two parents, who absorbed the situation with the same quiet stoicism that has guided them through the many other traumas that life has left at their doorstep. He left behind countless customers, friends, acquaintances, employees, cousins, and strangers who were baffled. 

He was a rock in our family, someone who we could always count on, who never seemed to need anything. If he had asked, I would have given him anything in my power. He never asked. He found himself lost with literally hundreds of people around him who would have happily helped guide him home, or more accurately do whatever was in their power to help keep him safe and happy until he could find his own way home. 

Ten years later so much has changed. One of his daughters is married, both have children of their own, that he would be pretty proud to know. They have left behind the arrogance of their teenage years and blossomed into adults. They have their troubles and flaws, but I know my uncle would have been proud of the women they've become. The home he built with his own two hands has become a living shrine to his memory. A place we all gather for events we wish he could be here to see; birthdays, meals, laughter, pain, and just moments of every day life. He would have been fifty earlier this year. We threw him a birthday party just because none of us wanted to sit at home and think about the celebration that should have been. So instead we got together and celebrated what was. 

I cannot judge him for the decision he made. I wish I had the chance to talk him out of it and I really think he missed a lot of joy these past ten years, but ultimately the decision was his. Today I wanted to tell his story and hope that our family's pain prevents another family from sharing the same pain. If you find yourself thinking that there is only one way out, please reach out. If you won't do it for you, please do it for the person you are going to leave behind who would give anything to have been there for you that night.

I learned of SW today, and I wanted to write here to get to anonymously talk about something I have never told anyone before.

I am a 26 year old male, but ever since I was 11 years old I have wished I was female. I am a medical doctor working at the Psychiatric Clinic of a medium-sized hospital. It is an understatement to say that I am the wrong person in the wrong place.

I have always been very unhappy with who I am, and at 19 years of age I made my first suicide attempt by taking benzodiazepines (and um, perhaps for information: it is practically impossible to commit suicide by taking benzodiazepines, their toxicity is just too low. They remain a common method of attempt, however, due to their availability and because of tradition, and I had not yet studied much medicine back then.) Ever since, I have wished for my life to end, and for many years now my going to bed ritual involves praying that I will not wake up.

So how does it work treating others for mental disorders and suicidal behavior when you're ill yourself? The answer is not well. I will look at my patient as she describes her symptoms, smiling and nodding to encourage her and show that I am paying attention, while in my head I will think ""I would do anything to be you, please stop complaining."" After every patient visit I will lock myself into one of the bathrooms and run my hands under cold water, telling myself ""you will make it through the rest of this day."" I will suggest different treatment regimes based on what symptoms my patients present and what medications they have tried, and I will assure them ""I know it is hard now, but as soon as we have chiseled out the optimal therapy you won't have to suffer these suicidal thoughts anymore."" While in reality I just want to say ""how can your suicidal thoughts torture you so? I consider them a comfort, a reassurance that I won't have to continue living."" When I meet patients with cancer and other terminal diseases, I find myself envying them, wishing I can put my hands on them, magically absorbing their illness so that they can be well, and I will have a countdown until I won't have to live.

I realize how this sounds, and that you are probably now thinking that I may be the worst doctor in the world. And this most certainly is not what an ideal doctor should be like. I would like it noted that despite these confessions, I have always done my best, and I have helped many, as evidenced by gifts I've received from content patients.

So, now my vacation is coming up, and I am making plans to end my life at the end of it. I have made my family proud, I have managed to work for about a year, and thus I think I have earned not having to continue on. I will spend time with my mother and my brother, and try to express to them how much I love them so that they will not think it is their fault when they find out later. Since I am a no-lifer I have not spent any of the money I earned, so I will transfer it all to them. I understand it does not in any way compensate for their loss, but it will perhaps help and show them that I do not blame them, and love them.

Thank you for listening, and giving me this opportunity to tell someone something about myself that I have never done before.

I know how hard it is to ask for help, especially from people you know, and in my darker times, I know I now have a place to go when I feel hopeless. You all deserve all the karma, Reddit-wise and in the universal sense, the world can give you.

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I have experienced the loss of four people I have known peripherally over the past two years. All of them are transgender, and I know that their pain lay beyond simply situational depression. They could never just wake up and feel better one day, their entire lives and identities were sources of stress for them. This happens a lot, and I selfishly thank the universe that it hasn't been to someone I am terribly close to, but I still see how suicide has affected people I love. It absolutely destroys people, especially folks who were close to more than one of the four people I have spoken about. Yesterday, I awoke to the news that yet another member of our community committed suicide, and everyone is shaken up and numb because of it.

Unsure if it was related or not, but I found the following article:
http://www.xojane.com/issues/dont-kill-yourself-your-dentist-will-miss-you
Between that, and the way my friends feel about losing their loved ones, I realized that no amount of pain or suffering I'm going through right now would compare to the pain or suffering people would experience if I weren't here anymore. EVERYONE will miss you, even the people you think won't miss you. I highly recommend that everyone read this. If I hadn't read that article, if I hadn't witnessed what my friends and chosen family are dealing with right now, I would have stepped in front of a 2 train last night. I was ready, I was done, and then I took a bit more time to think.

I've been incredibly depressed, being essentially homeless and with pennies to my name since I got laid off from my job back in March. It feels hopeless every day I spend hours applying for jobs, only to never get a call back. I give up a lot of the time, and spend a lot of days just sleeping because it doesn't hurt so much. I don't have enough money to buy food or do my laundry, so taking care of my basic needs has been difficult. I've considered a lot of ways to die, just so it would be over with. I'm still not completely out of the woods yet, but I made a list of reasons why killing myself would be a worse option, and it's helping. I just look at it to remind myself why living is worth it.

I guess I just want to send my love and support to everyone else going through this right now. I know it's tough, I know it's difficult to pull yourself up sometimes, but know that someone DOES care about you. There ARE other options out there. You will be missed when you're gone, we need you here to keep the world as beautiful as it is.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_1g5t9d,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1g5t9d/why_i_decided_not_to_die_yesterday/,

It all started 3 years ago, when I was seriously struggling with school. I couldn't talk to anybody. I lost all my trust in people. I didn't have anything to live for. I don't really have an amazing home life. I don't trust my mum. My dad left when I was 7, he turned out to be a liar and a cheat. My mum laughs at me whenever I'm in pain, or in tears. You would think all mums are like that but not like mine. Once, she stood and laughed as I choked on my sick. It was horrible.

I always hide myself in the room, just because I'm scared to face my mum. Ever since she has a boyfriend, her personalities start to change so much. It was from loving to really sarcastic. I HATE sarcastic people. My brother, who's 19 now, is such an arsehole. He threatens to kill me if I tell my mum anything! He had me up the wall by my throat and I got scared of him.

Now that he left for University, I was SO happy. I finally had freedom, until my 19 year old cousin started to be on top of everyone's priority list. She was suicidal, just because her boyfriend left her. Everyone started to get bored of her when she ""overdosed"" and ""slit her wrists"" where she has no evidence of.

3 years ago, I started slitting my wrists because I felt as though if I wasn't on earth, everybody wouldn't even notice me. It sounds as though I want attention, but I ABSOLUTELY HATE ATTENTION. Then 2 years ago, I stopped eating. I was so weak and my mum didn't care.

I tried to kill myself last 2 years in November, I overdosed on painkillers, fainted and fell in the bath of hot water. My mum stood and laughed. I hated the fact that it woke me up, I wish, EVERYDAY, that I actually died on the spot.

When I was 6/7, I was sexually abused by a 14 year old. But I can't remember his name, or his whereabouts. I only have nightmares around June/July time, as that's when he did it. I remember his eyes and his inane grin. I can't ignore that face.

This year, I was FORCED to go sixth form college when I wanted to live with my dad and go to another college, I wasn't allowed. Now, I'm getting forced to go to university. I feel as though I have too much pressure put on top of me.

Recently, 4 people I adored have died within the 2 years and left me completely heartbroken and guilty that I haven't had seen them as much as I truly wanted to. :(

My love life was SO bad few years ago. I only have 2 ex boyfriends, they dumped me, basically because I was fat. I currently have a boyfriend but I'm very paranoid, I feel as though I need to be with him all the time.

At the moment, I'm addicted to self harming and I tend to do it when I come home from school, and I basically cry myself to sleep EVERY night.

You would tell me to try and talk to my family, I can't. They laugh anyway.. even if there's teardrops running down my face. Or maybe talk to my friends. I also can't. They wouldn't keep it to themselves, no matter how many times I beg them to. They tend to spread it all over the town. I can't talk to anybody at school because my mum works at my school and the teachers will tell my mum anything.

I would like some advice please, I'm getting more depressed everyday. :(",,False,,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,t3_f42mm,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f42mm/i_cant_stop_crying/,

The world is an amazing, brilliant and lovely place. With love and passion and beauty. Between imaginary friends, love songs and fictional best friends, real friends, family, your dog [who you know is the best dog in the whole world] everything is amazing. Your country, foreign countries, languages and cultures and flowers, trees, books, video games and computer circuits.

I love you. Yes, you reading this. *hugs* I love you. And you, and you, and you. Because you're a person, you deserve it. And I'm right here. Me, my imaginary friends, the way I pick up British accents, listen to anime soundtracks and fall in love with fictional people. I'm right here.

And there are tons of other people who love you too. Just look at SW and what we do here. How we care, how we love.

Then there's you. You who reads with a flashlight under the covers even if you're 20, who loves the smell of flowers in spring, whose favourite thing in the whole wide world is a shiny rock you found as a kid. Who feels lost and hurt and afraid... hugs Don't be. I know it isn't that easy, I know- but try to smile. It'll be alright. The world is beautiful... for every ounce of pain, there's someone there with a bandage and a hug. With hot chocolate, extra little marshmellows, and the whole of series one and two of Doctor Who.

And a few nice links ^^ ""I love the whole world"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdaLfJjDuE&amp;feature=related

And with XKCD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAasManZ6IA

Love the world. Live and smile... because of happy things, lovely things. The apartment you want with nothing but mattresses for the floor, the midnight dances in the rain, Diablo III coming out... the stars in the sky, the random people on the interwebs, cats with captions, and candy.

Because the pain isn't forever. I was in hell, I'm still scrambling out of it... but I love the world. I love people, and 50s songs and the way that I cry at sad endings to anime.

So hold on as tight as you can to your happiness. Hang onto your book collection, your garden, your level 96 mage. To what makes you smile and makes you laugh... and to your dreams, your future and your life.

I didn't know him well, but he had a huge impact on my skills and thought processes as a fighter. I am forever grateful for his help and only wish I had expressed that gratefulness to him better. He reminded me a lot of the Coach in The Power of One. 

I'm posting this here because my coach never let on that he was hurting or in need of help. He kept to himself and in the end, he left so many people behind who cared about him. Please, if you are having dark feelings, even if you're not going to go through with them, tell someone! Even someone you don't know very well. You touch the lives of others on a daily basis, just like my Coach touched mine.

If you're in a good situation mentally, but you think you might know someone who's not, talk to them. And most importantly, follow through and check up later. Too often, the best listeners in life just move on and we are left to muddle through alone.

My life is worth nothing.,49,10,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15j28n/ive_heard_everything_my_parents_had_to_say_about/,"My parents and I have had a rough year. I went back to working for my step-dad, who is an attorney with a failing business. He doesn't care about the business anymore, and I've pretty much been running it by myself for several months. It's a heavy load, especially since his last 2 paralegals were caught in lying, theft, and fraud and fled before they could get in trouble. The majority of the clients refuse to pay their fees, and either move, change their numbers, or go ""missing"" to avoid bill payment. This has become shockingly common. Regardless of my efforts, I am yelled at when things go wrong. I am also owed over five thousand dollars. And no I did not mistype that. 

I was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and have a load of other health issues. I have medicine I take every day so I won't experience severe pains. On Christmas Day, my parents accepted that I am agnostic (I never even said I was nor hinted at it), and told me that they will never help me with future medical expenses. Like being agnostic is the worse thing I can be... like it makes me a rapist, a kidnapper, a murder. 

They told me I should get a second job and pay for everything myself. I cannot around here. I have tried. Almost every place I've been knows of my dad and his family and either a. assumes we're rich and thinks it's a joke that I am applying for work or b. hates my dad or someone in his family, so they automatically hate me, too.

This morning, my mother lost her shit over a missing receipt. One of her xmas gifts was a fancy dress shirt, and she doesn't like it and wants to exchange it. The day after it was purchased, I asked dad where the receipt was. He said he had it, so I didn't worry about it. Mom had admitted that he has become forgetful with age, but that wasn't the case today. She held onto every word he said about me. He has never liked me, because I am not like his brother's daughters: Blonde, thin, cheerlearders, loved by all, hated by none, that sort of type. But I digress. At one point I went into the restroom, and they thought I was in my room as resumed talking at a normal level. I was called a liar, failure, useless, bitch, devil worshiper, whore, ""far from normal"", and other things. 

That's odd, because dad isn't normal, either. It's not normal to send a woman in Romania that does cam shows thousands of dollars you borrowed from someone else. It's not normal to send her hundreds of dollars worth of lingerie every month. It's not normal to have over 300gigs of porn. It's not normal to spend more money on a stranger than your wife who is studying at an expensive school.  

But after hearing what they said, I wanted to die. I've contemplated suicide for months. But this sort of sealed the deal.

My boyfriend offered to get an apartment for us as soon as he could, but I'm worried I will be a burden to him. I'm almost completely broke. I had money before the holidays, but used it to buy gifts. I have nothing saved because I was previously in an abusive relationship that I escaped from earlier this year (totally different story). But I don't feel like I can keep going. I've resorted to self harm. I do not want to eat. I cannot sleep without having nightmares. And the horrible clients that cuss me out, point knives at me, threaten to follow me home and kill me, are starting to give me panic attacks. And no, my dad does not believe a single word I say. 

I want to die tonight, and escape the after xmas family get together that will take place tomorrow night. My parents clearly think nothing of me, and I do not want to be a burden to my boyfriend. I don't want to be a waste of space, and I don't want to be a leech while looking for a job where he lives. He is too patient and kind. He deserves better. 

EDIT: Probably worth mentioning that I'm unreasonably upset due to my abusive ex sending me messages that make me sound like a whore that ruined his life on top of it all. I know what he's saying is bullshit, and I shouldn't read anything, but I've been archiving everything he sends just in case I need it one day (like for a restraining order or no contact order). Once that calms down a little I'll be in a slightly better state of mind. His messages have been coming in random waves, and he'll probably get quiet after New Year's Day. 

EDIT II: If discussions on religious beliefs, or a lack of, are to continue, please please PLEASE continue them via private messaging. One reason I want to get away from my parents is to avoid such debates no matter which religion they are dedicated to. They are not currently of comfort to read, and I am now deeply regretting mentioning my beliefs at all.

I couldn't promise not to do it because it was the only possible solution to my pain. So we agreed that I would show up the morning after at the swimming pool where we meet before going to work. then the following days,  I did other short-time promises and went to see a doc.

Lord knows there are so many subreddits, and... well, sorry if I'm in the wrong place.

I think about suicide.  Quite a bit.  I don't seriously plan it or anything, but it's always there.  I'm pretty sure something's wrong with me.  I've thought about it since I was maybe 12 or so, and I'm 26 right now.  Sometimes it'll be little things that get me to think about it, other times things will be fine and I'll think, ""I wonder if things would be better if I just... weren't around anymore?""

I have my fair share of problems.  My right leg barely works, my spine is degenerating from scoliosis, and my doctor says I have the worst case of spastic colon he's ever known.  I recently moved out of a house that got broken into a fair few times, and while I'm happy that I'm in a safer place, I'm still bitter about it.  It... changed me.  My soul became a little bit darker (pardon the cheesy line).

I've recently been denied SSI.  They said my problems weren't severe enough to warrant it.  Maybe it's because I've never had a job.  But you don't need to jump off a skyscraper to know you can't fly...  Right?  My future looks bleak.  I currently live with my mother (yes, I'm one of THOSE kinds of people), and she pays for everything, since I have no income of my own.  It makes me feel bad, but what can I do?

But her health is failing, I think.  She's sick a lot, doesn't get out much, and she's lost weight.  She's getting on in the years.  And she's practically the only thing I have.  We're very close, and I don't have a great deal of friends.  I've never known my father, and don't have any close family on her side.  And if she... passes... I'm up shit creek financially.

I think about what I'd do without her, and the only thing I can think of is that I'll probably just kill myself when she dies.  Who knows, maybe things will have changed for me then.  Maybe I'll be a tougher person.  Maybe I'll be better set for life.

I have a few good friends, but it's not really the touchy-feely kind of friendship.  I feel uncomfortable and awkward opening up to them, and they feel the same trying to comfort me.  I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff but her, and... how can you talk to someone about what you'll do when they die?

It feels like life doesn't really want me to be happy.  My brain doesn't either.  Even when life didn't seem too bad, I was still sad.  Like I said, maybe something's wrong with me.  And now most days when I'm alone I just cry.

This isn't an ""I'm gonna kill myself"" post.  More like a ""Life really kinda sucks and I dunno where to go about it"" kind of thing.  The thought's there, but...  Fuck.  I don't know.

If nobody reads this, I'll understand.  Same thing if people read it but don't pay attention or reply.  After all, I'm just another username on the internet.  I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest, and I do feel a little better typing it up.

Probably one being born this minute. How fucking hard would it have been for me to be born female? Yet it didn't fucking happen. Fuck this. 

I wish it didn't come to this, but I'm starting to see life as not worth living. Compare having to endure pain and suffering for the rest of your life versus a few minutes of pain and then... nothing. Nothing is so much more preferable to the bullshit my transgender condition puts me through every moment of the day.

Sometimes I feel like my friends don't even understand the kind of pain I go through on a moment to moment basis: look at that incredibly beautiful girl, gee I sure wish I was born like her; I always feel this way, maybe transition is the right idea; but what if I transition and I don't pass, or don't feel comfortable for some reason, and then I have to detransition?; but if I don't transition I'll always wonder and I can never date anyone because I couldn't trust myself not to have a gender dysphoria breakdown like I did with my last girlfriend and completely ruin their life.

I know that I want to be female, and I have some doubts such that I wonder if what I want is what I actually need (what you want isn't always what you need, which is a truth that is taken for granted in transgender circles). Something is not right in my brain and it feels like no solution will work. I could pick up the phone and hire a new therapist, or call the LGBT hotline, or call a friend, but I just don't want to and I don't know why. I can't stand it anymore and it seems like my only two options are ending it or enduring it so as not to hurt my mom who hate to have to bury her child.

In the end, I'll end up dead like so many other transgender people and the world will continue having little-to-no compassion for the ""dude in a dress"" because why the fuck would you want to change your gender you sick sexually perverted fuck?",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_w3uyw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/w3uyw/being_transgender_is_a_death_sentence/,

I'm 18, and no one bullies me. In fact, since coming out, I'm probably the only person (besides my parents) who has a problem with me being gay (and it has nothing to do with religion). I'm tired of being so different. No matter what I do there's always something everywhere to remind me that I'm just some aberrant freak that should have gone through with it the first time.

Hearing ""it gets better"" and watching the videos makes me feel worse, because I haven't been able to make it better, and I won't be able to. I've been told to call the trevor line thing, but I can't. If I get caught my life will be ruined even more than it is now, because if someone finds out I'm suicidal they'll send me away.

There's nothing good about being gay. I can never justify it to myself, and the ones other people say just don't work for me. I feel like crap every time I look at a guy. Ever time I see a cute guy I secretly hope he's straight so that he doesn't have to put up with being gay. I don't feel like I belong. Like any of us belong.

I can't get married. I can't have kids (don't give me the adoption or surrogate bull, you know what I mean). Half the time I'm more my sexuality than I am me in other people's eyes, and I hate the fucking stereotypes people always feel surprised I don't follow. I hate that sex is harder. I hate that it's easier to find sex than a relationship. I can't stand being so disgusting and weird. I hate it all.

I wish there was a cure, but I know that's not possible. I'm stuck like this. I don't think I can do it. If I die now, it'll all be over. I don't have to worry about making people sad. My friends are the only ones who might be, but I'm so fucking tired of worrying about other people while I die inside and keep up my front so that they don't have to worry.

**ANOTHER UPDATE**: Hey guys, first of all, you are awesome. Thanks so much for your support, and advice, I really needed it, I felt alone at the time, but now seeing so much people helping me at this hard time is a real blessing. You all deserve a gigantic hug.

Second, I just came home from what was a meeting of his closest friends. We we're completely blank at the beginning but then started to reminisce all the awesome things he did. He was fun, quirky, sometimes even weird but in a pretty much positive way, and we just standed there and laughed at all those stupidities he did, sometimes we felt like idiots doing this, but we came up to a conclusion that he would enjoy the conversation just as much as we did. I still have to go to the funeral and we still need to put an orbituary in the local paper (I still can't cope with those two things), and I'm completely out of myself right now.

I'm 28, I've had depression since puberty. You know how it goes, just suddenly without warning everything in life feels bleak, hopeless, and sad. So I've had to live with that for 15+ years now. It's gotten so bad at times that I've thought about killing myself:

- I remember being in 8th grade, crying uncontrollably, suicidally sad.
- 2003, considering killing myself, incredibly sad while working at a sunny beautiful golf course.
- 2004, girlfriend dumped me, I wound up in the hospital for threatening suicide.
- 2007, had a psychotic break/manic episode that lasted for a few months, wound up in the psych ward for 2 weeks; the mania destroyed every relationship in my life, and once I was back to ""normal"" I realized how much I'd destroyed my life, so I didn't leave bed for 3 months and set out a plan and was ready to make it happen.
- 2009, spent the entire year massively depressed.
- 2010, met girl of my dreams, life suddenly imbued with hope although the depression and anxiety tainted most of my waking life.
- 2011, made a poor decision which instantly triggered OCD that wouldn't let up, ever -- so on top of the existing depression, pain, and anxiety, now I also had to deal with my every other thought fueling this mental obsession.
- 2012, girl of my dreams from 2010 who said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me and loved me despite all of my issues, suddenly ends the relationship without warning.

It's now mid-2013. My life is a parody of what it was in the past, and I don't know if it was ever very stable or consistently happy to begin with. **Imagine waking up every single day and knowing that what lays in store for you is shame, regret, anger, pain, sadness, hatred, self-loathing, fear, anxiety, panic attacks, OCD triggers, memories of the girl of your dreams which have now become excruciating images that blind you constantly and unpredictably, apathy, anhedonia, depression, and visions of suicide.**

I've done therapy, medication, exercise, meditation, and so on. I have some good friends and a strong relationship with my family. But my patience is just about done.

Contrary to what you hear, it doesn't get better. It's been 8 months since the breakup and I still have ""blackouts"" of suicidal pain, where I can't see, feel, or think about anything else besides putting an end to this hell. Nothing has changed.

My life is like a nightmare that I can never wake up from. I have one last hope, which is receiving a full TMS treatment, and if that falls through, then I will probably make the idiotic and shortsighted decision to kill myself.

I am a coward and I am lazy, which is why I would choose to end my life rather than continue to ""stick it out."" I never wanted this life and I want it less and less every day. I'll ruin my family's life, and my friends will be angry and confused for a while, but 100 years from now this will all be forgotten.

It will be excruciatingly painful for my mom and she will probably go insane -- how could I do that to her? I don't know. I guess not only am I a coward and lazy, but I'm selfish as well.

Everything hurts.

My thoughts and love to all others going through similar struggles.

If there is one thing that can provide me solace, it's the notion that one day this suffering will be over. I don't have any reason to believe in an afterlife, and I can't imagine a God that would punish you for ending an unwanted life of uncontrollable suffering, so I guess all I really want to say is I'm sorry mom and I love you always.

She wasn't Goth, but that gives you an idea of her style and stuff.

She was pretty, a lesbian, atheist, and stuff.

I'm your stereotypical white guy trying to look gangster. Anyway, she was the only cousin I could be absolutely honest with, and so she's my favorite. We regarded each other as the only ""normal"" people in our family. Just 2 days ago we were at our family gathering walking around the block, smoking our ever so ""evil"" cigarettes. We had a blast that day, stealthily joking around on Kik about how cute our second cousin is. My dad arranged for her to help us take care of some photo equipment, I told her about an awesome job my friend got and told her she should apply too, cuz they don't care if you have tattoos. She thought that was great. 

Her car is so much nicer than mine. Her parents are loaded. Her girlfriend was gorgeous and even I was surprised. 2 days ago she was happy as ever. 

And now she's gone.

I'm devastated. I wanted to introduce her to my friends, ""This is my hardcore and awesome cousin I'm always talking about. Talk some shit and she'll fight you. And she'll win and if she doesn't she'll come back with a pistol.""

We had epic plans.

We were supposed to chill this weekend.

And she was happy.

I just don't understand.

I think everyone is playing a big joke on me.

But she's not replying on Kik.

She always replies on Kik :(

Just remember how it hurts, how deeply it burns the people that care about you. That love you.

Her dad is flying in today really torn up about it. Her mom found her hanging. The entire extended family is at my grandmother's house, and I'm on the way.

He is one of the happiest people I have ever met and this just completely took me by surprise. He's doing much better now and I like to think that I and some of our other friends helped.

1364711562.0,38,self.SuicideWatch,1bciys,It gets better. This is my story.,50,12,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1bciys/it_gets_better_this_is_my_story/,"To everybody who has ever had a suicidal thought. I ask you to read my story. I too contemplated suicide when I was younger. I am still here 8 years later. I hope what I am about to write serves as support for those who need it.

I had just started middle school. I never really had many friends, and I spent most of my time playing video games. I was bullied every single day in middle school. I hated it. I thought of different ways to end my life, but I was always too much of a coward to actually attempt anything. I was hoping that the bullies would just do it for me, and end my life for me. I never felt more useless in my life. The only thing that kept me going was my love for my family and how distraught they would be if I was gone. They were the only ones who had ever loved me. 

Each day it got worse and worse, I was jumped, verbally and physically abused, began to fail my classes, and began to lash out at my parents. I told them I did not want to live anymore if people only viewed me as a target. My mom simply told me one thing: Pretend like nothing happened.

I had no idea what to think of what she said. How could I pretend to hide my pain? But as I soon realized what she meant, the bullying lessened each and every day. Every time I was hit, I didn't say a word. Every time I was picked on verbally, I didn't say a word. I spent my entire seventh grade year without uttering another word. Everybody thought I was a freak. Nobody bothered to mess with me anymore because I no longer showed any reactions to the pain. 

8th grade came along, and I met a group of friends that I began to play football with. They, too, picked on me, but again I never said a word, talking to only parents upon arrival home. I became part of their group, and it was the most fun I've ever had; playing football on the grassy field, not saying a word to anybody. I knew I was an outcast. But in high school that was all about to change, when I met my friend Don (name changed for privacy). 

Don was very similar to me. He was a male, my age, and a loner. He became the only person I was able to talk to, and him to me. As I learned about his story I realized I was not the only one in agony; I wasn't the only one who wanted to end my life. I saw the marks on his wrist, he was a cutter. I asked him how many times he's attempted suicide, and he said he has tried to die at least 5 times, but was never successful. Everyday I looked forward to seeing Don, hoping that he would show up at school. He did not show up one day, and I assumed one of his attempts was finally successful. He attended school the next day and told me that the only reason he isn't dead is because I had given him hope that he was more than just a victim of bullying. I had become his first friend, and he never felt happier. Even though he still had the urges to die, he said he wouldn't go if I didn't go with him. I told Don that seeing him alive gave me a new meaning in life, and we became the best of friends in high school. However, I had begun to grow out of my shell and make new friends, and Don and I began to drift apart. He posted a MySpace bulletin saying that he had lost his best friend and was going to end it all.

I had read this, and called him right away, and asked him to allow me once last chance to see him. I told him to come and hang out with the new friends I had made at school. These new friends I had made weren't just loners like Don and I, but pretty popular guys who were involved in the school elections and events. Don followed me along, and although he didn't speak a word to anybody else but me, he is still alive today. On graduation day, he thanked me for being there for him everyday, and introducing him to the new friends. He eventually began to talk to them and he fit right in. 

What I am trying to say here is: Don't assume that you aren't worth living. Everybody was put on this world to live, and although there may be struggles, sometimes all you need is someone to talk to. And if you honestly believe that there is no one out there that would talk to you, you aren't trying hard enough. I don't know where Don and I would be today if it weren't for our meeting each other, but I know that talking to each other gave us a new-found meaning of life. If you honestly feel like there is no one out there for you, I'd like to start off by saying: I'm here. Even though I am on the Internet and you don't know who I am, I am here.  Try to initiate conversation with people. Don't expect them to talk to you first. You never know where you will meet your Don, but he or she is out there. Trust me. 

Also, there is nobody worth taking your life for. I have also been in love, and I have also been hurt by the ones I love. And I have been depressed because of it. And as much as I tried to tell myself that I was not worthy of living, I think back to those who respected me and cared for me. Don, my parents, my family, and past lovers. If you've had a past lover, then obviously you have the capability to be loved. And although the person you love may have different feelings about you, it doesn't mean that your life has to be over because of it. Someday, you WILL find the person who loves you forever and for who you are. But sometimes it take pain and agony to achieve happiness and bliss. 

So I ask you all a favor: Please, nothing and no one is worth ending your life. Take a minute every time you have these urges and think about the good things in life. If you are dealing with a break-up, don't think of it as ""s/he doesn't love me anymore."" Think of it as ""things didn't work out, but there are no regrets and the happy times we had together, will eventually make their way to me again."" 

Hope that my story has been a helpful one, and I wish you all the best of luck.


Edit: Don and I have not really kept in touch since we both moved on to college, but we are both in happy relationships with new people, and both of us are no longer suicidal

I have always hidden myself behind a facade of laughs and smiles. People know me as a carefree person, who takes things easy. Only a select few have seen past that and have seen the darkness that's follows me. I have tried, truly tried to find happiness and to BE happy. Forcing it upon myself at times. It finally happened however, the depths of despair have never been so deep. I had lost it on the car ride home. I had been picked apart for the last time, I felt as if I were worthless. Never good enough, never able to meet expectations.

I sat down on my bed and felt empty... alone. My movements felt so sluggish, my will shattered and broken. As I reached for the bottle and took handful after handful, I opened my texts. I sent my ex, one of my best friends and closest friend... long ago, a message. Saying I was sorry for everything I did wrong and everything I didn't do. Those were meant to be the last. I wrote down my final thoughts about my life and a select few that are distant yet I still hold dear to my heart. My mind and body began to go numb, my empty stomach now full, I went to my bed and laid down. Twilight beaming through my room. I started to feel so very tired, my body starting to pump me full of adrenaline to no effect. I felt so cold and alone, my thoughts stopping. I glanced around at my things, feeling my inevitability closing in on me. Thoughts of death fleeted across my mind. I felt lost, a waste of a brilliant mind and loving soul. Wishing I could see my first loves face one last time. Apologizing to myself for my family and friends.

Up until 3 months ago, my life was awesome. Then one mistake cost me everything. I torment myself constantly for how avoidable the whole situation could have been. The heartbreak &amp; horror I am feeling is unbelievable.
I have all the symptoms of not only HIV but AIDS. I already have Crohns Disease (inflammation of the bowls) which I think had already depleted my immune system down for the HIV virus to take complete control. Thrush on my tongue, swollen lymph nodes all over, night sweats, diarrhoea, sores on my body that don't heal. I'm returning home early from my 5 month trip around the world just to get the diagnoses confirmed so I can plan my death. I can't live with what I have done to this beautiful girl. What I've done to myself &amp; the both of us. Each time I think about it I tear &amp; up fall to my knees. I haven't told friends or family I am coming home early so I'm all alone in this. 
I don't want to die but the guilt &amp; pain that I'm sure I am about to inflict on her is beyond my threshold. I've reached my tolerance.
I know that HIV is a 'treatable chronic disease' but I'm sure it's way past that for me. I've taken away our future together to have children (I know there are possibilities but there are very costly) which we had already talked about. The worst part is she is still over seas &amp; Christmas is coming up. If I find this to be true &amp; I am positive (I'm 100% certain in my head, just going through the motions of the shitty piece of paper to confirm) do I tell her straight away when she's all alone overseas? Wait for her to get home so she's with her family? Or should I fly over to see her in NZ when she's with her family &amp; tell her in person? (I'm in Australia)
My life was once amazing, and when I met her I thought it was perfect. But I'd fucked everything up before I'd even met her unknowingly &amp; now I'm utterly horrified every second of every day.
Please help.
**TL;DR: I had an encounter with a prostitute, then met the love of my life, spent 2 months travelling together before parting ways (she had her own travel plans before we met) and now I think I may have contracted something terrible and in turn given it to her as we had unprotected sex.

The father of my kids and I had a falling out several years ago but always remained good teammates in raising our kids and the best of friends beyond anything I could of imagined. Last year he got married, and while I was happy for him I couldn't help but feel jealous. I hadnt dated anyone serious and marriage wasn't even a thought for me. I guess I blocked this new girl out even though I came in contact with her weekly. She never really was a fan of me so I guess I see how she was blocked out. 

I had done a favor for him that resulted in me being incarcerated over night, he bailed me as soon as he was able to, and since then it seems like my life has been nonstop turmoil. 

He had papers drawn up for custody and child support. I lost my job. My kids had to go move in with them. I lost my car which made it impossible to find a new job. I became extremely ill and was admitted to the hospital late last year. And now I'm on the verge of loosing my apartment because I gave my last $300 to him for a Disney trip they went on this weekend. 

Since my downfall its been extremely hard for me to see or do anything nice for my kids. I can see and feel the disconnection that's happened over the past couple of years. I know they enjoy being at their dads and having this other lady around more than they do when they're with me. I have so little to offer them and haven't been able to offer them in so long that I told their dad to just keep them. I won't go to court and fight it, draw up the paper work and I'll sign it.

I didn't come here because I needed all of your support to stay alive, not this time, at least.

It seems like a lot of us have the same problems on here, not only personal, but on a grander scale. I just want a chance to actually accomplish something, however trivial it may turn out to be.

The crises in Northern Africa, world-wide famine, LucidEnding's plea for humanitarianism, maybe it's hopeless, but I've lost hope before and this isn't the same. We can all try to do some good in the world, not for our parents and friends and the ones that got away, but commit ourselves and the lives that we've been willing to forfeit for the betterment of the society that for us fell too short, but so that maybe there will be an alternative to the 9-5 until you and everyone you love dies world.

It's both watching a stranger and myself do these actions.

Well where to begin?  The big catalysts were breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years and being laid off from my job within two months.

I spiraled pretty quickly out of control.  I bought crystal meth from a friend and started doing it almost every day as I survived on unemployment checks.  I got little jobs here and there as I was a web designer, there was always a bit of work for me.

I went to all night coffee shops and wrote and obsessed about my ex.  I was brutally and hopelessly depressed.

I drank.  I started smoking.  This is coming from a guy who was the picture of health.  I used to run, go to the gym, eat healthy.  I didn't think this lifestyle was having an effect on me.  Later I would hear from my sister that when she saw me for the first time during this period of my life, she thought I looked like a skeleton.

I started going to therapy.  After crystal meth though I did get hooked on pain pills I stole from my roommate at the time.  But eventually those ran out and I had no choice but to become somewhat sober.

My therapist meant well but I lied to her, trying to be the person she wanted me to be.  I did get a job and felt like I was getting better.

What set me off next was seeing my ex after a few years.  Seeing the house that she bought.  The house she was living in with her new boyfriend.  Seeing how happy she was and what the fuck was I doing?  

I got pain pills, valium and cocaine from several sources and began using, all the while lying to my therapist about it.

I got into a car accident going to work while I was high on valium.  Nobody was hurt so the cops weren't called.  There were to be no drug tests.

I started hanging out with a guy who partied a lot.  We'd go out to clubs and do a lot of drugs and try to meet women.  I shudder to think how I looked to those women, high on coke and alcohol, reeking of desperation.

The main thing I can say about how it all lead to a suicide attempt was it felt like a snowball rolling down a hill.  I knew what was happening but there was nothing I could do to stop it.  It was going to end, one way or another.

On a Saturday, everything felt dark.  I felt like I was underwater.  There was so much pain inside of me I didn't know what the hell I could do.  So I took valium.  And pain pills.  And I drank vodka from the bottle.  I stumbled around my apartment.  And still I hurt.  I didn't want to live.  This was not life.  All this pain.

I called my friend and left a message on his voicemail.  ""Do you ever think of death?""

I grabbed a belt from my closet but couldn't find anything to hang from myself from.  So I drank some more.  I was so completely out of it, I thought I would die soon from all the drugs.  I went to bed and laid down face down into my pillow, hoping to suffocate if the drugs didn't kill me.  Then I blacked out.

When I woke up the next day, there was the deepest grief I had ever felt.  I failed.  I did not want to be alive.  I hated everything.  I grabbed a knife from my kitchen and dragged it across my forearms.  Not to kill myself.  I just wanted to feel something besides the pain inside of me.  It made me feel better.

I called my therapist and told her what happened.  She wasn't pleased.  She told me to call a friend over otherwise she was calling 911.  She also told me she couldn't be my therapist any more.  That she couldn't handle me.  At the time, I thought it was harsh but I didn't feel anything.  I was dead inside.

But embarrassment overrode everything and I called a friend lest I be hauled out of my apartment by EMT in front of my neighbors.  My friend came over, clearly over her head.  She did flush my drugs down the toilet which I know appreciate.  If she hadn't, I probably would've finished the job that night.

She cried when she was the cuts on my arm.  And all of a sudden I was comforting her.

I'm not really sure what happened after that.  My memory is pretty fuzzy from all the drugs.  But being off the drugs, probably helped a lot.  I plodded along.  I found no joy in anything for a long time.

Somehow, I hung on long enough to realize that my life wouldn't always be that way.  And that was the hardest thing to believe.  Because when I was ready to die, I thought that was my only option.

I don't know what advice I can give about coming this revelation yourself.  Maybe you need to get that close to the edge before realizing you don't want to go over.  And some people make it and some don't.

I think about killing myself every now and then, still.  But it's fleeting.  And not very real.  A fantasy.  A day dream.  It's been 5 years.  I love life, even when it sucks.  Because fuck it, that's all we know we have.

If you're out there, if you're thinking about offing yourself, i'm not going to give you a list of bullshit reasons not to.  To tell you the truth, only you can figure out a reason to live.  But it only takes one reason.  One spark to keep going.  And if you make it one more day, hour or minute, that's something.  Don't think about the rest of your life.  Think about this moment.

Do not underestimate the impact your death will have on people. Your friends and family will spend pretty much the better part of their lives wondering why they never saw the signs and what they could of done to stop it. The ""What if"" game many suicide survivors (the term used to describe the loved ones of people who end their lives) will spend the better part of their lives on will be extreme torture. You would not want your mother tortured to death so why put her through similar agony. 

Suicides has a huge impact on first responders. It is them who have to deal with the families at the scene and have to deal with the human remains. Even people walking by the scene to see loved ones crying in the front drive can be adversely affected. 

Forget what you have seen about death on tv. Suicide involves an act of trauma inflicted upon the body to cause death. These traumatic acts (falls, gunshots, hanging) cause horrible disfiguring injuries to the human body. Why is this important you might ask? Somebody has to find your body. Somebody has to see this. It could be your family member that walks in on you after you have done the deed. 

Whoever finds you will probably have a lot of mental problems to deal with as a result of this. Of course, you might think the way around this is to not do it at home but here is the catch. The medical examiner/coroner needs to positively identify the body and the way they do this is to use a family member to visually identify the remains. This means one of your loved ones is still going to get to see what you did to yourself. 

I have seen all sorts of suicides under a variety of conditions and I am convinced there is no nice or easy way to end one's life. The internet is full of information on how to do it and quite frankly its all garbage. Medical doctors get things wrong all the time and medical science is always learning new stuff. Do not trust people who have no medical training (because if they did they would legally and ethically obligated to not give advice on suicide) on something that medical science itself knows very little about. They are all alive. How can they know what a good suicide method is?

Do not underestimate the body's ability to survive trauma. People jump off tall bridges and survive only to drown in the water or live for 15 minutes before dying. 26 people have survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and a study was done in which they were asked, ""what was the first thing you thought about when you took the final leap?"" All had the same answer: They changed their mind. 

Funerals for suicide victims are always very awkward affairs. Death notices describe people ""who pass away suddenly in their home"" and nobody dare speak about the cause of death. Family members often feel guilty and will spend large sums of money on the funeral in the hopes it will atone for not stopping the suicide. 

A full service funeral with a burial and a monument could easily cost your family $15000. Do you really want to stick your family with a large bill. If you think its expensive to live you should see how much it can cost to die. 

I have been there myself. I can tell you I have stood on the edge myself but always managed to pull myself back. Even knowing what I do about the subject I have still gone through it. I can tell you one of the lonliest and scariest things I ever did was walk into a hospital emergency room and ask for help but I am glad I did. 

As scary and lonely as it was, its the desire to live that pushes you forward. Deep inside of us is the will to live and if you are reading this then obviously it is there with you. It really does get better, I can assure you of that.  Don't do what will surely be the biggest mistake and regret of your life. 

Sorry but I won't be answering questions on this subject. ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,t3_dycs0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dycs0/a_funeral_directors_thoughts_and_observations_on/,

Is my life even halfway to where I'd ideally like it to be?  Hell, no.  But it's good enough-- and there is much deeper value than you may now realize in the completely realistically achievable nature of that.

I haven't spent much time in this subreddit (first post here), but when the front page spotlight swung in this direction, I felt I had an obligation to add my voice and share *something*.

While in many ways I'm the same person with the same problems, I have learned and experienced a helluvalot that I'm glad for (think of everything I would've missed that's happened since 1994, it's almost vertigo-inducing), and I pretty consistently manage to look forward to the future now.  I don't have any illusions about making some huge difference by posting anonymously to the internet, but if I can be a small part of what helps a couple people get to the same place from where I used to be, it's one of the better ways I can imagine investing my time.

-------

First off, the folks who tell you you're looking at the world wrong and/or that everything will get sooo much better may mean well, but deep down you doubt it because you suspect there are serious problems here that aren't going away any time soon (if ever), and you fear it isn't just simple matter of 'adjusting your perspective'... and in all brutal honesty, I'm gonna hafta tell ya you're probably right about that.  The trick is how you transform the pull of oblivion from a howling supermassive black hole of overwhelming madness to something you can put in a room in your mind and shut the door on for a while.  You'll start to find with time that a whole lot of human beings have such rooms.  Dealing with that isn't easy, you damn well know it isn't-- but from my experience, it absolutely does get easi*er*.

-------

NOTE:  When you're bad enough off to seriously consider ceasing your existence, other people who tell you you're a whiner, or that the circumstances you describe aren't sufficiently bad to justify your feelings, are:
1. complete assholes (intentional or not)
2. totally clueless
3. not worth your time

Please keep this in mind at all times.  Thank you.

-------

Okay, so, reality as you are experiencing it is a qualitatively bad, ugly thing, and you can't flip a switch to change that.  With certain drugs, you may be able to slightly alter the picture, but really your only escape is sleep or passing out.  Am I making sense so far?  So, sleeping longer - or forever - starts to look like the most beautiful thing in the world (especially if you have insomnia).  And then the planning starts.

You tell someone about it, or make a subtle comment which leans in that direction.  Some trollface responds with ""you're doing it wrong, durkedur"", and even though you know they're full of shit, there's a part of your mind that follows the thread along anyway...  *maybe I am just being weak/selfish/dense/whatever, I need to 'buck up', but ohmygodicannotdoit, WTFiswrongwithme, i'm badwrong for being this way, i'm defectiveuseless, ireallydonotbelonghere, takemeoutofthepicturenow...*  STOP IT.  

You don't have to justify or validate your feelings to anyone-- they simply exist, like trees and rocks and concrete and diesel exhaust.  They are an integral part of your reality.  Draw a deep breath.  You *can* process them and begin to move on, but you have to start setting aside time and resources to do it, and find the right tools that work for you.  The sharp edges get worn down &amp; rounded out, and become blunted.  More beauty, wonder - and yes, even love - do await you, and it is worth it to try to make it through all this.  Still, you have to survive in the mean time.  Why?  Hang with me, I'll get to that.

I'm not gonna sugar coat this next part.  Whatever thing or combination of things that has brought you to this place quite likely won't ever stop hurting when you're reminded of it.  Hell, right now, you probably can't even put it out of your mind at all (although you should be able to eventually).  So accept that.  This is part of you now.  It's not as bad as it seems in the worst moments, but let's not fool ourselves, it's pretty goddamn bad.  There are some other harsh things you're going to have to accept, too-- what pushed me over the edge all those years ago was a set of staggering realizations, all of which I was fairly sure were true (and they in fact turned out to be): 
1. my options for 'how to live' were becoming extremely limited 
2. certain future major disappointments &amp; failures were basically inevitable
3. I wouldn't just disappoint myself, but many others as well
4. much of my dysfunctionality was permanent for all practical purposes
5. I would never completely get over *her*
6. I wouldn't live up to my potential, I'd waste time, I'd make mistakes
7. my safe, comfortable world view of younger days was gone forever.

There's more, too, of course, but that's enough.  Stare it in the face.  It's too much to take, isn't it?  It was for me, truly.  I could not process all those facts and remain sane at that point... ...but I can now.  

Here's a thought-- be glad that you're one of the privileged few who have actually woken up from the zombified autopilot life!  People like us value other people like us a great deal.  It doesn't come up very often, but when you meet someone else who you find out has been there, it's a different quality of connection.  We understand some of the most important things about being conscious and self-aware in a way that the masses don't.  It ultimately vastly deepens our capacity to appreciate things like the arts, nature and human kindness.  All you have to do is figure out how you can live with yourself and these realities first.

Yeah, it's a tall order.  But even if it's not worth it to you right now, even if you're convinced it can't be done, do what it takes to maintain your existence a while longer anyway.  It's a mess, but you might not have to clean it all up... and if you do, there ought to be an end point worth getting to, or failing that, at least some damn fun escapes now and then.  

Learn that within you is both a child and a parent, and that you have to respect both at different times in different ways.  Embrace your weaknesses.  Rediscover your cleverness in working with, through and/or around them.  Revel in tricking or daring yourself into doing things you didn't think you could.

-------

**Finally, the whys:**  Don't forget that while there may or may not be an afterlife, there is indisputably an ongoing epic human story that you can either be a net positive or a net negative contributor to.  There is also this thing called the domino effect-- you may be in a place mentally where you think you hate everyone and don't care if the whole world burns to ashes, but for most of you, there is probably some person or animal you can think of that you would never want to harm... and if you check out completely, it will almost certainly cause someone just like that to suffer in a way that you would *not* want to be the cause of.  A being who doesn't deserve it will surely *hurt deeply* if you do this, possibly far worse than you can imagine.  If not directly, than indirectly through empathy when they find you or learn of your story, or through the absence of something positive you would've done if you'd been here.  

The premature end of a human life, scoundrel or saint, causes countless ripples that only make the world an uglier place.  Do some people deserve it?  It's very possible.  But I feel fairly safe in saying that whoever you are, you probably don't.  Regardless, there is no glory in it-- only more senseless loss, permanent wounds and forever unanswered questions.  

This is what you do: you *just keep on* walking, shuffling, crawling or rolling, however half-heartedly, no-heartedly or half-assedly, but you don't stop breathing...  for the sake of other people more than for your own interests.  Even a heavily medicated semi-life can help facilitate the experience of things like joy and love beyond itself, and I believe it's worth it to keep going for that reason alone.  Just fucking do it.  And who knows?  Maybe - just maybe - after a long while, you'll occasionally find yourself having a sincerely good time.  In those moments, it will be worth whatever it took.  I promise you, with tears coming to my eyes as I write this, you *will* be glad you made the effort in the long run.

I only leave the house to buy food, booze, smokes and kitty litter. I need to take my cat to a non kill shelter but I am too lazy, plus he is all I live for. I am terrified.

I have never talked to anyone in my adult life about this, (I will be 31 soon) and seeing it out there makes me feel like a coward and a child.

I went to a kegger last night at some people's house I don't know so I felt like I didn't belong. Then went to a strip club where one of my friend's roommates works and that's where I cut myself. Went into the bathroom, closed the stall, sliced my arm. Didn't realize the knife was as sharp as it was, it went in like my arm was a stick of butter. I did the wrong thing and told my best friend about it when we were leaving, she of course freaked and started asking around for a towel or something but I told her to shut up. 

Went home and my dad was on the couch making funny noises (to get my attention, I don't know, he's weird like that) but I told him to fuck off...and then broke down in tears. Showed him the cut, told him everything that's been bothering me. I just lost my health insurance so I can't go see a shrink (he said he's pay for it, but I already feel like I'm stealing from him, being a guy in his mid-20s still living with one of his parents) or a doctor for my troubles. I spent 2 hours talking to him, telling him I'm about to just give up on it all.

I'm not going to tell my life story on here because that's on my other post under this name, you can probably discern from that what you should tell me so I don't cut again right now. Right now I'm 50-50 on wanting to die right now and I don't know why.

**Update/Edit:** Spent most of the day in bed, not feeling like doing jack shit. I haven't talked to anyone IRL since last night and I have been stuck in my room. I am too embarrassed to talk about this to my dad. I know it tears him up inside that I cut myself last night. This isn't the first time I've done it. I've done it before in 12th grade and came very close to ending it all back then too. Ended up being committed to a psych ward which was alright but it was tough going back to school after everyone knew that I cut. I haven't eaten a damn thing today either, not sure if I can. 

All I've been doing is sitting here on my laptop looking at Reddit and Youtube videos with my knife [open like this](http://i.imgur.com/dI64Q.jpg). Yeah...the blood is still there. I haven't washed it off. 

I think actually browsing Reddit today helped me a bit, although /r/gonewild kinda let me down because it makes me feel like I'll never get a woman in my life in the condition I'm in. **So I unsubbed from it.** Got kind of tired of chicks saying, ""This is my first time, please be nice!""

I picked up a great job this past December (15/hr, full time) and thought I could juggle that with going to school 12 hrs.. well. It hasn't fared well at all. I am probably going to be asked to leave the Business College at my school after this semester, and from my job performance lately, I think my job is on the line. Not that I am lazy, I just make a lot of stupid errors on paperwork at a blood bank. Which is not taken lightly at all. I am at a crossroads, and I honestly don't know what to do. I work Tuesday through Saturday (4PM-12AM) and I have school Monday through Friday in the AM and I have practically no time for myself anymore or for anyone else. I've stopped going to school on a daily basis because my grades are so far gone, there is just about nothing I can do to bring them back now. Everything I worked towards while I was in the military has pretty much gone to shit, and my prospects to go to law school are long gone now, even though my state will keep paying for school after I used my gi bill so when I heard my mom mention vocational school as a possible route, I figured I am a lost cause. 

The thing is, I am *supposed* to be happy. I am debt free, the gi bill pays for my school and rent, I make a decent amount of money for a college student, (3900/month) it's pretty much everything I dreamed of. I never wanted to leave college with a lot of debt. Except I have no social life, no friends, and girls think I am some creeper because I show up to school sweaty sometimes because I ride my bicycle to school. It's sad, because this wasn't a problem for me a few years ago. I've tried asking out some girls in my classes, but they just kind of brush me aside and hook up with some jock. Not that I should really care, herpes is for life. The only friend I really have is another bike rider who happens to be 17 years older than me (I'm 24, he's 41), who has taken me to church with him on occasion, showed me how to work out, and helped me out a few times when my car was broke down. 

So last night I started having thoughts. I'm not sure about whether or not they are considered intrusive. Thoughts about packing up everything I own into boxes, updating my will, donating blood for the very last time, (I'm O Negative, it would be selfish not to. At least I could ""live"" through someone else.) liquidating my assets and placing it in cash on the table to cover for funeral, clean up, rent for my roommate until he can find another place, then wrapping myself up in heavy duty plastic, placing a brick under my head to catch the bullet/bone fragments, calling the police, so they can possibly be there in time to harvest my organs, and blowing my brains out. And I could do it too. I have a pistol and plenty of bullets. 

The only thing stopping me is what it would do to my mother and my grandmother. My grandmother would literally die. Her heart couldn't take that, and as for my mom, it would absolutely destroy her. And I don't want that for them. So I figured maybe I can just make it look accidental. Like accidentally get struck by lightening when I am riding my aluminum framed bicycle through a lightening storm. Or accidentally get hit by a semi while on my bike. Those might be a bit easier for my mom or for my grandmother to swallow, but I don't think it would ensure me getting killed on impact. I'd hate to live out another year in a vegetative state. 

I know I should probably give my bike rider friend my pistol for a little while. Especially after writing this. But I don't know what he would think of me. He is a really levelheaded person, and I don't want him to see me as weak or mentally unstable. I don't think he would be my friend anymore. He hasn't known me for a year, yet he considers me family. But he only sees a part of me that I want him to see. 

It felt good to write this. And maybe some of you will read it. Thank you to those who did. Obvious throwaway. 

tl;dr: I should probably give my friend my gun. ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,1366914516.0,,,True,t3_1d3ji3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1d3ji3/about_to_give_my_friend_my_pistol/,

Is it? I’m 24 years old and I don’t remember what it’s like to be normal. This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world. The anxiety is constant and the panic attacks even happen when I’m sleeping. The doctor’s office smelled like Lysol and the nurse didn’t mind when I cried. The white pills make me drowsy and the small green ones make me sweat. I can’t stop grinding my teeth but they say I’m getting better now.

I've never really been able to talk to people about my problems, and its been tough. This is kind of a long story, but please read because I really need your help; During the summer of 2011 I started getting really depressed. People would put me down because of my bad skin and like any normal teenagers I feel insecure about my body. The depression got really bad and I would stop eating for days. After a few weeks, though, it went away. But during May 2012 I began getting depressed again, and this time I even started self harming. It got really bad and I would stop going out in case someone saw my cuts. After about 3 months my mum found out and helped me through the depression. I never really got over it though. Last month I made a ""My Secrets"" video and posted it to YouTube. The video included stuff about how I'm still really depressed and still occasionally self harm. My mum found it and confronted me about it. She took me took the doctors and they are referring me to a psychiatrist for young people (or something like that). I'm due to have my first session in a few weeks. About two weeks ago I fell out with all of my friends at school because of rumours and they are believing the lies instead of me. So now I have no one. I am scared to go to school or even leave the house. At interval and lunch I am by myself. A group of people in my year are constantly giving me abuse over the Internet, calling me a lesbian and telling me to go kill myself because I'm an 'emo freak who slits her wrists'. Over the past few days I have been heavily considering suicide, but upon researching it I am starting to get second thoughts. I'm wondering if I should speak to my mum and tell her everything and even ask about transferring schools or if I should just go ahead and commit suicide. Please help reddit, I don't know what to do.

I will NEVER get to know my daughter.

I will never get to know my daughter, yet despite this fact I am on the verge of homelessness. My stomach knows the rumble of hunger all too well. I have lost so much weight because of this that I'm not even recognizable next to photos from as recent as 5 years ago (I'm 27 btw). Why am I in this sad, pathetic state? Because of the state of texas attorney general Gregg Abbot and my ex wife. I am an indentured servant to a woman I was married too for a brief amount of time ( 3 years). Our daughter is now 4 years old and I've only seen her twice.

I had a heated argument with my ex-bitch (sorry I just cant stand her) last night which ending up making me so mad, i punch several wholes in my apartment's dry wall.

This woman had the GALL to tell me that HER father (who is a drug addicted ex-con who lives with HIS mother and he's in his 50s) is a better male role model for our daughter than I am. Despite the fact that I've never touched drugs and I am a certified Biomedical tech who at one time, could afford a decent living. When she uttered those words I swear to god I wanted to fucking kick her teeth in. I'd never act on it, thats just how bad she pissed me off.

Now to the point of this post. I'm paying nearly 70% of my check in child support based solely off the fact of what I ""should"" be making. Never mind the fact that I have rent, bills, and a life of my own i must pay for. I've tried to get it adjusted with no avail. I had to take a bereavement leave because my dad passed and so i fell behind 1 month in arrears. My ex promptly did her best to get me locked up, I was almost fired from my job because of it.

I'm going through all this for a child who I've only been able to see 2 fucking times ( i have no visitation rights). It has left me hopeless, angry, depressed, and bitter. And I am just fucking DONE with it all. Its been going on too long.

Fuck you.

I came to America at age of 9 from South Korea. I had a hard time learning English and adjusting, but now I am fine. My family is wealthy. I go to a private school. I don't do drugs. I am social. I can talk to girls easily. I have many friends. I get good grades at school. I'm not a troublemaker. I swim. I'm fit. I'm a typical teenager you will see.

Or am I? People don't know anything about me. They don't know what I go though.

I believe life is worthless. We are brought to this world to live for nothing. When you die, no one is going to remember you. I hate this world, and I hate people.

I play videogames. A lot. It's the only thing I really enjoy. ONE thing I enjoy in my worthless life. My parents always tell me to stop playing games. I always tell them it's the only thing I enjoy. Now, I would understand if I didn't get good grades at school, but I do. All my grades are above B. I told my mom I want to kill myself before. She becomes really worried for couple days and then it's back to normal. They tell me I shouldn't play games. For no reason. I do everything I'm supposed to.

My dad beats me. He screams at me for random things. I feel like he thinks he has a right to do these things to me because he sends me to a private school. Last time, when he was beating me, I got the phone to call 911. He threw the phone on the ground and started choking me. I hate him.

I hate my parents - they want me to see that they care for me, when in reality, they don't.

My parents make me go to church every fucking sunday. I already came out to them that I am an atheist. They told me I have no choice but to be a Christian. God this and God that. Oh that fucker Jesus died for our sins. I hate everyone at church. They are phonies. Straight up phonies who rely on religion only when hard time comes. God doesn't exist and bible is harry potter from the past.

I hate people in general. I don't know why. All I want to do is to be in my room or playing games. I've been trying to find a girl who would care for me and listen to my problems, but I found out all girls are selfish bitches.

When I got fed up with the way ""customers"" and I use that term only to describe the human trash that frequented but never purchased anyway from the establishment for which I was employed, I decided to quit. My boss didn't take the idea of my quitting lightly and attacked me. I retaliated and did permanent damage to his body and mind. I was convicted and sentenced to jail. That's where I spent the last 4 years, isolated and under constant attack until 2 months ago. 

I've been trying to rebuild my life. Everything I owned was thrown away and I lost my car. I didn't have much money because I've never made much money. I find myself in a position where I feel nothing but hate towards everyone I interact with. Hate isn't a descriptive enough term or word to describe my feelings towards others. It's not necessarily the individual I hate, it's human nature. The asinine reasoning that ends up with me cleaning up a mess that shouldn't of happened or having conversation that's going nowhere. I watch TV and it's nothing but a very basic set of problems that could be solved if human nature wasn't so broken. Just listening to others makes me want to leave this place. I have no connection to anyone here. I can't function in a world like this. I think what really turned me against everyone the most other than being around them were all the different therapists I was forced to deal with in jail. Talking to them was like pulling teeth. All they did was turn me against any kind of therapy or help for the rest of my life.

It's just horrible how stupid most people are. It's not worth the time or trouble to weed though the bad ones to find someone I can relate to. I'm not talking about companionship either. I already know that's an unreasonable expectation. I'm talking about finding someone you can work with so there's a chance of being half way successful in this screwed up world. 

Since it's too much trouble to have anyone or anything in my life I'm going to kill myself. A life without advancement is bad enough, a life around you people makes it even worse. I'm leaving this world because I don't want to wake up another day feeling trapped like I for the better part of the last decade.

(I don't know how this will be received I'm just suggesting)
What if we had like a friend4friend program or subreddit...or on this subreddit...
where people who are depressed can find other people to talk to via skype, or msn to keep them minimal company. 
I mean I know there are other ways to find people to chat...but what I'm saying is a way to find people who are also depressed (because they can understand or they don't mind if you are) or just people who don't mind talking to someone that is depressed.
Like people can unite in their rough times.

I don't know..I'm just personally having a really rough go at it...and it's just hard pretending that I'm happy all the time, you know? I'd love it if I could just hang with someone that would be ok with me being sad...and we could share stories and cheer each other up...

Would anyone be interested in this?
I'm sorry if it's a bad idea...or if this is the wrong place to post this...

EDIT: Well for now...um if you'd like to talk to me! Please go ahead and send me your MSN or Skype. Maybe I can work out some sort of chat room? Maybe I can pair people up? (I wouldn't mind that) Or we can just post s4df=searching for depression friend on our own. OR!! You can just post your addies here! Let me know what you think would work!

EDIT 2: Also maybe we can team up with /r/depression

EDIT 3: So I think we should just try to work this into /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression and if there is a problem I'll make a subreddit. So I guess the terms we could use would be **s4lmc= searching for like minded companion**. We'll assume it's mostly online unless the person says otherwise. I'll try posting with this in a minute and I guess we'll see how it goes! All of you please feel free to pm me as well.

Time to put on a smile and get to work. Thank you so much everybody for responding until now, and I'll get back on reddit as soon as I can. You really are beautiful people. Sincerely, Thank you. 

I am writing this with tears running down my cheeks, and my gut being so clenched that I think I am going to vomit any second.

I don't know how much I'll be able to type out, but it feels like every keystroke is just a clarification that what just happened really happened. I'm in a relationship, or was in one... or something. It wasn't the most conventional relationship, and I've posted on reddit about it under my real account, which is why I cannot give too much info about it here.

It was (I feel fucking strange saying was instead of ""is""), with the person I love, the only person on earth that understood me. This person knows that he is the most important person to me in the world, and knows that I wouldn't do anything ever to hurt him.

About 1 hour ago, he threw me out of his house. 

He set me in front of the door, like trash, in an completely unprovoked state. The story sounds so stupid when typed out, but he was cleaning the house. I asked him multiple times if I could help him, but he declined. I was then finally determined to go to the supermarket, to buy some stuff for tonight (we had dinner plans). I was looking for him to clarify some things, when I walked outside, thinking he was there. As I walked inside, I got some mud on the floor. He came in, saw it and asked me what the fuck I did. I said I was sorry, and that I'd help him clean up. I was trying to find a mop or something, but he just told me ""Go home, clean your own apartment"". I insisted to help him clean, but then he pushed me against a door, and imitated me ""Wewewe can I help you?"", he said, mocking the way I offered to help him. 

I thought the best thing would be to let him cool down, because he was mad, so I went upstairs to get my glasses from the bedside. When I was downstairs again, he had all of my things stuffed into two plastic bags. He told me to take everything, and to give him his clothes back (a few shirts of his are at my place). I looked at him in sheer shock and asked him what was happening, because I simply couldn't grasp how this situation had happened. He pointed a middle finger and told me to go fuck myself.

I have never heard anything like that from his mouth before. I've never thought he would say something like that.

Completely perplexed and baffeled I went to the front door, he had already put my shoes outside. 

I got on my bike but I couldn't move I was standing in front of the house where my happiest hours had been spent.

I saw a glimpse of him in the window, where he closed the shutters.

Alone I went bicycling home, in the rain. I had never felt so vulnerable or humiliated my whole life. 

I feel like my soul has been crushed, and that my heart is going to stop beating. The person I loved has completely sent me away. He is the person I know everything about and who knows everything about me. We spent the best time of my live together. I just feel so stupid and foolish.

I have no friends. Only him.

I don't know what to do, because writing this post is the only thing I can do. 

I feel like I want all of this to be over.

Please. Someone just talk to me. I have nobody else to turn to.

He was braindead, and his family pulled the plug. 

In November, my cat got sick. Took him to the vet, and he died the next day anyway. Surgery was successful even. He just wasn't strong enough and died of cardiac arrest.

January 31, we tried to celebrate Dad's birthday. I was gonna play hookey for work and spend the day with him instead. We got him a cake. He was too tired. He died three days later. He went to bed during the Super Bowl to take a nap. Mom went to wake him. Instead of napping, he just died instead.

Mom was the widow. My sister's a teenager. I was asked by out-of-state relatives to handle things, be strong for Mom and my sister. I agreed. I kept everything in while they grieved. I wanted to be that strong. I wanted to do it, I really did, but I shut down. I started thinking about dying every day. I've called into work more than usual. I wanted to drop out of grad school.

And while we're getting shit off my chest, I was raped at 19. I told a handful of people. Most of them told me it was my fault, smart women don't get in those situations, that I was used up (ex said that) now. I was huggy before. I stopped touching people. It scared me. Particularly men. I stopped hugging Dad. He thought it was because I loved him less. I never told him. He died thinking that. How do I forgive myself for that?

Finace lost his job. It's all up to me to be big and strong and provide for us and kept mom/sister afloat, and I can't do it. It's too much.

I eat too little, exercise too much. I'm at 102. I'm still going. I can control this. I have no control over anything else. Everyone leaves, and I have to be a big girl, and I can't.

It hurts so much.

Don't leave me alone. There's no one on anywhere else, and I don't think I have anyone. When I tell people, they change the subject. About the cat, the rape, Dad, any of it. I don't know how much longer I can hold all my grief in for the sake of everyone around me. Forever.

Any love would help. Seriously.

I've lived my whole life unhappy. Genetics, whatever. I was a talented kid, I was and am a bright individual. The more the days pass, I've picked apart life, and I can't seem to shake the arrogant thought process that I'm too good for this world. I don't want to be here anymore. I decided a long time ago that if I was gonna stay alive that I would try to do as much good as possible, but I've had enough. I'm drained. No matter how much good I do, the people around me I simply cannot handle.

Media, pettiness, selfishness (and dont anybody dare say im the one being selfish).

I have friends, I cannot sit around and gossip with them anymore. I cannot sit around and talk about what he said to her anymore.  I cannot go home turn on the TV and see who the ""it"" girl is sleeping with anymore. . I can't wait for my next paycheck anymore.

I've felt this my whole life, its inevitable, I've been on meds, nothing has worked. Why haven't they worked? Because I don't have a disorder. We are a disease. I'm sorry to sound like a broken record, but society and the people in this world are fucked. Completely fucked.

The only thing keeping me here is my Dad who is the most amazing person I know. I cannot believe the things he has been through, all to be cheated on by 2 separate wives of whom have showed my the template of which humanity is based upon. My sister is keeping me here, because I don't want to see her hurt, but I am doing a disservice for myself by being here, I guess this is more a rant then anything, I can't do this anymore.

Unfortunately, my experiences have provided me with proof that most people walk around with blindfolds. I'm done soon. 

I'm done being the one that has analyzed the situation, the one that genuinely feels for others, and the one that see's how selfish you are.

That's what I was told life would do shortly after my Dad passed away 17 years ago. It was supposed to get better after my sister overdosed on pain killers a few years afterwards too. It was also supposed to get better when my Mom died on the operating table a few years back. By the time my grandfather died there was no one left to tell me it was supposed to get better. 

A lousy, cheap 12 gauge shotgun is all I have left to remember them all by. When my Dad died he had to fly him over seas to be buried with his Mother in the family plot. Came back and my sister and her husband at the time had let people come into our home and steal almost everything. I had nothing to remember my Dad by but our family pictures. It wasn't long until I was forced out on the streets I lost those too. Mom spent all his money and lost our house to the guy she married after Dad died. The guy she re-married too ended up molesting his grandchildren. Only got 10 years probation. That's the kind of world you are going to attempt to convince me to stay in. 

I've got nothing but this shotgun. Lost my job and to be honest I never want to see another person for the rest of my life. I don't want another job, I don't want more things. All I need is this 12 gauge shotgun. That was the gift my family left me. A way out. They were too incompetent to do anything else for me. I didn't ask for much. I'm not talking about buying me a new BMW every 2 years. I'm talking finishing the dental work I really needed or helping me to go to college. It's all too late now. I've become so antisocial there's no way I'll not become homeless soon. There will be no rebounding from this. I've lived so long in isolation trying to fix this and that about my life, I've become socially inept. The recent job interviews I've walked to have proven that. I spent all my damn time trying to build a better future. Too bad I spent all those years mourning over the death of my family. Little did I know that got in the way learning valuable skills I'd need to live life. 

I'm sick of being told how much better the future will be. I'm sick of these therapy groups where people try to compare their wife cheating on them to my issues. At lease you had a fucking wife and a family. I see you driving away in your Mercedes back to your 4000 square foot house like your life is just so ruined. Yep, we're in the same boat... 

The one thing you can't take from me is the ability to end this suffering. I'll be damned if I become homeless and allow you to laugh at me any longer.

I lived in a rowhome that had been converted into 3 apartments, one on each floor. I lived on the third floor. The homes on either side of me were not apartments, but full houses.

I awoke suddenly one night to a noise. I wasn't exactly sure if the noise was my dream or not, so I checked out the window. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, I laid back down. That was when I heard the next-door neighbors screaming and crying. I thought maybe a family china cabinet had fallen or something, which would account for the [still not sure if it was real] noise and crying.

The following morning, the street was lined with cops. There didn't seem to be any urgency to their operation. My neighbor was on his stoop, visibly shaken. Since I didn't know them very well, I didn't want to intrude just to satisfy my own curiosity, but was still worried about my own safety.

The mailman later informed me that the neighbor's son, fresh off a divorce and living with them, had shot himself.

Now, I never met these people, had no idea they even had a son. But it haunts me to this day. I think about them all the time: the elderly father, the mother too shaken to come out, and the poor son, who just couldn't keep going. All the time. It literally felt like someone I had known for years had died. I cried for them, lost sleep, and here, 500 miles away and years later, I *still* think about them, my heart feeling it each time. As uncomfortable as it is, I carry a torch for them, gladly. I can't imagine how devastated his family probably still is...

Maybe you think no one would care if you weren't here anymore. Maybe you even live alone in a rural area and think no one would miss you. But believe me, someone cares and making that decision will hurt them. It may be a complete stranger, but you matter to *some*one. And if that one person isn't enough, well *I* care too. I genuinely care about other people, especially when they're suffering in ways I've understood (I attempted in '05 and was able to call for help). No one deserves to feel such pain.

You are not alone. We are here for you in /SW and in life. We may not always be obvious, but we are no less. It's ok to be weak and it's ok to suffer, but you don't have to do it alone.

Thank you to everyone who has come here for help, who has not given up. And another huge thank you to the people who offer such insightful advice and kind words. You are *ALL* just amazing.

I was also recently at a party where I am pretty sure I got so drunk I ended up putting myself in a position where I ended up being raped and now, a month later, there is a possibility that I could be pregnant. I can't afford an abortion, let alone a child. I also can't stand children to begin with.

I am about ready to off myself. I am no contribution to society, I have no friends left in my hometown, and I'm finding it impossible to get hired by anyone. I want to kill myself but to be honest, I am scared. I just want to do it quickly and get it over with but I really am terrified. I won't have insurance until 2011, which is soon, but I don't know if I can wait that long.

I really wish that no body ever feels as low and sad as I do right now.

I would just like opinions or advice from anyone who is willing to listen. Please.

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone that responded.  As it turns out, my period arrived and I was just very worried and I tend to get dangerously emotional around this time of the month. I'm not so much upset about the fact that I was raped as much as I am upset about the worry it caused me that I could possibly be pregnant or have an STD/I. I am going to get professional emotional help and get tested as soon as I have insurance again. 

I am not like this at all during the rest of the month, and would never even think about suicide, but feeling as low as I do just once a month is definitely enough to put me into a situation I would never want to be in when I am a normally happy person. I probably have some kind of hormonal imbalance that I need to get evaluated. Again, thanks to everyone for being concerned!

The people around me at work seem perfectly happy to wake up, work, generate cash, go home, sleep, and do the whole thing over the next day. For me, it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I really on this planet only as a cash cow? Am I here to work myself silly and feel grateful when I get a day off here or there?

Is life really meant to be nasty, brutish, and short--and absurd?

Happens in the books. 

Lemme start, I was sad for a long time, going through different kinds of depression. Lonely, sad, apathetic, hateful, dislike. I went through it all, it about 3 years. Started out with rejection, and that started it all. I felt like I had no friends, and I didnt. I had 1-2 friends I hung out with. I tried to change my life, and its been a crazy ride. Times where I wanted to die so badly, my mind was ready to explode. I couldnt think clear. I really wanted to die. I pleaded with god, being atheist. I had pills and had them in my hand just waiting. Somehow getting through, just barely. Driving on the road, thinking about just swerving. Thinking about having a plan to die, always. Some way, somehow. I was worthless. I felt like nothing. I felt like I didnt deserve to live. It took a great deal to get out of a negative image of yourself. I hated one person, and it was me. Out of everything that went wrong in my life i blamed myself. Marijuana helped a lot. Its not for everyone, but for me, without it, life would suck. It basically sorts my mind out, what I care about, and what I dont care about. Easily forgotten past, regrets, thoughts, everything. Silence, and pure connection with my concious thinking. I had a few girlfriends and they all went weird. After the 3rd I said No more for a while, I have to think. Last summer I got into a car crash due to some health issues I still have. I dont remember much, but I hit a fence and a piece of wood came through the windshield and came 3 inches from my face. It was surreal. And another board 6 inches from my waist. I cheated death, once again. This being the 3-4th time. I decided then, something is up. If I were to die, it would have been then. I shouldnt have lived, yet I have no cuts and minor bruises. People who saw the car thought I died. Or at least in the hospital. I have a pic somewhere if you want. I look fat (I lost 45 since then....health issue) which leads me to my health issue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sleep, and eating. After the accident I got sick, like I usually do (Swollen tonsils, cant get removed, get sick 2-3 times a year, not the doctors 4-6) but my stomach got really bad. I literally cant eat, I take a few bites of food and my stomach says no, pain, I hit a wall almost. Cant sleep at night, Ill wake up fucking every 30 minutes and be half asleep. Or cant sleep at all. Ive run out of options in that area. After the accident I went into reclusion. Didnt want to see anyone or be in any social event. I hated society for some reason. I guess it was because I felt like i gave so much, and ive got nothing for it. 

But about a month ago, I met a guy on craigslist for a job. Helping him for IT. Somehow, that got me in the in. He was a real estate owner, he owned a lot of homes and rennovates them and resells them. Makes decent money. Basically, any person I meet, they take my business card. I havent been this busy ever. We meet someone who needs IT work everyday. Everyday. Regular people, old people, home owners, mma fighters, lawyers, consultants, etc. The whole bunch. Thats just a little part. We have many side businesses going. Huge ideas. Im basically set if all just goes smooth in the next 4 months. After, Ill be set for life, ill have many contacts and money flowing on a good basis. Ill be saving for a house and renting it out to tenants. Ill have my own side business doing IT, homes, what ever the FUCK I want. I found it. Ill be set for life. I never, ever, have to worry. It makes me feel so relieved. 

I know not to count my apples before harvest but I like to plan ahead. Things could be great. In 2-3 years, I could have a house paid for, and be set if everything went to shit. At least ill have something I can call a home. Im 20, Im going to community college, I hold no degree, Ive worked in IT for officially like 3 years, no certificates. Ive somehow planned it perfect. I had all these connections, and found a web to connect them too. Im not euphoric, but life, for once. Does not suck. I havent talked to many people since the reclusion, so now Im meeting so many people of every job and age. I rarely talk to girls, yet somehow they seem to stare at me and talk to me first. Lifes ok. I went from 0, to about a 8. I thought for a while, I would never be happy. Ever. Im down of the upsides. Nothings gonna take me down. (Lol, reference)

TL;DR Hang in there. If you feel even a little hope that something might change, it will. Give it all you got, believe in what you want (Karma for me) and be honest. It will pay off. I can attest to that.

1359248862.0,38,self.SuicideWatch,17cf7u,My husband posted something about me and I wanted to follow up with something I learned that might help someone.,46,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17cf7u/my_husband_posted_something_about_me_and_i_wanted/,"I went to the funeral of an awesome, courageous, unique, caring, and all-around remarkable human being. He was a mentor to many kids, and an inspiration to his colleagues. He unfortunately took his own life. I sat in the funeral home and watched people break down into uncontrollable sobs. I saw people leaning on each other for support. I listened as they told story after story about this absolute treasure of a man. So many people were there, and I thought to myself, “Any one of these people would have gone to him if he was in need. If only he had reached out, he would have found so many people reaching back to help him.”

I have been suicidal for a while. I made my husband [posted]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1726ge/my_wife_is_suicidal_yesterday_was_her_second/) something he said while I was in the middle of a breakdown that really resounded with me. Now it’s my turn to share something.

It’s easy to forget the ones we love when we are in crisis. It’s easy to say things like, “They’ll get over it,” and “Nobody would even show up to my funeral.” Our friends and family (you have them even if you think you don’t) would be devastated if we took our own lives. But, more than that, we would be inflicting a grievous injury on them that would never heal. They would think, “If only I had…” done any number of things. Picked up on signs, just stopped by that day, called, etc. For the rest of their lives they would carry around the guilt of having not done something. Now, some people may find that thought appealing. They would like to punish the people that have ignored, not cared, or otherwise wronged them. If you really want to punish them, walk up to them and say, “I don’t think that you love me, and some of your actions have made me want to kill myself.” Don’t do it in a mean way. Be honest and tell them how you feel and how they have made you feel. I’m willing to bet they will change the way they act towards you and maybe even other people. 

I used to think that people would be sad for a little while, but then they would get over it. But it’s not true. Some of those people will never get over it. They’ll never stop being hurt by what he did, and what I wanted to do. And if you want to use suicide as a means of getting even with someone, there are far worse things you can do that won’t end up with you dead or in jail (for the love of all that’s good in this world, just don’t kill anyone, especially yourself.)

I have “taken suicide off the table.” The grief and anguish that those people expressed, the way they talked about how he lived his life and how much they admired and loved him, their pain and their words brought me out of myself, and I saw exactly how wasteful and tragic suicide is. The world was a better place with him in it. The world is a better place with me in it. The world is a better place with you in it.

Think of the people that you love, then imagine how you would feel if they committed suicide. 

**Edit** For those who have no family or friends: The very fact that you are here tells me that you have looks at sidebar at least 53 other people you can reach out to. There are suicide hotlines, and all sorts of other places you can turn to for help. You also have yourself. Step out of yourself and recognize the value of you. Love yourself (fuck, that is the corniest thing I have ever typed, but it's true) and you will have a friend for life.

**Edit #2** I am not ""guilt shaming"" I am sharing my real experience from last night and the last few weeks in the hopes that it can help someone. I'm getting some serious negativity, and I see myself in those peoples' words. You are so angry, the world fucking hates you, you are in constant pain, and you have every right to take steps to end that pain, and anything, or anyone that tells you otherwise is a worthless (fill in with many very nasty expletives). I've been where you are, and I might be there again someday. The utter darkness that swallows your mind, the hatred for yourself and the world around you. ""Why does it keep hurting me? Why does the pain never stop? Why does every fucking thing that can possibly go wrong, go wrong? God fucking hates me. The universe hates me. I'm being punished. I'm being hurt. This is so unfair, what did I do to deserve this?""
  
  
I know where you are. I know that place very well. I wish I could take you out of it right now. I wish I could fly so I could swoop down and carry you to safety. Maybe I can't do it, but you can. This is what works for me. This is what I say to myself:  
   
*Don't let the pain swallow you. Fight that Goddamn son-of-a-bitch with all your might. Grab on to something, anything, and don't let go. And remember, this is your life, YOU are the boss of your own life, not the pain, not the darkness, YOU. YOU are the boss. Don't like where you live? Move. Friends pissing you off? Tell them to fuck off. Get fired? Fuck em', they were a bunch of damn hell ass idiots anyway. Someone break up with you? To hell with them, find someone else. Love someone that doesn't love you back? Try and stop thinking about them, and embrace the pain of it and ride it out to wherever it takes you. Someone you love die? Talk to them anyway. Carry them around in your heart and mind and let them live on through your thoughts and actions. Did all of this shit happen to you at once? Get out of bed every morning. Brush your teeth. Brush your hair. Wash your face.*  
  
I take one gut-wrenching step after another and wait for time to pass. And it will pass, agonizingly slowly, but it will pass. It will pass faster, then faster still. Brushing my teeth in the morning is getting easier, and everything is following. Today wasn't that bad. Tomorrow might be horrible. But things are going to get better. There will be setbacks, but I believe I will wake up in the light and leave the darkness behind me.

That it takes more to live through life in struggle than to leave others who care about you behind.

Then, I started to hear more about people who have committed suicide. Mostly friends' of friends. As usual, I find myself lacking sympathy because of the after effects that go onto the people around them. At the same time, I'm a bit envious of how determined they were in ending their lives, without giving a shit about what others think.

I plan on killing myself sometime in the future, but not until after I've cut ties with friends (which isn't that hard) and with my family (which will be the hardest). In my experience, attempting to cut ties through fights and anger doesn't really work that well as it tends to leave a lot of unresolved feelings between both parties. Gradually cutting ties through lack of communication seems to be the best way.

After I've cut ties, I plan on buying a ticket to Thailand. Mainly because people tend to disappear easily there and being asian myself, it wouldn't be as big a deal than a non-asian dying there. Also, westerners tend to go to Thailand to disappear to start a new life, so most people will think that's what I did.


At first I was thinking about just drugging myself in a shack and burning the place down without leaving a trace, but that might be a bit too far and kind of a waste. I'm sure I could pay someone to just put me to sleep and then harvest my organs and dispose of me properly. I could pay other parties to ensure that it gets done without a trace.


I guess we can what we want with our bodies as we please, but it's unfair when it hurts others. I find peace in knowing that I could just ""disappear"" in another country, after cutting ties so that my lack of existence doesn't affect people as much back home.

I'm sick and tired of it all.

The usual suspects: 

* I'm a 22 year old straight male from western Europe. No money problems. No girlfriend, a few FWBs.
* There are medical reasons for my suicide, but I won't clarify them because I know some people I know read reddit, and the last thing I need is for one of you fuckers to ""save"" me. 
* I've had concrete suicidal thoughts for at least three years. Pretty much permanently depressed for as long as I can remember.
* Yes, I sought help. First my regular doctor, then a psychiatrist. Attended for half a year. Kept describing someone else's problems to me.
* Yes, I've tried contacting a hotline. They were busy. Great. Doesn't really matter, since I wasn't planning on letting them change my mind. I've had three years of this shit already, I don't need any more.
* I realize I will leave people behind that will be hurt my by actions. Tough shit. There's a few people of which I *hope* what I'm going to do will fuck them up.
* My preferred method changed from drug cocktail to shooting to hanging. Shooting isn't an option because acquiring a gun here is ridiculously hard. Hanging is preferred to a drug cocktail, because it's more disturbing to the people most likely to find me. Hanging is done from an attic window. I have an old bed as a counterweight. Rope, with noose, is prepared. Suitable length for my height and weight computed. It's at least as good as I can get it given the information I could find.

I'm sick and tired of people telling me crap like ""chemical imbalance"" and ""irrational decision"". Fuck you. Life consists of good things and bad things, and the good doesn't even come close to outweighing the bad for me. I don't care that there's some girl I'm going to meet, or some incredibly rewarding activity I'm going to miss out on. It's all pointless hedonism. None of it is permanent. We're specks of dust. We get born, go through a load of crap, and die. I want to skip the load of crap part.

I'm sick and tired of random people telling me they ""love"" me, when they ostensibly haven't met me and have no clue what I'm like.

Other than that, AMA. ~~Limited time offer.~~

I've been thinking about my life, and everything I've done, and it just doesn't seem worth it to continue. I'm not seriously suicidal or anything, but I think about it all the time. It feels like everyone's laughing at me, and that I'm just here for their amusement. I'm a living joke, even to me.

I'm unemployed, single, and living at home. At 20 years old.

It just makes me feel like I haven't done anything with my life. I tried applying to Best Buy for the sixth or seventh time, and for the sixth or seventh time, I was turned down because I didn't pass their stupid fucking test. I've applied everywhere else. Even McDonald's. No one will have me.

Without money, I can't rightly take anyone out anywhere. I can't go out and try to meet someone, because if I do, they'll ask me what I do, and if I say 'I'm unemployed,' it won't go over well for me. I blew everything I had on my ex-girlfriend, Rebecca, and she repaid me by calling me a stalker and throwing all of these guys' pictures in my face. Guys she thought were cute. I shouldn't have spent all the money I had on her.

I'm horrendously out of shape, I've been trying to get into a regular exercise regimen, but I just can't do it. Everything I do seems to yield no results, despite the fact that I only do it for about five days and then decide, ""Fuck it.""

My friends tell me I'm good at writing, but I can't put any stories down on paper without wondering if it's well enough for publication, and I end up trashing whatever I've done.

I'm not good at music, despite taking lessons for five years.

I just bought a few books for school, but even that's lost its appeal to me, and I haven't gone yet. It seems as though everything is just so tarnished and disgusting, and I want to start over, but there's no reset button.

It's as if people look at me and say, ""at least I'm not him."" That's the person I consider myself to be in my group of friends. I've had people ask me if I want to talk about it, and I've read all the 'tomorrow will be better' stuff, but that doesn't make me feel any better.

A few months ago I signed up to do the ""Out of the Darkness Overnight"" which is a 20 mile walking fundraiser for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  

**Anyway, I only have 3 more days to try and reach the goal to participate of one thousand dollars.  I'm only about $200 away,   and I know that I can make this, I just need a little help.  I am asking for donations , large or small, every dollar makes a difference.  If 20 people donate $10, then I will reach my goal!**

I would like to let you know my story.  I read SW pretty much everyday, but rarely respond because I am shy/afraid to.  

I have been seeing a therapist for over a year now, and have changed very much.  I haven't really made any of the physical changes I would like to make to my life, but the way I think about things is changing.  I still haven't figured it all out yet, and I am still figuring out who I am, and from what I have realized, I really really like myself.  It's weird to say that.  Therapy has definitely helped me to notice things about myself that make me who I am, and are these really great qualities that you don't find in many people.  Things that I have always felt made me weak, or a pushover, or oversensitive, or a failure, are really things that I should be proud of and embrace.  I am shy, I am quiet, I am empathetic, and that's a good thing.  You know? 

For me, I desperately needed to go on antidepressants.  I was an emotional wreck, and have been so for at least 10-15 years.  Ups and downs, and panic attacks, and rage, and everything was out of control. My thoughts were so jumbled, and most of them were negative, self-demeaning thoughts.  Each thought had an emotion tied to it.  And I could think myself sick.  So toning everything down with Zoloft was a freakin godsend.

After that, for about a year, I did what the psych. calls CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy).  This is where you start to identify your negative thoughts and look at them logically.  this was really hard.  I like to deny things, and I really had to disagree with myself for a few months.  I wrote everything down, then rationalized it, and realized that the things I believed about myself weren't true.  This was so different from how it was before I started.

Then I started to try and work on my weight.  This is a big deal with me, because I have been overweight all of my life.  I hit a serious wall, and started skipping sessions and got into a bit of a slump.  

I changed doctors, and started a new approach.  I think that I have most of my negative thoughts under control now, so we went into the psychodynamic therapy, where you actually talk about your life and stuff.  It's not fun.  But she asks the right questions, and now since I don't have the overlying thoughts of failure, I can actually see what happened without all the negativity attached to it.  

**Anyway, I really want to do this walk/fundraiser so that I can help others who may have problems with depression or anxiety just like I do.  I never imagined how helpful therapy could be, I wish I had started sooner.  It can really change your life, and I want people to get help if they need it.**

Below is a link to my fundraising page:

[Fran Doerr's Fundraising Page](http://www.theovernight.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=extranet.personalpage&amp;confirmid=10013790)

If you can help, thanks.  If not, that's fine.  I *can* pay the remaining balance on the day of the walk.  I would like to be able to say that I did raise the money, rather than bail myself out.  Either way, I'm going to walk, and can honestly say I did my best at fundraising.

Thanks for your support!

Introduction to you about me: I'm a 17 year old boy, going to high school. Recently (last year or two) I've started to hate myself for absolutely stupid reasons (calling myself an idiot etc). I'm also skipping quite a lot of my classes for one specific course (something like 25-30/70 classes so far this semester) and as a result I have a really low grade in that course. I was planning to end it before the semester was finished. And I also broke my monitor the other day because of pent-up emotions. 

My mom walked in today and I quickly turned off my monitor because I didn't want to tell her that I broke my monitor from punching it. So she asked me why I was nervous and scared. I told her nothing was wrong and she tells me that I could tell her anything.

1359840550.0,38,self.SuicideWatch,17rszp,Friends believes that his penis is 'destroyed' - an fear that is tearing his family apart. Does anybody have stories to share about BDD? (Body Dysmorphic Disorder),44,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17rszp/friends_believes_that_his_penis_is_destroyed_an/,"My friend/GF's brother (20M) has severe Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). His form of the disorder is focused on his penis.
He has the (false) belief that his penis is 'destroyed', and 'broken'.

The source of his anxiety is the idea that one day, he will be having sex with a girl, and will experience rejection because of how his penis operates and looks.

Mainly, however, he is anxious about how it operates. Since he developed BDD, he has been in one serious relationship, and had only a few sexual encounters with the girl. During these encounters he never climaxed, which makes things worse.
The relationship fell apart about a year ago...mostly because he is a complete train wreck.

He mastrubates about 5-8 times a day - effectively, he is NOT doing it for pleasure, but to CHECK that everything is working properly down there. By ""working"", I mean that his penis becomes erect quickly, and that he is capable of climaxing. (It's basically a fear of erectile dysfunction).
Through this, he completely tires out his penis to the point that he cannot climax any more, which worsens his anxiety...causing him to mastrubate more....It's a horrible cycle.

I met him a few years ago and we became friends. While he was getting ill with the disorder, I happened to fall for his sister and we've been together now for three years.
He shares with me, the general things about his struggles - but usually when he opens up about these things, he is in a good mood, and so I don't hear the worst of it.

However, through his sister (my GF), I hear about every drama that goes on in the house due to his BDD.
He wakes up every day, and the first thing he does is turn to his pornography, to try and stimulate himself enough to masturbate a few times. Eventually his penis stops working, he calls his mom, and his mom tries to calm him down.

His mom often, unintentionally, aggrevates him and he starts yelling, and falling into despair. This is not as common, but about once every two or three weeks he will grab some knives from the kitchen and threaten to kill himself with them. 
Verbally, he threatens with suicide (to his parents), extremely often.

My GF and I, both believe, that the talks of suicide are simply threats to his parents to make them feel bad. I believe this because he has never made a serious attempt on his life, or ever to harm himself even moderately. (as is often the case for people with BDD, he is terrified of pimples and cuts). However, this may be just a really bad idea, and completely untrue...
In my eyes, his mother is completely enabling his disorder on those days that he has bad moods. She is always there waiting to talk to him about how his penis is ok, and everything is going to be ok, but eventually - it all breaks apart. The mother allows him to bully her and treat her like shit. 

Yesterday, he started physically pushing his mom around in their kitchen - with a lot of force, while screaming at her. Then my GF tried to talk some sense into him and calm him down, and he grabbed a pencil and held it to her throat - obviously threatening her with it.

He let go eventually, and left the house....but what is left now? A terrorized family. My girlfriend, who I love dearly, is shattered every single time he has one of his episodes. I know that he didn't hurt any one, but that he threatened the people he loves? I am scared and angry. I don't recognize this person.

If you have read this far into my story, THANK YOU, sincerely.
I am so tired of him and his shit, and bringing every one down. It has come to the point that when he has a bad day - that I end up having a bad day too, because I hear about everything from my girlfriend and her family. It obviously brings them all down.

Does anyone have ANY experiences they can share about BDD? Does anybody have any internet links they can share with me about this SPECIFIC kind of BDD?
His kind of BDD is very rare, I believe something like 1% of all people with BDD have it this form of the disorder. There's a lot on the internet about BDD, but I really can find almost NOTHING about his kind. And his kind is so different from the other ones...

If anyone can tell me anything, it would mean the world to me. I am so tired of every one being brought down by him. Call me out if you think that I have a wrong idea about anything I have written above...

Thank you.

See, before my birth, nobody asked me if I wanted a life. This is because of the obvious practical implications. At the point in my life where it can be said that I was first able to consider my existence properly, it was already too late. I have already become tangled in a net of people who care. Their purest wishes, for which I cannot fault them, coerce me into a life that I do not want. For if they were to stop caring, and if I could put myself where nobody would have the distress of discovering my body, I would not even hesitate.

And there is anger, because I do not want a life. I do not want to put in the effort that it would take to process myself through therapy and become a functional human being. I am not saying that it is impossible for me to be happy. I feel that if I were to co operate with such entities, and have us work together to fix myself, I would likely become happy and productive. What I am actually saying is that I do not want it. I do not want to improve myself, nor do I want to cause distress. Given that I am not willing to compromise on my wishes, there can be no movement in this. I am angry like a trapped beast, because that is what I am. So I am angry only at myself. My pitiful, weak, ridiculous self. Maybe that is the cruellest trick fate has dealt me. The weakness, neither to improve myself nor to end myself. Simply to be here as a...

...COMPLETE ASS.

But those handful of people who I have spoken to seem to think that the medical profession has some answer. They seem to think that, if I went to a doctor, they would change my mind. No, I'd have to co operate, I'd have to want to change, and I do not. All I want is something that is impossible. All I want is to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it.

i guess a note would go to friends or loved ones but i have no one left, everyone has abandoned me or i pushed them away. i want my short story to be heard by someone who will care at least a little bit, so my farewell goes to you.

i want you to know that this decision to end my life is not a momentary irrational decision. i've tried to kill myself twice in the past 6 months, but before i tell you at them i will explain why i am.

i am almost 30, i consider half of my live - the supposed to be good half, to be over and lost.

my dreams and life ambitions were either lost or taken away from me. as a kid i dreamt of being a dancer or actress. i took dance classes throughout my childhood but eventually had to give them up when i grew large boobs which caused issues with dancing and gave me self image problems. at the end of highschool i revealed myself as bisexual to my parents, my father was always strict and overprotective, he thought my sexual orientation was wrong and kicked me out of home. i moved into the city with little money or aspirations. i eventually picked up a job as a waitress in a club and was soon spotted by a photographer. i became a model and have modeled since until recently.

at 21 i found out that i was infertile and unable to carry child.i was devastated by the news, children and pregnancy in general became a taboo topic to talk about when around me by friends, i felt alienated and left out, having children became another dream i had to abandon

 i had been in a lot of relationships, all of them had been non-serious short term flings for fun, but at 23 i met matthew and feel madly and crazily in love with him, he didn't know until i told him at the end of the year at a new years eve party. we ended up dating for a year, he proposed and we were engaged for another year. we married. at this point our relationship was described by us and all our friends has a fairytale, everything seemed and felt so perfect. life could not get any worse.

but that was so wrong, my mother died in a car crash in 2009 after surviving cancer, at her funeral i saw my father for the first time in almost 4 years, we didn't speak.

matt expressed his desire to have children, he knew that i was infertile but we still decided to have a go, we tried a lot of things but nothing worked for us. it was upsetting for him, but he seemingly moved on from it. we were still happy and in love with each other.

at the beginning of 2011 he confessed to me that he still had his desire for having a family with children, and so he had started cheating on me. the other women he was with was pregnant, and that was the only reason why he suddenly had the heart to tell me. i was shattered and betrayed. we had a huge fight that day and broke up. i fell into depression but at that time did not feel suicidal. my depression changed who i am, friends slowly abandoned me to continue being friends with him or because i wasnt fun to be around any more.

at the beginning of this year we finally divorced (it takes 12 months of separation before you can file in australia), he took almost everything in the settlement. i got to keep the house and a small amount of money. i could of kept more, but at this point i really didnt care about anything and didnt fight for anything in the settlement.


6 months ago i tried to commit twice. the first time i overdosed on my anti depressants that werent working at all and other medicines i could find around my house, i would have died then if my housemate hadn't gotten up early for work. i was rushed to a hospital only 20 minutes away and on arrival was barely conscious and having respiratory failure. i spent 3 days in hospital in a psychiatric ward.

when i was released i stopped eating and sleeping, 2 days later i tried to kill myself again by cutting my inner thigh with a razor, it only sliced my skin and didnt go nearly deep enough to cause anything serious enough to let me bleed out. i decided that this attempt was a bad idea, not because i decided i wanted to live but because the method was stupid and that my next attempt should be well planned in advance. i had my housemate take me back to hospital and lied about the cut being from an accident.

as i had tried to od earlier in the week i was moved back into a psych ward, i was moved out a few days later into a general ward in another hospital for 2 weeks as i still refused to eat properly.

2 months ago and i begun planning this final attempt. while im okay with my death i know my few remaining friends would not be so i have slowly cut off ties and driven each one of them away. i have lied and pretended to be happy to almost everyone.

last month would of been our 4th wedding anniversary, instead it was their childs birthday and their wedding.

they are happy, my friends are happy, everyone else is happy, but i am left here alone, in hell for 2 years unable to sleep each night, left with dark thoughts and voices whenever im not distracting myself with video games or movies. no one cares for me, i don't care for them, i dont care for continuing.

today i will finish what i started. i will take my car, without my phone or any id and park out somewhere by the train tracks. i will lay down on the rails and peacefully wait for the next train that comes every hour. the sound of it approached will be bliss to my ears before im released from this hell.

i wont be back to read any comments, farewell.

I have been meaning to post this for a while, I am subscribed to r/depression and r/suicidewatch, but I have not known how to help.

When I was 13 I nearly jumped out of my bedroom window. At the last moment I put my hands up and held onto the window frame. I had no friends, smelled bad as I didn't wash and I was surviving on one meal a day (dinner). I also slept for about one hour a night.

This was not due to neglect, but was a result of depression and feelings of self loathing brought on by some childhood problems.

Since that moment, I swore never to attempt suicide again. Although I self harmed after this, I knew that I would never take my own life. 

Things did not improve for me properly until I was old enough for sixth form, when I was surrounded by other people who were as geeky as I was. 

During my teacher training my granddad died and I found everything too difficult to cope with. I sought help at the university counselling service and completed a series of CBT, focussed on the childhood problems I had suffered. I found this to be very helpful.

I am now a fully qualified teacher and happily married, renting a great flat. If you had told my 13 year old, smelly, malnourished, spotty, lonely, geeky, sleep deprived self what his future held, he never would have believed you.

I have a doctor's appointment on the 29th. I'm going to ask for antidepressants and a referral for mental health care. I've been waiting two months for this appointment but I feel like I'm going to chicken out and not go. I don't feel like the doctor will believe the severity of my distress. It's happened before. 

In order to leave the house, I get myself really psyched up to shower, dress, make my way there and sound like a reasonable, coherent human being. I look so normal and sound so calm as I tell him about the oversleeping, the overeating, the irritability, the angry outbursts, how I can barely concentrate long enough to get through a newspaper article, much less an entire book. There's the porn that I *do not* plan on telling him about that makes me feel good for a while, until it's over and I feel pathetic. Seriously, my chest hurts I feel so bad afterwards.

What I can't say or am afraid to say is that I don't see a way out of the sadness this time. I think I've been depressed all of my life and I have tried a half-assed treatment here and there.

I was physically, sexually, mentally, and emotionally abused in that place that has since been shut down for it's violations. I saw other kids die there. I barely survived myself. It was worse than I could ever describe. I have had severe PTSD ever since. Terrible, constant nightmares, flashbacks, depression, fear, all of that stuff. For so many years now. I've tried so many different things but I just cannot turn my mind to anything but my past trauma. And even though I believe in my mind that what was done to me was wrong and not my fault, I have never stopped feeling completely worthless and subhuman and like I do not deserve anything good in my life. I have always been told that I cannot recover from PTSD unless I go back to the same sorts of people and places who gave it to me in the first place, and this terrifies me. Despite my fear I believe there must be somebody out there with the desire and the ability to help someone like me. But I doubt I will ever find one in the outpatient mental health centers for low-income, uninsured people like me.

I replied I did not wish to go to a psych ward and was fine with waiting a month. Then she astonished me by suddenly declaring ANGRILY that she was committing me against my will. I said I did not think it was right or legal to do that to someone who is not homicidal or suicidal. She told me she could report me as suicidal and no one was going to believe any different from someone like me!!!! And she called security to take me away. I was only held for four days before a dr. saw me and said, ""There's no reason for you to be here."" But during that short time I lost my place in the nursing assistant training program I had been working so hard for, my grandmother had a stroke and no one could get a hold of me before she died, all my childhood trauma was ripped open again, and I lost the only feeling of security in this world- the assurance that I would never again be abused in my adult life the way I was as a child. I was not suicidal two years ago when this was done to me, but I have felt increasingly suicidal ever since. I feel being dead is the only way I will ever stop hurting, and the only way to make sure I am not going to be hurt again.

I fall under the latter. Everything about me spells normal college student; I have friends, I do college things, I can carry conversations okay. But the difference is my face. I have bad skin post-acne, and this disgusting bump on my nose. The contours of my jaw lines are rather pudgy, so it makes matters worse. People can’t look at me, or rather they love to stare at me when they assume I am not looking. Today this gregarious fellow I met couldn’t stop starring at me beneath his fingers, and every time he realized I noticed him, he shook his head in disgust. People do this to me all the time. People always look away. The worst part is, I am really ugly, but not enough to be considered a freak or physically impaired, so people have to keep their repulsion to theirselves around me. 

This girl I was love with, I love to talk to. But if the lighting is bad (florescent, natural overcast day) she can’t even face me. My relationships with people is entirely contigent on how well the lighting is for me.

This girl broke my heart, as have others before her. But I really liked this one, and there is nothing more heart-wrenching then to know that the obstacle between our relationship’s intimacy depends on something that is both out of our control, and something that could never be fixed. To know I can never spend the rest of my life with her, because of this face, not because of attitude change, makes me find no point in living the rest of this life under that realization.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_hrfm3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hrfm3/too_ugly_for_love/,

I think about killing myself at least 20 times a day... I may go for a week or so where it seems I think about it less, but the thoughts never fully go away. I've been severely depressed and anxious since I was 12 years old (10 years). I got bullied pretty bad starting in 6th grade... it was mostly racially based stuff... destroyed what little confidence and self esteem I had. I remember being 12 and just begging god to kill me because I was too much of a pussy to do it... 

Ever since I've been terrified of social situations. Just talking or being around people throws me into a panic attack. I usually spend most of my time alone in my room doing nothing. Whenever I have to talk to someone my mind just goes blank.. this even happens with what little friends I do have. There are people I know I should be good friends with, but I just feel an immense feeling of awkwardness from both parties... makes me just want to avoid social situations... I can't talk to my classmates and I don't even know how the hell I'm supposed to survive in a real job...
 
With the intense social anxiety you can imagine I'd have problems finding a girlfriend... It doesn't matter. I'm a pederast. Tried gay sex... didn't like it. Had sex with girls... didn't like it either. I never talk about sex or girls and I'm pretty sure everyone thinks I'm in the closet or something. It puts me in an awkward situation. I'd never hurt a kid, but I mean really I feel like I'm a danger to society and everyone would be better of with me dead.

I'm not a stupid person... have a decent IQ, but I just can't do work. I'm so lazy. I have no motivation to do anything. NOTHING. This probably due to the years of depression. My mind is almost always in a fog.. I forget things constantly. Got tested for learning disorders, but came up clean. By the time I graduate college it would have taken me nearly 6 years to get a BA in film. I don't even like film. I have no idea how I got stuck here, but because of my loans and financial aid I can't switch and I have to stick with it. This presents several problems. I can't handle social situations and if I want to make it in this industry or at least graduate I have to be good with people... something that I simply can't do. Also film is expression of yourself... but I don't want to show anybody what is really inside of me... they'll find out what a sick twisted fuck I am. 

I've tried to kill myself... I had a bad social interaction in my dorm and decided to swallow all my meds (150 pills)... I failed... I was put in a psych ward for a week and came back and got two year long pity party... yay.. I switched schools.

There was a very brief time where I felt good with my life.... I was going through a manic episode for a couple months... It was the first time in my life where I could talk to anybody without feeling like I was going to die. I found out what self esteem was like... my god I thought I had finally came out of my shell, but no. I was just crazy. Anyway this rant has gone on long enough. 

Someone tell me why I should live? There is no magic pill out there that's going to make everything sunshine and rainbows. Therapy has never helped me. I admit some of my problems could be probably improved somewhat, but their root is ingrained in me and I will always be broken. 

TL;DR: I'm a socially inept pedophile with severe depression and anxiety that has lasted nearly half my life.

1295195656.0,33,self.SuicideWatch,f3b95,Today my wife told me she didn't love me anymore and wants a divorce,36,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f3b95/today_my_wife_told_me_she_didnt_love_me_anymore/,"We've been married for 5 years, we met online, i'm enligsh in spain, she's peruvian. We decided it would be best for her to move here due to the better economy, but it was a pain getting her paperwork in order for residency status so we decided to get married which would speed the process up alot, we were desperate to be together. Looking back i ofcourse realise that was the wrong reason to get married but we really felt we loved each other enough, we'd been together for 5 months.

 I got a mortgage and bought her a house, i wanted her to have as much as i could give her, this was my first house also (i'm 32 she's 28), the first year was great, i had great fun taking her everywhere i could think of, i showed her off as much as i could, i was so proud of my wife i wanted everyone to see and know her. 

We did have a problem in the first year that she fell pregnant, at the time i didn't feel ready to be a father but would have stepped up to the responsability, she wanted a big fancy religious wedding as we'd only been married in an office and i told her that with a child she couldn't have that expensive wedding, she chose to abort. 

 Something i'll live to regret till the day i die.

Later that year i caught her chatting online and planning to meet up with another guy when she travelled back to peru, we had a big fight and everything but we sorted it out. her reasons were that i didn't pay her enough attention. At the time i thought i did but promised to change, which i did.

My mother has been a big factor in the problems, she's very dominating, has to have her say and sticks her nose in everything. I'm a coward and have never stood up for my wife against my mum infront of her, i have had loads of arguements behind the scenes with my mum to leave her alone. She tells me what to do constantly also, she lives 20 mins away.

Over time i became obsessed with reforming the house, thinking i was bettering it for our enjoyment, adding a jacuzzi, bbq, nice garden etc, doing it all myself. Consuming up all my time. I realise now that even though i alwayd asked her opinion on everything i put it in a way that she had to chose from my choises. I've always handled the money, she's not best at it and i'm quite good. We've never been rich but have saved up a little which we decided ti buy some land in peru to build on to sell.

the last years of the marriage we'd have lots of arguements, i'd get angry at small errors she made, even though she made lots of them, we worked together and i'm unfortunately a perfectionist.

Every majour arguement we had i'd promise to change what she was telling me she didn't like about me, and i did, i don't think it was enough but i did my best.

my whole life has been dedicated to my wife, doing as much for her as i could.

last year she went to peru and returned depressed, a big arguement ensued where she said she missed her family too much and she needed them. I promised her we would move to peru to live, we agreed to work towards that goal, and the land we bought would be the doorway to financially allow us to move.

During the last year then i've worked hard to finish what i had started on our house here, i would try and make time to take her out once a week for a long day out. There were many occasions at the end of a day's work she'd ask me to go out for dinner but i was always shattered, i'd say if she'd told me sooner i'd have worked less to have the energy to go out. She says she is more sociable than i am and needed to go out more and would always have the energy for that.

she says i didn't intergrate with her family enough, she's just been back to peru and said people made fun of her because she was always the single one even though she was married, i wasn't able to take alot of time off work to go to peru, also we had agreed to improve our lives and move back to peru so she went back for 2 months with every penny we had to build the house to sell, for me it was my single objective, getting the ball rolling to have the security and funds to go to peru.

She says that may be so but she needed me, she cried for help from me, all she wanted was me, not material things, not a fancy house which i've done up, she only wanted me, and to spend time with her parents, and religious wedding which she dreemed of even if only a simple one, she'd rather not built the house and used some of the money for me to spend xmas with her and her family, i stayed here with my mum.

She has come back and after a day sat me down to say she no longer loves me, that my actions have slowly chipped away at the love she had for me and now there's nothing left. She said she'll stay a while to help with work and once the house is sold in peru she'll go back to reinvest and continue building, that she would like to continue a business relationship with me.

I know it's all my fault, but i really did try and change to how she wanted me, we agreed on this project to move back to peru but apparently she didn't want that, she only wanted me, i don't understand why she didn't tell me directly. I'm obviously not good at reading signals.

I'm absolutely devastated, my chest hurts, it feels like my heart has been ripped out, my sole reason for waking up was my wife.

I don't know what to  do???

In the night i wrote out a suicide note, and left it under my pillow, drove to my dads grave who died 10 years ago to the day yesterday when she told me, guess 15 is unlucky for me, i have mixed emotions, i don't want to die, but i also don't to feel this pain. I know it's for atention, i would have killed myself by now if i had real intentions as the pain is so bad, but i'm lost, i don't know what to do.

I'm very shy, i live in a place where people come and go, i have many people i know but no real friends, whilst she was gone for 2 months i was so sad being alone, and now i'm going to be alone again becuase she's leaving me. I love her so much i can't bear it.


i don't know what to do, i can't see myself without her. I can't stop crying.

Sometimes I would feel fine for a few days and then any random thing would spiral me into a deep depth of hopelessness. After weeks, no-months, of almost randomly becoming immobile and nonfunctional,  I finally decided to find a shrink. Imagine my pain when their assistant called the day before the appointment and canceled on me. Days later I found myself in another hours long panic attack with shooting chest pains and sky high blood pressure. Finally I hauled myself to a local University's free/cheap counseling clinic. An hour later a therapist (phd) had me calmed down enough to assure me that this could be dealt with. That was yesterday. Today I got my prescriptions for xanax and a ptsd med filled and had the first normal-feeling day in, in I don't even know anymore. I saw a post a few minutes ago saying that /r/suicidewatch has been flooded lately and was inspired to finally make an account for the 1st time ever. THERE IS HOPE OUT THERE.

A little over 3 years ago I was married, employed, making lots of money ($160k/yr), in a respectable career, living in a very nice large comfortable house in a nice neighborhood. I was a soccer coach for my kids, I shoveled the neighbor's walk, I went to church, I gave to charity, I volunteered. I had hobbies. I helped family members with their problems. I had friends. I was living a good life, I thought, and I was thankful. I used to thank God that my family was healthy and everyone got along.  

Today I don't want to show my face.   I'm divorced, and live 2400 miles away from my four children (7,11,12,14).  I haven't spoken to them in 10 months.  I live in my sister's basement.  I've not left the house in 14 days.  I haven't shaved in 3 weeks.  I haven't gotten a haircut in 3 months. I'm broke. I guess I'm maybe $30,000 in debt. (legal fees and credit cards).  I'm unemployed. I'm behind on my child support payments, and I think I'll never catch up. They took my driver's license because I haven't made payments. I hate my life. I escape by watching movies.   I am a bum.  A loser, in a very real sense.  But I also look exactly like you would think a loser would look. 

I can't sleep. I sleep about 3 hours a night on a good night. I weep every day. I can't work like this. I left my job because I was letting everyone down, totally distracted.

I want to quit. I gave it a good shot, and now I feel done. The only reasons I don't leave this life  - first, I'm a coward; and second I think it would be hurtful to my kids, who are still my kids even though I haven't spoken to them in 10 months. 

How did I get here?  I still don't understand it.  My wife had an affair with my best friend, who wasn't such a good friend after all.  He and his wife were our ""best friends"" - they had kids, we had kids.  We went on family vacations together, had dinner at each other's houses regularly. We spent a lot of time together. A little over 3 years ago, the secret came out.  I didn't want a divorce, I mean, we had four kids. I encouraged her to go to counseling with me, to reconcile. She was reluctant. Her family and my family encouraged her as well.  She went, but secretly continued to see him. 

She eventually walked out of counseling, filed for divorce, and during that proceeding, alleged that I abused the kids. The courts believed her. She lied about my income. The courts believed her. Based on those lies, I was locked out of the house. My legal advice told me to rent a house, if I had any hope of getting shared custody.  I didn't have the money, because I was paying for the family house.  But I borrowed and rented a house anyway.  She stayed in the house, but refused to get a job. Eventually the bank foreclosed. 

Based on her accusations, the court ordered me to not contact the kids for a year. By that time,  the relationship I had with my kids was permanently damaged.  Every court I walked into looked at me like I was a criminal. 
In the end I lost all custody of the kids, all parenting rights although I have ""visitation rights"".  The word makes me want to throw up.  I am allowed to ""visit"" my children!  I got saddled with a child support payment I cannot make.  

I feel like I am permanently damaged.

I feel like I should talk to someone, but I can't do it.  Months ago, I scheduled an appointment with a counselor through Catholic charities (free), but 3 hours before the appointment, I called to cancel it. I'm afraid now. I had been court-ordered into a DV offenders group - it was horrible enough to me that I am now afraid of any therapist or counselor.

Every week I'd walk in and I'd have to confess how I abused people that week.  At that time I wasn't seeing my kids, wasn't allowed to speak with them. I'd go to work and then go to my apartment, and not interact with people otherwise. And I'd say that, and the counselor would insist I was in denial, that I had in fact abused someone that week, and I wasn't admitting it.  The other guys would talk about how they picked fist fights with people, or swore at customer service people on the phone, or how they insulted perfect strangers waiting in line at the bank, or how they called their wives ""fat ugly bitch"" that week. I couldn't believe I was in that group.  None of those things were me. They'd tell stories about slapping their wives and threatening to kill them. I never did this. I felt so lost and out of place. So wrongly accused.  I never did those things and never had anything good to confess to, so they eventually kicked me out of the program for being in denial. 

I went to another counselor, because it was mandatory if I hoped to get custody of my kids.  I was very upset about how things had gone, I was crying in her office. She asked me if I planned to kill my ex-wife and children. Oh My God. The world is crazy. 

The whole frigging world is crazy. The people I had depended on have abandoned me.  First my ex-wife, who compounded abandonment by accusing me.  Then, the new people I was depending on for help - the professionals - have accused me or expressed suspicion.  This is not me.  I'm not abusive, and I'm not killing anybody.  But despite that I've still lost everything. 

----

When I go to church now, I cry.  I have always thought of myself as a family man, and church reminds me of my family.  Now that family is gone.

I feel like I am not made for this world. Or maybe I am, but my fate is to be one of those who gets chewed up, crushed. Someone who other people can look at and say ""there but for the grace of God go I.""  

I know many people who lived like I lived. They have spouses and mortgages and yards and leaf-blowers. They go to baseball games and do homework with their kids.  They take family vacations, and save for college, and that's enough.  I was content with those things, I didn't envy anyone. I felt extremely lucky.  But all that is gone for me, out of reach.  Even when the divorce was inevitable, I thought I'd get through it, we'd make separate lives, she'd get a job and we'd share custody.  I think at some point she decided she couldn't tolerate sharing custody.  So out came the allegations. 

They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but I don't see my problems as temporary.  I've lost all the things I had organized my life around. 

----

I've never been suicidal.  When I was younger I didn't feel my problems were so serious.  I've never made a plan.  

But now I don't know how to ever get on the good side of life again.  I can't see living through 5 more years of this hell. 

I don't look forward to anything, not in the near term, nor in the long term.  I used to have hopes and dreams - but it all was taken from me so easily, I'm afraid to hope for anything anymore.

In this state I feel like I've done all I can.   It would be true mercy for me to get run over by a car, or some other accident.  My kids would feel sad but not guilty.  I'd be excused from taking action.  Problem solved.

I don't really see the appeal in living anymore. It's a tad bit funny because I'm actually in DBT. It is a program that I was required to take after being discharged from the hospital.

Feeling pretty shitty, needing help of how to deal with it.",36,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cht5j/sister_tried_to_off_herself_last_night_feeling/,"So last night my mom and my sister had a pretty big argument. Not exactly sure what started it since I was taking a shower at the time. When I walked out of the shower, I heard my sister crying hysterically (we share the same room right now). So I went downstairs because I am honestly that shitty person that does not know how to comfort people. So I figured I'd leave her alone rather than make things worse. 

Eventually my mom barges in the room and asks why she's crying. This wasn't done with a comforting tone by the way. She seemed pissed that she was crying and was yelling at her already. So of course they start to argue intensely and at some point my mom says quite aggressively that her and I are terrible children, have bad attitudes and she doesn't know how we ended up like this and who do we think we are acting like this blah blah blah. 

Note to all, we don't do drugs, we have good grades (I've had straight As all throughout high school with AP classes. I'm currently a junior and number 2 in my entire 2014 class regarding GPA ranking), we don't get into trouble, the typical ""goody good"" children. I admit that we can both be real brats sometimes but at least I acknowledge it. My mom doesn't seem to be willing to admit any fault for the way our relationship is. 

My mom also attacked my sister in terms of religion, which I think may have done the most damage. I'm a pretty passive Christian, but my sister on the other hand holds her religion closely. My mom was attacking her, asking if she's even a Christian with the way she's acting. Eventually she just stopped talking and let my mom say whatever else it is she wanted to say. My mom stormed out eventually and I finally went in my room. I didn't know what to do so I just put a blanket on her while she was sitting on the floor and rubbed her back a bit. A few minutes later she gets up and grabs what I assumed was a bottle of pills. 

This is where I feel fucking shitty about my useless self. I heard the rattle of the pills but I knew she wasn't the type of person to. I figured, she would never do something like that so I didn't go after her and let her have her space, thinking she just needed to cool off. I really should have gone after her... She wouldn't be in the ER right now and my family wouldn't be crumbling more than it already has been the entirety of our lives. I'm going to visit her tomorrow after school but I have no idea what to say. My mom has no interest whatsoever in seeing her. I just don't know what to do. I want to help but I'm afraid I can't. I don't want to make things worse. I hope someone here can give me advice on what to say to her. Because I'm pretty useless right now. I know it's pathetic and that is what I feel like. But I want to do something. Anything. 

Can you guys help me help my sister? 

EDIT: Thank you so much for the responses everyone. Seriously, I appreciate it. Knowing that even random strangers on the Internet can care really is comforting. I talked to my sister's friend that took her to the ER and visited her today. She said that my sister doesn't want me to see her in her current state. I really want to go to her sooner than later though. So I think I'll still visit. It doesn't seem like she'd be mad about it.

My little sister (she's 16) left her google drive account open by accident- I was nosy and read some of her stuff. There's about seven pages of all the ways she could commit suicide. I've noticed she's lost a lot of weight, her grades dropped from A's to B's recently, and she stays in her room. 
Our mom was recently diagnosed with cancer, and my dad may be getting laid off soon. We have a lot on our plates, do you think I should try to get her a therapist or call a hospital? Or is this not a big deal? I have no idea how to respond. I can post more if requested. Heres some of it: 
The solid, smooth feel of the hand gun stowed in the coat is comforting, the heart races just a bit faster as I contemplate the meaning of existence yet again, to become a god! Complete, utter control over the thing I hold most sacred to my breast, the very notion of life! It makes life so precious, when one can fully accept that it can easily end in seconds. Precious is the sound of rains, the slender figures of trees in my peripheral visions, the scents of the grasses bending and flattening in the torrential pours. There is an inescapable beauty to feel the utmost control, the rawest power over your own realities.
I walk, without hurry, down the muddied paths of the nearby park to the farthest point from the flooded parking lot, surrounded by the beckoning trees, protecting, looming over me. I call 911 and whisper my location. ""I will pull the guns trigger in two minutes time, please clean my bloodied head as much as you can before returning it to my family."" I would turn the phone off, and watch it fall to the ground as if in slow motion, sinking in a mud puddle. 
I take off my jacket and fully embrace the rains, and the winds that were carried in gusts for miles. No longer would I be able to differentiate between the natural rains, and my flowing tears, just accept it, accept the entire world, the rains soaking through my very skins, accept life as an insubstantial, temporary form, the true beauties of nature and far off mysterious universes remaining. Lifting my arms far above my head, a hand cupped to caress the elements, the other clenching the gun, I would scream, my very soul allowing an overwelming torrent of the deepest emotions and energies, ""THIS, TRULY, IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE! LIFE IS SO PRECIOUS."" Then I would pull the trigger next to my right temple, and sob as an immense echo of thunder rolls through my senses, my form gracefully falling to the ground.
Desperation and sudden violent urges often consume my mind, while sitting at my desk, bent over in frustration at the math homework. I often feel compelled to run downstairs, pull a plastic bag from the drawers near the back door, and retreat to the garage late at night. I would kneel on the cold cement floor, ignoring the long centipedes that scramble past frantically. Then I would begin to slam my head against the unforgiving floor, relishing the headache that quickly rings after, the solid feeling of all the circling thoughts disappearing at last. Slam, slam, over and over, til I see stars in the complete darkness, and feel the warmth of rushing blood collecting around my neck at the rubberband I had fastened beforehand, its metallic scent overpowering. I could collapse to the ground, and lose consciousness, the bag pulling in closer to my nostrils and half opened mouth with each deep breath
Staring at the student profile packet, in which I am supposed to write down all my achievements for the past three years, makes me most depressed- far more than I have ever felt. I try to avoid going out of my comfort zone, and have a lack of motivation for doing anything- even activities I used to enjoy. Everything is so overwhelming and tiring. This has been my daily reality for the past four years, no breaks. A long dark tunnel, with no escape, fingernails bloody from scratching at the curved walls- but there are no doors- nothing- just my panting and the ghostly laughters- just on and on- nothing-
Even the word 'feelings' causes a subconscious recoil, but I must admit- extreme feelings of guilt, insecurity, depression, worthlessness, and restlessness have plagued me. It's always there, always letting me know my efforts at writing and drawing are and always will be utterly futile. But now I am supposed to quantify this lethargy, and show it to the school, the world. People continue to ask what is wrong- I say nothing. I just want to be left alone! Left to my own devices! I don't want others to care for me, it makes the suicide that much worse! My parents look at me with such sadness- they are ashamed to have such an offspring, such laziness- squandering away all these opportunities to actually prove the potential I was born with. I deeply hate myself. Cutting no longer satisfies, because I know that eventually the knife will be put away, and I will have to deal with reality and myself yet again. If I hang myself next weekend during the night in the basement, no longer will people see me as a complete loser and idiot. My depression will be taken seriously, and my awful grades and motivation will be forgiven. Everyone dies eventually, and all that will remain is your name and the memories held by people who once knew you. With my current trajectory and depression, I will slowly fall to the bottom- impacting and burdening everyone around me. My name will be redeemed if I die now. Dragging it out is the last thing I want to do. My family will no longer feel ashamed by me, they can finally get on with their lives. I have fought for years- there is no hope. No hope. If someone else is reading this, and I am still alive- then perhaps I had enough hope to show you this- but trust what I say. There is no reason to even get better. I hate myself so deeply, the perfectionism is so consuming, I cannot process most foods from anxiety so everything must be restricted, I cannot force smiles for my parents and friends, my mind is numb and dull. My self control is wearing far too thin. Death seems like the only possible solution. What's the point of fighting for life if you eventually die? If you enjoy living, striving for goals, feeling proud of accomplishments and being in relationships, then perhaps life is for you. As for me, four years of fighting is far long enough. I'm ready to give up. It would be so easy and simple. Suicide ideations are becoming more and more pervasive. I cannot concentrate on reading novels once greatly enjoyed, nor can I listen to music. The clock is ticking, I am on borrowed time. I am so weak and unable to continue. . ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_1cck06,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cck06/please_read_i_need_advice_quickly/,

I hate all of it.
Ever since I was 5,i've hallucinated.
When I was in kindergarten though 3rd grade,I convinced myself everyone liked me. Even though I knew they didn't. I was that girl that was always cheerful and loud. But once I moved,I became anxious and was quickly put as an outcast. I hate it. I told a friend about my hallucination,another overheard. Everyone started to circle around me and make fun of me. My friend tried to help but it didn't work. Everyone I loved and knew lied to and/or betrayed me. I've lost touch of reality and never payed attention to anything. I started to fail my classes because I was too busy of thinking of how I should and when I should die. I keep thinking two opposite things at the same time. I started to hate my own talent.

I have no family here. My friends purport to care about me but I have not been invited anywhere for Christmas. My plan is to just dope myself up with sleeping pills and stay in bed the whole day with earplugs jammed in my ears.

I know I am pathetic, ""playing the victim""... I've heard all this shit before. Yes I tried to volunteer at places, but I've been put on waiting lists (please don't start with ""Oh, you should volunteer at other times of the year"" 'cause I do). I'd make a nice meal and distribute it to homeless, but I have 20 dollars to last me until the New Year. My family doesn't give a shit. I am staying off Facebook until the end of next month, if I can make it, because other people's happiness and nice gifts and pics with their family just reminds me that I'm forever alone.

I am feeling sorry for myself. I have suffered for so long. I think it is time to let go and do something that I want to do instead. Suicide is selfish, people will say, but I'm tired of being selfless.

Good night.

P.S. I don't act like this in real life. Like a bitter, hateful asshole. I keep these feelings bottled up. I am known as the quirky, caring, adorable person. It's all an act. So I'll just leave you with this:

I heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life is harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Doctor says, ""Treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go see him. That should pick you up."" Man bursts into tears. Says, ""But doctor... I am Pagliacci."" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum.

Only they all one by one abandoned me and now there are none left.  I have one person and they can't be with me because they have to work they have no choice.  No parents, my older brother(cousin, but more like protective brother) is gone.  And I'm bringing them down everyday and holding them back when they could be so much happier.  I want them to have a good life not be stuck taking care of me even helping me sit up in bed every morning and get things because I can't bend or stand up from sitting.  They are upset right now because of finances.  They do everything for me and they are sad they can't buy me a Christmas gift or anniversary gift even though I told them that doesn't matter they are the best gift ever.

I'm done.  I had 2 goals and dreams for my life and this disease took away BOTH of them.

I don't know what I want to do.  Do I punish myself again??  Do I just run away from everything and let them start fresh??  Do I just keep getting sicker until I rot away??  I don't do anything.  I'm useless.  Even my ""big brother"" is out of the fucking picture. me he was the only person that stood by me no matter what and never made me feel like a bad person.  He even made me smile all the time.

I can't stop crying nothing is working I'm a rambling fucking mess I don't want to be lonely.  I want friends who will visit me since I can't come to them.  I want to be better for my significant other and give them what they deserve.  Right now I just don't want to be in an empty house coughing and choking and not making sense.

I never did anythign wrong.  I took care of myself it was inheirited and I got the worst.  I was never a bad person.  I want somebody to just be a friend to me and help me figure out how to fix this.  To top everything off, I feel super sick and horrible and can't eat anything.

Please, just make it stop somebody.  I have a hard time reaching out I can't do it I might even come back and delete it because I don't want to complain to people.  I don't know.

Sorry for the length, I have no idea where else to turn to.",37,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xbpuw/suicidle_husband_sorry_for_the_length_i_have_no/,"Right now, I don't know where else to turn to. I should start with some back ground I guess.

He's 26, I'm 23. We've been married just under a year but we've been together for 9 years. He's always had emotional issues and comes from an unloving family environment. He's always refused to get any professional help for his issues. We've been going through a rough patch in our marriage and tonight it has come to a head.

Over the past few months, I've noticed him becoming more depressed. When I've asked him about it, he would tell me that he is stressed about work and that he was jealous of his friends and their success at the same place of business. He would then brush it off as just jealousy and he would work through it.

Things got worse though. He has started to distance him self from me when he used to be very affectionate. He got more and more depressed. When I asked him about it, he told me that he hated everything about his life except for me. He told me he wanted to make several drastic changes (abandon long loved hobbies, get rid of our beloved cats, buy a whole new wardrobe) and that he thought our marriage was a mistake but that he loves me and never wants to say goodbye to me. After lots of talking, he admitted that even if he made those changes, he would still be unhappy. Again he brushed it off as his frustrations at work and said he would work through it.

Tonight, things went bad. Through all of this, I've known that he has been chatting with a woman he met through a gaming site. He's chatted with her on and off for about 3 years and knows that i dont like it. She flirts and talks dirty with him. With in the time frame of his depression, he started talking to her again. It escalated from his chatting on the computer with her to him now texting her. The main reason why this bothers me is because every time he starts talking to her, he gets depressed and it starts effecting our relationship. He has been acting suspicious about his phone lately so it didnt take long for me to figure out he went from chatting with her to texting her. I had to talk to him about it.

I kept it civil. He freely admitted that he was, and that she sends him pictures. I asked if this is why he is depressed, being cold toward me, and talking about huge changes. He said yes. He describes her as ""a thought provoking catalyst that when stripped of all things superficial, he can only see him self in"". Her reentry into our life has been kind of a last straw for me. I knew she was back and have been thinking about leaving. So I asked him what he would do if I left, he said ""keep on living"". I asked him if he wold care if I left, he told me to leave if I want to and find what makes me happy. I tried to explain to him how much this relationship with this girl effects our marriage and how much it hurts me.

He broke Down. He started saying things about how ""he tried"" and how he is a horrible human being with evil un fixable flaws that are geneticly encoded in him. He said he has tried to ignore tem and he can't. He says he can't feel empathy and can't hide that fact any longer. 

I'm sorry this is so long but I feel the back ground plays an important role. 2 years ago when he was depressed, he told me that one day on his way home from work, he left go of his steering wheel I front of a semi. The semi went off the road and he went into the dirt. No one was hurt and he came home. He didn't tell me about this till a week later. He started talking with his mom a lot after, and seemed to get better. Tonight he told me he did that same thing again 2 weeks before our wedding. I told him I love him and I'm committed to making this work and he told me to give him 6 weeks and it'll be ok. We'll be coming up on our anniversary around then. He said after that ""you'll do just fine"". I asked what he meant why that and he told me about the second semi incident. Then he told me again that Ill be just fine and remarry someday. He then asked for me to leave him alone so he could go to bed. I've checked, he is just sleeping.

I have no idea what to do. He refuses to see a professional. I'm so scared he'll try something again. I love him so much and just want to help him, despite the problem with the girl. I'm sorry if this is rambling, or too long, or confusing. I'm just so lost and don't want him to harm him self.

All my life I've been risk-averse, have never had a girlfriend, and generally just live vicariously. I strive for safety, and I often think that, were the world to have no risk, I'd fit in wonderfully. It's almost as if I'm biologically from a parallel universe, and just don't fit in this place.

I have several decent friends - that's not a problem. I fit in as far as I go through the motions - do okay academically, have a good CV, etc. But I feel completely and utterly alienated. I don't take risks because the consequences seem so terrifying that clearly this place just isn't for me. I feel like I'm resigned to a life of boredom because that's the only thing I can cope with. I have the feeling that I also actively avoid relationships so that I don't get any drama. To top it off, I'm a huge hypochondriac - seemingly, the very existence of things that can kill me torments me from day to day. It's ironic that I should be so scared of these things - it's not as if life is amazingly satisfying anyway - what am I even trying to protect myself from by being so defensive over my body? I think I'm defensive over that tiny glimmer of hope... that maybe I'm not biologically wired to be a huge fucking wimp (pardon language). But I figure that nothing in my life has any reason to make me risk averse. I haven't had any health issues, generally do enjoy stuff when I do try it...

I do get incredibly jealous of people who are carefree in this regard. The amount of freedom they must feel must be incredible. And I'm also jealous of those guys who are actually willing to take risks in relationships, who don't have those fears.

Life sucks! It just doesn't suit some people, like me. I'm clearly one of the 'runts' of society, one of those people who would have died off ages ago if it wasn't for the luxuries we have around us. I mean, biologically, and from an evolutionary perspective, I'm nothing but a waste of space. Clearly I'm never going to get to the stage where I'm in a relationship - in a position where I can procreate. I'm low-value. Easily replaceable by a 'better model'.

I believe that internet discussions serve as an excellent archive of human experience. For the first time in history, we have a well documented thoughts from normal individuals on just about everything they thought. I want my experience to be just a small part of this vast piece of knowledge. This is not an attempt to elicit sympathy, or to ask for someone to change my mind.

Following is the note I wrote to my family and will be mailed to them. I don't know who you are, but thank you for reading. I hope my minuscule contribution to the human experience will somehow benefit you. I am 22 and a student.

-----------------------------------------------------

My dear family,
I know you have many questions, so I will begin by answering a few. You must want to understand why, but first I will explain why not. This is not an attempt to seek revenge, nor do I wish to use guilt to torment. I am not upset over the relationships I have developed with others. It is not because I feel abandoned or unloved.

When I was a teenager, I was often told that my teen years would be the best time of my life. And everyday I suffered, How terrible those times were. To hear that my life could only get worse was torture.

But I persevered. And life did not improve. I felt so lonely and helpless. I desired freedom. Freedom from the pain of middle school. I felt excluded from others. I was hurt so many times during those years. I am so sick of being sad. I cannot handle it any longer. I was given a privileged life, but I am too spoiled to enjoy it.

I cannot continue the drudgery of my life. I have spent too long living in a world that I see in beige. I am unable to feel the joy that others seem to experience. It's as if my senses have been reduced to the blandest of tones. The boredom. The repetition. The disappointment. I feel as though I am slowly wasting away. It has been a slow death.

You tried to help me. But, I was unable to help myself. I did not know how much pain I was in. I was unable to express it. Please do not blame yourselves for this.

I wish this was not going to hurt you. I wish I were able to spare you this pain. Knowing my suicide would harm you provided the only motivation to continue living. I am amazed that I delayed for so long. But living to spare others from suffering cannot be the only justification to continue living. Everyone dies, and my time has come.

Dad, we had some troubled times together. As I aged, I came to understand your actions. Thank you for all of your sacrifices.

Mom, thank you for being so kind to me. You always knew what I was thinking, even when I was too scared to admit it. You are the only one who truely understood me. When I was 17, you confessed your concern about my suicide. Maybe you know me better than I know myself.

(Brother 1), I enjoyed so much time with you. My favourite times were spent introducing you and (Brother 2) to all of the toys and activities I enjoyed during my child. I know you suffer, and I am so sorry for all of the times I got frustrated with you. I hope your life improves. Adults too easily trivialize the pain that children endure. Help your parents through these hard times, and try to forgive them when they are angry. I hope you can find an activity that will compel your interest for the rest of your life. Your intelligence and commitment will take you far.

(Brother 2), thank you for being such a great friend. We shared so many great moments. I never knew what love felt like until and met you and (Brother 1). seeing your excitement upon my returns from college bore the most magnificent and adoring feelings. I am so glad we shared many happy moments together. I am so sorry for depriving you of more.

It is too easy to overlook or forget small, joyous moments. try to remember unexpected laughs, long stories told on roadtrips, inside jokes, warm pats on the back, basement sleepovers, and affectionate surprises. Those are the times worth living for.

I wish there were a way I could remove your pain right now as you read this. I wish I could hold your hand one last time.

When I was in first grade, I was asked to describe a goal I would like to achieve as an adult. I stated that my goal was to attend college. When I was in college, you did not see me for months. If you ever miss me, just think of me as away at college, fulfilling my dream.

Your loving friend, forever,

I've contemplated suicide many, many times. Even some suicidal gestures here and there, one ending in a lot of humiliation.

I know how it feels to think that everyone hates you, to lose friends, to feel everyone is judging you, to feel ugly, to feel as if you have absolutely no energy at all, to regret and dwell (and dwell, and dwell, and dwell) on all of the bad choices you’ve made in the past, to feel you have no worth or purpose, to feel like everyone would be better off without you. I think to myself sometimes, “Oh my god, I’m only 20. What’s the point of me sticking around if I continue fucking up all the time? It will never get better.”

I just thought I'd remind you (and myself): YOU NEED TO FORGIVE YOURSELF! YOU NEED TO START LOVING YOURSELF!

Believe me, I know it's easier said than done. You have an illness… It’s not that you are a bad person, and it’s not that you’re worthless. You are useful to society, even if your job sucks, even if you’re jobless. You feel like you have no skills? You do. You have many skills! You have things that are beautiful and wonderful and lovely about you. Times may be tough right now, but things HAVE to improve from here. And, there are about a million things you can do to feel better. Talk to someone (even if it’s just a school counselor). Perhaps find the right anti-depressant for you (I know that can be especially difficult, but it’s necessary for some of us). Re-invent yourself. Lose the folks who make you feel like shit, yes, even if it’s a family member. Eat healthier. Drink less alcohol, better yet, don’t drink at all (can’t stress this enough). Exercise (!!!) even if it’s just taking walks regularly. Play or snuggle with a pet. If it’s not your bedtime, don’t hang out in your bed! FORCE YOURSELF to do these things no matter how unappealing this all sounds. It makes a difference. I promise.

Anyone who judges you for mistakes you've made, or shitty ass things you've said in the past, fuck them! Rid them from your life if they can't look past that. Move on from relationships that didn’t work out. Dwelling on them does absolutely nothing for you. Most importantly, don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re human. We all have our faults and regrets. You need to accept yourself.

Stick around, you are very much needed.

I've never lost a family member, always had a roof over my head and a warm (relatively :/) bed.

I've read through the front page posts for an hour now, and I was reminded as to why I stopped being a regular here anymore.

I've attempted before, but mostly as a cry for help. I've told myself that if I were to ever try again, I'd be sure to do it right. I've made strides, but the calls in my head to give in remain strong.

My self-destructive nature has temporarily forced me out of college and to live back home. I've been twice diagnosed as bipolar, but my family won't have any of that.

They've been highly critical of my doctors---even threatening to kill them at one point for ruining my future. They refuse to take any part in my treatment, even when they're requested to attend. They're trying their best to keep me away from my best friend, who has supported me for the past year and has helped stop one of my prior attempts. They've even been critical of and implied I should halt my medication, although they've now backed down on this.

I'd leave, but I don't have the financial means to do so. To be independent, I would first need to be stable. To be stable, I'd first need to be independent.

I don't want to say that your situation depends on the urgency of someone with the gun in their hand, ready to do it. Those should always float to the top. But we can still help.

Long story short, this was me for the last few months after moving from school to college and completely changing everything in my life. I had gone to a K-12 private school with 550 kids total, since Kindergarden, and moved out of state to a school of 28,000 grad and undergrad. My long distance ""girlfriend"" left me, my friends were all in different parts of the country, and I was struggling with the fact that I was a business school student that... hated business school. You know the next steps, got heavily involved in drugs that I hated using, which only made matters worse, got bad grades in easy classes, etc. Over thanksgiving break after bawling my eyes out to anyone who would listen at a friend's party, I got arrested on the ride home for making some awful decisions. If you want to know what I was arrested for, I'll go into it, I'm not ashamed, but this just isn't about me.

**My therapist would always first ask me ""Do you have a plan, have you taken any action towards suicide"" when I would bring this up in our weekly meetings. I felt like nobody would take me seriously unless I said ""Yes"", which I never did.** I remember telling people ""I want to go into a coma for the next few months"" because I could never do that to my family, but I didn't want to be alive. Anti-depressants certainly didn't help matters, I pulled myself off of them two weeks ago, but it's ironic that a prescribed drug can make those symptoms worse!

Anyways, I browse here now because I am willing to do ANYTHING to help saved friends, family, loved ones, internet strangers, redditors, whoever, from the same type of pain I went through. Even if you're thinking ""I don't want to be alive, but I am not going to kill myself"" you're in an awful place. Don't be afraid to ask for help, PLEASE PM me if you want to talk or anything. Especially if you're in high school, I was just there, I know what it can be like. That email address was expensive, might as well put my legitimate one out to you guys. I get emails to my phone so I can get back to you basically any hour of the day.

That's all, happy new years to everyone. You'll get through this period of your life.

**tl;dr: People in urgent situations are still very important, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you have ANY suicidal thoughts.** Any level of ""not wanting to be alive"" is a valid reason to post here or send any of us a message.

&gt;The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level person will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flame yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.

Last Friday my brother hung himself in my mother's basement, the day before his birthday. We have known that he has been suffering from severe depression for a long time but did not know it had reached this point. Luckily my mother came home from work, saw the basement light on and went down. He had been there for maybe 10 minutes, not sure, but he was still alive. He was immediately rushed to the hospital and after a few days of agonizing uncertainty as to whether or not he would ever regain consciousness or brain function he has finally woken up. He has a breathing tube in so he is unable to talk and is heavily sedated, but he can respond to a question with a slow head shake or nod. I can't explain the feeling we all have now that he has regained consciousness and at how lucky we are that my mother found him when she did, as had only a couple more minutes gone by he would no longer be here, but I feel we may be getting lost in how happy we are that he is alive and may not be considering the fact that he may be in the worst hell imaginable right now. This was not a cry for help, this was it, he had made the decision to leave the world. And we brought him back. Now he is tied to a bed, unable to move or talk. I don't know if he feels differently now and is happy that he survived or if he is spending every waking moment in pain wishing he was not here, but unable to do anything about it. Not sure how long before they take him off of the breathing machine so he is able to talk to us, but apart from explaining how much we all love him, what can I say to convince him that life is worth living? I don't want to say the wrong thing, because he obviously felt/feels differently, and saying something like ""life is a beautiful thing, etc"" may make him feel worse. Any advice?

It happened not even thirty minutes ago, she said she couldn't take being the only person I have anymore.

I was so close from actually ending my life before she came into my life, she was fucking perfect. Sure, she lived in Europe and I'm here in America, but it was still okay. I met her on omegle and I completely fell for her, it took us simply a few months just to get together. We'd talk for hours on end and it was perfect. I was so fucking happy being with her. Eventually we planned a trip to meet eachother, I flew down to Sweden for a month to be with her and it was amazing. She's really the only person that's ever loved me, and my first everything. That month was the single greatest thing that has ever happened to me.


In real life she expressed some interests in me not being very independent, which is somewhat true. I can admit that. But really, my family has been completely and utterly emotionally absent from my life. I ask them to show me how to cook, show me how to to laundry, and there's just some dumb excuse behind every single one, each time I ask. I guess I haven't had the greatest upbringing ever. I watched my pregnant mother get beat by her druggy boyfriend at the time, the baby was killed and my mom was in the hospital for weeks. I really hate saying this, but I'm pretty sure I have PTSD. Everytime I see someone I love drinking, or even just irresponsible really, I start getting flashbacks to that night. I really don't want to sound like ""omg, i stayed up until 2am!!! im such an insomniac!!! XD"", but really it is a problem and my family doesn't want me to get checked out for it among other problems, like anxiety and such. Even if I was recommended to see professional help by you guys, that just won't happen.


She also expressed concern about feeling like she hated feeling like every decision she made makes me unhappy, which is completely untrue. She's made me happier than I've ever been. I can see how she partly feels like this. I find her best friend to be a negative influence in her life, and that's pretty much the only person she hangs out with. My girlfriend found the idea of drinking repulsive when I met her, she would always deny drinks that were thrown in ther face by her best friend, and I don't think I've ever heard of her drinking a single time in general. Now suddenly, she's trying out all of these drinks, going to bars and such, which is alright, they just spark my anxiety and everything. There are plenty of other little things, but I don't care to list them. I'm sure you all get the point.


I stopped myself from taking prep classes from college. I deprived myself from a social life, because I prioritized her over me. My anxiety just made me so scared from losing the only girl that's ever truly cared about me, the only one who's put up with everything that's wrong with me even though I can't control it, and the only girl I've ever loved. She couldn't take it. She's gone. I have no second chance. I have nobody. Literally, all I have left are strangers from the internet. 

I feel so fucking pathetic.

I'm still in love with her.

I find myself wishing I didn't have anyone who loved or cared about me so I could have an easier time making my exit.  The thought of leaving everything and putting an end to this personal hell becomes increasingly more seductive as the days go on.  Well today, I received a little bit of hope in a very unexpected way and I wanted to share that with all of you.

I'm a pretty private person (aside from venting on Reddit).  I don't like people to know that I'm having a hard time and I don't like asking for help.  Whether it's a pride/ego issue, or I truly believe I can handle things on my own, I will do everything I can to keep up the facade.  Of course as most of us know, this gets unbelievably tiring and exhausting.  Sometimes you slip up and you just want to be heard.

So I posted a status on my Facebook:

""People are doing great things with their lives, things with purpose.
What the hell am I doing? I feel like I've been holding onto a match and a candle without its wick.""

In that moment I didn't care who saw it or responded, I felt like just getting my thought out there was enough for a temporary relief.

Well the morning drags on and that relief wears off.  I'm not doing a very good job at my work and I'm just hoping the day will end quickly so I can go back home to be alone and away from everyone.  Then one of my co-workers walks by my window and comes up to my desk.

We are acquaintances, but she is a very kind and happy go-lucky person.  She has at least 20 years on me and I've always thought she leads a life that I've only ever dreamed of having.  She tells me she wants me to have something and hands me [this](http://i.imgur.com/xCXJs3d.jpg).  She says:

""I've noticed you haven't been doing so well.  I want you to have this for a while.  It helped me when I was in a really bad place in my life and I was making very bad decisions.  I want you to keep this at your desk and look at it everyday like I did.  It helped me be brave.  We're in the same tribe.""

I had a rush of happiness, despair, embarrassment and anxiety all at the same time.  I wasn't sure if I was going to start crying or pass out.  She left right after handing it to me and I can't stop glancing at it.  I know they are just words, but it still gives me some hope.  It's a very, very dark place where we're at...it's nice to see some light once in a while, even if it's just for a brief moment.  I sincerely hope this makes your day just a little bit better just as it has for me.

Thanks guys.

1346621427.0,32,self.SuicideWatch,z8x7y,From legitimately suicidal to hopeful about the future in 11 months. Please read my story.,39,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/z8x7y/from_legitimately_suicidal_to_hopeful_about_the/,"Okay guys I know that when your real down nothing is going to make you feel better in that moment, I totally get that. But I just want to share my story so that you might have hope things will get better, even if it doesn't make you feel better now, keeping this in mind (things WILL get better) could prevent you from doing something irreversible in a moment of crisis.

Some background: my mother has been a SEVERE alcoholic since I was 11, when she discovered my big-shot businessman father was having an affair. They both completely stopped caring about/being parents to me and my two younger brothers. From this point on Dad was home between 4-10 days a month (they remained married). I was neglected on a daily basis and driven home from school(if she actually showed up) by a blacked-out shitty mother. As a kid she'd physically hurt me for trying to prevent her from going out at night, driving, blacked out, to do...whatever she was doing. She is currently in prison for her second stint this year (DUI's).

I'm 24 now, and for me college was awful, I found true happiness for the first time in the summer after HS graduation and was forced to leave it all and start over. College got progressively worse every year and I was deep into Trichotilomania(compulsive hair plucking) by my senior year. I was certain I would have massive non-pattern bald spots on my scalp for the rest of my life. I have suffered from severe body image issues from having man boobs since I was 9(I'm not a ""fat"" fellow, slender build)- the body image issues were compounded when I ate myself into a full, deep, purple set of stretch marks surrounding my entire torso when I kicked my pain killer addiction, replacing it with weed and binge eating in my junior year of college. The stretch marks came only shortly after developing a classic case of plaque psoriasis which had spread to my private parts(this was when/why i got into pain killers.)

Because I had no other friends, for my last two years of college I was living with one of the most narcissistic, insecure, fucked up people I've ever met. He constantly belittled me and made it clear I was fucking worthless. He did this without being direct about it because the guy had no fucking balls. Not only that but I realized he was talking shit about me to EVERY ONE of our mutual friends/aquentances. I would hear him and one of his butt buddies constantly making fucked up jokes about me and laughing hysterically through the walls of our place. Eventually he started dating another narcissist and their favorite activity was making me feel worthless. Psycho-lingo would assume that I was a classic example of ""secondary narcissistic supply"".

After graduating in '11(which was a major feat considering I skipped 2/3 of my classes simply because of social anxiety) I had no job prospects, no motivation, NOTHING. My father had cut me off and I had to plead with my mother to let me live with her until I was on my feet, she reluctantly agreed. Shortly thereafter she went to prison during which time I stayed at her place and gambled away all the money I had to live on. When I was about to run out of food she became eligible for early release and I was her sponsor for that. As soon as her parole officer completed the home sweep she busted out the booze and went to town. She informed me (while still on parole, while I was still her sponsor) that a ""friend"" was coming in from out of town and I had to leave for the weekend. So basically she was telling me to get the fuck out so she could fuck some weird guy she met at the beach a while back. I had NOWHERE TO GO. Imagine having to steal your mother's phone while she's passed out, start redialing all her recent calls to find the man she invited and tell him if he showed up I would chop his balls off, then delete his contact info (I actually ""met"" this guy when I stupidly visited her at her beach house rental- he lived in the adjoined part of the duplex, everything about him screamed serial killer/rapist).

Her drinking continued to get way worse, on multiple occasions I dialed the number of her parole officer to turn her in for violations but could never go through with it, hung up every time. My depression got real bad and I was seriously contemplating ending it all one night, the next day things got worse. I had to take her phone away from her again but she was too far gone. She assaulted me when I starting walking to my room with her phone and tried to push my down the stairs, ripping my shirt apart in the process. She then ran across the street and used a neighbors phone to call the police and try to have me arrested. The police came inside the house and summoned me upstairs. I was so flustered and randomly dehydrated that I could barely speak. I told them what happened and they wanted to see the torn shirt. They escorted me back to my room and immediately saw the pipe and weed on my desk. This is when I decided I definitely wanted to kill myself. By the grace of god, the lead cop on the scene had a heart. He pardoned the weed, pretended he never saw it and arrested my mother for assaulting me. The friction burns on my neck and the torn shirt were all the evidence he needed, not to mention the fact that she was an intoxicated, crazy fuck.

After this happened I stayed with a friend for a couple months until I was somehow able to make my father understand he needed to help me. He began to support me financially with the understanding I was not going to be able to support myself for a while. I now have financial security which is huge. I am seeing a great therapist who gets what I'm going through. I'm eating right and exercising. The weight loss has reduced the appearance of the stretch marks. My father has agreed to fund cosmetic surgery for both the stretch marks and the man boobs(coming clean about these body issues was like pulling teeth, but worth it). I have my psoriasis completely under control. I am reconnecting with friends from my past- good people. For the first time since high school I have hope that I will meet a great girl who gets me and can get past my upper body. I'm effectively managing the Trichotilomania and my hair- you can't even tell! I'm even getting regular hair cuts now without insane anxiety about it :)

I'm still unemployed but I'm looking for a job for the first time since college. I stopped smoking weed three days ago because I know I'm finally ready to handle life without it. It's rough right now but in a few weeks I will be so happy with myself for it. I'm not saying my depression is ""cured"" or anything like that, hell, this afternoon I got depressed as shit, but was able to bounce back by forcing myself to work out with some upbeat music. It's SO fucking hard but forcing yourself to run or get some type of exercise or sunlight is really important. So there it is guys, I'm not out of the woods and never will be with the cyclical nature of depression but for the first time in a long time, I can deal with life. Everyone's situation is different but remember this story when your feeling like doing something terrible to escape the pain. Eleven months ago I really felt like suicide was the only option- today I feel like I can lead a healthy, somewhat happy life managing my anxiety/depression.

Tl;DR I've had a pretty fucking rough go at it the last five years, alcoholic mom, shitty friends, no job, shitty EVERYTHING. Thought suicide was my best option 11 months ago. Today I see hope for my future.

Original post is from about 5 months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lno7o/cuttertilldeath/

The first statement I'll start off by saying is that I have finally been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder aswell as severe anxiety and I might have ADD:?

*UPDATE* I haven't cut for the past few months now.

I used to think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I woke-up, if something bad happened during the day, and before I went to bed. Before I fell asleep at night I would pray that I wouldn't wake-up in the morning. I just wanted all the pain and all the suffering to be over, and I'd be gone from the world. The people in my life would move on and act as if I was never there. No one would care, and everyone's lives would be a lot easier. My parents, my few friends(if you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.

*UPDATE*: About 2 weeks ago I jumped out of my 2nd story bedroom window. I'm okay though, I wanted to die but I couldn't get up higher. My left ankles sprained but everything else is fine. My depression medication Wellbutrin XL is working really well, and I love my anxiety medication Klonopin its fucking amazing. I feel so calm and at piece with my surroundings and I don't get tense, anxious, or have any racing thoughts so its great! :D

Boyfriend and I broke-up but I'm doing really well. We broke up about 2 months ago and the great part is, is that he's still my best and closest friend but we don't have that emotional attachment anymore because we're over each other. :D

I do not have any communication with my mother anymore and if I do I am not afraid to stand up/speak up for myself. Assertiveness &amp; Mindfullness is key! :D",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_s4kwr,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s4kwr/update_2_cuttertilldeath/,

Hi. Name's Jarred and I'm 20. I've read in the past of people posting up their problems in life, and recently I've been so confused with my emotions. I don't have anyone to talk to about them. *My English is not amazing so bear with me!*

Please respond with advices or progressive remarks. 
___________________________________________________________________________________

So, where to begin. Maybe a summary of my life and events.

I am the youngest of a Christian family. My mother and sister are very religious while my two brothers hates Gays and even feminine metro guys.


I was exposed to explicit videos when I was about 7 or 8, but I did not realise I was attracted to the wrong things until I was about 11-12. I knew then I was different from the others. Since young I was guarded, kept my emotions away from anything. I was one of the only kid who didn't get bullied since they know no matter how many times they threaten me I won't budge. 


Being gay in high school is a very sad thing. Although no one knew, I couldn't make 'real' friends since i was so guarded. When they talked about girls, I couldn't comprehend. Even after years of listening in to groups of boys talking about it, I could improvise but I hated it, lying to myself and saying things that 'real' guys says. So I went through high school, with piratically no 'real' social life. I didn't get any invites to any parties or gatherings. I wasn't the nerdy loner in school, people knew me and smiles; but I was if I ever attended a party since I really couldn't provide any conversations.


Back then, I saw it as a way of life, I could be like that forever, I didn't mind. Keeping my 'issues' to myself. As time passes by, I became very cautious of things I shared with everyone (including my friends).


Uni life was fine until the last 2 years, I was 17-18. I live on campus away from my family, and I'm glad of it. But my whole life, I've never felt so alone. It just gets worst over time. I cry every single night before I fall asleep, because I knew I had no friends. It was very depressing. So what if I have over 400+ friends on Facebook, probably only about 5 actively communicate with me, and that's cause we share the same classes at uni. I sit in the uni lounge with my group and I see many couples flirting, hugging, holding hands, I know for a fact I'll never have that, I will never be able to hold another's hand or be romantic. It really puts me down. In my uni, there was only one gay I know. He was out-of-the-closet and he seems so happy. We are friends, we're not close but we are friends. He's a year or so ahead of me, but we shared a few classes, but before he graduated I told him about myself (in a letter, cause I can't handle the looks people gives). He was understanding and kind to me, but I did not want to pour my life's issues on him. Because as I've learnt (later on), that's how you kill a friendship.


I am of Chinese background, and as our stereotype we love our money. Me, I see love first. Without love in life, I may as well be not live.


About 6 months ago, I becoming very desperate to find people like me. So I started interacting with people on this application. I felt so alone in the world, I wanted some friends who are like me. Most of them just wanted was sex and I fell for their sweet words at first, I though they wanted to be friends but when they see I wasn't in for the same thing. They just tossed me aside. A few of these instances occurred, I felt like dirt. I opened up to them, cause I though they'd understand, since they are alike. At the start it felt really good, to be seen/loved/liked for who I am. Talking to people alike, I let my guard down but I see now it's a mistake. I fell into depression, which very soon gave me very bad mood swings. When I'm with friends, I put on a mask. I'm always happy, but when I'm alone in my room I felt depressed, lonely..... very often suicidal.


3 months back, I got really sad, angry and confused about everything. I wrote a letter, placed it in an enveloped and dated it. It was a letter to my mother, coming out to her. On the day, I sat with her as she read it. In disappointment, she said that it was alright to like baking and be a bit feminine. Since she liked to hang out with boys when she was younger, and she said that the-man-upstairs will make me fall in love with the girl I want to marry later in life. And tells me not to worry about it and focus on my studies, as she tore the letter into pieces so my siblings won't see it. 


So yes, my mum tossed it aside like it was a little joke. 



**Currently:** *aka* **;TLDR;**

I'm currently lost in my life. I have very low self-confidence. I feel I no longer have a motive to live. I cry and think about my death every night. I think about dying in someone else's place. I think about life if I ran away, life on the streets. I think about how my family will react if I died compared to them finding out about me. 


I don't even know why I am studying any more. I am even losing interest in games or any of my past-times. Life in general is becoming a daze for me.



*So please enlighten me on what to do, because I feel like I'm just spiralling down.*

In past times, the only thing that has kept me from suicide is the fear of going to hell for it. Now, I have lost a lot of my faith and even question whether there even is a hell. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like ending my life is the only thing I have control over at this point.

I have no idea what to do with suicidal patients.",49,18,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p619n/hi_rsuicidewatch_im_with_ems_i_have_no_idea_what/,"Hi, guys. My co-worker and I do a lot of EMS/medical transports. About 1/4 of our transports are suicidal ideation calls, transporting from hospitals to psych facilities, and sometimes back. We're both EMTs, and- frankly- the DOT training we get focuses primarily on trauma, secondarily on medical, and not at all on psychological.

Some patients are fine; a few clearly don't belong there, but between 23-hour holds (a kid who scratched the inside of his wrist, claiming he had plans to cut himself; a 14-yo kid who claims he's going to hurt himself because he's not fitting in at a new school; or an elderly person with dementia who produced some improbable ""plan"" to poison themselves) and those with much more serious issues (40-something YO woman with a history of multiple attempted overdoses, with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and auditory hallucinations; 20-something YO woman, awake for 3 days, seeing insects crawling on her and the inside of the ambo; 20-something YO male who received notice his previous homosexual partner died of AIDS; 70-something retired man with dementia and extremely inappropriate sexual advances towards fellow residents, who knows his mind is slowly going; 60-something YO male physician with Parkinson's and diabetes who wants to drive into the middle of the desert and go into diabetic coma because he knows precisely what his disease course will be like)...

Ugh.

Don't get me wrong. The nurses (and presumably doctors- we never speak with them, we're the wrong caste) are great. The only one they've loaded me up with that I wasn't prepared for was a 80-something concentration camp survivor with Alzheimer's.

I just don't know what to do with these patients. My training doesn't include anything along these lines. Over the years, we've come to cope with them as best we can, but what's appropriate? Are there any guidelines for dealing with this sort of thing?

As I said, many are perfectly calm and collected; a handful are off their meds (I ask them why, and it's invariably because the side-effects suck- I have yet to find one who *says* they think they're ""cured,"" and don't need it anymore). A few give me stories that don't really get to the truth behind their actions, like they're ""bored,"" which is why they decided to smoke bath salts and get self-destructive. About 1/3 are beyond reach: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, deep bipolar or schizophrenic problems. I had one patient whose only communication with me was to give a seismograph-like signature, her arm sticking out from under the blanket while she was trying to sleep. Another patent's sole cogent moment was when her eyes got real big, swimming upstream against a cocktail of benzos, and she said, ""Today's my BIRTHDAY!"" and immediately lapsed out of consciousness once more. She was right about the birthday part, except for how it was after midnight.

Morale remains good; I've been doing this for a long time, and try not to dwell on my job during my off hours. My current co-worker is psychologically indestructible, and I don't worry about him. We remain professional from the second we walk in the door.

I am prepared for almost every aspect of the job, except the psych part of it. I try to do what I can, sitting down with a big ""Stupid question- how are you doing?"" thing, listening, and not doing stupid stuff like passing judgement or telling anyone what they should or should not do. That's well above my pay grade. Sometimes I have them for not even 3 minutes, but the psych facilities are full up these days and sometimes the transports are over half an hour. And, lemme tell you, when you have a suicidal 20-something YO Native American high school graduate that you have absolutely nothing in common with, that is a very long transport indeed.

Any pointers from the Reddit illuminati would be welcome.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments, everyone.

I certainly appreciate the comment that I lack compassion; I apologize if it comes off that way.

1324581371.0,31,self.SuicideWatch,nmxrz,I think I'm a pedophile. I've firmly decided to blow my brains out if I can't change this within a year.,35,4,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmxrz/i_think_im_a_pedophile_ive_firmly_decided_to_blow/,"Deep breaths.

I think I'm a pedophile. Feel free to hit me with your worst. I deserve it, and there's no possible way that I could be made to feel any lower than I do already. I do want to make it abundantly clear that I have *never* abused a child in any way, and I never will. I'm not heartless, as one would reasonably assume, and I am simply incapable of harming a child. It's all relegated to the confines of fantasy. That's the only positive thing (all things considered) about the situation. The desire for kids to be safe from such harm trumps my (relatively low) sex drive ten to one, and I do not pose any sort of danger to children or any person other than myself. The idea of me or any adult actually doing something sexual to a child is upsetting and revolting to me. Sexual abuse infuriates me. But that's the catch: I'm infuriated with myself for even thinking about children in that way. That's why I decided today to set my final goal: Either I find a way to fucking stop being this way by December 22nd 2012, or I eat a bullet. Make no mistake, I am 100% serious about this ultimatum. 12/22/12 is judgement day for me. If I can't change, that's it. No hesitation, no excuses. Game over.

I'm more attracted to adults by a decent margin, so I might have something working in my favor. I think it's very slightly possible that I may break myself of this. In the years since this started, I've 'quarantined' the problem and kept it well under control, and I can do that indefinitely, but that's not good enough. I just can't and *won't* carry on living if this is really what I have to be forever, no matter how in control of it I am, because I fucking despise myself for this. Pedophilia is pure evil and evil must be wiped from the face of this planet if we can ever hope to advance as a species.

It hurts so much because I was abused as a kid too. I *know* why pedophilia is so horrible because it absolutely ruined my childhood and turned me into such a miserable, fucked up kid. I wrestle with the trauma to this day. Second only to my awareness of how sick I am, the memory of what happened to me is the most horrible thing in my life. I'm not trying to make a pity case by writing this; I just want to get to the bottom of *why* I am this way. Why the fuck did I turn out like that? I wish someone could tell me. I have to understand this sickness fully if I want to take advantage of the very remote possibility of fixing myself. Part of me wonders if this is my way of dealing with the trauma, as if it started out as an attempt to 'disarm' some specific memories of the sexual abuse so they wouldn't torment me so much. Through fantasy, I basically relive the memory in some altered form over and over again, with the people and circumstances changed around from the ones present in the event itself. If I somehow conditioned myself into being this way, perhaps I could condition myself back out of it. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm rationalizing. Who the fuck knows? Or even cares?

As hard of a time that you might have believing it, I'm actually a loving, compassionate person under all of this ugliness. I simply cannot reconcile those traits with this sickness. That's why I'm considering suicide. I care too much about people to be deceptive about something so dire and serious. The protectiveness towards children that most of us feel is the thing that enabled me to rein in this problem early on in my adolescence, preventing it from snowballing into something even worse. And that same instinct is the driving force behind this ultimatum I've given myself. If I can't make myself see kids in the normal way that healthy people see them, then my existence cannot be justified. I would be doing parents, kids, and myself a huge favor by just bowing out. Like I said, I'm not a danger to children, so my death wouldn't make anyone safer, but one fewer pedo can only be a good thing. Goes without saying that it would end all this pain that has been building up since I the day I got abused, which was when the person who I should've been died forever. But most importantly, killing myself would mean one less sick fuckup of a person defiling the world with their mere presence. People can take solace in that. That's important to me.

What the fuck should I do? What would you do? The more I ramble about this shit, the more I want to die. I certainly deserve to. The world would not weep for me, and it absolutely shouldn't. I wouldn't fucking weep for me.

This is the mantra I repeat everyday and to many people. 
This is not only what they want to, need to, no, must hear, but also what I have to remind myself of.
My body is covered with scars, but my skin is still soft and smooth.
I have seen more then I care to, at ages that I shouldn't have and am jaded, but in the kind sort of way, that allows me to still hope and foster joy.
I have been raped twice, one very recently and the other not as. I have been sexually abused by people I trusted.
I have been screamed at and hit.
I have cut myself.
I have tried to kill myself, starting from when I was nine. 
People who should have kept me safe, were the first to rip open shut wounds and drip acid in them.
 
**And, I am ok.**
 
Even after hitting the two and half year mark, there are times I still want to draw lines into my skin and watch the blood flow.
Even after my new support system was built and I escaped my old life, there are times I still want to die.
Knowing now that I will never see either of my rapists again, I still dream and have nightmares over them.
Knowing now, that I am safe and can find happiness, there is still a huge part of me that fears what actual contentment will bring me.
Knowing now what I do about how happy it makes me to be pagan and open with my sexuality, with my eccentrities and lunacies and many other oddities, more often than not I wish I was normal and could act like normal girl do.
But I can't.
 
**And, I, I am ok.**
 
I have made mistakes.
I have had careless sex.
I have hurt people.
I have been selfish.
I am loud.
I am pretentious to a degree.
I am either an open book or a gated community.
I am still learning to be beautiful.
I still feel like it hurts to admit I can be wrong in large ways.
I have done things so unbearably stupid, I'm pretty sure if it were punishable by death, I would be killed three or four times over.
I get overly emotional.
The more I dislike someone or something, the more painfully obvious it will become.
 
But.
 
**I am ok.**
 
And for what it matters, and it may only matter to me, I forgive them.
I forgive those who've shown me real harm.
I forgive those people for raping me and showing me at an early age what sex was.
I forgive you for calling me names and beating me, condoning my self-abuse and perpetuating my mental illness.
I forgive you for showing me that there were things I could and should hate about my body.
 
 
What is more though, is that I forgive myself.
I forgive myself for my self-harm and being a wreck for a large part of my life.
I forgive myself for being difficult.
I forgive myself for making it out to be my fault over the rapes and sexual abuse. 
I forgive myself for an occasional brash and irrational nature, my mood swings and angry words spoken with no meaning behind them.
I forgive letting other people harming me cloud judgement of those who love me and for allowing myself to dislike myself moreso over it.
I forgive myself on occasion for being irrevocably me.
 
It is the mantra I say to myself in the morning when waking up is hard.
It is the mantra I repeat in the mirror when I hate what I see there.
It is the mantra I tell people who think I need more meds, another trip to the hospital or to be in constant therapy.
 
From this pain, I have risen and will continue to rise. 
From this rape, I have learned to be ok and to live with myself and my pain.
From that and those abuses, I have become the person that I am and who garners much love and respect.
From my mistakes, I have learned morality and the joys, complexties and hardhsips of being human and young.
 
I became jaded at a young age, of seeing things and learning things that some do not see their whole lives.
I grew weary, tired and sick of trying, but I'm that special kind of jaded.
The kind that still hopes and smiles when sad, because lies often become truths in their own right.
 
I just do not want you to worry, becuase I am ok.
The simple mantra that I hope you know is becoming more and more true to me.
 
**I am ok.**
 
*Please* get help. It gets better and things change and I did it, even when I was told I would NEVER get better. I got off my meds, I stopped cutting almost three years ago and have no since attempted suicide, even with all of these things. You are fucking capable, and hard as it is, life is beautiful. 
It is so beautiful.

Now I kind of want to be around someone but the only 2 people I was counting on for support are the problem.

This is what I would call a stupid reason for contemplating killing myself.  But, I don't know.  I have a history.

Before I met my wife I couldn't imagine a future for myself.  I was a college dropout who had never had a steady job, a serious relationship or much of a social network to support me at all really.  The plan was ""figure something out for myself, I guess, or give up some day.""  This sounds like a sign of depression but I never saw a doctor about it.

Well anyway, things took an upturn about 8 years ago when I met her.  2 years ago we finally got married.  She got a job halfway around the world and I followed her here.  Even if I haven't been a perfect proud productive little member of society, at least I've been doing all right and keeping my chin up.

But now I'm thinking back to my little plan for dealing with a life that never seems to go down the right track.  It never left the back of my mind, I suppose.  I've always loved to quit.  If the going gets tough, I give up and go home.  This is the ultimate way to quit and for some reason the logic has always appealed to me.

Anyway, I don't know why I'm having such a strong reaction, but since she told me I've started to think about how to die.  I'm really thinking about it a lot.  I haven't consciously decided that I ""want to"", but I can tell that the subconscious part of my mind that makes decisions is divided.  Part of me wants to quit, part of me doesn't.

I think the main reason against is that I can easily imagine it killing my mother, too.  She's getting older now, her health isn't perfect, and she just loves me so much.  My parents wanted children but had to try for 10 years just to get one, me, and when I think about it, it would be unconscionable to throw that away.  I'm so pragmatic that I know *I* can't regret it, after I cease to exist, but right now just the thought of hurting my mom like that is what's kept me from doing anything.  I guess I need to think about her more, to keep the downside in my mind.

Well, I don't know, reddit.  I just wanted to tell somebody what I'm feeling right now.  I'm really pretty shocked, and I'm surprised at myself for so seriously entertaining this notion so quickly.  I think I'm pulling back from it but... I wanted to put some words down and make that idea concrete.  Thanks.  I think it helps.  I hope it helps.

&gt;In order to create an ideal world, every man, Christian or not, has the duty to live in the same way that Christ is depicted. What this means is, every man must live by unconditionally loving his neighbour. For people to live in peace and happiness, there can be no hate or desire for others’ misfortunes in their hearts. Why? Because in a world in where everyone is happy, someone who wishes ill to another cannot be happy, since his happiness depends on the suffering of the latter. And if everyone is to be happy, no one can suffer.

&gt;Christ’s cross is to represent the burden this love implies. The world is far from utopian, and most likely this will not change. But for those who truly wish to try to better the world must love others. And he who loves others in an imperfect world will see them suffer. And he who sees those he loves suffering, will also suffer. In the same way Christ is said to suffer for others’ sins, those who sincerely love others will suffer when they err.
&gt;
&gt;And this is why I want to apologise to everyone, since, different from the Christ the Church represents, I have been unable to carry this burden. I believe that in my determination to alleviate others from their problems, I rejected their offers of help; I rejected my Simon of Cyrene. And there is no man more arrogant than a Christian who believes he can carry a burden bigger than that of Jesus himself. I could not carry my cross without Simon, and I do not want to ask for help, as I do not want to be a bother.
&gt;
&gt;And so, I have no other path but to fall. My suffering cannot be compared to carrying all the sins of the world, but I could not carry those I tried to. And for this, I apologise to all those I met and loved, and I hope I can one day be forgiven.

Help me vent a little as I feel it’s getting really bad. For those of you unfamiliar with what it actually is, have a look on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder particularly in the 'Symptoms' section, as it outlines the disorder more or less.

Firstly, up until about January of this year, I had no idea that this mental illness existed, let alone that I actually had it. And to be honest, to this day I still cannot bring myself to completely acknowledge it. Basically, I became quite self-conscious of my nose when I was 14. I was, and still do, at an all boy private grammar school, and so our contact with females was often sparse. This, I think was the driving factor behind my illness. Whenever I would know I'd be meeting up with girls or potentially seeig girls, I'd panic and it'd be a big ordeal for me. Over the year, things got worse and by the following January I started becoming almost completely reticent, and outside of school, the only social contact I would maintain was with my very close, trustworthy friends. People with whom I wasn't self-conscious around.

Thanks for staying with me, because this is where the story exacerbates. Now don't get me wrong, around males and especially friends, no one would have a clue I was this anxious about my appearance. So aside from the odd comment, ""you've been hanging at home a fair bit lately"", nothing was really made of my increasingly avoidant behaviour.

Now let's jump to midway through year 10, a year and a half ago. I was walking home from school, absolutely dreading the thought of seeing girls, more accurately, them laying their eyes on me and my nose. This was when, a random attack occurred. It was one of the boys in the senior year. I was innocently walking down to the station when he threw an rock, at an extremely high speed, into my nose. It was a brutal and random attack. There was blood everywhere and I'd most certainly broken it. After a good month, and after the swelling had gone down, I found it difficult to breathe through both nostrils, now noticing a very evident deviated septum (a hump) from the breaking and a bulbous tip, from damaged, loose cartilage in the tip. It was horrible, and what's worse is, the fact that my parents only iced it, when what I most aptly need was stitches, and quite permissibly, surgery. This is where I evolved, my BDD was so much worse. I'd spend hours looking at my nose, finding the best/worst angles; taking photos of it; dropping into anxiety attacks and depression. It was, and still is, a very strange and vulnerable time of my life. My nose consumed me (I say consumed, but to this day, I still completely and unequivocally resent it - it has consumed me, poisoned my personality, isolated and controlled me for the past 5 years).

Now to the crux of it, I recently discovered BDD, and upon reading the symptoms, and checking each one of them with flying colours, I became alarmed. As I have schemed since I was 15 about getting plastic surgery (for years I have also been using a NoseRight, to no avail) and when I read that sufferers develop an “obsession with plastic surgery often with little satisfactory results (in the perception of the patient)” I was emotionally floored. Could my dream nose be unachievable and unrealistic? I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that I didn’t want to get help about it in case anyone attempted to thwart my plan of obtaining rhinoplasty surgery.
About two weeks ago, I was feeling super down, worse than normal. So on my free period, I decided to visit the school’s psychologist (who is freely accessible) and I told her some things about it. She diagnosed me after a two sessions and has urged me to speak to my parents, so I stopped going. As an 18 year old, I am an adult, and so legally, she cannot intervene further, without my consent. 

I have no idea what to do, I feel so torn apart, so vulnerable and sad. In my mind, and this is the truth, I see true happiness with a better nose. I do. But now I have this tiny yet excruciating feeling of doubt about everything: that my perceptions are warped, that my dream of surgery is all a lie and that maybe I will never be happy, not even with the surgery. Additionally, I am dealing with this in my final year of school, in which an introverted persona is not favourable. I need some sympathy, perhaps even empathy.

I tried twice around 17-18 with a knife, had tried to put the notion in my head that if I could just plunge the blade into my heart I'd be happier in my last moments than I'd been in my whole life. I had bought a fixed blade, rosewood handle, copper caps 8"" blade, decided if something was going to end me it may as well be beautiful. I cut but could never bring myself to feel it bury itself in my chest. 

Several years on I had taken my rifle and put it in my mouth, I knew it was empty but I tested how it would feel to pull the trigger, that moment where I heard the hammer slam into the firing pin against nothing caused me to break down and cry. I then loaded the rifle and racked it, sat for several minutes with a chambered round, four pounds of pressure and it would be over, just squeeze down and done... 

I couldn't. I cried for hours, in shame that I couldn't bring myself to do it and in shame that I wanted to in the first place. 

Two weeks later a friend asked if I could take a dog in, they needed to find a home for him, he kept trying to run off and kept playing in the street, perhaps an unknown to him a similar disposition to myself, lonely and looking for an out. I took him in, and after several months of bleeding my heart out and having him here to cry with and hug, even though I know he dosen't truly understand, he's there for me and he needs me. If it weren't for me he'd be dead in the street, if it weren't for him I'd be dead in my room. 

Today I fell apart and put the rifle in my mouth, racked the bolt and sat, tasting the oil and metal, and that fucking dog strolls into the room, tilts head sideways outta curiosity and nuzzles my leg. I cried for at least a half hour.

Last August, my fiance and I got evicted. We weren't able to pay our rent because I couldn't hold a job. He moved in with his grandmother, and I moved in with my aunt briefly, then a friend.  When I moved into my friends house, I lost everything.  My aunt moved out of her house and everything I owned was left behind. No warning. 

I moved back in with my fiance after a couple months, he was able to support us. We thought we were having a baby, and I was so excited to be a mommy, even in the situation I was in, this is my light at the end of the tunnel! I woke up one night at 3 or 4, bleeding everywhere, in unimaginable pain. He rushed me to the hospital, and I heard the words I have been dwelling on since October 13, 2012.

I'm sorry ma'am, you had a miscarriage.

All of my possessions are gone, my baby is gone, my fiance doesn't seem to care, and I am at such a loss... so, for the next three hours I'm going to write his letter, one for my parents, and one for my best friend. Then, at 6 I'm going to walk to the train tracks and end it.

This is too fucked up. I can’t deal anymore. Im so sick of the fucking blaring noises I hear hear all the time. Hearing damage occurred while I was working at a nuclear power plant. Industrial accident. Air compressor/ reservoir tank released pressure while I was near it. This was a piece of equipment the size of a large kitchen. Shit was loud as fuck! Right then I knew, I had that oh no my body is really damaged feeling. Fuck this im out. At first it was a guessing game as to what the fuck was going on. Doctors didn’t know. They were all guessing. Time went by the company stalled and tried to stonewall me. Fuckers. If you ever get hurt at work get an attorney immediately. The sooner they can assist you in the process the better. I chose a shitty lawyer by reference of a family member. They said he was the best. Not in my case. He doesn’t want to pursue a psych claim despite this absolutely obliterating my life. I got a fucked up report from a Q.M.E. E.N.T. doctor who said something completely different than every other ear doctor I’ve been to. And that person opinion holds a lot of weight in the courtroom. I’m fighting those bastards and all I want to do is kill myself. Its all I think of because im driven to horrible places by the pain. 

in addition to typical hearing loss my ears lost their ability to tolerate everyday sound. Everything sounds like a fucking jackhammer! It’s SO LOUD. They call it hyperacusis. This bitch is ridiculous. My ears split in pain all day. All night the silence is terrible and leaves me with nothing but horrendous noises all night. If I turn on any noise it’s super loud and I cant handle it. White noise pink noise ive tried a lot of things. I have tried for the last 3 years to get this under control. It has only gotten worse and worse. Things are declining despite my best efforts. I got meniers from this, torrential nausea, it’s like the feeling of being tossed in a wave and being stuck upside down and not being able to right yourself, but still feeling like your turning at the same time. Soo fucked up.. my body is falling apart, my mind is slipping. I barely sleep at night on these heavy sedatives, but I wondered where my health was at without them. So I went the first day, no sleep. 2 days, no sleep. 3 days, I still cant sleep. Im wide awake all night and writhing in pain. I try to think of positive things or nothing at all. … The only thing that calms me down is the idea of death and being out of this pain. 4th day. No sleep at all. Considering going back to the psych hospital. 5th day still wide awake, this is fucked up…. On the sixth day I passed out during the day for 4 hours and ended the insanity. Right? I went another day without sleep medicine or sleeping and said fuck this. Chronic sleep deprivation is accumulative. You get more and more tired as every week goes by. Your left is a haze and your vision goes blurry and strobe effect on you. You look around and its like an old film projector where there is a black frame in between everything. My body is suffering from ptsd at this point. Drained of all energy. Depressed into manic. Anxious off the charts, my body is in fight or flight mode all the time. It feels like its dying all the time. It cant deal. I try to remember the happy days since the accident and there really are just fellting moments of funny jokes in between suicidal thoughts. Nothing great has happened but sooo many terrible things have. I don’t want to give in and let them win, but I don’t give a fuck at the same time because as soon as I leave im down with all this. Im sick of the 24/7 migraines. They never go away. Nothing I can do helps them. It fucking hurts sooo bad. WTF!!!!!!!!!  Before the accident I was pulling straight A’s and able to work 100+ hours a week which we did sometimes. Typically we worked 84 or 72 hours/week. This was during an outage so the company is inclined to pay crazy overtime to get the plant back together as fast as possible. We had two days off per month. 13 on 1 day off, and another 13 on, and so forth. But that was fine. Not a problem. Now? My head is so fucked up I can’t hear properly my vision is going I feel like half my brain is gone completely. I lost my ability to talk to people. I would stare blankly back at them and not a thought would go through my head as to what the fuck was going on. I started repeating what people were saying to me to get used to talking again. I cant function in a social situation because I cant hear people right and I cant keep the pace of a conversation. Its isolating. Ive screwed up most all interactions and turned them into the most awkward shit shows. Burning bridges all over the place. A few true friends have truly stuck it through with me and for that I don’t know what to say. Thank you. It’s made life up to this point, im still here. Im so close to the end though. My body is far more than ready, my mind is at ease and pleading with me to suicide. I was studying to be a sound engineer when this happened, the world of sound was wondrous to me and truly magnificent. Now? The most painful dark, I cant express the pain through a keyboard. My passions are my pains, my soul is the only thing pleading to continue. But I feel like a major part of me has already been reincarnated. I keep holding out because of the finality of suicide. Don’t know what’s on the other side. But it wont be this broken body. 
I haven’t even talked about the complete invasion of my life by the insurance company and how they hack your facebook and anything online to gather information. They cant use it, but it’s a private investigator that does the dirty work. Shady fucks. They have followed me and filmed me and make me look over my shoulder every moment. Wtf… they dig up every record on me they can, medical, police dmv, credit, academic, anything and everything. It was a stack of binders over ten inches tall. Wtf? I didn’t ask for this? I just wanted to do my job and help people and do good by my fellow humanity. I’m at my wits end. I can’t handle this. I’ve thought about so many methods of how to do it. I’ve settled for one that leaves my organs un-poisoned and intact so that a 5 donor recipients can live through my death. So this is it. I’ll be making a video for my friends and family explaining all this and to reassure them and ease the confusion and chaos that usually surrounds a suicide. People usually ask “why” well I want to let them know I was hurting and ready to go. I’m ready

This is only meant to shed light on what people are thinking of doing.

April 15, 2009 is the day my step-brother found a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  I remember the day so clearly, it was full blown spring and being a high school senior, along with my step-brother, there was a certain excitement in the air about graduating.  I had gone to school and stayed after school had ended to pay for a ticket i owed to go to prom.  My stepbrother had gone home for the day.  I return home and go to my room, which was in the basement while my bro was upstairs.  I'm playing video games and pretty much doing my thing while i get a call from my bro's gf.  She is frantic and telling me i need to talk to him because he is upset and mentioned something about having a gun.  I nonchalantly tell her i'll talk to him and reassure her everything is going to be okay.  I go to his room yelling his name, but i can't find him.  I look all over the house and he apparently stepped out.  So i go to the park at the edge of the block and circle it looking for him, again to no avail.  There was one room i didn't look in which was our parents room because it's almost always locked and we never go in there.  I nervously open the door and what i found changed my life forever.  I see my beloved bro laid out on the floor in a pool of crimson red.  The revolver was also lying on the floor.  Our cat ran through the door when i opened it so i actually had to jump over my bro's lifeless body to get her out of the room.  I will never forget that sight.  I immediately call the police and they were in my house in minutes.  I  had told them my stepbrother committed suicide, but later i found out the call went in that there was a hostage situation and shots had been fired.  The police greet me with guns in my face telling me to get down on the ground.  I'm handcuffed and put in the back of the police car.  It soon becomes apparent to them that this was self inflicted and un-handcuff me.  They take me to the station and tell me to give them the number to all the family i know.  I comply and i witnessed one by one each family member walk into the station as they break the news to them.  They decided to tell my family about my bro's death only after they reached the station.  So i witnessed my family and friend's heartbreak as they came in.  My parents were in Hawaii and the police thought it was best if i told them.  So the burden was put to me to give the worst news they have ever heard.

I would say this event had been tough on everyone, but i had the extra stress of finding the body and seeing everyone's reactions of hearing the news.  There was also no note to be found, so the reasons why he did what he did will never be known.  I can tell you that today, three years later no one is over his death.  While the tears have slowed the pain of losing family has not subsided, especially with his father.  His father drinks occasionally and it gets to the point where he is in tears thinking about his son's death.  My brother and two sisters have joined suicide watch groups and have advocated greatly, especially the out of darkness walks that take place yearly for those thinking about suicide.  I on the other hand don't know how to deal with the loss.  I don't take my frustrations and energy into raising money for awareness, or even tell my story to anyone except close friends.  I have suffered through depression and post-traumatic stress from the event.
but through this all there is still hope.  Everyday i know he is my guardian angel and protects me when no one else can.
Still, the pain he left behind will never go away in the hearts of those that truly loved him.  I was evened surprised how many lives he actually touched as people i never thought was close to him celebrate his life by getting tattoos or also raising awareness.
Suicide is not ending your own life.  It is hurting everyone you have ever known and loved.  So the only thing i ask of someone who is considering suicide is to really think about all the people that it will effect, and know that whatever the problem you're going through, this too shall pass

I don't know what I was looking for, a job, a sense of adventure, or just a ticket away from home.  Whatever it was, I really don't know what made me choose this.

Even in the initial stages of the pipeline I started to get second thoughts, but I told myself I was just nervous about leaving home and needed to get a feel for it.

I'm now about 5 months into my training, and I feel more helpless every day...The job I've been selected for is something that I've never been particularly good at, and I feel like a monkey trying to solve a simple puzzle to get a small treat every day in my training.  Watching my classmates succeed effortlessly while I constantly need help wears on my confidence and my morale.

Being told what to do every day, being berated by instructors every day, then coming back to a dilapidated, worn-down dormitory only to have nothing to do but surf reddit because everyone I'm on the graveyard shift for classes really kills me.  I study everything we did that day, and everything we're going to do the next day, eat dinner, and try to sleep.

The only redeeming thing in my life right now is my girlfriend of 3 years who has been incredibly supportive of me.  Still, all of my training is hands-on, and I really hate this job.  Due to the nature of the military I barely knew what I'd be doing when I signed up to do it for the next 6 years.

Sometimes I think I'd be a lot better off just throwing myself out a fourth-story window, but the thought of leaving the people I care about behind kills me.  I really don't know what to do, I feel like in my ignorance I threw myself into a situation in which I have absolutely no control over my life or my fate.

I really don't know how to feel right now, but the urge to just give up grows stronger every day...Really small, stupid things like not catching something when someone tosses it to me, or fucking up a capcha code, or just knowing that everyone I know is asleep or in class and I can't talk to them make me feel like absolute shit.

i have no one to run to. my boyfriend lives too far away. he is a student like i am. i can't get a job, even a parttime one because no one will accept me. i don't know what to do anymore

today my parents told me i was unwanted, and that i'm worthless. all because of fucking money. all of my effort in improving myself in terms of personality, art skills, my grades, everything, it's all worthless because i can't give them back money.

at first they were happy i was able to get some commissions off deviantart, but when they realized it was only ~$20 a piece, they started hating me again. i don't think i can ever live up to their expectations. i've never felt like they loved me. it all boils down to money for them.

i feel like an empty shell of a person now. i'm sorry if nothing i say makes sense anymore, i just really need a place to rant.

I am 20 years old to date. I have been living with depression for the majority of my life and I feel that I am at a point where I am contented with the idea of my death. I have terrible generalized hyperhidrosis (basically, I get really sweaty for no reason). It's an awful condition and inhibits me from interacting with people in even the most simple of settings. Honestly who would want to be around a sweaty person all the time? The worst part is that I look normal otherwise, so people are always disappointed and weirded out by me and my condition. That's what makes interacting with people so punishing. Honestly, if I had a nickle for every time I was asked ""why are you sweating so much?"" I would probably be able to pay off America's debt crisis. Please don't bother suggesting the topical clinical medications. I've tried them and it only makes it worse in the areas that I can't apply the medication. I will never be able to truly be close with anyone and that's the sad fact.  I've always had this hope that things would get better if I just tried harder. I did and I have been but I just feel worse than ever. I got good grades. Got into a good school. Started a service organization... But all that means nothing if you can't be happy around other people. It's a terrible cycle of avoiding social situations, becoming more socially awkward, trying to talk to people again and failing miserably. In addition to all that, I was in a bike accident several years ago and I now have permanent brain damage on the part of my brain that helps with language. I have a terrible time remembering names of anything. People, places, movies, anything. It really inhibits my communication, and no matter what i do to try to improve it, I still suck at it. On top of that, I have two hideous scars on my face that people always stare at. I just can't handle looking at someone as their eyes dart to my scars. You don't know that you do it, but it makes me very self conscious.
I thought things would start looking up for me by now, but after years of failing to connect with anyone beyond my family I am giving up. I dread waking up in the morning every single god damn day. More and more I have these fantasies about shooting myself. I play it in my head over and over and over no matter how hard I try to make it stop. I know its bad to think but it's the only time I'm happy now. It's like smoking a cigarette or those few seconds after an orgasm. I feel as though I am getting some sweet relief, but then reality comes back and my life still sucks. Fuck it.

I'm sorry Mom, Dad, Big bro, and little bro. I know this will be hardest on you all. 
Mom- I hate how this will affect you the most and for that I'm and eternally sorry, but no matter how much you love me, it will never make up for how much I hate myself.
Dad- Please take care of mom. I'm sorry for being such a burden. You'll have more money now that you don't have to worry about me.
big bro- You've got it made. I know that you'll find a great wife, buy a big house, and be a wonderful father someday. I know you told me that you believed in me. I'm so sorry for disappointing you.
little bro- I don't even know what to say. I love you little man. You're gonna rule the world some day. You're tougher than I ever was

I'm 28 years old. I'm mostly self-sufficient. I've got a job pays decently well (though I have to do freelance and will probably need a third job on top of that), I live in my own apartment, I cook for myself, and mainly do all the things people are supposed to do in order to maintain their lives. 

It's soul crushing. I've already made the decision that if I were suddenly to find myself in a life threatening situation, I wouldn't fight it. I want a bus to careen off the road and hit me. I want to be struck by lightning. I want to have a sudden, fatal heart attack. I want to just not have to be alive anymore. 

Everything costs money. Food costs money. Rent costs money. Electricity costs money. The simple act of being alive, it seems, costs money. Being alive, living, is an effort. A huge effort. It's not a default state but something that must be consciously maintained. You have to eat. You have to have shelter. You have to go to the dentist. You 
have to go to the doctor. And these all take time and cost money. There are no alternatives. Capitalism won the Cold War. This is society. This is the way things are done. This is LIFE. 

And Communism was no walk in the park either, at any rate. 

We work to get money. We wake up. Brush our teeth. Put on a tie, unless it's casual Friday. Run to catch the train. Elbow some guy in the gut because there's not a lot of room and you need your 1.5x1.5 square. We get to work. Get our coffee. Do something we hate. Something that goes completely and utterly against our principles. It's like a Jew working at a pork processing plant. But the money's good. You're not in college anymore. It's time to put all that idealism away. It's time to be an adult. You're not getting any younger. Do this. All day. Every day. Until you die. 

Life is full of worries. That project needs to be completed by Friday. That freelance assignment needs to be done by Monday. You've got to call the exterminator and get these silverfish out of your bathroom. And these are just your immediate worries. Meanwhile, oppression is happening on a mass scale all over the world. You directly benefit from it. In fact, part of your job is contributing to it. In a small part. But still a part. How did this happen? How did this become your life? 

Other people deal with it. You're not so self absorbed as to think that you're the only one suffering. You're not so naive to think you have it so bad. You live in a first world nation. You can get clean water whenever you want. You eat every day. You're comparatively healthy (though, you do smoke a lot...) What makes you different? Why can't you just accept what millions, billions, already accept? Why can't you just work for a living and like it? You entitled little shit. You're exactly what's wrong with America. Everyone works. You hate your job? So does every god damn fucking person in the world. THEY don't wanna die. Why do you? 

Because it's like a light switch going off in your head. One minute you're here. The next you're not. And all your problems vanish. You vanish. It doesn't matter that you've worked as hard as you can but you can't complete that project. It doesn't matter that your freelance assignments have dried up. It doesn't matter that you need to find a third god damn job on top of the two you already have. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Because you're dead. You don't have to worry about anything. Life is no longer happening to you. There's no need for decisions. No need for stress. No need for work. There's not even a need for a burial plot -- you don't care what happens to your body. Let some necrophiliac carve your corpse full of brand new orifices for all you care. 

You don't have to worry. About anything. 

Change jobs? God, even MORE fucking work. Sure, you can do it, but it's so much effort. Scouring jobs boards, going to networking events, writing cover letters, it's all so much much work. And you'll still be miserable. It's not the specific job. It's jobs in general. It's life in general. It's responsibilities in general. There will always be something that grinds you into dust. One leg gets tired, so you shift your weight until the other leg gets tired and then you shift your weight again over and over and over. I just want to sit down, but everyone else is standing. I'm just fucking lazy. Things that come easy to others is an arduous task for me. Getting out of bed, even, depresses me because I know it will be yet another day full of soul crushing responsibility. I'm not so entitled to think I deserve to not have to do with every god damned person does. But, still, I'd really rather not. I don't want to have to take care of myself. I don't want other people to take care of me. 

So: death. 

I don't know what, exactly, I hope to accomplish by this post. I only intended to write a paragraph or two and everything just came pouring out. I've been thinking these thoughts for years. I've never shared them with anyone. To outside observers, I'm the most cheerful fucking guy in the world. But I'm rotting like a soft log in a shallow pond, from the inside out. And one day. I'll split.

I don't want to live anymore,31,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dj82l/im_very_lonely_i_dont_want_to_live_anymore/,"I'm 18 years old. I go to a community college and I hate it. I don't think I'm a socially challenged person. I used to be, but ever since I realized how stupid my worldview had been (around 11th grade) I started on a path of change. I live with my dad because my mom kicked me out because I kept calling her out on her alcoholism. She is very emotionally abusive and has been hurting me for years by drawing me in and making me feel like she cares, and then rejecting me.

My dad doesn't really pay much attention to me. He has a new wife who is obsessed with. She doesn't like me either because they were starting a new life together and now I show up. My dad has never shown me much love, he is a very emotionally strong person so I guess it's tough for him to show love to someone. If I let on about an issue he will just tell me to tough it out. Nothing is ever done well enough for him. I think he is also very disappointed in me because he is smart and wanted me to go to a real college but I have to go to this community college instead.

I don't have any real friends. I just have some acquaintances who I talked to in classes in high school. I'm sure some of you know how that is. They went off to real colleges and now they're having a great time. And it's tough to make any friends at this community college because it's small and there's not a lot to do and I feel people don't like me. I'm also trying to find a job like many people but it's tough.

The reason I have to go to the community college is because my grades in high school dipped off around 11th grade ever since I realized how much of a socially awkward idiot I had been. It made me extremely depressed even as it gave me the motivation to change. I wish I had done better in school so I didn't have to go here, or had at least made some good friends.

I pretty much gave up on having a girlfriend a while ago, I've never even kissed a girl before so I've just assumed I'm not cut out for that. I'd like to just have friends or someone close in general.

I started thinking about suicide in 11th grade and it became a daily part of my thought processes around 6 months ago. I spend a lot of time crying because I wish I felt needed or useful. I became more social, I took better care of myself, I got nice clothes I feel comfortable in. I did everything I was supposed to do, and still have nothing.

It's just such a pain to get through the day anymore. I don't think it's worth it. I'll probably kill myself within the next couple months. I would like to hear your thoughts.

Edit: Sorry if this seems run on or stream of consciousness, I'm running on little sleep or food the past couple days.

Edit 2: Several people have suggested either therapy/mental health professionals or groups. I don't know how I could pay for a therapist person right now and I'm not too comfortable with the idea of talking in a group. It was difficult just forming this post anonymously.

I don't have any true friends. I spend most of my time walking around my school with my headphones in or sitting in class not saying a word. I have people who I eat with and talk to on occasion, but I don't identify them as true friends and I'm sure they don't think of me as a true friend either. Part of this is my fault, because for some reason I just don't really like other people. I really wish I did though, and I hate myself for disliking 99.9% of the world's population because part of me would love to have a great social life. I'm not the smartest in school, but I work pretty hard and get decent grades. The only thing that I would really consider myself good at is swimming. I'm a YMCA Nationals qualifier, which won't mean anything to you guys, but it's a pretty decent accomplishment in the world of swimming. However, my team is the part of my life that I hate the most. They are the most dreadful group of people I have ever met and they suck the fucking life out of me. I'm a high school senior and they have been bullying me and emotionally torturing me since the 7th grade. I would've quit a long time ago, but I made a promise to myself that I was going to be a fucking man and stay on that team until I graduated, no matter *how* bad it got. I've thought about quitting many times but I would still see them around school and if I started swimming for another team (I certainly don't want to give up on swimming) I would just see them at swim meets anyway. I guess that I'm just seriously reaching my limit, and part of me wants to just end it all. I hate living a life where every flaw is pointed out and then made fun of for days, weeks, even months. They have broken me down to the point that 5th graders who are in the locker room at the same time call me gay and a faggot because the swimmers my age tell them to because it's 'funny'. The only things keeping me from ending myself are that I want to go to college and see if things get better for me, and that I know it would tear my family apart if I died. Even the college reason doesn't really motivate me to keep living because these fucks have teased me and backstabbed me to the point where I'm terrified of opening up to anyone and I don't have it in me to trust anybody. I have no chance of getting a girlfriend because I physically and mentally cannot intimately interact with anybody. Sometimes I just sit in the dark and think about killing myself and leaving a note that just says about 15 names on it just so those cunts get what's coming to them for what they've done to me. I guess that's about all I have to say, I can't really type any more or I'm going to start crying. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

We were behind on all of our bills and she had to fight for short term disability twice. She was still behind on everything, and we had it rough then. She had a mini stroke while working one day due to a blood clot, she had also had a stomach ulcer due to stress. She was in the hospital for awhile, while she was there a doctor changed her anti depressant medication and it had a reaction that made her very suicidal. I had to call the police twice because she was starting to OD on pills. She was sent to the 6th floor for suicidal thoughts. While she was there she kept her Job notified the entire time. The day she was going to be told about when she would be released, she was called and told she was being let go from her job and that she did not know yet when she would be able to return to work yet. She found out later that she was being released the 9th of January and her FMLA that had already been extended once would not be able to be renewed.

Her boss told her she needed to get her life together and was told that they would not fight her for unemployment. This however was not true and here we are now. The only witnesses my mom had still works for the company, and the boss lied and said she quit. We have already appealed it and they chose in her company's favor. Now we are at a risk of losing everything because they lied and said she voluntarily quit. We can't afford anything. We have food stamps and all but the stress of all this is unbearable. I feel suicidal, and I am scared. How can people be so heartless. We have no family to help us, our friends can only do so much. We have nowhere to live. I love my Mom, and I always feel good around her, but when I am alone I start crying all the time.

My mother worked for this company for 18 years and was 2 years away from retirement. I think about that YouTube video about that old lady getting bullied on the bus, and there are some good people out there. But we are alone, I feel alone and dead inside. My job is becoming more and more stressful since I work at walmart and push carts. Seeing my Mom so sad is too much for me to bear.

I have been on anti depressants since 2008, and have tried to help people the best I can. I am a good person and so is my Mom, and seeing stuff like this happen to us is unbelievable.

I've been unemployed for a year now and can't find anything. Really anything. I can't get a call back from temp agencies. My family isn't very supportive and I'm tired of living with people who don't want me there. Even if I could get a job a McDonalds I wouldn't be able to support myself or have much hope for a better future.

A year ago I didn't kill myself because someone pointed out that I was about to graduate and there would be new opportunities for me to be more secure and build a better life, but that was just a well-intentioned lie that clearly didn't happen.

Medication has never really helped me. I've tried every medication you've heard of and some you haven't and none of them helped. I visited a psychiatrist again a few months ago but they have nothing new to offer me. I even shelled out the money to try Abilify, which is new, but it can't fix my situation. CBT helps me with some things but I don't think it can deal with an objectively hopeless situation. I got this last interview because my mom knew someone at the company; it's the first one I've had in a long, long time. It's not as though waiting any more will do any good, since every passing day makes me more unemployable.

I don't think there's anything anyone can say to me. No one I know has any suggestions and they can only offer palpable lies. How, when I have not had a genuine interview in months, and when I grow less desirable by the day, can I believe that things will suddenly turn around? The last interview I had prior to the one I'm holding out hope for they were mocking me. That sounds crazy but I know it's true; especially because they were mocking other candidates when I was in there. That's how low things are, my minimal hopes for a lower middle class existence are worthy of ridicule.

I have a great group of friends I've known for years and a part time job that's halfway decent (which says a lot in these economic times). 

And yet I have never felt so alone in my entire life. All my friends keep bouncing in and out of relationships yet here I am, in shape, great personality, amazing sense of humour, the works and yet here I am on another night all alone on the internet. At least with my mother around, despite the fact that we ended up hating each other towards the end, there was someone to go home to. Now there's no one. The moment I stop being around others to socialize, or have work to do, or hell even weed to smoke I fall into a deep dark depression that makes it hard for me to talk or breathe. This even happens in front of my friends and I spend hours just trying not to break down in front of them.

I've soon come to realize that there's a gap in my heart. A void if you will. For the past 6 years I've never been able to even score a first date. For some reason I've been put on this earth in a form that cannot be liked or loved or cared about. Despite having a small group of close friends I have never spent the night with someone else in my bed or had a kiss or anything. I'm just a lonely fool. (This is a slight exaggeration because I have had one LDR that resulted in one weekend being spent with someone but that was years ago) In the end I can't stand this. I've taken every piece of advice thrown at me and have realized that I have not done anything wrong. People are always trying to find fault in me when the fact of the matter is I'm not doing anything wrong. People just don't see me as someone they can love. I can't live my life as a foreveralone. I just wanted the internet to know that I'm sick and tired and done with it. Between now and Sunday I will write a farewell letter to those I care about and then go do something crazy that'll get me killed (because taking pills or hanging myself is the boring way to do things).

We have good times but also really rough patches. When we hit a tough time we can argue every day, multiple times a day. There are weeks and weeks when I cry every day and have permanent headaches from it. I also get behind on my work because of the constant arguments and feel bad about that too.

I was seeing a psychologist but she's from the public healthcare system and basically she just told me my allotted visits have run out. I don't feel like anything is much better than it used to be when I started seeing her and now I'm losing her.

I don't know where to start, what to say, if there's any point in even describing the sorts of issues we go through. He tells me to try things, says he'll try things, but nothing ever happens. He cheated on me and when we tried to patch things up, I wrote him an email for him to answer in multiple parts so it wouldn't be too much at once. He answered the first part but when I sent the second, he never got back to me. He has zero initiative, doesn't approach me for sex, when I approach him for sex he's super nervous and we barely connect, it's like we're strangers. Even though I'm leaving on vacation for three weeks next Sunday, and I'll be super busy all week trying to wrap things up at work, he has spent the whole weekend playing video games and wouldn't move from in front of the TV to even just come to the store with me, so we could spend a minute together. He's just not interested. He says he is but then he never does anything with me. He just got done telling me how even though he's reading his book right in my face, he's totally available to me and if I want to talk to him so bad, why don't I come up with something to say.

It's dumb to even talk about it. Everything is always an issue. We always end up fighting and I break up with him and he gives me attitude and I feel responsible and we try to fix things and he says he'll try to take better care of me and does something right there on the spot but never follows through. I feel lonely, undesirable, resentful, horrible all around.

When we've been fighting for too long (days and days) I get vivid images of throwing myself off my balcony, shooting myself in the head, whatever. I feel like I'm too much of a coward to do anything but the fact that these images come back again and again has started to worry me. I get to the point where it feels like I can't get out of my misery. I can't leave him, I've tried and it doesn't work, the moments when we do (or did) connect are (were) too precious to me and I can't let go of the possibility that it could get better. I don't know if I'm just depressed or insane and I'm actually just painting everything black in my head and my issues are just bullshit and I should just stop whining. I have no idea of anything except that I cry all the time and I'm feeling shitty all the time and I just want it to end, want it to end, want it to end so bad.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_uvilx,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uvilx/my_relationship_with_my_aspergers_boyfriend_is/,

My older brother wanted to take a fridge that i keep in my room and it is my property and i said no and he came to take it by force and a fight broke out. 

Little background. He's my fathers favorite and my father is known to getting him whatever he wants because he had a lot of girlfriends. I hovewer never had a girlfriend, im kinda of a SAP and am not considered a ""real man"" i guess. I basically dont speak to my father because hes a drunk and a obnoxious man. Also he payed to build my brother a whole house, bought him a car and furniture in the house, meanwhile i never got anything and i live in a room i lived my whole life(im 20 yo, my brother 22) which i find extramly unfair and is part of the reason i hate my father and dont speak to him. I would like to point out that my brother has a fridge of his own in his house but it was more convinient to him to take mine from my room for some party in the front yard i dont know. He and my father were drinking bears in the front yard, he needed a fridge to cool his bears for the party. He is used to getting his own way so he felt he has right to just take whatever he wants... but not today.

About the fight. He called me on the mobile phone from the front yard, i was in my room. He just told me he needs to get the fridge to cool his bears. I told him to get the fridge that is in his house(on the same property) he said its full and he needs to take mine(like i use mine just to sit there empty). After i said NO and again told him to take his own fridge he raged and yelled hes coming to get mine. He rushed into parents house to my room and atacked me. I could smell bear on his breath, drunken barbarian... He choked me, puting me in a head lock and pushing me down the stairs trying to remove me and take the fridge by force. He didnt punch me, otherwise i would be giving this information to the police and taking pictures in the hospital as proof. Im just very shaken, need to talk.

Fucking drunks both him and my father! Btw my father knew what was going on and just stayed in the yard, continued drinking.

My mother was working and she is the voice of reason i think and only thing thats keeping this family together. She is also not very found of my father because hes a drunk, cheap and obnuctious man and i can only hope she comes to her sences, divorce him and devide the property. After the fight i called my mother and she said to stay away and she will talk to them.

But these have always just been in theory. I have always come off to others as a cheerful guy with his head in the right place. People see me as reliable, stable, and a man with direction. I helped a friend of mine with her problems just last night, and she left me with the following: ""you know, literally every time you come up in conversation with anyone I know, it is never about something you've done. It's always, 'hey, [x] is just... a really good person.' I say that as a compliment.""

I am not any of those things. What people need are goals, whether that is a family, or a job, or a dream, or really, anything to keep as the light in the darkness that leads you down the path one step at a time. When therapists or whatever talk about ""hopelessness,"" it sounds like a load of shit -- it's not hopelessness. It's the lack of a goal, of direction -- it is the lack of that something that doesn't *make* us alive, but rather *keeps* alive, gives us something to live *for*, rather than live *through*. When I was younger, I was sure I had so many things figured out. Golden boy in school, captain of the soccer team, urged by teachers to go to music school, or to med school, or to become a lawyer.

I look at my friends in college planning out their lives now, planning for grad school to get a job, to make money, to get a family and have kids. Others are planning for a life in music (which, to be honest, has always been my dream), others in medicine, others in something else. At the end of the day, all I have appeared to others is as a ""good"" person -- but what does appearing ""good"" entail? I am neither moral, nor faithful, nor honest; but I tell white lies to people and take that burden upon myself to give a third party some solace -- my being a good person is but an appearance, just as being beautiful is as much of an appearance.

I am too far in my life to change these things. I have written an album, a *full* album (just sketches) complete with musical ideas and motifs, themes linked together, as though I am trying to piece together the different melodies in my life. No one I have shown it to is impressed - they are disturbed, unsettled, turned away from it and towards the shallow shit music we have today. And that is my problem -- that is my decaying dream -- that has taken that goal, that light in the darkness, and extinguished it. I am groping my way through the night, hoping for a rope, or the shimmer of a flame that I might warm myself by, but it's not there. It has been lost -- and with it, I am lost. I am a proud person, but I am twisted up in my own mental acrobatics, and not a soul can help me. Nietzsche talks about the pessimism of strength, that by realizing that life is meaningless, that our existence is transitory and over in a heartbeat of existence, we can gain strength from this realization, that this life is the only one we have to live and that we must live it to its fullest.

I am not an Übermensch, and my theories just seclude me, my pessimism festers in my head like a poison, and I want to say I am a strong enough person to defeat my demons, and I want to *be* that strong person. But in my moment of reason, I have to admit that I'm not. Reason only takes us so far -- reason can take words and bend them into such shapes and forms that we manage to justify the death of 6 million people as ""ethnic cleansing."" Reason can take words and justify that a man making a billion dollars should be taxed less than my dad.

I am at the boundaries of my own logic, and as I stare into the abyss, it stares right back at me. I stand face to face with the darkness with no light to lead me through it. Where my next step lands, whether it takes me slowly up the path out of the darkness or further into it, I am completely helpless to decide on my own.

I'm not even sure this belongs here, but hey.

Around this time, when I was 16, I was determined to just end it all. I was depressed (my doctor referred me to a counselor years before that but I never went. HORRIBLE mistake on my part. I wish I would have went), in an abusive relationship, and had contemplated suicide enough to think that it was the only way I could find peace. 
An old friend of mine texted me to wish me an early birthday just as I was preparing the pills. It was just one person and hell, we weren't even that close, but the fact that at least one person on this planet was thinking about me made me stop. It wasn't a complete stop, though. I was still harming myself up to a year after that. I still had weeks and nearly months of being disgusted with myself. And I didn't get out of that horrible relationship until months later.
I can honestly say things eventually did get better. I don't live a charmed life and I still get a little lonely sometimes, but if I would have died that night, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to become closer with my brother, meet some interesting friends, or get away from the people who made me feel like shit in the first place. I've matured, found my niche, and I don't feel so lost anymore. It took some time and work and optimism and a little logic, but now I'm here. There are some really incredible things in the world that are worth seeing and experiencing, and a lot of those are the little things we don't even think about at first.

I am 24 and haven't done anything with my life. All my friends are gone. My girlfriend, who was the world to me, left me for a threat I had seen coming. I have no talents. I have no money. The only people who talk to me are my parents. I'm six foot three, fairly attractive, and someone with capacity for above average thought. But I'm invisible. People hate me immediately. I try to go out and meet friends. But I am just an old creep with no redeeming qualities. I've even tried meeting people online. 

It's hopeless. I have perspective on the human condition, and the futility of life. I wanted to live a good one before I died. But I'm a ghost. And I can't feel anything anymore. I became a cutter just to get the sensation. But I'm finally ready. 

I don't need a suicide hotline or Jesus. I just need someone who gives a fuck. This is my last try. ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_dfvoi,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dfvoi/230_am_knives_on_the_table_pills_brimming_my_glass/,

I had fallen into a fairly bad place and since then i have gotten a lot better. Many many things had built up over time and it all came crashing down with the incident that happened that night but, since i started back up with school this week, i have felt better and better each day and today i just feel fucking amazing. I love what i see in the mirror now(i started back up on my workout routine) and eventhough i'm still not in the shape i was in 2 years ago, it just feels amazing being sore and knowing i'm working out and working towards something better. Especially given the fact that i'm working on less classes and going to be graduating this year... i couldn't ask for more. I've finally started doing what i absolutely love in college. It also has helped that one of my best friends returned to college and we've been hanging out everyday and going to the gym together. It's been so long since i've felt this amazing and thanks to the people in r/SW, i am able to experience it. The two main people i'd like to thank who stayed up and kept me talking are Carmac and i can't remember or find the other name because he deleted his account but you know who you are. Everyone who responded, thank you because it showed me how much everyone cared and it made a huge difference in helping me vent out my frustrations and finally be able to think a little more rationally. Sorry for the wall of text but thank you for helping me see another morning that led to me regaining and finding a confidence i had lost long ago.

At the current moment, I could potentially face up to 10 years in military prison. I can't tell you why I face 10 years, but I promise you that it's bullshit. Not even in the sense that U.S. laws are bullshit, but they have no evidence to convict me of the crimes they accuse me of.

I'm honestly contemplating suicide, but making it look like an accident so my family can get my huge life insurance policy. I'd love one of two things:

1. To have a reason to try to continue with my life. There's roughly a 0% chance I won't go to a military prison for at least 2 years, so just saying ""Don't go to prison isn't really an option.

2. A good way to make it look like an accident. I hate my life, but I don't want to hurt my family because of my idiocy.

I knew I had no future. I always knew I'd never get into college and become a physicist/engineer. I tried to have dreams, and failed.

I'm failing all but two of my classes, and just the thought of that place makes me crumble inside.
I'll never be able to get close to someone in my life. I'll never go anywhere. I've failed everything, even out-patient therapy.
There's no reason for me to go on. Darwin was right, only those most suited to change will survive. I'm not one of those, so I might as well remove myself from this planet full of disgusting people.

My only fear is that I got it so late. I'm going to hold off on the suicide for now. If it turns out I am pregnant, I'll more than likely end it right then and there.

If you doubt it, just, please leave... I really don't need/want to argue about the validity of my situation. Thanks.

In April, I was let go from my job. I was promised I'd be kept on at the end of the business's season, and allowed to start training for a higher position, I was however lied to, and like a said, ultimately laid off.

I have a GED, and my A+ Certification under my belt, and after looking in my gmail sent box last week, I've estimated that I've made about 150 calls, and sent out over 800 resumes via emails, still nothing.

I applied for unemployment, food stamps, and medicaid for my pregnant wife, and now almost 3 yr old daughter. I was given all three... but the unemployment payments were and still are very very little. I get about 150 a week. Our food stamps are enough to keep us fed. But the unemployment has mainly gone to pay our electricity, and buy needed items for our daughters, diapers/blankets/clothes etc...

My wife gave birth to our second daughter last week, and I couldn't love any of my ladies more. My wife and two daughters are my world... and I'm letting them down.

on the 8th of the month, (3 days past due on 600 dollars of rent) we recived a letter from our landlady... she advised us our lease is up, and she's tired of working with us on being late with rent... she we had til the 23rd to be out, otherwise she'd go through the eviction process. On the day of my newborn daughter's birth, my mother called her and advised her we need more time... she agreed to let us stay til the 31st. 

I have still not paid her for the month of July. And have 3 days to get out of here with nowhere to go, less than 75 dollars, no one available to loan us anything, and no hope of finding available services from the state as i was informed yesterday that waiting lists are 2-4 years long right now.

My parent's don't have money to help, or a place that we can stay. They simply don't. We tried last year before I landed the job I was laid off from in april, and they were threatened with eviction for letting us live there for a little while.

My wife's mother and father are divorced and live in different states. They've offered to help in the past, but only to the extent of helping by giving my wife and daugters a place to stay, not me. My wife refuses to except that offer without me being included.

I'm ready to just... let it all go. To just take a couple more of these pills, and fade out. I really feel like my wife would have more opportunity to succeed in life and with these little girls, if it weren't for my constant failing. We're so close to being homeless... should i just disappear and do it? should I do it tonight when they all goto sleep? will her parents really help her if Im gone? 

I know it would break her heart, and it breaks mine to think about it... but I dont see another way. If we become homeless with nowhere to go... the girls will be taken from us. theyll be split apart and put in homes where people make money from babysitting orphans and call them self foster parents.

I want desperately to fix all of this, but there's no way, I've turned everywhere I can think to. I've exhausted everything. And I'm the only roadblock in her way to getting into a stable environment by her choice alone.

I'm so tired of this.... mentally and physically...

UPDATE:
---------

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 

I don't really know how to take all of this in... it really is astounding that people I've never met would take the time to care for me and mine. I've received an offer of a financial loan, that should get us into a place, or let us continue where we are. 

I've looked at the links you've provided me, and have already taken steps to get help from some of these programs. 

Most importantly, I've taken the advice of people and realized how devastated I'd leave people where I to act on the things I stated above. I'm actually more ashamed that I can really convey here that I even thought these things, let alone posted them online. 

I told a few of you via IM/Emails/Replies and such that I actually have a meeting with the local mormon church tomorrow night. Hopefully they know of a place that we can get into without me having full time employment right now.

I wish I could say I found it here, but mostly I see people that have given up already.  I don't want that for myself, and I don't want that for anyone else who's suffering.  

SO I guess the reason I would need to unsubscribe from SW is because I need to go on living and keep making progress.  I do relapse often into self-harm and suicidal thoughts, but if there is any one thought that I hold on to to keep going its this: Everything will be alright.  Rather than let the bad thoughts snowball until I lose myself in them, I have to nip them in the bud and remember that although things are tough now, they always ease up.  I write it on my arm every day and look at it when I know I'm sliding downward.  Everything will be alright.  I know it's hard to believe, I didn't think so myself.  It's something to hold on to, something to get through the day and to wake up to.  It's keeping me going, I hope it can help someone out there.

The brain is incapable of imagining a reality where itself does not exist.

I don't believe in out of body, life after death, etc, so as far as I'm concerned, this is it and it's ending slowly.

As far as suicide is concerned, the only way is to destroy my body. However, since I'm incapable of imagining a reality where I don't exist, the only inevitable solution is I try to kill myself, and end up disabled and worse off. I can logically convince myself that I can put a bullet in my head and I will not end up blind and paralyzed, but my instincts tell me that the only possible outcome is I will end up still alive, in a lot of pain, and possibly in a condition where I could not attempt to do it again.

Therefore, I'm kind of stuck here. But that just means smoking, drinking, and lots of fatty foods to quicken the process. Of course, even if I die naturally, and even if I don't self destroy my body, it's still going to be a long shitty process either way. That's life :D

I love her more than anything on this earth, and I wish so badly that I could change her mind... but I accept that I can't. 

Our lease is up for renewal next month and I can't afford the house we're currently renting on my own, but I also can't find anywhere nearby or near my work that's within my price range either. My only friends I'm close enough with to ask such a favor of recently moved out of state for work as well, so I have no idea where I'm going to live either....

Really though I just don't know how to deal with the pain I'm feeling right now. I've been through bad breakups in my single years, but this hurts more than anything I've ever been through before. I have a history of mental illness (severe depression, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder) and I'm actively seeking consoling again, but my appointment isn't for another couple of weeks and I don't know if I can make it that long.

Everything reminds me of the time we shared together, and I feel nothing but sorrow and disgust with myself for not being more attentive as of late. I want to change things, I want to make things right, but I can't... and it's killing me. I have a gun, and I really want the pain to stop. For the first time in my life I finally felt like I was somewhere I belonged. I finally felt loved, and I was so happy with everything we had together. I just don't know what happened...

Everything hurts right now, and everything in this house, every candle and stick of furniture is a memory of a time we shared together and it's tearing my heart out to even look at any of it. I feel like I'm losing a piece of myself.

I know I'm not the only one who has been through this and I really want to know how to beat this because I don't want to die, but I can't see any other way to make the pain stop right now.

**Edit:** A little before I wrote this two hours ago I took a couple tranquilizers to help calm me down.

I spent most of my life from graduating high school up until this point drunk, on pills, or finding any substance I could abuse to keep me not feeling or thinking.


I'm 26 now. I do not have a boyfriend, nor do I really feel the need or point in attaching myself to another human being just to have them destroy me again.


I don't have a career. I should have a 401k, a mortgage or at the very least my own apartment. I came back home after being a wanderer for a year after my grandmother fell deathly ill, and eventually passed away.

I have a hobby playing video games and fuck, even made a job out of it for a while.

Then a follow co-worker went on a tirade of how pathetic of a person I was. And for some unknown reason, I took it deeply to heart.

The things he said to me are running on a constant repeat. I am laughable, I'm a joke, I will never be anything other than a sad waste of life.

That got me thinking. I had a chance to be a Animal Control Officer. I failed a drug test. I went to college, did really well until I got into a car wreck and the thought of over $750k in debt drove me so far down that I was taking 10-15 10mg Vicodin and drinking at least 2 40oz bottles of malt liquor, or an entire 24 pack of beer and a fifth of whiskey. A day. I failed out. (I ended up not having to pay a dime thanks to good lawyers and insurance)

When people bitch at me for being depressed, they tell me to go get a job and move out. Or get a boyfriend. Or find a hobby.

I really don't give a fuck about any of these things anymore. 

I simply do not see a reason why a person, like me, should be given a second chance by anyone. I was a drug addict and alcoholic for 7 years. Still am a bit of drunkard, but it's the ONLY THING IN THIS FUCKING WORLD that keeping me somewhat sane.

Why? Why get a job? Why should I sell my soul to a corporation that will only enslave me and work me to the bone until the day I die? Why should I make this disgusting piece of paper that people give so much value? I don't need a goddamn apartment. Give me a nice plot of land near a lake and I'm set. I don't want to live in a fancy house. I want my loneliness and solitude, or give me death.

Why should I attach myself to another human being in such a way that I give them all the ammunition in the world to destroy me? I don't trust people. I don't like people. People only cause pain. People only exist to hurt each other. There is no such thing as a ""good person"". That's an oxymoron.

I tried to kill myself back in March. I swear to god, another handful of sleeping pills and I would not still be wasting electricity, water or other fleeting resources.

Give me one, reasonable example that isn't some bullshit optimistic statement covered in glitter why I shouldn't just call it quits.

I wasted my chance of having a normal, successful life. I had all the opportunity in the world, and I threw it all away.

If all life is is attaching yourself to some human that will only cause you pain and suffering, sell your life to a company that sees you only as a number and an easily replaceable drone and spending every waking day shooting for this fairy tale you people call ""happiness"" that is just a fake, bullshit emotion that never lasts more than a few days?

I know, I sound like a cunt, a bitch, a spoiled brat, a pathetic joke, come off as being rude; whatever. I'm a shitty person anyways. 

What's the point of life? All I have ever done is fail. All I will do is fail. I have no hope of ever being anything different.

Even if you have to give me a bullshit optimistic statement covered in glitter, at least make it sound like it's faintly realistic thing. Try to keep religion and your empty hopes out of this.

Around the time i turned 7 my mother moved me and my two brothers away to live in a hostell, it was shortly after that time that my mother went to the hospital and i went to go live with some temporary foster parents awaiting permanent adoption from somebody else. My temporary foster parents were great, it wasnt until i was adopted that things really got bad. I forgot to mention but i didnt get adopted with my brothers, i was adopted on my own. After i got adopted the people that adopted me were terrible, i didnt get beat anymore but i was constantly neglected. I didnt go to school and i never got a good meal, all i was fed was terrible microwave meals. Shortly after for some reason or another i was again adopted, but this time it was my grandparents that adopted me. My grandparents were amazing people and ive lived with them till now when im 18. They brought me up well, taught me my manners and did there best to make me go to school. When i first came to live with them i was a horrible child, i would constantly get into fights and throw hissy fits. Eventually i grew out of that. When i was 13 my dad died, i never really felt the shock as i hardly ever knew him. I heard he was a great person and everybody on his side of the family loved him and were crying at the funeral but how great can a person be if he cant take care of his own child? Twice a year id get to go on a long drive to go see my two brothers who were adopted together, it was great and i loved them and loved seeing them grow up so fast, i only regret that i could see more of them. So after my dad died i stayed off school for a while and i cried alot, mostly crocodile tears but regardless of him not being the one taking care of me i still loved him because he was my dad. Time goes by, i do terrible at school i get alright grades but nothing to be joyful about. I was a huge game fanatic and loved playing tonnes of PC games. So from 16 to 18 i was constantly playing games. I never got job experience and i never went to college or anything like that. And that brings me to now, my grandad who has cared for me for the majority of my life and taught me what it means to be a man was diagnosed with cancer, he had an operation to no avail and it doesnt look good. I have nothing going on with my life, no job no qualifications and soon no family. Its going to break my grandma's heart when i take the last step and i dont believe in god, how could i after what ive been put through, so i dont believe ill ever see them again.

I am on a wide variety of medications, none of which are working.  I recently tried to be intimate with my boyfriend, something that is often difficult or impossible for ICers, and ended up with a flare (period of intense pain) that has left me bedridden since Saturday. I called my urologist,who prescribed a very expensive pain medication, for which I had to borrow money from my parents, that isn't working.  I'm at the point where I'm largely immobile and ended up missing class yesterday. My uro offered to set up an appointment for an instillation (procedure that can sometimes help) on Thursday, but I can't afford to miss any more class than I already have with exams coming up next week. I have had multiple breakdowns in the last couple of days, which is highly unlike me. The love of my life (21M), wonderful and patient as he is, cannot hope to understand what I am going through and I fear that I am going to soon lose him because I cannot handle the guilt of being depressed and sexually incompetent due to IC. It isn't fair for him to also be weighed down by a disease that isn't even his, and while he says he will never leave me because of it, I don't know if I can keep seeing him while knowing that this might be how it is for me for the rest of my life. He deserves better than that.  I have little hope of ever being able to horse-back ride, my greatest source of joy since I was 3, again because of the bladder pain. I have had to change my diet completely to avoid all foods that might irritate my bladder, which happen to be almost all of the foods that I enjoy.  I'm too afraid to even think about my grades for this semester due to my absences for doctor's appointments and flares, and my professors and TA are not answering my e-mails about missed work. I have become socially isolated because I go to a large party school, which I enjoyed very much first semester, but now I cannot ever drink due to bladder irritation or even summon the energy to go out with IC. I have tried to have a normal life, but I think I am losing it and I don't know what to do anymore. All of my symptoms are permanent.  I fear that I will never be able to have a husband or children because IC almost definitely eliminates the possibility of sex, let alone the possibility of having the energy necessary to raise a family.  Before IC, my life was full of opportunities and joy, and now I feel useless and alone. I used to go to the gym to work out my anxiety (I have had an anxiety disorder since I was a child), but now I can't even do that and I can feel myself growing weak and gaining weight. I feel like a disgusting waste of space. I am spending too much of my parent's and my own money on prescriptions for 10-14 pills a day that aren't even helping me right now. I find myself constantly thinking about suicide. I'm afraid of hurting those close to me if I were to kill myself, but in the long run they would be better off without having to worry about me and take my needs into consideration every time I leave the house.  I have thought about reaching out for counseling, but none of the support services at my school have experience with such a little-known disorder, and I'm so tired of trying to explain to people how I feel. Everyone around me is worried about me, but as much as they try to understand and help me, I just feel even more terrible for burdening them. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this.  I am constantly in terrible, burning, unbearable pain for which there is no relief. I can feel myself growing more and more hopeless, and I believe I am near my breaking point.  I tell myself every day that I am more than just the pain, but it is so overwhelming that I often just wish that I could curl up and die right then.

In the last half year my depression/anxiety has gotten so bad that I've been getting persistant fantasies about cutting myself, as well as a lot of concentration problems and just feeling fucked up in general. Back to the landlord, I finally accepted a room somewhere else, felt relatively ok about it, but found out today that my landlord is basically screwing me on the money he would give me for moving, and then I went to visit the room again and found out it was definitely way small. I accepted it because I felt stuck in my current room and couldn't deal with the pressure from the landlord, not because it was such a good room. While packing up I found out that the stuff I care about most is basically my collection of paint/tools/materials, something I really have no space to use in the new room. I'll be glad if I can get my furniture to fit, I have no clue where I'd be able to paint or build anything. I suppose this is very firstworldproblems, but fuck it I have mental issues and building shit helps me to hold on to sanity. 

I had my first meeting with a psychologist last week, but my first meeting with the psychiatrist isn't until the second week of March. And any pills I'd get would probably take 6 weeks to work anyway. Honestly I've thought about just calling the crisis center a couple of times in the last two weeks. But I'm supposed to have help now, and when I was looking for a psychologist the same organisation that has the crisis center basically told me that my problems weren't severe enough for them (they get the homeless people and all the other severe mental illness cases too). So yeah, I really have nowhere to go but inside myself, and I just feel like I want to wreck myself for making the wrong decision about the stupid room. And about everything going wrong. Not kill myself, thank god, but basically punish myself. Luckily the psychologist said it's expected for what he's thinking about my diagnosis (something to do with my personality, but what exactly he couldn't say yet in one session), so I suppose I'm not completely crazy or uniquely disabled or something. I don't really feel I fit in any of the categories of the treatment leaflet he gave me, and in general I'm kind of sceptical about the treatment, but I suppose at this point it can't really get worse or anything.

So yeah, it's not fun. I've never hurt myself, and honestly I hope I never will, but I'm getting closer and closer to doing something stupid (either hurting myself or destroying something else, neither of which are a good idea). 

I'm not sure why I'm writing this down or wtf you're supposed to do with it, but the only other people I can talk about this with are my family and I already talked to them a couple of times today. So I'm just on the internet because I'm scared to be off it I suppose, 'cause when left alone all I'll do is mentally torture myself for no good reason.

Let me introduce myself. For simplicity's sake, let's say my name is Seph. I am 14 and a half years old, and this is my story. I was born and raised for the first 9 years of my life in Bavaria, Germany. I lived in a very secluded, separate part of town, so we were pretty isolated. There was only one other kid to play with, let's call him Steve. Steve was about 4 years older than me. We became very close and spent pretty much all of our free time together. What I did not know and was not old enough to know was that Steve was a pretty sick kid. It started small, with him showing me his first pubes. Eventually, it evolved to him challenging me and my brother, who is two years younger than me to dares, which basically consisted of rubbing our penises on a wall. One day he decided he wanted to have sex with us and tried to get us to blow him. I refused because he peed from there. He then tried to give anal, there was no actual penetration. In the end he just decided to roll around on us and rub his penis against ours. I estimate I was around 6 - 7 at the time, my brother being 4-5. flash forward two years, our family is moving to miami. What you should know is that my mom is American, so I learned to speak English fluently and I have an American passport. My time there is relatively uneventful until I hit the early stages of puberty at around 12. I started to become increasingly depressed and developed severe anxiety. whenever I was left alone I could not stop thoughts of my parents and family being burned alive, dismembered and tortured in other ways. I never talked to my parents about these things. I became pretty depressed and had to see a therapist because I wrote a story about dead hamsters in school. Our school basically required me to see a counselor. That lasted about 2 months because to quote my father, it was ""a waste of money and I was fine."" Another year passes and we are moving again. This time we moved to vienna, austria. Things started going downhill very fast. I started cutting at 13, I dont remember my first motivation to pick up the knife and try It for the first time, however I was hooked off the bat. I started cutting more and more and deeper every time. If I did not leave a big enough cut, I was hit with a huge wave of rage because I felt like a pussy for not cutting enough, followed by frustration because it hurt to cut more, and then just guilt that I had not finished what I had started. I did not tell anyone about this, except for this one girl I kind of ""liked"". I did not really know how to expect her to react. When she saw the damage I had done to myself by this point, she was devastated and told our homeroom teacher. This lead to the principal and my parents finding out. The school recommended I see their counselor, but I never showed up. My parents also pressured me to seek out a therapist, but I only went once. My parents did not get involved much after this. I kept on cutting a lot after this. It is really hard to describe exactly what emotions I felt right before I cut, but the best I can describe it as is a deadly cocktail of shame, guilt, rage, frustration and feeling like I had no one at all. the last one is provably the worst, because even though I knew my parents loved me, they just did not understand. I kept isolating myself more and more and turning more into a shell, a husk of a person. My cutting got more and more eccentric. I carved an omega into my right forearm. It had a diameter of about 3 inches. I also carved a star of David into my thigh, along with multiple ""standard"" cuts. I got to a point where I did not have enough energy or the willpower to continue on. I decided to try to kill myself by cutting my wrist. My attempt failed because the artery was too hard to reach. I tried to cut the vessel but the angle was too difficult to get right with the razorblade. I remember taking a needle and desperately poking around in the gash I left, trying to puncture the main artery in my wrist. I could see a bump on the other side of my wrist where I was pushing up against the skin with the needle. In retrospect, I am pretty damn lucky I am still alive. After I tried and failed, I woke my parents up at two in the morning to take me to the hospital and get stitches. On the way to the hospital, I recall my father telling me I needed a way to vent. No shit. he recommended kickboxing, which I partook in for about two months. I stopped cutting after this, I am still not sure what caused the bounceback. One should also note that I had an extremely hard time trusting and building complex interpersonal relationships with people. I was very well liked, mainly since I put up a flawless act of a happy teen. I became very very skilled a lying and deceiving. I could make most people believe anything I said, and I had an innate sense of where someones weak spots lied. But back to the point: I did not really trust anyone, even though I did a good job at convincing people we were friends. This only added to my perceived loneliness. As this year rolled around, I became more and more interested in psychology. I spent hours learning more and more about the human psyche and it's weaknesses. I mainly did this because I felt I needed to diagnose myself with something. I have symptoms for many disorders, mainly BPD. I also have psychopathic tendencies, and many of the red flags lined up, like killing animals as a child. I used to take apart insects and smash them. I also thew the family cat down the stairwell once.
-----------------------------------
Freshman year in highschool: I have not cut in months and occasionally use marijuana. Life has calmed down somewhat but I am starting to get random psychotic and depressive episodes. Last year it was chronic clinical depression, but this year I can be fine one minute and legitimately weighing the odds of stabbing my friends in the neck the next. Sometimes my episodes are anxious, other times they are depressive. the worst kind, though, is a smoldering, broiling rage that comes out of nowhere and leaves me restless for hours. 




HERE IS MY ACTUAL QUESTION

I am afraid I am literally coming apart at the seams. I am not necessarily suicidal right now but I can never know who or what I will be the next minute. Am I going insane? have I already gone off the deep end? 


TLDR: Just fucking read it


EDIT: To be honest I was not really expecting this post to get any attention. I wish I could just ""see a therapist"" like you all are suggesting, however it is sadly not that simple. I do not live near a therapist, and even if I did, I doubt I could find the time or money required. I feel very vulnerable talking to my parents about this, mostly because they work a LOT and I do not want to trouble them right now. Additionally, my mom has anxiety problems and never seems to relax. She is also very sensitive around these topics, mostly because her sister killed herself while they were both around my age. I am afraid I will just end up hurting her if I bring stuff like this up. All in all, I am stuck in a pretty difficult situation, and if I saw a way out, I would take it.

I'm in the biggest shithole predicament of my life up to this point, and I feel as if I have no way out. 
I was recently arrested (about four months ago) for two felony drug possession charges. My house was raided because my roommate, unbeknownst to me, was selling drugs out of our house and ended up selling to an undercover. One day, I answered to a knock on the door to a gun in my face, and all of a sudden dozens of cops started running into my house. They had a warrant to search the entire premises. During that time, I had anti-anxiety medicine (not prescribed to me) in my possession, as well as weed, safely kept in my bedroom. The police searched my room, found the drugs, and arrested me.
I was in school to become a teacher. I was student teaching during the time of the arrest. My students were everything to me, the particular group of eighth graders I was student teaching at the time confirmed my decision to be a teacher. I was making straight A's, finally feeling happy and fulfilled with my life, and knowing this is what I wanted to do. I would occasionally take a half of one of the anti-anxiety meds before teaching to lower my heartbeat and feelings of nervousness, hence the reason I had them. I tried going to therapy, but the doctors I saw never helped me and I just couldn't talk to them. I have a hard time talking to anyone. I would come home, do my homework, and smoke a few bowls once I was finished with all of my work to relax, and as a reward at the end of the day. I enjoyed it, and I didn't see anything wrong with it. I never partied, or brought the drugs out of my house. I am a very introverted person, and almost always kept to myself. Teaching was one of the ways I always felt would help me get over my extreme social anxiety issues. 
In the few months following the arrest, I was not able to return to student teaching, which means all of my former students were basically under the impression that I ditched them. I had to change my major, and move out of my house. I lost the few friends I did have due to my depressive, introverted personality. I currently live with my boyfriend, who is incredibly supportive. My parents are disappointed in me. All I ever wanted to do was make them proud, help people, and just be happy with my life. I feel as if I have lost almost everything that meant anything to me.
I finally am facing the fact that I might actually do time in jail. I have a good lawyer, but after doing extensive research through my lawyer and the internet, I found out this particular District Attorney and judge(s) almost always sentence people with felony drug possession charges in my area to jail time. I would honestly rather die than have to spend any time in jail.
All I wanted to do in this world was live a life helping people, and trying to be happy. The fact that I might have to go to jail, postpone my life for years to come, and become a convicted felon is driving me back into a downward spiral. I am not a bad person. I have never stolen anything in my life, and I have never hurt a fly. I don't understand what I did to deserve this. I have considered suicide in the past, but never as much as I have now. I feel as if society and the world in general doesn't want me here. 
I have already planned my suicide entirely, as well as when I will do this. I don't really know if anybody will even read this. I just need somebody, anybody, to hear me. Give me your opinions if you choose, I am willing to accept anything anyone wants to say. Thank you for listening, Reddit.

tl;dr, Wanted to be a teacher, got arrested, realized I can't do that, became unhappy, now I just want to die",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_18nk2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18nk2o/reddit_this_took_courage_to_write/,

I want someone to read my story.,35,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17tky1/i_just_dont_know_whether_i_want_to_kill_myself_or/,"I made this on a throwaway account because some of my friends know my Reddit username. I doubt anyone would read this, it’s too long, but I’m trying anyway. So I am currently 17. Before I start hearing ""you're too young to think about these things"" or ""you still have so much ahead of you, wait it out and things will get better."" Just hear me out first. When I was 13, my best friend (let's call him J) came out to me (we're both guys) and he told me he had feelings for me. Being the ignorant kid I was, I found it weird (I'm straight), and decided to stop being friends with him. A few weeks later he killed himself. The first few months were exceptionally difficult. I was constantly depressed and cut myself almost every day, I have over 50 scars all over my body now. As my attempt to make up for his death, I decided I would try being gay. It was stupid, yes, but I was 13. I didn't really know how I could so I decided to google ""how to meet gay people"" and ended up on a gay dating website. Being the dumbass I was, I met a guy on there and spontaneously without really thinking about it, he gave me his address, and I went over. Short version is: I got raped. Told my parents the whole story around a year after, we tried to take it to court but nothing happened in the end. Took me a few months to get over it then I developed what seems to be selective amnesia, I just completely forgot about it, nothing would remind me of it not even when people say rape or make pathetic rape jokes. I was still clinically depressed. My parents sent me off to boarding school, by now I was over the whole idea that maybe I could be gay to compensate for J's suicide. I was expelled from school for disciplinary behaviors, the year later I moved back home. I was 15 now. I went to a concert with a few friends and ended up getting very very drunk.  I have a very vague blurry memory of it, but somehow I ended up in the back of someone’s car, and I was raped. Again. At this point I was beyond depressed, I just couldn’t bare it anymore. I never thought about either rapes but was just constantly depressed. I hated everything and everyone. I swallowed a full box of Advil (pain killer). I woke up in a hospital with a long clear tube shoved up my nose (I don’t know why the nose and not just the throat) that apparently led into my stomach. Every time I swallowed I felt razors in my throat. I will never forget that pain and that’s probably why I haven’t swallowed pills again as a means of suicide. I never told anyone about my second rape, and lost many friends because of the suicide. Since then I’ve been very clingy to all my best friends and drive most of them away. The reason I’m clingy is because of J, and because I don’t want to lose any friends in general. Two years later, I’m not constantly depressed. I saw a psychiatrist and a therapist after the suicide for two years, and was on Zoloft. Now I’m not taking any form of antidepressants. I’m not antisocial, I have many friends, I just don’t feel emotionally connected to any of them. Nothing. I’m completely oblivious of emotion now. Until I feel rejected or I’m drunk. Whenever I drink I become extremely depressed and suicidal. Although I see my friends almost every day when they do something and not tell me, I feel rejected, and then suicidal. Me and my family are both close, but still distant. We’re close in the sense we laugh and have a good time together but we never have serious talks and I’m more of friends with my parents and siblings than anything else. For the past few months, I’ve been depressed, yes, it’s clear to me. The type of clinically depressed where I really have no control over it. I try to cheer myself up as much as possible I just can’t. I really genuinely can’t. I feel completely discouraged from living. I just really want to die. I don’t want it to be suicide, I can just wait it out because I know everyone dies one day. I’m just so worried about what that would do to my family. I just don’t know anymore. Dying naturally is taking too long, I just want it to be over. I just want to stop. Stop being here, I’m just done with it. I’m not sure if I’d kill myself. I might, but unlikely.

My self-esteem. I went to college for the first time last semester and flunked, now financial aid is denied and I don't get another chance. I have no money to pay for a semester myself to go back and prove I can do it. Who am I kidding though? I likely can't. My girlfriend of 4 years and I broke up when I was 21, and I still can't find a girl that will go on a second date with me. I think I have a great first date and I just keep getting turned down. I just received my final rejection yesterday. I'm not ugly, I'm not fat. I just have nothing to offer. I'm worthless. I can't be happy by myself anyway, what makes me think I could be happy with someone else? I can't, but my emotions don't let me rationalize it. 

All of my friends are gone. They are all married and living their own lives. They have all graduated college already when I just went for my first semester. They all grew up with parents that could pay for everything they needed throughout their life. I got to grow up and watch my friends have their first cars bought for them, all the way to them having a place to live and college paid for, and family to help them when they made mistakes, financial or otherwise. All of my family is messed up, I tried to fix it. I tried to take care of things my parents couldn't. I thought I was the normal one. I'm not. I gave everything and now I'm out.

Anonymous will have to do, I've just finished eating, cleaning my living space, and organizing my things. I have a video journal with normal entries for three years now, nothing about suicide, just things you would say about your day to day life, I've spent the last month deleting any entries that would seem depressing. My family knows my passwords I use so they won't have a problem getting to it, or to the rest of my computer. I'll just be another statistic for the start of a new year.

I am rarely able to get to sleep without crying and rarely attempt to sleep before 5 am, because I'll just cry for longer if I do.

I'm increasingly developing, or becoming aware of, how distorted a view I have of sex and women.  Some of my closest friends are women, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep those friendships because just thinking about them has began to make experience a mix of anger and sadness.  I don't hate women, but I fear that I someday might, seeing an attractive woman at this point makes me upset because I know I'll likely never sleep with her.

I have no idea how this problem might be resolved either, I've never been remotely sexual with a women who has known me for more than a day, my only experiences have come from drunken party hookups.  I fear going out and trying to meet people solely out of motivation to have sex, but to pretend it's for any other reason would be disingenuous.  Any sort of remotely formal dating scares me, I don't enjoy spending time with many people, and I've never had a good time hanging out with people for the first time.  I don't see any sort of date going anywhere without me pretending to enjoy it just to get into her pants (not to mention the fact that this probably wouldn't work).  Additionally I have a fear that I might lose it in the face of rejection, possibly breaking down and crying on spot or even worse becoming violent (even though I'm 99% sure I wouldn't, that 1% terrifies me).

I set a date a few months ago to kill myself, and now it's here. I gave myself enough time to cut ties, write notes, and get everything in order. Now that I'm so close, though, I'm having second thoughts. I don't think I'm going to kill myself tonight, but the idea of living until tomorrow is almost unbearable to think about. I don't know how to explain it, really.

I guess to give you some background on my reasoning. I'm 16 years old and I have virtually no friends. I spend all my time in my bedroom and I don't even go to school anymore since my depression got too severe and I was switched to online school. I don't really have any talents or skills, and I can't even get a damn job. I don't have any special qualities, and I have close to no interests, I'm definitely not the most attractive girl, either. I'm just a hallow shell of a person anyways, so why not just finish the job and put myself out of my misery?

I tried to overdose last year, but I guess I did something wrong and I just woke up the next day in a puddle of vomit. I have some xanax and vodka stashed away now, though.

Anyways, I haven't had any doubts at all about going through with this until now. The only thing stopping me from downing the pills right now is my family. My uncle was just diagnosed with cancer last week, and I really don't want to put my parents and sister through any more emotional trouble. Now I'm mostly just scared and panicking about it and I don't know what to do. I've been on reddit for a little while and I've heard of this subreddit in passing. The idea of calling the suicide hotline just makes me panic more, so I thought I would just try to get my situation out here with a throwaway account.

I am working my way out of a similar situation.

Just talk to someone, anyone. I understand talking to your friends and family about something like this is difficult but there are lots of other people who will listen. Talk to your doctor, everything you tell him/her is confidential. Talk to a mental health line, they are trained to deal with people who are feeling like that. Or the people here, there are tons of people here who will offer their time to talk to you. I went to my doctor who is a cool guy, I was ready to talk to him but when I got in he handed me over to a med student so I was really reluctant and nervous talking to this person I've never met before. But once I started we just kept talking, and it got personal. I've told her things that I haven't told anyone else in the world. It got really emotional and we both got teary-eyed but in the end I felt a whole lot better. So please just talk to someone.

Also when my doctor can in she filled him in on what was happening and this is what he said

He said that one of the most common things people do to people with depression is just tell them to cheer up. But you can't just cheer up, depression isn't in your imagination it is in your brain. If someone had a skiing accident and broke their leg you couldn't just tell them to walk on it. They would need to go to the doctor and get a cast, it will take time for that leg to heal before they can walk on it again. That's what we do with depression, we fix it but it will take some time. Michael J. Fox has parkinson's which happens when dopamine levels are low in the brain and it effects motor skills. He can't hold a pen still like you and I can. No one would tell Michael J. Fox 'Hey, cut it out, people are looking' because they know he has parkinson's and they know what that is. Depression is similar in that your sarotonin levels in the brain are low which effect your mood, we can use medication to bring those levels back up to where they need to be so that you can enjoy the things you like to do.

So please, you are not crazy, just go to the doctor and tell them what is going on. You will feel better, trust me.

Also, so many people care about you whether or not you have a good relationship with the people directly around you. Your aunts and uncles, cousins and nephews.

I'm a 19 year old female from Seattle, Washington. I was born in one of the worst neighborhoods in my city. Lots of gun violence, lots of drug deals, lots of gang activity, you name it. My parents divorced when I was four (or somewhere around then) because my father was abusive, so my mom raised us three kids by herself. I'm the youngest and have two older brothers.

My mother suffers from PTSD and bipolar disorder, both of which were exacerbated considerably during the ten years she worked in the juvenile detention system. She had a psychotic break when I was in elementary school and was temporarily committed to an institution. She quit her job and went back to school for four years to get a communications degree that means pretty much nothing in the economy right now. We've been living on an incredibly tight budget most of my life, with not a lot of money for new stuff -- or, even, for stuff we needed, a lot of the time.

Because I wasn't a very assertive child, I got pushed aside a lot when I was little. My brothers' arguments and appetites meant a lot of emotional and financial stress for my mom, so I tried my best to make myself small and stay out of the way as much as I could. It was an unbelievably destructive way to spend a lot of my childhood, because it meant I had to actively suppress a very large part of my personality to keep what little peace we had in the household. Furthermore, my family (my brothers, mostly) got used to me being the shy one, so when I tried to assert myself, they laughed it off and brushed me aside, dismissing me as “dramatic” or “self-centered.”

When I was 12, I had my first round of suicidal thoughts. My family wasn’t taking anything I said or did seriously, which meant that I didn’t feel I could tell them that the son of the pastor of the church we attended (who was at least six years my senior, I don’t remember exactly) was taking advantage of me sexually and had, quite possibly, given me an STD. The shame and guilt of it was overwhelming, and the feeling that, because I was so young, nothing I said mattered anyways, drove me almost to the edge. One night, when everyone was sleeping, I went to the kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife we had, and brought it back to my room. The blade was against my forearm, poised to cut, when something made me stop. (I have a theory about this, but it’s a little far-fetched and not really to the point. Ask me later if you really want to know.) I made it through that night. We still have that knife.

The rest of middle school/high school passed with nothing major happening. Money was tight. My brothers moved out, so all of my mom’s craziness was directed at me, which made it pretty impossible to be at home. I focused all of my energy on my school work, which paid off way more than I thought it would. I got into my top-choice school (Columbia University) early decision, was chosen as a recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship, and spent the majority of my first semester in college pretty convinced that everything would be much easier for the rest of my life.

Spring semester of my freshman year, one of my very good friends from home killed herself. Being almost 3,000 miles away from home and all of my friends, it was hard to explain to my professors why I wasn’t able to come to class and why my work wasn’t up to its normal standards. Before I got home, I learned that two girls in high school who went to my church (different church than before) also killed themselves. It was a rough semester, and my grades reflected that.

This last summer, my mother and I fought constantly because she was jealous of all the attention I was getting from our church congregation (she’s admitted this to me since). Being at home was mentally and emotionally exhausting, so I didn’t get the break I really needed to cope with the events of spring semester. I left for school again in the fall, wanting nothing but to be away from my mother for as long as was humanly possible.

Last November, my mom was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of lymphoma that does not usually respond well to chemotherapy. I began having severe insomnia. My grades dipped again, and I finished the semester with a poor GPA – again.

In January, another good friend of mine was found dead in an apartment complex in Barcelona. In February, we found out that his death, originally thought to be accidental, was actually being investigated as a homicide with the possibility of sexual assault. Not long afterwards, around the anniversary of my friend’s suicide, a member of the church I attend in New York City was murdered as well.

I was back on the suicidal track. My grades were (are) suffering because of everything that’s happened, and New York City’s I-don’t-give-a-crap-about-anyone-but-myself attitude was (is) really, really wearing on me. The apathy for other people’s suffering became almost too much for me to bear. I went through a list of people I knew, asking myself whether their lives would be completely devastated if I just wasn’t around anymore. I didn’t come up with anyone, and went to sleep, planning to come up with ideas for how I would end my life the next day.

I pushed it off for a few days, mostly because I’m really scared of pain. I had a cappella rehearsal a few days later, and we ran through the song where I have a solo during rehearsal. There was a moment during the song, when I had a break from singing in the song, where I looked back at the group. I was completely surrounded by music. I met the eyes of everyone in the group and knew, in that instant, that I had another family. I felt happiness and completeness I didn’t even think was possible many, many days before, in the darkness and loneliness that was completely overwhelming at four in the morning. I had found something I truly loved, and I’d found people that were not only invested in making music with me, but also cared about me as a person.

I wish I could say that it was 100% happy from then on, that everything went back to normal, but you guys know that’s not how these stories go. I broke my ankle pretty badly a couple of weeks later, underwent surgery, and found myself confined to a wheelchair three weeks before the end of the semester. My attendance, already spotty because of the depression issues, became such an issue for one of my professors that he asked me to withdraw from the class. Getting to class has been pretty tricky because our campus is just barely wheelchair accessible, so I’ve missed the last few class meetings for my remaining classes. I’m 99% sure I’m looking at academic probation for next semester, and my broken ankle means I don’t get to exercise as much as I have been this year, so that’s going to cause some health problems that are just too much for me to think about right now.

But I’m not here to bum you out. My point is that really, really, *really* crappy things have happened to me, and I’ve survived them. Only just, but I've still survived.

My point is that I see that the apathy that is pervasive in our culture is toxic – fatally so.

My point is that my story is not the same as yours, but I hope it’ll give you some hope that there is, in all probability, a light at the end of the really, really dark tunnel you’re in. And, if you feel that there isn’t a single person who thinks that what’s happening to you doesn’t matter, I will tell you that **that’s not true.** I know that it matters. I know how much it hurts when people say it doesn’t matter.

Please hear me: it matters. **You matter.** Each and every one of us matters. And I’m going to work as hard as I possibly can for the rest of my life to convince as many people as I possibly can that that’s true.

**TL;DR -- I love you.**

I'm twenty years old. I've flunked out of college, I feel much, much stupider than I used to from a combination of severe depression, lack of productive focus for my mind, and a lot of alcohol/marijuana/k2 spice. After a drunken burst of suicidal ideation last summer, I was forced to relocate out of state to live with my parents, and I then freeloaded off my family for several months. I worked a little but did almost nothing else productive for that duration.

I have a job now, by the way, but I absolutely hate it and I have been unsuccessful in finding another one.

My unresolved issues caused issue with each of my family members, as I lived with all of them, and with the people I'm living with now, who were generous enough to let me sleep here rent free. However, I found out today that, because of my inability to control my frustrations, they have kicked me out. I don't have anywhere else to go.

My depression stems from two places, mainly: the first is that I'm transgender and it has fucked up my life. It took me flunking out of college and becoming an angry, depressed, suicidal alcoholic before I was able to even attempt to come to terms with it. I have been trying to start the process for many months now, but money, home situations, and politics have repeatedly gotten in the way, so I have had no emotional resolution in that area.

Because of this depression, I have lost all the motivation I had to do anything at all. I was an accomplished instrumentalist in high school - I was all-state three years - one of the smartest kids in my school, a pretty damn good athlete, and I had a lot of interests and loved learning. I can no longer even play a scale on my instrument, due to deterioration of muscles, I have an impossibly difficult time learning, and I have no motivation to fix these problems. I've tried, multiple times, but have been unable to keep it up.

To top things off, I think I seriously fucked myself up, psychologically, while I was heavily addicted to k2 spice (it's a stupid addiction, but whatever). I spent years believing myself to be - with some justification - a sociopath, and I think I've developed a conscience now. I'm afraid of my own mind, much of the time, when before I used to enjoy it. I need serious counseling, but I have too many other pressing concerns - money, shelter, etc. - and it's just not feasible right now.

Quite frankly, I feel like a complete, utter failure of what and who I used to be. I have so much shit to wade through before I get anywhere close to where I want to be, and I don't think I have the emotional resolve to do it. I have felt seriously suicidal a handful of times before, but none with the kind of calm resolve I have right now. It's so easy, and this suffering will be over with. I'm only typing this because I want someone out there to know why I did what I did.

I'll still read your responses on the off-chance that something someone says snaps me out of this, but as of right now I'm very, very resolute in this decision.





EDIT: Having completely given up, I got high one last time. Now I'm not so sure I want to kill myself, but my life still looks as hopeless as before, I've just stabilized a little.

Please, I need to talk to someone, I think I can reason myself out now. I just need to figure out a plan.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,t3_rooev,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rooev/im_going_to_jump_off_the_roof_of_my_apartment/,

My life is shit from almost every perspective. Brought to the US at the age of 14 unfortunately I didn't qualify to obtain legal residence in this country. Lived with my parents and my sister. My father was an alcoholic and aggressive idiot who didn't get legal residence in this country because of his past. Basically we all lived in fear at home because of him but we all stayed with him because we needed the money to help with the transition in this country. My mother became a citizen, my sister a resident, and they managed to get retail jobs so after a while my father got sick of supporting us and went back to Mexico. 

I never managed to make new friends, I was and still am too insecure because my parents weren't too involved in my upbringing. They don't speak English, my father would rage if I asked him to take me to school or buy anything beyond food even if he was making $2500/month as a peon and not even paying in full for rent and utilities. I guess the cultural shock was pretty fucking harsh and never managed to get past it, I was almost 15 when we moved so I was already nearing adulthood. Sometimes I wonder if it wasn't the cultural shock but rather the treatment I received at home.

I did like shit in school, no access to extracurricular activities, only one car and it belonged to my dad, fights all the time at home, sister got into drugs so that put a lot of extra pressure on my parents, I felt fucking alone so I retreated to a deeper and darker place in my mind. Eventually I got depressed, managed to finish school with an embarrassingly low GPA which I didn't even care to find out what it was, passed algebra, chemistry, but by physics I just stopped caring... I was ashamed of who I was, I had no life and working in group projects was fucking hell because I had to deal with normal people. I couldn't reach out for anyone, my counselors thought I had no future and just assigned crappy courses like interior design and animal farming -_- (sad LOL) when I asked for programming ones. I guess that as a minority with a low GPA with a shitload of mental issues passed as someone who barely spoke English and wouldn't have the ability to do some simple logic on a computer.

Fuck, I've deviated from the topic... anyway. My mother (late 50s) has been on medical leave since she had an accident at work where she fractured three vertebrae, she's soon going to undergo her 3rd surgery to attempt to get her shit fixed since now she has a limp. She'll stop receiving her payments in less than six months so that means that I have to get a job AfuckingSAP, the thing is that the last time I had a mcjob I would get anxious as hell when dealing with co-workers and the customer... I am even afraid of checking the mail if there's people outside. 

I managed to finish up to calc II in college (was working on a EE degree), couldn't do my speech class since I am too self-conscious (tried three times). Lost a shitton of weight trying to see if that would fix my attitude, didn't do shit. Dropped out of community college because we couldn't afford to keep paying it, but really, I didn't see myself going anywhere especially with what's going on around me. My mother is shit poor, doesn't have any savings, who knows if she's going to end up well and be able to hold a job after her last surgey (if it's even the last one) we don't even have our own home, we have around $5K CC debt which was accumulated after my father left... 

If I work, it will be to pay for my mother's debt, I have no incentive to work or study because doing both make me feel like shit. I am not lazy, I just don't see myself making any progress earning money because the little I would make would disappear as soon as I got it by paying rent, utilities, and debt. Did I mention that if I get pulled over I could get deported? 

Part of me wants to get deported back to fucking Mexico, to escape it all, but my sister is about to leave home because she's become fed up with all the fucking problems, an agoraphobic/socially anxious/no life brother, a sick mother... me leaving would mean abandoning my mother to rot in debt and physical ailment... you just don't abandon those who care for you. What's for me back in Mexico if I get deported? I don't have a degree, my Spanish is decent both in speaking and writing but far from a professional level, I do have relatives but they are shit poor as well and mentally unstable...

I look at my options... I can't court a woman to even attempt to get married and get a green card because I am an emotional mess (never had a gf, don't have any friends). I've developed a fucking speech impediment from not talking to people so my fluency is all fucked up when talking in both languages, this makes me even more insecure. If I get a job I wouldn't last long because the anxiety would make me quit... dealing with the Mexican version of rednecks is just unnerving... they are unpredictable, loud, aggressive, get away with doing drugs at work, can't hold a conversation that isn't about tits or soccer. I took french in HS and college so I do have basic conversational skills, but even if I wanted to immigrate to Canada I would require to have a useful degree of some sort and even have money to do all the proceedings. Sometimes I do fix or build the occasional computer, build a basic home network, or build a static website but these are shit, low grade IT skills, and without a social security number no one is going to hire me for shit.

Nothing stops me from hating myself. Even though I realize that there are millions of people dying of hunger right now, it just doesn't stop me from hating my existence.

I tried college, and I stopped going because I hated it. I hold a shitty job that pays nothing, working for people that couldn't give a shit if I died tomorrow. Every day I waste my time in this place, and every day I wish I would get hit by a truck on the way home. It's a pointless endeavor. I would try to find a new hobby but everything I try bores the living shit out of me or is costs money, and when you don't have any it's hard to find something to do. 

I don't have any friends I actually appreciate. I don't appreciate them because they are in the same position I am in, and being a working-class drone isn't a respectable position in my mind. 

Women drive me crazy. I thought I was in a picture perfect relationship that shit everywhere because it turned out that I lied to myself and made myself believed I loved a girl I didn't, yet, I still think about her every day. You'd say I still love her, but I wouldn't be content if I was in a relationship with her again. I would belittle her and take advantage of her anyway. I do my best to avoid relationships now because they seem to just get in the way of me trying to dig myself out of this shitpit that is my life, but no matter how much I focus on trying to get out of debt, it's never fast enough. No one is reliable. No one is dependable. No one has any fucking money. No one is industrious as I am and no one wants me around anyway so whats the fucking point? 

I'm fairly sure I've never actually felt love. All I have been able to do is fool myself into thinking I was in love. I haven't been able to feel happy since I left high school, and I'm forgetful as hell. I ask a lot of questions and always end up getting laughed at for asking questions that are obvious to everyone else, yet they always as me to come fix their bullshit when it breaks!

I'm not motivated to do much of anything, ever. I'm already tired of writing this. I can't focus on fucking anything. I think I literally have a 30 second attention span, and then I just get frustrated because things are taking too long. 

The only constant in my life is feeling like shit, day in and day out, and when I don't, it's because I've convinced myself that feeling depressed is for weak people that can't get their heads screwed on the right way, but I'm pretty sure I'm the one that can't get his head screwed on the right way. 

I squandered all the money I made in the last 4 years on stupid shit that didn't make me any money back, and I still knowingly do it every day. My self control with money is like a child in a toys-r-us with mommy's credit card.  

I hate myself because I can't be everything, and it's turning out it's hard for me to be anything at all. I'm not comfortable being this person. If I die, I won't know the fucking difference anyway so really the only thing I have left to do is find a good way to do it and talk myself into pulling the trigger.

He's 5 hours away and I can't take off work, so I can't see him.

I hardly talk to my parents (or anybody anymore) because I always let them down. And they constantly tell me that. I'm always compared to my cousins. They're perfect. I'm just their son that they despise because I'm a failure. 

I feel like everything I do upsets them. They get mad, yell at me, treat me like dirt, hit me, throw me around like I'm some puppet. I probably am anyways. Everytime they yell, I just can't help but cry right in front of them because I let them down. I'm not that good in school. I'm not that good in life. I'm not good at anything. Anything and everything I do will just piss off my parents. I've never made them happy. Not even when I was in elementary school.

I wish they gave birth to a different, and better child. My own mother said that right in my face. That was years ago. She asked God why she gave her a failure. Asked Him what did she do to deserve me. I'd be happy to die if it made them happy. That way, they could have another son. A better one than me. Sometimes, I overhear my mom talking to her friends on the phone about how much of disgrace and failure I am.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I can't tell anyone because my friends are too busy being happy. I fake all that happiness when I'm with them. I don't want to tell my ""friends"" that I wanna kill myself. I've seen them deal with problems of their own friends. They just think they're overreacting. And I'm afraid that they're gonna tell that to me also.

I may not fully understand his condition, but I know that he is trying as hard as he can and that the man he wants to be – someone who has the confidence and power to selflessly help others – is still in him somewhere. But his depression won’t let him see it. His search for the right medication puts him on emotional rollercoasters that leave him in constant pain, and he admits that he does not have much time. The worst possible situation for him right now is that he fears that in his condition will put him in a psyche ward or that the police will somehow take him (for whatever reason?) and that our connection with him will be severed. I don’t want this for him either. There has to be another way. I know he is wrong - I know his life is worth living, but I don’t know how I can possibly convince him.

1345063222.0,30,self.SuicideWatch,ya4as,There is hope! I just want to share with you where I've been and how far I've come in just 2 months.,41,11,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ya4as/there_is_hope_i_just_want_to_share_with_you_where/,"/r/SuicideWatch, I know exactly what you are going through.  Just 2 months ago, I was literally sitting on my couch with a noose in my hands about to end it all.  About 1.5 months ago, I was issued a Temporary Detention Order and forced to go to the Psych Ward of my local hospital against my will.  I am now seeing a psychologist and I am in regular communication with my family.  This summer, after 2 years of letting my life fall apart, I finished my classes with all A's (I haven't done that since High School).  And as of today, I have a job to help pay for college!

I can't imagine that just 2 months ago, I was ready to give up and throw everything away.  I felt the exact same feelings a lot of you are going through.  I felt alone, worthless, hopeless, unwanted, unloved, abandoned and forgotten.  I want you to know that those are all LIES!  No matter how hard it is for you to believe, there is someone out there who cares about you.

SW has been a huge help in the past for me when I've struggled with depression.  I can't tell you how serious my suicidal thoughts and plans were. I was even ordering sedatives over the internet that I could overdose on.  I don't know any of you, but seeing the hurt that you all are going through assures me that I'm not alone in my struggles.

I know you think that no one out there cares about you or would even miss you if you left.  I have had those exact same feelings.  I constantly would tell myself, ""If you killed yourself, nobody would even show up to your funeral.""  I can tell you as someone who has experienced the same Hell that you're going through, that ***I*** care about you.  ***I*** want to see you succeed and be happy.  It pains me so much to see people feeling this degree of pain, having experienced it myself.

I want to give you some advice that helped me get through it!

You have to learn to recognize intrusive thoughts.  Recognize them as **LIES** and rebuke them immediately.  Do not entertain those thoughts for even a split second.  If you let your mind go off on its own, your thoughts **will** destroy you.  You are loved and cared for deeply.

Secondly, Your worth is **NOT** determined by how many friends you have or how many people like you.  ***You*** determine what your life is worth.  You can achieve anything that you put your mind to.  I used to constantly stress over whether or not my friends liked me.  I wouldn't hear from any of my ""friends"" for months, and I'd tell myself, ""You could just die and nobody would notice or care.""  This mindset drove a lot of my suicidal behavior.  I realized that I was putting my worth and happiness in the hands of *other* people.  Who gives a SHIT what Joe Schmoe, your old high school buddy, thinks of you?!  If he/she doesn't care about you, then why should you care about them?  Your life's value is what ***YOU*** make of it.

Everyone has their vice.  Mine was drugs.  You CANNOT let drugs take control of your life.  I know it's scary to face the world on your own, but sitting on your couch high as a kite is not going to help you in any way.  I know it's hard to muster up the willpower, especially if you are going through a physical addiction to a substance, but you **MUST** tell yourself that the drugs are running your life, and that it is absolutely necessary to get rid of them.  Don't even look at it as a decision.  Look at it as an inevitability.  How many times have you heard someone say that drugs did great things for their life?  You're going to have to give up the drugs at some point to have a successful, fulfilling life. Why not start now?  I can tell you that since I stopped using hallucinogens, I feel better than I've felt in YEARS.  There is NO better feeling than getting everything done off your to-do list and then relaxing.

**STAY BUSY!**

I can't stress that enough.  There is so much truth in the saying ""Idle hands are the Devil's tools.""  Here's some ideas to keep you busy during the day:

* Get in shape
* Learn a new language
* Go Kayaking
* Go hiking/camping
* Collect something
* Volunteer somewhere
* Take an online course (or go to khanacademy.org and learn something new for free)
* Learn a programming language and make an app for your computer or smartphone (there's tons of books and online materials)
* Make a blog
* Learn a musical instrument
* Join a local community (Could be a church, a hiking group, a book club, a movie club, etc.)
* Go to yard sales and thrift stores
* Watch a documentary or a movie you wouldn't normally watch
* Write poetry or a short story or a song
* Do some puzzles
* Get organized

There's literally an endless number of things you can do to keep yourself busy no matter where you live. (comment if you want to add more ideas)

Also, I know that for me, my depression is at its worst when I'm lying in bed unable to fall asleep.  I take adderall for my ADHD and it sometimes gives me insomnia.  I recently started using a storm sound generator and meditation tracks, and they have worked wonders for my sleep schedule.  They help settle your mind and fall asleep.

I also want to encourage you to seek help if you need it.  I was furious when I was taken to the hospital, but it ended up being a huge wake-up-call for me.  I am not sure if it's the case everywhere, but where I live, if you are issued a TDO, you don't need insurance to go to the hospital.  Look online or ask a local counseling center about group counseling.  Your pain and suffering is nothing to be ashamed of.  Nobody is going to judge you in the groups, because chances are, someone in your group is worse off than you.  Don't hesitate to go to an Alc Anon, Narc Anon, etc.

I really hope that this post could offer some hope and encouragement to those of you out there that are suffering.  These are things that have helped me deal with my depression and suicidal tendencies.

I want you to know that I *LOVE* you, and it fills my heart with sorrow to know that people out there are going through so much pain.  Please comment or PM if you want to add anything or if you have a question for me.  I'm open to discuss pretty much anything.  If you need a friend to talk to, I'm here.

Is life worth living?,37,6,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/va1zl/i_have_aspergers_is_life_worth_living/,"I'm a 20 year old college student diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and I don't think I'll ever be able to achieve the quality of life that other people have.  I just read in the ""most depressing fact you know"" thread that over 90 percent of people with Asperger's never get married or have kids and I don't think I'm part of that ten percent.  I only know one person with Asperger's who has a girlfriend and he's brilliant and disciplined.  Everybody else I know with Asperger's is an anti-social shithead, myself included.  I'm awkward, ugly, and I've never met a girl who likes me as more than a friend. (I've had about two or three friends who are girls) 

I've asked out multiple girls, only one said yes and the ""date"" was a massive sham.  It turned out she had a boyfriend who she never told me about after I paid 40 dollars for dinner and we still hang out because I'm an immense faggot.  Whenever I talk to girls (and guys to a lesser extent) I can tell that they think I'm awkward and repulsive and they feel uncomfortable and would rather be talking to somebody else.  My parents and my therapist tell me I'll be able to find someone but I'm pretty sure my parents are delusional (they genuinely believe I'm a cool, handsome guy who people like) and my therapist will say anything to make me feel better.  My friends tell me ""BLARGH JUST BE CONFIDENT"" but they're the ones who make fun of me for being weird and awkward so I don't think they have any confidence in me.       

I don't see why I should live the rest of my life if I'll be alone forever.  I don't know if I'll be able to have kids either because my kids will probably just be depressed and retarded like I am.

I had just turned 16. My family would have abandoned us both, so I let them convince me of what a horrible mother I would have been and I gave him up.

What I did was ""brave"" and ""selfless"" and so no one expects that I regret it every day of my life. I was very subtly coerced, and only recently realized that it wasn't my choice. People expect me to move on and be normal, but it's impossible. They expect that because I have been through such trauma, I have all the answers, that I am strong and capable. But I'm not. I am a shell of a person. I am a scared little girl, all alone. I am needy and helpless and vulnerable and I have never been allowed to be those things even for a second. I have swept the pain under the rug for so long.

I find myself at a place in my life, on my own, no college, just work, 14 hour days. My roommates hate me and my dog. My boyfriend is pulling away because my complexities aren't as exciting as he once thought, because he doesn't want to listen to me ramble about the past. My mother is more concerned with ingratiating herself with her boyfriends three kids than how I'm doing. I need to move home but I can't because his daughter lives with them now. My dog is the same age as my son, I got him while I was pregnant. People thought it was a bad idea because getting a ""replacement"" wasn't healthy but at this point my dog is the only thing keeping me alive. I couldn't leave him with people who don't care about him. My dog needs me. But I don't know how long I can keep it up.

I am a shell. I have zero personality at this point. I am so exhausted with trying to put up these fronts that I am okay. I have never been allowed to feel pain, but it's all I know. For once, I want to be taken care of. Just for a little while. But it won't happen, and I see no reason to wait around any longer for relief. I have been to several therapists, and all they can muster is a blank stare and a lecture on ""ambiguous loss"" because ya know, ""it's the same thing families of POW's go through."" 

I don't know when or how but someday soon this shit is gonna catch up to me, and I will implode. Silently and without ceremony, the last little bit of my humanity is on it's way out.

I might replace I'm with was cause it'll be past tense by that point.


I cannot wait to be dead, because there really is absolutely no reason to be alive.  There is nothing here.  We pretend like there's a point to life, but there really isn't.

I wish I could tell you this, but I know it would just cause you more pain, so I won't.  But, I will follow you shortly into whatever follows this life.

Folks, I'm aware that depression is a treatable disease, but that doesn't change the fact that my existence is a burden to EVERYONE.  Seven years this has gone on and I've proven myself incapable of changing this.  It is an objective fact that no one benefits from my presence.

I am a remarkably healthy 29 year old man.  I see myself living a very, very long time, all while remaining very, very alone.  No thanks.  I fully intend to off myself before I become that smelly homeless man no one even wants to deal with, disavowed by any and all relations, anonymously cremated and interred in a city cemetary.

I am a physician(anesthesia), and work in an often stressful environment. I was depressed long before I became an MD, and let me tell you, it does get better.
Through my teenage years, I was very very depressed, and attempted suicide at one point. I was picked on, singled out, and lonely. Many of my high school class mates never took the time to get to know me, I thought it was something with my personality, and maybe it was, maybe I alienated myself. The one thing that always kept me going was my dream of one day helping others, I wanted to be a doctor. I worked my ass off, even through the worst of times during high school, and got into an elite university. Again, I often felt depressed, but not as much due to my acceptance as an intellectual. 

People came to know me, because I realized I needed to get to know them in order for them to get to know me. 
Through all of this depression and loneliness, I sought some sort of secret to happiness, something that worked for everyone, but more importantly, something that worked for me. I eventually came to a conclusion, there is no secret, life is what you make of it. I started therapy and eventually worked out my issues.

Fast forward to a few years ago, I was diagnosed with brain cancer. As I stated, I am a doctor, I knew what this entailed. I kept working through chemo and luckily it was an operable tumor. The idea of my own mortality struck me as something very profound. I had a growth in my head that could do for me what I had so greatly desired as a youth; death. Oddly, when faced with this, I had the strongest desire to live. I noticed the beauty in every day life, I love the smell of flowers, I love to look at the stars. I am an atheist, so don't feel like I am making a faith based message here.

What I realized, is that one of the major reasons I was depressed was, I did not realize how amazing life is, and how lucky I am to have won the universal lottery. I know many of you see the world as bleak and empty, are hopeless and alone, but you are not. Please, if you feel as though you really cannot take it, get professional help, these are my experiences only. Maybe, getting the help you need will encourage you to help others having similar issues, maybe not, but it just may save your life, and not the life filled with darkness, a life filled with passion and appreciation for the world around you. Please, get help if needed. You never know when someone may need YOUR help!

Rachel's response was top read up on it. Mine was to find a story that made it make sense. (http://mfinley.com/pdf/zombie-girl.pdf, if you're interested)

Rachel's breakthrouh occurred reading a book called SUICIDE AND THE SOUL, by psychiatrist James Hillman. Hillman's idea is that we all freak out when we hear about suicidal wishes. Like a fire department we all rush to the scene, and seek at all costs to prevent it.

Hillman suggests that the psychiatrist might be wiser to walk with the suicide to the lip of the abyss and stare down into it with him/her.  We still don't want the person to jump, but more than that we want to honor their journey to the edge of nonexistence.

He's just talking about psychiatrists, not folks like us. But there is something to this. Depressed people are not usually helped with chucks to the chin, promises of a better day dawning, good times being just around the corner.

In a way it is better to be a real friend, and acknowledge the pain that has brought the person to the edge. In short, to love that person and his or her struggle.

Some people, Rachel and I decided, including our beloved daughter Daniele, are involved in a dance with death. In a sense, they have already lived their lives -- intensely, often miserably. 

This accounts for a small percentage of those of us with suicidal urges. I'm talking the hard core -- the death's head kids. Daniele was such. When she died there were literally over a hundred plastic and ceramic skulls surrounding her.

Could she be saved? She was saved, once. But she took pains not to be saved the second time. No note, no longing glances -- even though she adored us.

What is the lesson of a kid like that? That suicide is very profound, and deserving of our respect. Sure, we don;t want one another to die. But we all will die. The trick is to know one another, to respect one another, so that when we do die, we aren't entirely by ourselves.

If you see someone having a hard time, don't be too quick with the wise words. Buy 'em a coffee. give 'em a hug. Listen to their story.

I got off the topic of James Hillman toward the end here. It was me talking, not him. I don't recommend reading his book unless you are a real good reader!

I was diagnosed as HIV+ 1 1/2 years ago.

My family rejected me because I was gay, though they are dealing with it better now. However, they don't know of my HIV status.

In the past weeks, I was hospitalized for a staph infection. As a result, I lost my job and had to move back home with my parents to a very rural area. Also, because I had no insurance at the time, I'm now $30,000 in debt for a 4 day hospital visit.

I've been home for over a month with no job prospects. My family gets more aggravated with me every day because I'm not working. I'm afraid to tell them about my HIV status for fear they might reject me and kick me out again... after which I have no other place to go.

In addition, no one wants to date me... even more so where I live now with my parents. There are very *very* few people with HIV in my area. The only ones I've been able to find are over ten years older than myself... and don't seem to appealing in any manner. The moment I have brought it up, any potential suitors run... sometimes literally.

I never wanted to live my life alone, however I've never felt more alone in my life. I want to be loved, but anyone who knows me, and knows I'm HIV+ runs. 

I take my HIV pills every day to keep me alive, but I feel like a suck on society... costing them thousands every month while I'm not contributing back. It's not fair to society to support me when I have nothing to offer in return. 

I don't have money to go back to school, and am already behind on the student loans I had before, meaning I can't apply for financial aid to go back to school until those are caught up. Yet I can't catch up because I can't find work.

The idea of suicide being selfish has no effect on me. After the help I've asked for and been denied because it was too much of an inconvenience for others... it has caused me so much pain and grief. 

I'm already on anti-depressants, and have been on them for 6 months now. They have had no effect on my desire to just die, and be done with the matter. I wanted to die before my life went down the tube the past few weeks... but now it's only intensified. Any past activities that used to make me happy, only intensify the feeling that I just want to be gone and dead. 

This is as much as I can bear to write for now. Please Advise.

I own a 9mm handgun and I loaded a full magazine, pointed it at my head, and pulled the trigger. There wasn't a round chambered but I don't know about next time. Usually when I do this I keep it unloaded, but I get almost excited at the possibility of an accidental discharge to the brain stem.

So I guess some backstory. I joined the Army in January and was discharged two months later for serious anxiety issues. Before that, I was on school on the road to medical school. I was doing fine, great even, but I was living at home. I'm back home now and it's driving me fucking insane. My mother is a raging alcoholic who hasn't contributed to society in the slightest in years and who talks down to everyone constantly and my father is a spineless wuss who never stands up to anyone. I joined the Army as a fast way to get out but now I have nowhere to go. I want to go back to school but I don't know if I can focus living at home (it's a commuter school, should've mentioned this). It doesn't help that finding a job is for some reason fucking impossible and that I failed a personal trainer certification due to being so frazzled all the time at home and not being able to focus. I feel fucking unfocused all the time here. All I hear is that bitch and her fucking screaming and her taunts. Every god damn day. I hope every day she drinks herself to death, but no, every time I sleep I hear her fucking voice. Always awake and never fucking sleeping. She sleeps from 2pm until 4:15pm every fucking day, and she's still drunk when she wakes up.

I've seen a therapist. Didn't work. Maybe I didn't want it to. I also made an appointment with a psychiatrist months ago but cancelled it due to not having enough cash to pay the deductible. Besides, even if I did, I doubt I'd want to take medication. 

I'm 23 and I still live at home and I feel trapped and hopeless, and please help me keep that hollow point out of the chamber. I've been glorifying suicide since I was in middle school but now it seems more and more enticing. It's like being so close to water after being dehydrated for years. Death is like an oasis out in the distance.

About a year ago, I moved out of my parents house to another state. It's everything that I had dreamed of, being independent and in a great location. It's very expensive and I won't be able to afford such a location much longer. My friends and family think i'm fine, I think I've always been really good at putting on a happy face and fooling people about the boiling depression under the surface. 

Well, within the past few months I've noticed that I think about suicide even when i'm not sad, just casually thinking about what it would be like, being dead and all. I've always sort of had this desire to commit suicide, but it wasn't practical then. I have the resources now to accomplish it, where I hadn't before. I had an acquaintance in my home state who had committed suicide. We had a few courses together, I talked to him casually, never really hung out with him. But it was still interesting, knowing someone who had willfully killed himself. What were his last thoughts? What drove him to do that? I saw how his friends reacted to his death, even people he didn't talk to were pretending to be impacted as if to join the parade of sadness. Facebook lit up, it was incredible. Knowing that I don't have that kind of impact is disheartening, I must say.

I know my parents and siblings would be very saddened about hearing of my death, moreover that it was suicide. How could I make it easier on them? I don't want them to think they did something wrong to ""make me this way"". I want it to be clear that it was my own mistakes that lead me to where I am now. I plan to visit them and come back, spend the last few days with my friends out here..but i'm not sure if that would make it better or worse for them, being close to me near the end.

Of course, if I do proceed with it, I wouldn't do it where loved or liked ones could find me. I will probably call the police and notify them of where I'll be so that they are prepared for what they will find. I just want to minimize the pain and suffering that I cause onto others. 

My life isn't very tough at all, either. Compared to a lot of others, i'm sure I have it made. The few problems I do have though, one in particular, are too much for me to handle. I suppose I really don't want to see what life has in store for me, as i'm sure it won't be promising. 

What are your suggestions? Know that this isn't a cry for help, i'm not trying to be coerced out of doing it. I genuinely want to know how to make this easier on them, short of not doing it at all. 

Ignorant, clichéd comments concerning why I shouldn't do it and how ""it gets better"" will be gracefully ignored as they should be. You do not know me, don't blindly pass assumptions. I appreciate your concern, however. This is my decision, i'm an adult. I've given it weeks to consider, I don't think it would be too hasty of me.

Underwear pictures seemed innocent enough, or so I thought. It was far in the past, and something I had frankly forgotten even existed. Since, I have dealt with major depression, to the point I wasn't even sure I wanted to live anymore. Yet with much perseverance and getting help, I made it through and became a successful, happy person on my way to a career doing what I love. (I fear posting what it is here for identification purposes, but it is a very high ranking profession in our society that I was in the process of applying to school for). I was working 60-70 hour weeks tirelessly to try to reach my goals, and genuinely felt happy and like life was going somewhere. Then, I discovered that those old pictures are now all over Google, with my name actually embedded as the title of the pictures, and completely falsified comments about what a slut I was in middle/high school. They give my location, my contact information, everything. There is apparently no way to get your pictures removed once they're up, as they put their servers in Romania and intentionally make it so there is no way to successfully pursue legal action against them. They do not respond to DMCA takedown requests, they laugh in your face if you tell them you want to kill yourself over the pictures. There is nothing I can do to get the lies deleted about how apparently I was a whore in middle school or high school or college, which is now publicly available false information.

I am crushed. My future career was the center of my life, and I guarantee there is no way I will get into school for it now because of the doxxing. I am relegated to being a housewife, with every single person I ever meet being able to look online and laugh at me, judge me for being a slut (even though I have never been slutty in the slightest, other than having taken risque pictures for my very small number of boyfriends). The FBI doesn't care, since there are people being murdered out there. It would cost thousands of dollars to do anything, and all they can do is push down the pictures of me a few pages on GIS, though they'll always be there for people to check out on page 3. I have no future, I have been stripped of all dignity as a human, and all I can think about is the constant shame and degradation. I have been raped before, and this feels like a rape that is constant and ongoing, with no chance of it ever ending unless my life ends (in which case, it will go on to shame my family, professors, and coworkers who have believed in me, even though I will no longer have consciousness anymore). I can barely deal with the weight of every day, knowing that I can no longer pursue my dreams; that no one gives a damn that my life has been ruined so people can masturbate to it and laugh at my degradation. I can't logically think of a reason I should keep on living, and need help to do so.

EDIT: I cannot begin to express my gratitude for all of the support and perspective you all have given me today, it has really helped me convince myself that there is a path and this is not a dead end. It's still going to be a bumpy road ahead of this, but I will try to make the most out of this all and fight back against this attack. Every one of you has been a great help; I really feel down off of the ledge. But I will try to pursue every option you all have proposed, and until then, there is no reason for me to give up.

I was homeless this past summer and finally after months of looking I found a job.  It was cashiering at Target but you know what?  It was a flipping job.  

I moved into a place with two roomates and was able to take my cat back in.  I have a home.   A place to feel safe, to feel comfortable, to feel at home.  I can sleep here, there is no set time to move out, and I have food.  However, I have bad IBS.  Really bad, it'll leave me in pain for hours.

If I knew i was on thin ice, I would have forced myself to go in and make them accomodate me some how.  But no, just out of the blue I am fired.  

I am so worried.  So so worried.  I am spirling back into depression and I don't know what I will do come November.  I will have nothing.   It took me this long to get hired...  Will it take me that long again?  I mean, I have two cases of luggage when I am hired.  I have IBS to an extreme and I am transgender.   Finding a job is very difficult.  What am I going to do if I can't get in on the holiday rush of hiring?  

I'm going to be homeless again, thats what.  And I can. not. do. that.  I just cannot.  I don't have that will power in me to suffer on the side of the street.  I cannot utilize homeless shelters in my area because they can't fucking figure out what to do with me since I am trans.  My family wont take me in as indicated by my last spell of homelessness.  I don't have any friends with room.  I don't want to lose my kitty again.  Shes the only one who loves me no matter who I am.  

I am starting to apply at every place I can find tomorrow, but I am so scared.   I am so so scared.   I am hoping I get a job at this online tech support place, but I cannot count on it at all.  I would work from home there, a freaking dream job for me.  

If I cannot find a job this month..  I am going to be back on the streets. I don't want that.  I can't take it again.  I cannot do it mentally or physically.  I *will* kill myself at that point.  It will make my heart ache to do it because I know it will devastate so many people...  But I don't know what else to do if no body will take me in. I need fucking stability.  I can't couch hop.

I tried to kill myself once when I was 12. I'm 17 now, but I can now say that for the first time in about 7 years, I feel truly happy.

It all started around May, I met a girl through Reddit (not SW). We started talking, she had an eating disorder and depression, and I had depression and suicidal thoughts. She gave me hope; she made me want to be happy. I had never met someone who understood me quite as much, nor whom I had so much in common with. In just one month, she knew more about me than anyone else in my life. She saved me from trying to kill myself again, and apparently I helped her stop cutting and purging. When I talked to her, I felt that the world didn't completely suck. I smiled every time I saw she had messaged me, and I love talking to her. The biggest problem, she lives over 14,000 km away.

She uses Reddit, and I'll know she'll see this, so I need to clarify something up for her here: I know you dislike when teens say this sort of stuff because ""we don't know what it's like"", but I know that IF I've ever been in love with anyone, it's you.

Back to the story, fast forward to about 2 days ago. She knew I liked her, and I knew she liked me. She's the most important person in my life and I'd be dead without her. So I asked her to be in a long distance relationship with me. When she said yes, I felt for the first time in years I was happy. My life didn't suddenly become unicorns and rainbows, but I'm happy.

I want to try to make my life better. For the first time, I have something to live for. I felt all those posts about ""it gets better"" where just a way to stop people from killing themselves; and while I can't assure anyone it *will* get better, I can say with all certainty it *can* get better. Now, I have a reason to finish high school, to do something with my life. I know that as soon as I graduate I'll go visit her, and hopefully I'll be able to go to university in Melbourne so I can be with her.

I know it's hard, I know what it's like to wish be dead. I know what it's like to feel so much sadness it physically hurts. But now I know there's a chance it can get better, and I know it's possible to feel happiness again. I guess **what I want to say is that if you have nothing right now, hang in there, and hopefully life will once more smile upon you like it has smiled upon me.**

**TL;DR:** I've been depressed/suicidal for about half my life. I've tried to kill myself. I met a girl on Reddit a few months ago, she also knows what it's like to be depressed.

I reached the lowest of low in life(or so I thought). Things obviously didn't work out because I'm still here. I was going to slit my wrist but mentally couldn't do it. So I popped a bunch of ibuprofen(around 50 or so) along with some melatonin to put me to sleep. About 20-30 mins later I called the cops. Not to be saved, but simply to be found. Well, needless to say they got there very quickly and I was saved. I spend 48 hours in a psych ward (the minimum was 72 but I got out for ""good behavior"" essentially). 

Life afterwards has been quite ridiculous. I genuinely thought I'd be dead. I'd say life is worse now because I live back at home with my parents(no freedom; I'm 21). College matters none to me, yet I still go. None of my friends quite understand simply because I never appear to be sad/depressed. I'm the *life of the party* in most situations. I refuse to take antidepressants (smoking weed does the trick, yet I'll be quitting shortly. Therapy has failed miserably. I find it hard to find any motivation in life whatsoever to do anything because in my mind I'm not supposed to be here. I don't have a passion.. I don't even know what happiness is. 

So basically that's my story. 

**TL;DR** - I attempted 9 months ago. Life's essentially worse. (definitely isn't better). I don't know why I continue living but I do. I could die in the midst or writing this post and be completely fine with that. Attempting did nothing but get me judged by others for it.

It might not help at all, but it might make all the difference in the world. 

The **tl;dr** version: I tried to commit suicide (with pills), stopped myself after taking several. It ended up being the worst, darkest experience of my life. I haven't regretted stopping myself once since it happened. My life still isn't great, but I know now that suicide isn't the answer.

On to the story...

A bit of background on me: If you labeled me a loner, you wouldn't be wrong to do so. As a kid, I was quiet and everyone asked me why, which led me to believe that I was somehow broken because I wasn't as social as they were. My self-esteem was nearly non-existent as a teenager. Thought I was ugly. My ""friends"" only used me at their convenience. Struggled with my sexuality. Had a lot of guilt laid on me because of my religious environment. 

As I grew up, my social anxiety grew worse. I began to withdraw into my ""cave"" (bedroom) and isolated myself from friends and family alike. I had no job. I wasn't going to college. I rarely attended church. Being around people just made me uncomfortable and angry with myself (that I couldn't be more social and friendly). 

Then, a couple months ago, I started listening more and more to that rotten voice in my head that told me I was worthless, that said my life was meaningless, that I had no reason to live. It told me that everyone would be better off without me so why bother staying? No one really cared, right? They just pretend to. They love you because they have to. 

And I believed it. I slid down the hill faster and faster, nearing the bottomless pit of despair, planning my suicide for weeks. What was the best way? What method would be least painful? I didn't want to create a mess. I didn't want them to find my body in a horrific manner. I didn't want to mess it up and end up screwing my body up while having to live with it forever. 

The idea that appealed to me the most was sleeping pills. So I gathered as much as I could. I took them out several nights, laid them out before me (hundreds of pills), but never had the gall to do it. Then, one night, it was just too much. Life had reached the point where it meant nothing to me at all.

So I brought out those pills, laid them before me, and started downing them two or three at a time. I got to about twenty when I stopped and realized ""What am I doing?"" I panicked. I was seriously going to end my life? My last moments on earth would be spent alone, in my darkened cave, hopeless and lost and in miserable pain? No. I didn't want that. I couldn't go through with it. 

I tried to throw up the pills, but it wouldn't work. It didn't take long for the pills to hit me. I can't really remember what happened after they did. I ended up falling asleep. I vaguely remember horrifying snippets of that night, of waking up and flailing at demonic presences that were attacking me (or so it felt like to me). I woke in the morning and could barely walk. I stumbled to the bathroom and saw myself and I still remember how sinister I looked. My pupils were huge. My face looked evil. It was the worst feeling I've ever had. 

I went and told my parents what I'd tried to do the night before and they called an ambulance and got me to the hospital. I recovered quickly and my family did their best not to make too much of a fuss over it, and here I am. Still alive. And so glad for it. 

Life is still hard for me. I have some trials that I haven't shared because I'm not comfortable doing so, but just because I survived an attempt doesn't mean I suddenly find life peachy and brilliant. I still have days that I hate. I still loathe myself at times. But I'm still alive. I still get to laugh and to read good books and to listen to the rain. I still get to gorge on chocolate and pizza and sleep in and listen to all my favorite songs over and over again. 

I'm still struggling to find my purpose, but I have no doubt that I'll find it if I just keep looking. I believe that we're all miserable if we haven't found our purpose in life, that some of us feel more deeply than others, which results in depression and becoming suicidal. Please, don't surrender. Please just hold on a little longer. ",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_lnfdk,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lnfdk/the_story_of_how_i_almost_killed_myself/,

I swallowed a bottle of prescribed klonopin. My dad found me and took me to the hospital where they pumped my stomach. After my recovery, I was submitted to the psych Ward for over a week with people I didn't know away from my family and friends and worst of all was unable to smoke cigarettes... okay that last part wasn't the worst but at the time that's all I could think about. Once released, I decided since I have failed at everything else and now suicide, maybe its time for a change. Maybe instead of laying in bed all day and drinking all night, going to a job I hate and feeling awful about myself I should change the things I do have control over.

I did something completely unrealistic and fantastic that I wish everyone in their life would do once. I sold all my shit, packed a suitcase and bought a fucking plane ticket to Hawaii. I said goodbye to the friends and family I cherished and missed so much while I was away for away week in the hospital and moved 5000 miles away to a place I'd never been to where I knew no one. It was the most freeing experience of my young life.... 

I guess my point is, I was at the bottom of it all looking out into a world I hated surrounded by people who loved me but didn't know how to help me and I left to make myself stronger for myself. Its like those stories you hear about people who lose like 400 pounds and say ""if I can do it, anyone can"" and as fucking cliche as it is to say it I mean it.  I was a gross example of a human being and as depressed and lonely as they get.

If you really want to change and get better, you can't wait for anyone else to do it for you. Fuck everyone else and get better for yourself. Its a day to day thing but its an amazing feeling knowing you did it yourself for yourself. Standing on the other side of the battle field, its easy to just say, ""get better"" but I know where a lot of you have been and it can and does get better.

I feel hopeless.",27,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l0mkj/i_have_no_clue_where_my_life_is_going_and_no_one/,"I don't even know where to start. Ever since my ex left me over a year ago my life has been spiraling downwards and it feels like there's nothing I can do to stop it. I'm 18, turning 19 shortly, in my second year in university pursuing a dream that is incredibly difficult to achieve. If I really want to succeed, I feel like I'm going to need to stay in school for at least another 6 years, and I simply can't afford it. I just don't want to have to worry about this shit; having a good job, a wife, friends. It's all just so impossible to properly maintain. On top of this, after my ex left I got very depressed and started using hard drugs like MDMA and Ketamine, which in retrospect, was one of the worst decisions of my life. I don't know if it was the drugs, I've stopped using them now, but I still feel even more depressed than when I started them, and it's been over 3 months since I touched either of them. But the most immediate cause of my depression is how utterly alone I feel every day. I long for a romantic connection with someone, anyone. I'm not ugly, not overweight, not stupid, and I know I have a lot of talents and qualities that I feel should be attractive, yet I still find myself struggling to secure a relationship. I've come close, I really thought she liked me, but it turned out I just got friend zoned to the extreme. She's been asking me things like what to do about this guy she likes, and the hickeys on her neck, and I really just don't want to discuss it, because it hurts me way more than it should. I really like her too, and I feel like I should just stop talking to her because this hurts too much, but I don't want to stop talking to her because I really like her, and I guess I'm willing to have her as a friend if nothing else. I just feel like the longer I go without some assurance that I'm worth dating, the less attractive I become. Nobody wants to be with someone who reeks of desperation. But the thing is, when I'm out with friends, and with this girl that friend zoned me, I don't think about these things. But as soon as I go home, alone, everything starts rushing into my head... The guy my ex is with, I start thinking about how nearly all of my friends are in great relationships, and I haven't even held hands with a girl in over a year. I don't understand how some people can jump from relationship to relationship - not just HOW they do it, but WHY. Don't people need recovery time? I've had tonnes, and I still can't find anyone. It's gotten to the point where those funny ""forever alone"" memes are actually starting to hurt me, because I relate to them too much. I find myself crying myself to sleep because all I can think about is how everyone has someone but me. I feel fucking pathetic, and the more I feel that way, the more it becomes a reality. I really just want to end it all, not care about getting laid or having a connection with someone or getting a good job or being a respectable person. I'm juggling insecurities and I'm at the end of my rope. I don't even know what I'm doing here. I've read countless forums and articles on loneliness and depression, none of it seems to do anything for me. They all just say, wait it out, someone will find you, and you'll be magnificent. I've waited for what seems like eternities. Things have only gotten much worse. I guess I just need advice from someone who has been in the same place as me before. Thank you for reading, I know I'm pretty scatter-brained.

The main thought in my head, is how easy it would be to sleep forever. My brain keeps telling me to end it all, and I'm not really sure what's stopping me anymore.

Damn. I keep editing this shit because I keep going deeper into myself. It doesn't help that I know just how disgusting it is to be longing after sex and women as much as I do. It's a despicable trait, but I really can't help it. I think about girls all the time, and I hate myself for it. Women are not objects, they are not possessions, they are not there to make me happy. I'm an extremely respectful person, but I find myself wishing I had a girlfriend far more often than I feel is healthy or normal. I just don't understand why a nice guy like me, who would treat any girlfriend I got with utmost respect -  I would treat her like a goddess - can't get a girl, but the guys who treat women like shit seem to be rolling in them.

Eventually we got to talking about getting a counselor. She found so many results in my zip code that she told me she had to narrow by address. By this time, I figured I'd told her enough times that I was inside my bedroom which was in a house with lots of people in it enough that it would be fine. 

Five minutes later, my dad knocks on my door to tell me the police are here. 

So now my parents are both livid at me, telling me I could have talked to one of them, (could not actually have talked to them-- they're an involved party and I told them this and they won't listen) and wondering why the hell I ""lied to the operator and told her I was on the roof."" Never once told her I was on the roof. We were to the point of discussing counselors before she got my address! My parents don't seem to realize that I was seriously going to kill myself. 

Not helping: 14 year old little sister had a friend over for a sleepover. One of the cops yelled at my sister and scared her and her friend. And of course the friend called her mom and now her mom knows. They also flashed their stupid high beam lights all over the roof so now the whole neighborhood knows.

I dated this girl my last year in college for about 9 months. She was like the exact opposite of me - I was liberal, atheist, shy/antisocial; she was conservative, religious, in a sorority. Despite the differences, we were really happy together. Eventually with our graduations looming and mostly my stubbornness, we split up and I took it pretty hard. But I made a promise to myself to become a better person. I started working out, focusing on trying to improve my social/fashion skills, working on being more tolerant/openminded, etc. and to an extremely large extent, I feel I succeeded. One night, I was drunk and facebook messaged her kind of just saying hey and hoping that she was doing better. She ended up coming over and staying the night. Slowly we started talking again via text, pretty much every day. Her texts were always the highlight of my day. I'm working in KS as a chemist, and she's moved to Atlanta, GA for an internship. We start to talk about life goals and how we've changed, etc. and it slowly evolves into a 'hey, you know, we seemed to be much more in line with each other now, maybe there's a possibility this could work this time'. And the sentiment is mutual. I plan a trip to fly down and visit her this past weekend, with the intent of laying the formation for a slow, but potentially great recovery and loving relationship.

Friday night, I get in and we go out drinking. We're being really flirty and having a great time then she just disappears. So now I'm alone in a bar in a foreign land and super confused. After 45 minutes of looking for her, I find her in the backseat of her car with some random guy. She doesn't even know his name, and they're clothed, but I flip out. She says it's not what it looks like, etc etc. We go back to her place, have angry sex, and pass out. In the morning we talk about it; she says she was scared/nervous about me being there, and this is her way of pushing people away when they get close. She says she loves me and wants to be with me, but doesn't think she can offer me what I want/deserve from her. I play the role of the nice guy and say ""alright, well, let's do some sight seeing and rent a movie and take it easy tonight, my flight leaves in the morning."" She thinks that's a great idea and she gets in the shower. While she's showering, I'm laying there and I kind of freak out. I sit up, think to myself ""No, I'm sick of being a good guy and letting girls walk all over me"". So I start to pack my stuff up to head to the airport and leave early. She gets out and asks me what's wrong, and I respectfully let her have it. I tell her that what she did is not okay, and that I came down here with what I felt like was a mutual interest in pursuing a meaningful relationship only to have her pull some insane stunt that hurt me more than I can put into words. She cries and apologizes, and I give her every chance to stop me from leaving, but she doesn't. I walk to the door, without turning to look at her say ""I hope you get everything you want in life"" and walk out. After walking for 45 min trying to figure out where the hell I am to call a cab, I find a McDonalds and start looking up cab numbers on my phone. She calls me. She asks me to come back and talk to her and stay. I comply. We kind of lounge around at her apt for the rest of the day, rent a movie and snuggle and watch it, then go to bed (no sex). We wake up, she takes me to the airport and I leave. She texts me after I leave telling me that she loves me and she's sorry, she just doesn't think she can give me what I want right now, and that she wants to be with me and that she needs me to be a part of her life. I tell her that I wish I could understand that. I tell her that I need some time away from talking to her for a while to try and figure out what I need to do.

I don't know what to do. I feel like my entire motivation to keep waking up and going to work is gone now. I think there's a part of her that wants what I want - the ""well, I'm an adult now and I want to settle down and share my life with someone"" stage but I also think she isn't completely out of that ""I'm young and want to party and meet people and be crazy"" stage either. I don't want to let her go, but I don't want to wait around to be the consolation prize because I might be waiting for nothing. She has always had psychological issues, she's been suicidal/a self mutilator in the past, and I think she's dealing with some of that stuff right now, so I don't want to leave her to deal with that alone, but I can't let myself be dangled along.

I have no motivation. I have no energy. My social skills are nil. 

I talk to people and I see their faces scrunch up. I look in the mirror and I'm horrified by what I see. My own family doesn't even care about me. 

I've made mistakes. Horrible mistakes. 


I'm mean. I can't even help it. It's just the way my brain processes. I try to be nice but then I get walked on. I lose my patience and my meanness comes out...and I get walked away from. 

I've been coming to SW regularly. I know people want to help. And it does. Temporarily. But it's just a couple of hours of feeling better but doing the same thing. 

Everyone gives great advice, but it's hard to follow when you don't even want to get out of bed. Seriously. I get home from work on Friday and don't leave the bed until Monday morning. 

I don't have any motivation to do something as simple as drink water. I'm so dehydrated, but I don't even care. I just want to die. I don't like my life and I see no value in it. I feel like more of a burden than anything. 

Sure, you can say there are people that love me...and I can assure you they don't. I don't have any real friends. I don't really have family. Sure, there are people related to me, but they never call or visit. I'm only 25. 


I just don't understand why I get dealt this heaping pile of shit for life. Mental problems. History of every kind of abuse imaginable. Addictions. People being mean to me. 

Then they say ""You're so strong"".... That's what people say when they can see you have a shittier life than they do and you don't kill yourself. You know in their mind they're like ""Man, if that were me, I'd totally kill myself.""

I tried  being positive but I just don't see what there is to look forward to. I know I'm not taking care of myself and that my health is diminishing and sooner or later I will pay the price for that.


I just feel like I'm paying the price for all of my parents mistakes. I'm paying for their selfishness and neglect. My whole life will be paying for their mistakes. Because no one taught me any better. No one cared. 


The world is already crowded and there are people out there that want to live. Why should I continue to take up space when I'm nothing special.

1300243958.0,26,self.SuicideWatch,g4v27,Think of Chloe.,28,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g4v27/think_of_chloe/,"My best friend, Chloe, and I have been best friends for 7 years. It started in 7th grade, we clicked and ever since then we have been inseparable.  I'm now a junior in college.  We were the type of best friends where we felt like we were seriously the exact same person on the inside.  We understood absolutely everything about each other and have been there for each other for everything, through both our parents' divorces, through our grandpas deaths.  Our friendship is a kind of friendship that most people will never experience in their lives.  She's my soul mate and my everything.  I bailed out on a volleyball scholarship in Pennsylvania college so I could stay closer to her because I knew it was a type of friendship that I couldn't give up. We grew up together into young, independent thinkers with all the potential in the world. 

She started to get depressed about a year ago because of a guy that broke up with her for his ex.  She was so tore up inside, I could tell. I have no idea why he would leave Chloe because she was beyond beautiful. Short, big hips, long brown hair, a gorgeous smile, and a one of a kind personality. I finally convinced her to get help, whether that be counseling, medicine, anything.  She started to feel better, or at least she said she was. She said it was so hard telling her dad she was suicidal. 

About a year passes and during that year we had some rough times, but we always ended up being best friends again, with each fight we had an even stronger bond than before. 

Over this past weekend, I was in Florida visiting my sister for her birthday.  Chloe stayed at our house.  She had friends over chilling with her all weekend.  That Monday night/Tuesday morning, Chloe and I were in a petty fight. When we get in fights, we both are so stubborn.  I won't say the first word but my mind is screaming at me to, and of course, Chloe was the exact same way.  That Tuesday night we had text about the fight, with her saying she was miserable and she felt like her soul was empty.  She suggested I find a new best friend.  I replied back telling her how fucking amazing she is and had no reason to be so hard on herself. 

On Wednesday when I got home from class, I knew she was home because her violin and bag were on the couch right by our front door.  I went upstairs to see if she was there and her door was shut with music playing.  Being in the fight, I didn't go in there. I kept with my business and felt like she would talk to me first. 

It wasn't until Thursday afternoon did I go in her room.  The only reason I had the balls to do it is because that morning I put my ear up to the door to here what song was playing.  When I got back from class around 2PM, I put my ear up to the door and heard that exact same song playing.  My mind and body were going nuts.  I brought her dog Mufasa to go in there with me.  I knocked twice, which made Mufasa bark. She didn't say anything.  I opened the door to the most empty and eerie feeling I've ever experienced.  I saw Chloe in the middle of her room.  Her back was facing the door with her shoulders hunched forward.  It looked like she was standing there, but when I saw the mess by her feet, I knew she wasn't standing. I said her name one more time and she didn't answer me.  I walked up to her and looked at her face. I knew it, I just had to make sure. She had used her dogs choke leash and hung herself from her ceiling fan.  

My beautiful, witty, amazing best friend took her life because she was in so much pain on the inside.  Even with my love I couldn't save her and I'd do anything to just be able to see her smile again. Everything I hear, see, smell, eat reminds me of her.  I'm still in shock and haven't realized that I will never be able to touch, laugh with, snuggle, or even see my best friend again. 

I wish I would have told her every single day how much she meant to me and how I would suffer without her.  I have so many unanswered questions that I will never know the answer to.  

I can't imagine the battle she was going though in her head.  Who even knows if she's not hurting anymore or where she is now.. I hope on everything she is happy though.  

For all of you lovely individuals who are suffering like my Chloe, please just think of this beautiful girl who can no longer enjoy the sun shine, play with her dog, or just experience life.  I now have to experience life without her and I would give ANYTHING to get her back. Think of everyone who loves you and how you are forcing them to only have memories and pictures left if you were no longer here.  Every second I miss Chloe more and more.

I thought the traditional advice was sound and decided to follow through on it as much as I could. Help yourself, exercise, get out there, be productive, find a hobby. I did all these things. School, I managed to get a 4.0 GPA for my first full time semester back; I exercised and ate well; as I said, I spent time with people; I started being more active with creating music and playing the guitar. 

And yet I still can't remember the last time something good actually happened. I can't remember the last bit of news that made me smile rather than worry. I try my best. Sincerely, I do. And I allowed my hopes to get raised once again. I had long thought that hope's only function is to have those hopes be crushed and have it hurt even more, and it feels that way now, as well. 

As I walked home from the bus stop after school, I realized I was truly crushed, truly defeated. And the only thing I can think about now is dying alone in my room. I write this with tears welling in my eyes as I had managed to fool myself into sincerely believing life was worth living for a time, and it is worse pain than ever before to see the truth.

1286896293.0,25,self.SuicideWatch,dq7ww,Checklist of common sense. Don't do it!,34,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dq7ww/checklist_of_common_sense_dont_do_it/,"I didn't know this reddit existed. I'm both glad and sad that it does. I just want to say my piece. It might help. It might not. But I have a few things to get off my chest that I wish I could have said to a couple of people I have known along the way. It’s a bit disjointed, and not exactly prize-winning literature - I’m not an author - but here goes.

Firstly, I've been through some dark periods, and live with some pretty difficult situations right now that I have come to terms with. So I'm not some happy, clappy Anthony Robbins type that is going to ram ""life is wonderful"" at you. Life often sucks, and the world is full of crappy people. Bummer! But there are two sides to every coin.

In my opinion, a decision to commit suicide usually isn't taken because your life is so bad right now, it happens because you can't see that the situation will ever improve – or is going to get worse! Something bad has already happened and you’re living with the consequences, or it is something that you fear will happen soon – maybe a secret that you have held inside for a long time, or something you have done that you need to confess to the world.

You believe that you will never feel happy and contented like other people. You feel different. Isolated. Nobody understands. Maybe you have tried to talk to someone, and they tell you ""It'll get better. Cheer up"". It makes you feel worse. It's like there is nothing else to do. Suicide seems almost sensible, a logical step given your situation. Sure, other people won’t understand your decision, but they don’t have all the facts. They can’t see the situation like you see it. If they were inside your life, they’d do it too. You’re right – and you’re wrong.

I'm not here to tell you that it ""is"" or that it ""isn't"" the right decision - it's your life. But you have to take a “time out” to think. Really think. Not worry. Not focus on one problem. But THINK - about your whole life and your whole existence. That is what is at stake here.

If you have a headache, however bad, however painful, you don't think about killing yourself - because you know it will go away. You don’t focus on the “now”, you focus on “later”. It is this hope, this faith in a headache-free future, that comforts you.

It is the opposite of this, a lack of hope, a lack of faith, and a clouded vision of the future, that leads to the most destructive personal decision a human being can take.

I'd just like to say to anyone that finds themselves in this position. Stop and think. You can't? Your mind is made up? . . . . So what do you have to lose by thinking for a while then? There’s no rush. After all, it's your life. You deserve to be listened to - even if the person listening is yourself! Before you finally turn out the lights, take a walk around the house! Consider this:

1) The world is full of people who tried and failed to commit suicide, and now lead happy lives. ""Bullshit"" you say? Wrong. It's true. They can look back at that black period, a period when they thought that life wasn't worth living, and see with hindsight how wrong they were. By definition, every person who has long-term survived a suicide attempt is a testimony to that fact that life can and usually does improve.

2) Often you can get so depressed and concerned over a single issue or set of issues, that your vision narrows, and your whole world becomes about “that”. You stop seeing all that is good about your life, and focus on what is wrong. There are no “possibilities” - just the problems of today. The same cycle of thought. Over and over again. It's like being stuck on a rollercoaster. 

You wake up in a morning, and for 20 seconds you feel normal - then you really wake up - you remember - and it's like someone has reached inside you and crushed your stomach in their fist. And the thoughts stay there all day - chewing away. Maybe in the back of your mind, but they’re there. Narrowing your vision. Robbing you of hope.

You don’t think that this applies to you? Well just think. Think about before these thoughts took over your life. Think about the way you used to live, the things you used to do that made you happy. Maybe it was sports, maybe it was going to the movies, playing video games, reading, bowling. Just think about something that USED to make you happy . . . . . . How long is it since you thought about those things? How long is it since you did them? When did you last plan to do them again? 

Don’t you see – this frame of mind you are in, these issues, have robbed you of your happiness, stolen it, and are stopping you from seeing or experiencing the good things in life. It’s a monster, and it’s not your friend – it is your enemy You need to fight it. You need to win. You CAN have the happiness back. Be angry if you like. Something is stealing your happiness – and you have to defeat it!

3) If you are feeling bad about yourself, or lonely, try to think about what is good about yourself. Not what other people say (or don’t say). What YOU think. Do you feel unappreciated? Why? What do you think other people SHOULD like about you. Maybe you are kind and generous and feel that nobody notices. Maybe you are faithful and honest and the kind of person people SHOULD appreciate – but they just don’t seem to. Well listen up – they probably do - but they never tell you. 

I've been to a funeral of someone who took their own life. Was it full of people saying that the person was nasty and boring? Full of people saying “OK – See ya”. No. It was a room full of people saying the nicest things about a wonderful person. People all wishing that they could turn back the clock and say those things to the guy in the casket a few weeks before. Help him.

Think about how many people in your life you like, love and appreciate. Have you told them? Probably not. Human beings are weird. We keep things inside that we should say, say things we shouldn’t (and don’t really mean), and then let our true feelings flood out when it’s too late. 

So think about someone you find special, and imagine how little you have actually SAID to that person about how special they are. There are people out there who think that YOU are that special - and they haven’t told you either. Maybe because some of them you haven’t even met yet!!


4) If you are feeling bad about an issue or a situation in your life, and can’t think about the consequences of living with the aftermath – let me assure you that it will never be as bad as you fear! Maybe you’re gay and need to come out. Maybe you are about to lose your home and your job. Maybe you’re in massive debt. Whatever it is, you CAN face up to it. Sure it will be awful at first (let’s not sugar coat this). There may be consequences. You might lose some things from your life. Possessions, friends, social status. But consider two things.

First – how much of a relief will it be when you can finally get everything out into the open. No secrets. Nothing hidden. No constant thoughts of “What will happen if . . .”. It’s done. Phew!

Secondly – everything material you lose can be replaced. Money. Possessions. They just come and go – and they are not the things that really make you happy. If you lose friends – they were not really friends anyway – and you’ll be surprised just how loyal friends can be. Plus – when you finally get your head sorted out, you can be YOU again. You can make new friends – friends that know you – good and bad.

4) My final thought is this. The world, whether you know it or not, is now your oyster! This is the hardest lump of schmaltzy bullshit to swallow. I know. But bear with me. 

Finding yourself on the floor, without hope, on the verge of suicide is a nasty place to be. But there is ONE positive. You have fallen pretty much as far as you can fall, and you have nothing to lose. The only way is up, and you can afford to take radical decisions. Yes – this is a life changing moment for you. A fork in the road. But it is a FORK with two paths. Right now you have been hanging around at the junction – probably for a long time, staring down the “death fork”, but shift your focus. There’s another path - a “birth fork”.

It’s time for a big decision, but why not choose birth? Start again. Drop that heavy bag of issues that is making your life hell, and plan how you want your new life to be. You have nothing more to lose and a huge amount to gain. I promise you happiness is out there for you.

Basically, I hate myself and everything about myself. I have completely unhappy with how my life has gone so far, am unhappy with it currently and I don't think it's going to improve much.

I remember George Carlin saying that ""luck is genetics as well as the desire to do hard work"", a observation that makes me sad to think of because I am a loser born from a family of losers and raised to be a loser. Due to years of emotional abuse as a child I am totally out of my depth in social situations, I can't make friends easily or win people over, can't attract women (due to me having the face of a rapist) and on the rare alcohol-fuelled occassions I do I have no idea what to do with them once I've got them. I have no idea how to be charming or charismatic in a conversation and it makes me really upset when I see that people would rather hang out with someone else despite them talking a load of bullshit.

I could accept not being a gregarious person if I had formidable mental capabilties to compensate for it but I don't have those. I have zero imagination, zero ability to critically think and no work ethic whatsoever. I've winged my entire academic career and it's only now that I'm at university that I wish my parents had drummed a desire and motivation to complete work into my head from an early age but now when I am faced with a daunting task I bottle it and give up straight away, mental fortitude and standing up for myself being another thing my dad never taught me.

So as it is, I am literally a cadaver-in-waiting. I can't do anything right, have no confidence, no idea what I want to do with my life, no luck, no drive, nothing to give me enjoyment, no past, no present and by the looks of it no future. I think my genetics and my mental conditioning up this point are pretty much made up for life now so this is my lot, I don't like it and think suicide might save me a lot of pain.

I continue to lay down until the teasing becomes unbearable and I want to violently hurt them. **It all gets bottled up inside and I have no way of releasing that aggression**. At one point in time I decided to fight back against the teasing (years ago), and the aggressor broke several of my bones – I couldn't do anything about it though since technically I 'initiated' it, although only after he egged me on to fight. I still hate him to this day because of it. I initially forgave him because he apologized, but then I later learned that he had laughed about it on that same day from a trusted friend. I now hate him with every fiber of my being, even though I no longer in contact with him. I couldn't file criminal charges because I was in the military and we would have both been court martial-ed and dishonorably discharged because of zero tolerance policies (the UCMJ is unforgiving and a dishonorable discharge labels you for life). The military is archaic. It was swept under the rug like most things in the military. I thought I was done with that event, but the permanent scars (from surgeries) and emotional scars remain.

Now, I'm still teased at work for being timid. I have no friends, and everyone is has their own 'cliché' and I am in the outgroup. I don't know anyone in this world, and I'm starting to hate everything.

Sometimes I think that if I go back to college, I can get into a career where people don't act like children and tease each other. Children who tease should be severely reprimanded.

Maybe I should just get really drunk, grab a baseball bat and go smashing things. At least no one dies, I get aggression out and the night in jail will put life in perspective.

Maybe I should just fucking quit my job, and check myself into a mental institution. The ONLY thing preventing me from doing this is that I will have a permanent stigma attached to myself that is even more crippling. (I have taken several psychology courses) No one hires someone who was in a mental institution, and even worse, you can't buy firearms for sports hunting. (Stupid archaic law, if a mentally insane person wants to hurt people, there are far more effective ways than with bullets)

I seriously don't want to be fucking alive anymore in this fucked up world. My life has been nothing but utter misery, molested when I was 4, raped at 9, teased ever since because of being shy – I am now in my thirties and life is meaningless. I've tried talking with VA psychologists and psychiatrists, but they only schedule appointments during the day and I HAVE TO FUCKING WORK. I can't see them, because I have to work. They tried antidepressants before and they had no positive effect, CBT was getting no where. I want to end it, options? (Please no “Don't do it, life is precious comments” It isn't precious, it's worthless and constantly full of pain) I feel trapped in a scheduled prison of deadlines and meaninglessness in a cruel and cold world.


EDIT: I've taken out some of my profanity and insults (yes it was that bad before), and please don't take my anger to mean it is directed at you. I am asking for constructive criticism here and any help is appreciated.

When I'm driving alone, I consider crashing. Walking over a bridge, I can't help but look down. Death invades my imagination on a regular basis.

I'm a 20 year-old male. These thoughts began when I was 13, so they grew with me as I shaped into the person I am today.

My parents separated when I was 7. It was for the best, I knew it even then. I watched my mother struggle to raise my sister and I, and it was the hardest thing I've ever been put through. She had to start from scratch once she was on her own with us, and that meant working herself to exhaustion. She was ruined by her situation, while my father (made of money) complained openly about child support to her, my sister and I (and does to this day). I recently found out he even attempted to sue her at the time of their split. We moved away when I was 10, and everything continued.

I began to encounter my own problems (of which there are plenty) at high school and ended up hating myself at age 13. I create a lot, and play some instruments. I think I was seen the 'tortured artist' type. Suicidal thoughts during this time fluctuated from actively trying, to thinking about it maybe monthly. 

I did two years of university. The first year was in some ways pretty good. I moved out of home (a new home: my mum re-married and is raising my sister in a nice environment - I couldn't be more pleased for them) and into a place with friends. I got steady As and a letter of recommendation. I felt really proud for a little while. But it got to the point where I had a panic attack every time I had to talk in a tutorial and eventually whenever I left the house. I decided to take this year off studying to spend time creating, working, and mostly trying to clear my head. It has been liberating at times but mostly I feel no self worth. I'm working in a hospitality job where I have to present myself and smile a lot. It is harder every day.

I'm sleeping less and less, and I think I'm going insane. My friends don't know I still feel this down. They don't know that I think about death as a means to an end. I can't bring myself to tell anyone. Natural death feels so far away.

I suppose this is a test, to see how it feels to tell others (albiet strangers) how I feel. Thank you, even if you just read this and nothing more. You played a part in my attempt at healing. Sometimes I genuinely want outside help, but am I wrong in being morally against parts of what is involved? I don't want to be categorised. I am aware there are major philosophical disputes in the field of mental health. Maybe I'm just too scared. I don't know anymore.


EDIT: I'm still here :) - Thank you... This all feels very strange, but reading your replies has been really productive. I stayed up most of the night considering my options. I think I'm going to tell a good friend how I feel, and that I'm now seriously considering going to a doctor about it. The thing that scares me the most is how much control over my life I will lose once I admit my suicidal thoughts and behviour. I am extremely hesitant about this part. I live amongst a male-dominated culture that perpetrates social stigma towards sadness. One overhears the word 'pussy' a lot, in reference to melancholy. I can make no promises, but I think I'm going to try.

I'm a 23 year old male and I've felt like killing myself for years now.  I let myself go down this downward spiral and ended up as a stereotypical parents' basement dweller after withdrawing from my university when I was put on academic probation.

As time went on, I started isolating myself from everyone and started pushing away all who were close to me. The most dominant thought in my mind was how/when to commit suicide, and with each passing day it seemed like the most reasonable thing to do and I just came up with more and more reasons to kill myself. Every time I tried to make a difference or change my ways, I would just fall back to my old self after a few days. Life was only getting worse, and my prospects weren't looking good. I was being a leech to society and life seemed pointless. 

Fast forward a couple of months of this horrible existence, and I was more determined than ever to kill myself. I considered posting my problems in this subreddit and didn't feel like going to a psychiatrist again. One night in early January, I had this rather crazy dream I'll never forget. This might be prone to false memories, but here goes: 

&lt;CRAZY DREAM&gt; I'm in this giant facility for 'useless people' and a bunch of 'government scientist' types are messing around with me and putting me through a series of tests and trials. 

They then make me put on a mask and tell me to get into this large elevator with a mirror in it. I comply but I feel something's wrong about this whole thing. Soon enough they say ""Goodbye"" and start laughing at me through a window in the door and the elevator starts going down. I'm overcome with fear as I realize I'm going to die and start freaking out, I shout ""I don't want to die!"". I look at myself in the mirror, pull off the mask and think ""I shouldn't let myself go to waste, I can't be useless, I'm still alive"". I pull out my phone to call for help, only to find out there's no network coverage since I'm underground and in an elevator. I then decide to record a message for others in case they find my body later. 

I start recording a video and begin this long epitaph in which I speak to the people close to me, declare what values were dear to me and what I wanted to do with my life. In the process I realize things about myself like I behaved like a fucking narcissist all the time and start weeping. Suddenly, I lose the ability to breath and get ready for this slow and horrible death full of regret and pure terror &lt;/CRAZY DREAM&gt; ....and I woke up with my face in the pillow. I got up let out the largest sigh of relief of my life and felt this tremendous zest for life. Although things didn't change much, I felt great from that moment on. 

This post is getting too long so in short, I learned web programming and made some good money undertaking projects for local businesses. I started hanging out with my friends again, reconciled with my family and others who I put off and I'm getting ready to head back to my university. Now with each passing day, I find more reasons to live instead of dying.  It's strange a dream brought out the best in me, I guess a lot depends on how you look at things. To those feeling down, I hope life turns out better for you.

Any similar U-turn experiences?

**TL;DR** Life was bad, was always suicidal, had a crazy dream in which I was being killed, realised I really don't want to commit suicide and now everything is going better than ever.

I used to see a doctor and take medicine (both cost me about $600/month when I could afford it), but my income has been slowly falling ... now it is $505/month working as an adjunct professor at a community college. I have no wife, girlfriend or kids; indeed, I'm still a virgin at 44, years ago having given up on any hope of finding someone who would be willing to put up with me. Family is far away, but they never call me--I'm always the one who has to initiate contact. My sister never seems that interested in talking to me, and I literally have to beg to speak with my nieces. 

Attempts to find more work have all led to disappointment and failure. Because I'm a single male with no kids and a job that is reported to the state as only 4 hours a week, I don't qualify for any kind of assistance whatsoever in the state of Florida. I currently sleep in the building where I used to teach piano lessons. Craigslist ads for getting students has yielded absolutely zero new students, but several attempts to scam me. I used to have 75 students. I'm down to 4 students now, and closing the studio down is a real possibility that would just emphasize how much I have failed, plus giving me no place but the outside to deal with.

I tried a Kickstarter for a children's book which failed: less than 20 people even bothered to back it and I only got 1/2 of the amount I asked for. (Reddit thought it was a horrible book, and I guess they were right, given that they predicted the Kickstarter would fail after the first week.) 

I illegally sleep in my piano teaching studio now, as I have for several years now, trying to put my life back together. But everything I do seems to just keep me where I am without any improvement. 

I answered an ad for an online piano teaching job, but my internet connection and computer aren't fast and powerful enough. I'd need over $500 in equipment to get started with no guarantee of students.

I spent this month's rent money on a limo driver's certification hoping to find some work there ... All of the places here want not only the certification I got, but another certification in the neighboring county, and they want me to purchase my own GPS unit with a minimum of 2 chargers (smartphone doesn't count), which costs more money which I don't have, so I feel like I wasted that money getting the certificate.

I owe $20,000 in back taxes to the IRS. They've refused offers in compromise twice already. The tax lien placed on my name prevents me from getting any sort of credit, and has prevented me from qualifying for a lease for a small studio apartment (probably a good thing, because I would have ultimately been unable to pay the rent and been evicted).

The temp agency I applied at has not called me once for any positions, and calls to the agency are met with a stern ""we will call you if we are able to match you with something' please stop calling us.""

I've gone from eating rice and beans to just rice, when I can force it down.  

I have most of the materials needed to end my life.

I have fantasies of attempting suicide and then getting the help I need because of the attempt. Then I feel horrible because I shouldn't be abusing anything that way or be that manipulative. So I can't just attempt to end my life ... I have to make sure it succeeds so that no one can accuse me of ""just wanting attention"" or being a lazy burden on everyone, or being accused of selfishly wanting to hurt everyone.

It would be weeks before anyone would know if I were able to carry it out tonight. Students would just think I was sick or on vacation. The college would fire me after I missed class twice in a row without letting them know--but they'd do it through email, not by calling or any other method. Family would just think that I was busy and they'd leave voicemail messages if they called at all.

All I have now is venting to places like MMFB and here, and I know it's not enough. But this is all I have. It's all I can afford to do. If I were a more worthy person, I'd be able to afford ""real"" treatment which I've since learned is only a mask covering the reality. But if one is poor, one doesn't even deserve the mask. Life and society would objectively be better off without me.

That last sentence was really egotistical of me: 99.9999996% of the world won't even know or care that I'm gone. Their lives are not made better and only negligibly made worse by me existing.

I don't even know now why I wrote all of this. Maybe it's hoping that someone cares or even at least pretends to care for a few moments. Or maybe it was just me making things more definite and concrete. I'm not even sure if it matters anymore. I'm just overwhelmed and have nowhere to turn, and maybe I don't deserve to be able to turn anywhere. This is the third time in 24 hours I've written something like this ... I deleted the other two without posting ... I fell asleep crying while typing this last night. I can't keep living like this, but every attempt to make a difference has ultimately failed or backfired. I'm scared to do or try anything else. 

All anyone can do to help me is talk, and the time for talking's over. It just prolongs the inevitable.

EDIT: I'm still here, mainly because I barely have the willpower to get up, let alone do something meaningful.

Everything started going downhill in 2006 when my wife -high school sweetheart- divorced me; I never truly recovered from it and consequently, my health began to deteriorate. It all started with me waking up -soaked in night sweats- with my heart pounding out of my chest and me screaming her name. Panic attacks and deep deep clinical depression -manic and bi-polar disorder- ensued thereafter, along with gastrointestinal issues and physical pain resembling chronic fatigue/lupus set in. I had ever diagnostic test known to man for a myriad of issues I could talk your ear off about. I also found out why I had been treated differently all my life, why I couldn't keep a friendship if my life depended on it; why I was socially inept all my life. Why my parents sensed that weakness in me and handed me incessant physical abuse, by my father and verbal and emotional abuse from my mother. I was recently diagnosed with Aspergers. Problem is: I'm a 31 year old male. I can remember as early as age 7 - having suicidal ideation. Obsessive compulsion didn't make life any easier; I had the incessant checking of things and compulsive 'hand washing' and 45 min showers to get completely clean. My father beat the shit out of me every time I exhibited those symptoms; or any reason he could find. My ex-wife was Mormon -I know, spare the commentary- he beat the fuck out of me for dating her. One time I snuck outside, while I was grounded, to kiss my ex-wife (then my girlfriend) at midnight on New Years Eve. He saw me leave, followed me into the darkness of the alley and made sure that I saw him, then he disappeared. When I returned home, he threw me on the couch and smashed my face in with his fists. That didn't hurt as bad as having 5 women watching it and acting like nothing was happening and not saying a word. Another time, he took a metal clothes hanger -unfolded it- then put the ends together and whipped my back so long and so hard that blood soaked the white shirt I was wearing. Anytime I exhibited confidence or knew what I wanted to do my mother tore me down verbally and emotionally (you know, the stuff some women are really good at). I've been called every name in the book by her. I never called her anything disrespectful. To this day she can and does tear me apart with words. I can never appease her, I can never date the right girl. She is racist, bitter, and passive aggressive. A few years ago, I found out that my parents spent my entire childhood and teenage years, high. We were doing ok financially at one point, until we lost our house and everything else because they pissed money away and spent most of it on pot, cocaine, and later, meth. Fast forward to about a year ago, my sister called me worthless and nothing but a piece of shit. I was staying with her and her husband for a few months since I had lost my job. She had always participated in the verbal and emotional abuse alongside my mother. After that confrontation, I was kicked out of her house and became homeless. I have been on several job interviews and have been applying everywhere, but this is hell. I've been living in my car for a year and I am still sick; I'm going to need gallbladder surgery and as we speak have $4 to my name. The sister and in-law that kicked me out -along with my mother who lives with them- are texting me with passive aggressive messages. My sister's about to have a baby and they are trying to pull me back into their web of narcissistic bullshit. They are portraying me as an evil person because I haven't talked to them in a year. Everything is about them. The thought of going back to that life makes me want to put a gun to my head as much as being sick, jobless living in extreme poverty, and homeless does. I have no money, no job, no insurance, no bed, and right now I want to sleep forever. I want to find the highest building and leap.

My cousin is coming here over New Year's Eve and I just don't want to meet him, I feel so guilty. I am also afraid that I will do something awful to him.

Is there ANYTHING to do? Am I crazy or a pedophile? Can I celebrate christmas as usual? I just cry when I face my thoughts and I honestly kind of want to die.

Your voices, cliche, harsh, demeaning and just plain funny made me do the 'right' thing. Man, i had a rough day. I called my older sibling to meet me and take time off work. I told him first, and bawled like a baby. He understood. Step 2, tell mom. She was very understanding, i bawled anyway. Step 3, told dad. I wanted him to scream and threaten to hit me. His disappointment hit me so much worse. But the truth is out. We headed into town and registered me as a citizen again, soon i will have health insurance, tomorrow I need to contact the student loans office and make a payment plan with them. We decided the best thing for me is to start work; anywhere. In August when school years start again I can choose to finish 1 of my college programs or pick some other training to do in a field I deem appropriate (full time or part time). During my months of labor I shall handle the burdens of my loans alone, while seeking to move out at the earliest opportunity and provide for myself completely for the first time ever. I only told my sibling about my 'suicidal thoughts'. There was no need to bring more drama into it for my parents. So I guess my life finally begins, and I have you people to thank for it.

I've decided that instead, I'm going to do the thing I feel is the worst action possible - I'm going to post something rather vague and whiny about my life and hope I get a response that I personally judge to me worth responding further to.

Now, that first paragraph is part of the problem and as you'll see at least this one stems from me. I don't talk about myself, it feels selfish and boring and more so depressing to others. So this is is new to me. I also seem to find myself looking at other peoples stories of depression or desperation and belittling them in my own mind.

I'm rather quick to judge ""I cheated and now I'm sad"" as, well how about don't cheat any more, learn from your pathetic actions. I read ""I know how you feel"", ""I'm sorry"" and ""it gets better"" as ignorance. You don't know how I feel, as I've never told you. Those I've even started to go down the path of how I feel with, find my entire inner workings strange and alien. If you're sorry, you wouldn't do what you do. If the situation has nothing to do with anything you did, you can't be too sorry about it. I'd assume that we as humans are in a constant state of feeling empathy for those in less fortunate circumstances, we're all sorry in this regard 24/7. It gets better? No, it really doesn't work like that.

As you can see, I totally fail to grasp the concept of not giving information, writing in a concise form. I apologise for the wall of text.

Essentially, there is a life time of stories, issues, events and troubles that have caused me to end up where I am, bothering to type this. But for the majority of my life I haven't wanted to live, I've often found ways to ignore that and carry on, as I know that while my mother, father, would be better off without me in their life - they wouldn't deal well with me dying. This has led me to be rather distant from them, as I think internally, I actually am really unhappy with them for making me be alive.

My major coping mechanism to carry on in life has been to attempt to help/benefit/fix others, solve their problems so I didn't need to think about mine. The friends that I have used for this purpose have in the last year finally found their feet for the most part and no longer need me to give them lifts, buy them things or even spend time with them, as they have other people in their lives now to do that.

Unfortunately this leads me with nothing to forget the issues I have myself and so I've been considering whether suicide is a legitimate option for me.

When I was 8 I said things would be better when I was 11, they weren't. When I was 11 I said they would be better when I was 16, they weren't. When I was 16, I thought things would be better when I was 20, they weren't and so the cycle has continued throughout my life.

I'd like to go to my mother and father and offer up a conversation to each of them, so that I can explain my situation and help them get over the fact I will no longer be around. However, I know they will not take this lightly nor allow this to be of any comfort to them.

So here I am, realising that I'm simply waiting my parents out, alone, unhappy and bored of being here.

I think I need the opportunity to list through all the things that have caused me hassle and have my opinions on it either confirmed or not. I've spent my life knowing what people were going to do before they do it, think before they think it. I've always been told I was wrong, when proven right, its always been brushed off as coincidence or that I had not even said anything.

I need some grounding and I'd like to work out whether suicide is an appropriate path.

Yes, this is my version of being vague and not typing much.

Thanks for reading, I apologise for my inability to be brief.

If this is the wrong place to talk to then you can just tell me where to go and I'll post there.

My life is pretty shitty at the moment. Today I really felt like that my life is absolutely worthless and not worth living. I thought hard about it and I'm getting afraid that it won't get better. Maybe this will sound melodramatic but that's how I feel.

I'm doing terrible at school and I'm not getting any student loans because I haven't finished enough studies. I can't seem to have a normal conversation without coming of as a fucking inconsiderate douche. I'm really starting to wonder if I'm an extremely uncomfortable person to be around. I have pretty shitty sleep schedule and I'm pretty tired at the moment (I couldn't sleep but I'm going to take a nap after I finished this post). My knee is damaged because of faulty training, and now I'm having a hard time exercising, the one thing I felt I was reasonably good at. I can't seem to focus on classes or friends talking to me and I seem to constantly zone out. I hate my life.

I suspect I have ADHD and I've tried to seek help for it. But it takes a long time and I will get help in about 2-3 months. Today I just wanted to curl in my bed and die. I talked to them and they said that there is no chance to hasten the process.

I've tried to call a few suicide/urgency-hotlines but they've all been busy or the line wasn't open at that moment. I don't think I'll really kill myself. The thought of my family living with that is horrible to me and I just can't do that to them.

I've tried commiting sucide back when I was a teenger but I failed. I don't think I will do it now but today I just really wanted to die.

I talked to a nurse and he suggested that I should go to acute psychiatric ward (I don't know what it's called in english, I live in sweden) and see if they could help me. He suggested that I could maybe get anti-anxiety meds and hold on to that until I can get ADHD-medication. I think it sounds a bit retarded but maybe it will help, I'm not sure. I'm going there later tonight and we'll see what they have to say.

It's weird, I feel like if I'm not shouting at the top of my lungs and attempting to jump from a building at this moment it's not considered serious enough to treat it.

This post doesn't really have a point, but I just wanted to talk with someone and maybe get advice. Whenever I talk to people about this they always seem to refer me to someone else. On every webpage on suicide it always says that there is hope and that you always can get help but I just can't seem to find it. I'm grateful for getting help on my suspected ADHD but it feels so far away and I don't want to feel like I'm on constantly the edge for two months.

I just wanted to share how I was feeling. If there is something unclear then tell me and I'll explain. I'm going to try to take a nap and see if I'll feel better. Thanks for listening.

I'm typing this, leaving it here and will check back tomorrow.  So don't trip over yourselves posting ""don't do it because I love crunchberries"" or what have you.  

I say this is a cry for help because if I was dead set (pun) in my suicide, I wouldn't be typing this.  I'd either be dead or another anecdote about a botched attempt.  I have tried to off myself once before by pills, but it lead to me pissing my bed and eating mustard from the container.  

The reason I'm posting this is that I want a good reason as to why I shouldn't kill myself.  I'm an atheist, so there is no karmic retribution in it.  The only reasons I have ever been given are that people around me would hurt too much.  I've always found this to be an infuriating response.  You want me to live so that you can be more comfortable with your conscious?  What a fucking joke.  

I'm not some kid who is sad.  I'm in my thirties.  I'm divorced.  I have no chemical dependencies aside from nicotine (I loathe drug users and alcoholics).  I'm in a situation where I barely make enough to live but lack of transportation keeps me from being able to find a better job.  

Another response I've often seen is for people to list things to look forward to.  This worked for me up through The Dark Knight Rises but upon further thought, the idea of sticking around for something that just doesn't matter in the end seems infantile.  I guess my problem is that I see myself as an extremely small microcosm taking up an extremely small fraction of time.  The way I see it is that I know that my life is shit with little to no hope of it getting better.  My (two) friends can only respond with ""that's life"" in some condescending manner.  

Oh, and I also fear that if I don't kill myself, I may at some point down the road kill someone else.  No one in particular or anything.

I graduated from undergrad and am working a crappy temp job over the summer until I go to grad school. I'm under a lot of stress and the lack of friends prevents me from really dealing with any of it. I got into a fight with my mom who I'm staying with over the summer. She threatened to cut off support to me. It would suck in the short term, but it wouldn't really screw up my life entirely. The reason I'm reeling is just all the hurtful things she said. She basically called me a fuck up and said that I was unlove-able. I've always been the shy nerdy type. I have no friends, have never had a girlfriend or any female attention of any kind. I've struggled with depression before in college and managed to crawl out of it before but it feels like I've just been dumped down so far into that mess again.

The first part of this post is gonna be my story, skip to the next section (the idea I've got for us) if you dont care about this. I'm just putting it here in case you wanna know what kinda situation I'm in right now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I - My story.

I've been contemplating suicide since I was 14. I'm 24 now. Why? I'll try to put it in a chronological order.

The first reason is probably because I grew up in a broken home in a a third-world country where divorce is frowned upon. Rich but crazy violent/abusive father, kind but acutely depressive mother. I hadn't been able to get away from him no matter what I do, especially since he's the one bringing food to the table. But a few months ago I finally just did. I finally broke all contacts with him.

The second reason is that I'm always quite the out-of-place geek. I have an outlier IQ. For anybody who thinks that is a gift, trust me, most of the times that is a curse. It's hard living in a world where 99.9% of the population thinks about everything extremely differently from the way you think. You are always the weirdo, you are always the outcast.

The third is that I am unemployed and have pretty much zero cash. I have a finance degree from a US university but seem to have zero luck finding a job.

The fourth is I almost got married and pretty much failed. Had a blast, lived together for years, was living a fairytale love dream until one day she got lung cancer. Ironically she doesnt even smoke. That was a few years ago, and she has recovered well since, but those days were depressing and it got the worst of me, it stressed me out so much, I don't do well under that much stress. I got angry a lot, and I vent it on the nearest people. And sadly she's the closest so she got the most of it. Our relationship had gotten downhill since that time. Instead of always saying ""I love you"" everyday now she's always like ""you wanna take a break? we'll still be friends"".

Fifth reason is I started my own herpetology business, spent whole 3 years doing everything I could possibly do to make it work, sacrificing every single other thing in my life just for it, literal blood sweat and tears yada yada, and still failed miserably. Now I'm in the process of selling everything at a loss. A loss of time, effort, happiness, hope, and dream.

It would probably be better if it were any other business. But with animals, you get attached. At least I have. Overly attached. 150 animals, all of which I love to death and now they just have to go poof and be sold to people who will most likely not love them more than I do. I mean when's the last time you see someone loving crocodiles?

That's pretty much it. I have been depressed as all hell this past few years, gotten more intense for the past few months, and right now the only thing that brings a smile to my face is when I remember that I have one easy backup strategy should I encounter a dead end, and that is the word this subreddit is centered upon: suicide.

But as I live my day-to-day currently bumming life I realize, there are still so many things on my bucket list. I want to go adventuring allover the world. I want to go deep-sea fishing. I want to join the military. I want to study Mandarin and live in Shanghai or join a Shaolin monastery. I want to live for a few months in Manhattan. I want to live in a tribal village in Africa. I want to live with the Inuit.

I really don't want to die. But I have no money, I have no job, soon I'll have no food, I'm losing my fiancee, and I just cut ties to my family.

But I still have another idea. Another plan, a hope, a dream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Part II - My idea.

There are probably thousands of suicidal people reading this subreddit. Thousands of people in similar situations, thousands of people losing hopes and dreams with every passing moment, thousands of people whose life is dangling on a very fragile string, ready to pop at any moment.

Let's fucking change that. We are not alone. We can help each other.

What I propose is we build a community. Whenever you are already on the very edge and ready to pop that xanax or click that gun trigger, do this instead first. Let's all move somewhere together, helping each other, having the adventure of our life. A lot of us. We've got nothing to lose, you were about to end your life anyway. If you dont like it after, then feel free to commit whatever it is you wanna commit after this. But just give this plan a chance.

What is the plan? Well, we surely each have something that others don't. So lets move together somewhere for good. Adventure. Lump ourselves somewhere new in the globe together. Write a new page of our life, forgetting the past pages. Having an entirely new game on life.

I am sure we all come from different backgrounds.

Some of us may be a good linguist and can make learning the new language a bit easier for the rest of us.

Some of us may know computers and technologies a lot and make understanding the foreign tech stuffs easier for all of us.

Some of us may be extremely good at making new friends at this new place and connecting the rest of us.

Some of us may have great entrepreneurial spirits and can help us find a job or start a new biz in the new place.

Some of us may be awesome in mediating the group together, bringing everyone of us closer.

Some of us may be great leaders who can motivate people on hard times.

Some of us may be hilarious jokers who will brighten everyone's day.

My point is, no matter how fucked up you think your situation is, you definitely will have something good that can make the group better. And at the very least, even if we dont know crap about a particular thing, having more people there is gonna be way more fun than doing things alone.

No matter what your situation is, it's gonna be one hell of an adventure doing this as the last resort. You're an oppressed gay, transgendered, or lesbian? Welcome to the party! You're poor as sin? Me too! You're alone? Not anymore! You have no friends, or just broke up? There's a ton of new people here to hook up with!

Let's do this. Let's move somewhere new, all together. South Africa, Singapore, Russia, Taiwan, Antarctica, whereever. Lets embrace a completely new life. Build a new community together. Fuck the past. Live in the present. Be surprised at the future.

I think it completely beats pulling the trigger.

All my options lead to suicide. My brain keeps telling me there's enough to not screw over my partner's parents who co-signed his side of lease. This is it. This is my way out.

I guess I should start from the beginning. I got really sick a long time ago. Brain damage, depression, the whole deal. I had to relearn to count and spell and all the while attempt to not fail out of school. That was the beginning. That was 10 years ago. Since then, my life has been a downward spiral. I get told how proud people are of me that I pushed forward. That I made it. And that I even graduated from high school even though I didn't think I could do it. Not when you have to relearn the basic concepts of kindergarten at 14. But I did. Shortly before graduation, my body began collapsing. Soon, I would crumple at various times throughout the day. Another diagnosis. Fuck. I went college. It took me six years, a serious drug problem, and a host of doctors visits, but I did it. I graduated. Another fucking tick mark. 

I left my family after graduation. I couldn't take the disappointment. I knew that if I stayed, I'd end up killing myself. I moved 600 miles away, moved in with my partner, and began a ""new life."" I got a job. I told myself all I wanted to do was change the world. Everything is fucked and if I don't stand up and try to fix it, then I'll consider myself a failure. I found a shitty apartment. My partner had to have his parents cosign on his side of the lease because his credit is piss poor. I told myself I had made it. That this was stability. A job. A roof. Some ramen. I tried so hard to be happy. To stick to my ethos.

You see, I have this problem. I can't function. I work and work and work and drive myself into the ground and hate myself and throw everything I am just to get through it... And by the end of it, I'm exhausted, a poor employee, and about to be fired. All because basic things like punctuality, time management, and communication get put aside just to do the basic tasks of the job. I lost my job on Tuesday. We have 1000 dollars in savings. I thought we'd be okay until I could find another job. 

I got a call on Wednesday. It was a collector. I had a fender bender with a coworker a long time ago. He ran into me, but I didn't have insurance. I talked with his insurance about everything. They said they'd send me a bill. I waited. No bill came. No calls. I wondered if it was his fault then I wasn't liable. I didn't know. The collector calmly told me that I owed 1700 dollars to his insurance. That they couldn't contact me. That I was unresponsive. Oh god, why now. I cried on the phone with the collector. I told her I didn't a job. That I don't have any money because it all goes to medical bills. That I literally can't pay that. She was nice enough to cut it down to 900 dollars. Its due by the end of the month. They said they'd take my license if I didn't pay. That leaves 100 dollars until I can find a new job. 

100 dollars in an economy with a high unemployment rate. Recent grad, few work experiences. I'm fucked. We can't pay this. They'll take my license, meaning I won't be able to even get to a job, let alone get to it. 100 dollars. What about rent and bills? I haven't been eating already. I'm already hungry because we're broke. Wake up hungry. Go to sleep hungry. Repeat ad nauseam.  

We have a 1000 dollars. That's enough to cover my partner cancelling the lease after I'm dead so they don't go after his parents. My body's already broken. I'm already a failure. I don't have any more options. This saves my partner and his parents from failure to pay bills. This'll get him back to his folks until he can find another place to stay. He'll have food and shelter and won't be facing what we're facing right now.

It's not something to joke about, really, so when they acted disappointed and told me to stop talking like that, I started feeling worse.

I'm currently going through SSRI withdrawal.  I first started taking the medication because I was working 40 hours a week on top of 5-6 classes a semester for class work.  I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and placed on 20mg of Paxil daily.  I ran out of the medication and don't have an appointment with my doctor any time soon.  I feel nauseous on and off.  I have terrible headaches, twitches, and pains throughout my body from not taking the medication.

I'm a computer science major.  The semester ends next week and I didn't keep my GPA up enough to be able to continue.  The school is basically going to kick me out.  I have ~$30,000 in loans that I simply cannot pay, I work at a part-time job as a video store clerk, and don't receive any monetary support from my parents.

I'm tired.  This last week or so I've been thinking more and more every day about a specific bridge that would work very well for committing suicide.  I don't want to do it, and I don't feel like I really could, but from what I've heard, those are serious signs that it might actually happen.

I'm stuck in Wisconsin, the weather is terrible, I'm a terrible student, I hate my job.  I love my girlfriend and my room mate so much, and I would never want to hurt them so bad.  I just don't feel like I have any other options.

I feel like such a coward for even thinking about it.  I want to see a psychologist but I don't have money to pay for it.  I'm under my father's insurance, thankfully, but as soon as I'm removed from school, that won't be the case anymore.

I'm pretty close to being at the end of my rope.  I'm sick of switching between crying and laughing every day.  It almost feels like my brain is having spasms and I get shocked.  I twich, I can't sleep well, I can't eat.

People have been telling me to take a year off of school and to just work, but where?  You can't get a half-decent job without a college degree, and I haven't done well enough at school in the first place to get a company's software division to even look in my direction.

I'm 23 and have been working on my undergrad since I was 18.  I've gotten almost nowhere.  I don't have any other interests, and I don't even think I'm interested in software development.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know who I am.  I don't want to be in pain anymore.  I feel so filthy and selfish thinking that I even remotely want to commit suicide.

I just want to tell a little of my story, and hopefully it will help someone else down the road.  I tried to kill myself this past Saturday, I left home and tried to do it in the woods behind my house.  I figured no one would find me there and everyone would just think I left town or something.  I dunno.  I tried to hang myself, and through shear luck I failed.

It was in the last few moments though, before I passed out that my brain realized I guess what it was doing. I remember hearing myself yell ""What are you doing?!"" and then realizing there was nothing I could do.  I wasn't scared before, but I was scared now.  I thought I had died. I woke up on the floor, I dunno how much time had passed.  The branch I had tied the cord around had broken.  I guess that final struggle worked to my favor?  I haven't really thought about it.

I lay there in the woods for a while, and I debated trying again.  It was not glamorous, it wasn't quick, it wasn't easy, it wasn't painless.  It fucking hurt, a lot.  I thought to myself, if I wanted to die I wouldn't be debating it now, and I wouldn't have struggled in the end right?

I came back home, my parents where crying.  They had found the note I left them.  I was surprised to see a friend of mine there who they had called to see if I was with him.  He cried, and held me for a minute.  I am too poor to have gone to the hospital, or any sort of center for this kind of thing.  Part of the reason I was miserable, I suppose.  I went over to a close friends house, told her what happened, and just sat there for a while.

My phone kept ringing, word spread fast.  I was ashamed.  I AM ashamed still.  I felt angry for a while, I survived so everyone could find out what happened? The whole point of me doing it the way I did was no one was supposed to find out.  But now everyone knew, and I was not given any time to process the events before I had to start processing how I made other people feel.  I spent the majority of the first 2 days on the phone, assuring various relatives and friends that I was OK.  That they could stop worrying now, thanks, go back to your lives.

I wake up in the mornings, and for a split second everything is normal.  My head hurts, all the time.  I have really bad bloody-eye, which is pretty normal.  My neck and throat are sore, and eating was a challenge the first couple of days.  Nothing I can do but wait for it to heal.  I feel as if it's a reminder, every time I look at the mirror I see the bruises on my neck.  My blood-red eyes.  I am just ashamed at myself.
I am trying to deal with it one day at a time.  It gets a little better.  The pain I had before is still there, I am just trying to learn to work around it.  To recognize it almost as a separate entity from the real me.  The depression is Player Two, and as long as I don't give him the controller we are all fine.
I got lucky.  Not everyone does.  Seeing how I affected the people around me with just an attempt really put things in perspective for me.

The hardest part for me is just talking to people about it.  Unless you have tried it or have at least considered it as an option, you can't understand.  How can you possibly?  
Don't really know how to end this,  I don't know if you are thinking of trying it yourself or are just here to help those that are.  If you are thinking of trying it, I don't know that a random wall of text are going to change your mind.  But, as someone who was JUST where you are now, I can tell you that even if your situation or immediate surroundings don't get better the depression can get better.  You can learn to cope with it and better yourself.

I have been feeling like this for too long, and I keep seeing it in multiple SW posts. Don't get lost in that lie.

You may have a great job (I do), or do studies (I do) and be successful at them (I am), have a family, friends (or whatever you call the people you interact with everyday), and still, there is an emptiness inside you, thoughts that eat you inside out, and for some reason you just can't seem to be happy/satisfied.

This is normal. No amount of material assets have ever made anyone happy. You can be happy with barely enough to eat if you have people who love you around you, or any other reason to keep going. You can be stuffed with expensive food in an expensive apartment playing expensive games on an expensive computer, if nobody around you understands you, you have every right to feel miserable.

And then when you stop feeling guilty for being ""materially priviledged"", realize you are part of the ""emotionally poor"", and work from there. There is hope if you let go of the thought that ""with all you have, you ought to be happy"". That's not true. There is so much more to life than this. I know it because I have lived what ""more"" there is to life, and I have lost it, and I am looking for it again.

Let me thank you all first for your responses early this morning, I was finally able to get some sleep knowing that I did the right thing and didn't mess up. 

I called my friend about 5 hours after I called police to check on him (11am MST). He did not harm himself, and he consented to giving his guns to the police who came out. However, he continued to tell me that he had not changed his mind about his decision to end his life. He also confirmed to me that the clicking/snap noises I briefly heard were indeed him loading his new gun. He was going to do it over the phone but changed his mind because he didn't want to scare me. Lastly, he told me not to make any more calls for him and to disappear from his life completely.

Well, too bad for him. I called a national crisis counseling service and was guided what to do next. I called his local police again and explained the situation. The officer I talked to was amazingly understanding, professional, and helpful. He went out with another officer who had military experience so he could make a bond with my friend while they spoke. They decided that he was not in immediate danger and he agreed to get professional help on his own time (although he told me he didn't want help before this - I want to make sure he will soon). 

He has been texting me since the officers left after the second time. He is very upset with me but that is not about to make me step out of his life and stop caring. He has a value in many people's lives and is too stuck in his depression to see that his life situations are about to change for what he wants them to be.

I will be letting his family in on what happened, as they are very supportive of him and deserve to know what their son is going through. My friend deserves as much support as he can get, too. I don't think he would be telling me as much as he had, or continued talking to me if he didn't want help, right?

I'm posting here again with a quick tale of why I should stop giving a fuck and am looking for your opinion.

At age 17: I was making roughly $800 bi-weekly doing web development at a firm.

At age 18: I was making roughly $900 bi-weekly doing web/desktop development at a firm.

--

At age 17: I had a beautiful girlfriend that I provided everything I could to. We lost our virginities to each other. I would spend time, money, and do whatever caring thing I could to express my unconditional love for this woman. I never did anything purposely to hurt or upset her.

At age 18: She left me for a friend and from my knowledge has started doing everything we had agreed was not good. (smoking cigarettes, sleeping around, etc.)

--

At age 17: I never had enough money to live on my own, but I definitely had enough money to be satisfied at this age.

At age 18: Same as above.

--

I'm turning 19 this weekend.

I quit my $900 job after my girlfriend left me.

I failed a class and did poorly in another. (After having been on Dean's list, and thus ruined my perfect GPA.)

My ex is out fucking whoever she wants.

I'm tired of being the one who has to kill himself to get anything back.

I quit my job because I hated it. I wanted to be happy, and being there that wasn't possible.

I fucked up school because I was trying to spend more time with my ""friends."" They only had time for me at odd hours, so my schoolwork became less important. I just wanted some kind of social interaction, and I had nowhere to go for it. I went wherever I could to get it.

I'm deprived of real good friends.

One of my current ""friends"" owes me well over $300.

My only real friend in life was my ex.

I no longer care for her. I hope she somehow ends up in the same state I'm in. Terrible, depressed, wretched, hate. I hate everything.

I can't ever enjoy myself; almost as if I'm not meant to be able to.

I have brief moments where I'm happy, and then reality kicks in and I realize I'm fucking up somehow.

By hanging out with my ""friends"" I'm fucking up the now-no-longer-existent relationship with my parents.

I started smoking weed... a lot.

It's been therapeutic. I get things done. I actually enjoy many things I do because I can't possibly think about the depressing things in my life and be focussed on what's going on in front of me.

But, I still live with my parents.

I started my own company. I have 3 or 4 major clients.

No income after a month.

I've been surviving (secretly) off a $2,000 check that came in as extra from my scholarship / loan money from school. (i most likely owe $1,000 to a loan company, but that's the least of my worries. I owe loan companies my life right now thanks to school! *thumbs up for trying to get a degree!*)

Degrees are a waste of fucking money.

No one has cared about any of my accomplishments and won't even look at me with the same respect because of my age.

I'm tired of it.

I'm a hacker. It sounds corny, and I hate saying it that way, but I am.

I hack things. I break into things because it's like a puzzle. I enjoy doing it.

It's the one thing I can do and prove to others that they aren't any better than I am.

I've never done anything illegal, though.

I don't *want* to do anything illegal.

I just want to be like everyone else.

My grades are good, an A student, I'm not too bad looking, and I can socialize decently.

But why do I feel like killing myself every time I leave school?

I hate my life so much. The only things I can be proud about are my grades and my gaming skills. My friends don't really know me, and I don't really talk to anyone. No one knows the way I feel, no one knows my hopes, my dreams, my ambitions.

I'm feeling angry now
I sure as fuck don't want to talk about this to my parents. They're not that bad I think, regular old Filipino parents. We do well by ourselves, have a decent computer, internet, cable, eat every day three times. But i fucking hate them so much. That fucking sperm donor who calls himself a father isnt fucking one. In second grade i teased my sister with friends, a shitty move, but I dont think I deserved to get thrashed the way I did?

Maybe I did, but i was only a fucking kid i didnt fucking deserve that kind of beating. 
(wasn't even that bad though right? not even a black eye or any bruises)
I can barely type, I want o cry and hit someone at the same time.

When I was in fourth grade my father thrashed me again for getting an 88 on a social studies test, called me failure and a disappointment, when I called him not my dad he hit me again and in the morning made me feel like it was my fault. Could have been, i should have studied harder instead of playing my new PS2, ratchet and clank is always fun.

But it wasnt that bad he didn't hit me too hard.

In 6th grade or 7th grade i didnt want to do my kumon and he almost strangled me because I said no, I'm not going to do it.

He doesnt do it really that much anymore, just screams at me a lot, says everything that breaks or goes wrong is my fault.

Its always my fault in my family, when something breaks or whatever. My mother calls me a liar when I say I'll be finished by 11:30 but I ends up doing it late. She screams at me, treats me like a delinquent for doing shit that would make any mother just shake her head.

I'm so fucking pathetic, its not even that bad. Maybe I should just sstep in front of a subway train.

I don't want to though, someplace inside me doesnt want to. but it'd be so easy and I wouldn't be such a bother anymore.

Or maybe im a fucking drama queen.

I feel like I'm blowing things out of proportion and just overreacting.
EDIT:

Now that I've calmed down a bit, I can expand hopefully. I'm 15, a junior. My family lives in an ok apartment building, small mouse infestation but nothing too bad. I can actually emphasize with my parents a bit. They grew up in the Phillippines, in poor conditions, so maybe its just the way they're used to acting. My parents are under a lot of stress too, high bills and all, plus the fact that my father can't really do anything, because of personal pride and age.

He was a lawyer in the Phillippines, but couldn't become one here- held a job in a corporate place for a bit, but left before he was laid off. Since then he's been unemployed, acting as a stay at home dad while still keeping up the appearances of a ""retired attorney"". It must be a lot of shame and stress that hes feeling.

I know that this doesn't excuse their actions. The misspellings, grammar mistakes- its like that 2nd grader is finally speaking. I've held this anger for a long time, more than half my life, and I want to let it go. I can't change my parents- I need them, not ready to break away just yet.

I remember that my depression was alienating--other high school kids saw what a downtrodden loser I was and so they avoided me. I was too scared and self-despising to ever start a conversation with anyone, so whenever someone (rarely) came up and started talking with me in a friendly way, it really meant the world to me. It's really hard when people reject you just because you're in pain, the time when you need love and acceptance the most. Please know that there are people out there who care, though they can be awfully hard to find, but they're worth seeking out.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,t3_dq3ul,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dq3ul/please_consider_professional_counselingit_really/,

I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/byawi/please_someone_listen_to_me_i_feel_completely/) post a couple of weeks ago, and I'd just like to give a little update/life-sign, to get some closure (and maybe give the people who helped me some).

I'd first like to thank the people here in SW, from the bottom of my heart. I remember sitting in my apartment alone, confused, feeling like a beaten dog with no-one to turn to. It was *you* that stopped me from doing something stupid. I remember I was ogling a bottle of Vodka at the time, which seemed like the solution to what I was facing. I just wanted to be gone, and to be disattatched from the horrible feelings I had. If I would've drunk that bottle I'd either would've had alcohol poisoning and no-one to help me with, or would've thrown myself off something. It was you that gave me someone to turn to, someone to talk about everything and even someone to confide into. This goes for all the people who responded to the topic, and who PM'd me. So, again, thank you. 

If you want to know what the after story is: I went to the train station to buy myself a ticket home. I had turned my cell off for some reason. When I came back home he was in front of my door. As soon as I saw him, I broke down crying. He started to try to apologize, but my whining kind of drowned him out. I sank to my knees in front of the door, and he leaned down and hugged me. As soon as he touched me, I felt contempt. I pushed him away, got up, and told him that he had broken us and that nothing was ever going to be the same. I opened my door and slammed it shut. The next day I was off on a 9 hour train ride. My family didn't know why I had come, so I just engaged in some routine actions, to keep myself busy. Being away from it all gave me a long time to think, what subsequently lead me to more and more mixed emotions. After about a week, I sent him a single text message: ""I miss you"". I was angry that he hadn't tried to contact me, for the whole time actually, until I checked my email account. I had stayed away from the internet for some time, because i didn't want to communicate with anybody. In my inbox I saw mail after mail from him, telling me that he was sorry. 

So I decided to give him a second chance. I saw him again for the first time yesterday. Things are different. They are awkward. I don't think we'll be a couple again, but I think we can get along.

So, that's my story.

Its too difficult for me to tell someone face to face. I told one friend partially about my problems but he hasn't followed up. Like other posters here, I don't want to burden him or anyone else in my life. 

For the past few months, my depression has gotten worse and worse. I am disappointed every time I get on an airplane and successfully reach my destination. I always imagined accidents happening to me to bring death, even if its slow and painful. After my surgery, I now have prescribed narcotics (my last refill). I've been seriously tempted to overdose on them twice so far. It was relaxing to count the number of  pills over and over again. The other times I take them to sleep. The low point was last winter, when a student at my school committed suicide. I was scared because that could have been me. I tell myself I would never do this to my family and friends. I would never hurt them or make them cry. But I really fear that in the future, in a moment of weakness and selfishness, I am capable of forgetting the people who care. 

How is it that my emotions can change so quickly? I can go from smiling and happiness to feelings of suicide and depression in an instant. When I am around my friends, I feel fine and normal, but whenever I am alone, I feel like shit. I am unhappy with myself and no longer think I can change. I don't want to bother trying anymore because I know I will fail again someday. Right before this, I came up with plans to change but who the fuck am I kidding? Its not going to work as I've already failed  today. 

I am a terrible student with no motivation. I don't deserve to be in the university I am right now. I cheated my way through high school. I lie to my parents about my grades. I tell my parents I am going to law school just so they don't worry. I lie to my parents who are devout Christians about going to church every Sunday. I've become agnostic since the last two years. I don't want to disappoint them. My dad immigrated over 20 years ago and works a tough job to support me even in his old age. I think my brother molested me when I was younger, but I'm not even sure as the memory is fuzzy. It could be something I just fucking made up to get attention or to feel sorry for myself. 

I've been a sick pervert ever since middle school. Porn doesn't seem to be a big deal to everyone else on Reddit. I got caught masturbating by my roommate multiple times last year. I even did it many times at night when he was sleeping in the room. I feel sick for fantasizing with the women I interact with at school. I smile at them, say Hi, act like a good person to them. Then I go home and fantasize about raping them. I look at this part of myself and absolutely despise it yet I don't stop. I feel guilty for losing my virginity as its only made everything worse. I still think about her a lot even though its been over 2 years. Its pathetic I'm still not over her. What makes all of this worse is that all of this happened when I considered myself a Christian. I feel like a disgusting hypocrite who's lived a lie. Even at school most of my friends are from the Christian group on campus. I feel so fucking fake. 

I don't have social or people problems and I don't have a dysfunctional family. I don't have a sob story like others. I get depressed about my depression. I believe I really don't deserve to be depressed. I don't want to deal with my problems so I just play games all the time to distract myself.  I have access to university counseling but I don't think I could ever talk to a stranger face to face about these things. I am too ashamed.

Thanks for reading it all and sorry for sounding like a whiny bitch.

**My problem**

I always get by in school doing things in the last minute. Every year, every day my anxiety grows, the pressure grows and the fear grows. My childhood has been about moving from 1 place to another losing all of my friends. I used to be very outgoing and social in my teens, but I have become a real anti social-person at 20. Every boy and girl in my family has a boyfriend and girlfriend and friends that they go out with to party and get stress off of their minds (I have a large family). But all I have done the past 3 years is sit in my room, study and then waste time on the computer. I feel like a geniune loser in front of them all.

**My father**

The only thing that has kept me from hurting myself has been my father. My father has been the one person in my life that I cant imagine to die in front of. He has spent all his life dedicated to making every detail of my life the best it can be. He is a working class man, a rights activist and someone who has been through worse than me, which is why he dedicates so much for me. I used to be a full of happiness when I was little thanks to him. But now I face the real world, school debt, and Im probably going to fail this semester and work a dead end job because I have no connections or portfolios with anyone. I cant blame anyone for this, i dont even blame myself because I know that when i feel this bad i cant function properly to do anything right.

Im posting here because im scared of admitting my feelings to my father or anyone else. Im scared that if i let him know, he will be hurt. He has health problems and a hard working life, and gets very emotional. I dont know what to do, but I have strong feelings about just ending it all because I cant bare my situation anymore. this feeling is getting worse everyday. thanks again if you read this.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,t3_b6d2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b6d2n/i_really_just_want_to_end_it_when_i_fail/,

Wanting to kill yourself just means its time to kill parts of yourself that you don't need.  It just means its a time to make big changes.

1262008850.0,27,self.SuicideWatch,aj6pe,Unlovable?,28,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aj6pe/unlovable/,"Two months ago I lost the best friend I've ever had. I always told him I could be myself with him without having to put on any facade. He's the first person I've ever met since I was a little kid whom I've felt that comfortable with. With most people I have to pretend to be happier than I am, or act like things are better than they are so I'm fun to be around. I left and joined the Navy over a year ago and was kicked out last June for being bi-polar. I can't get my life back together.

I spent a few months out of state with family. It was the worst experience of my life. My mom and g'ma are great, but they have no life whatsoever (not one friend or hobby) - and I'm a fast mover. But I didn't even have money for gas to go anywhere, and I didn't know anyone other than them in the state. I have a master's degree and couldn't find a job. Just when I was about to lose it, my brother called with a job opportunity on the other end of the country. I packed up and left. It was great for 3 months... til I got laid off. My boss made it clear to me that I had done nothing wrong; he just didn't need my position anymore and couldn't afford to keep me.

That was October, and I have yet to find a job. The first week of November, I lost it and tried to kill myself. The strain was too much for my best friend. He stopped talking to me. A month ago, he sent me an email, telling me how much what I did hurt him. He was absolutely right - I was selfish and I put him through too much. He told me he still loved me, but he needed some time. It's been another month. I texted him for Christmas and told him that I miss him and am thinking about him. He has yet to respond.

The thing is, this completely justifies the whole reason I tried to kill myself in the first place! His life is obviously better without me - I was just weighing him down. Otherwise, he'd miss me by now. Also, if the one person whom I was ever myself with, whom I ever opened up to completely can't even stand to talk to me... what does that say about me?

I haven't had a real relationship in years. I can't hold onto a friendship with the sweetest, most selfless person I've ever met. I can't keep a job. All I do is suck the life out of those around me. Why in the world should I continue living? Oh, and my savings just ran out again. This week I'm moving back in with my mom and g'ma. This time I don't even have my friend to talk to from afar. Where do I go from here?

All I wanted for Christmas was my friend back... instead I got swine flu followed immediately by pneumonia. Without any income or healthcare, you can imagine how much fun that's been. I don't really care about any of that. I just want my friend to forgive me. I'm starting to believe he never will. It's been two months, and I still cry everytime I think of him.

I couldn't bring myself to leave my house (maybe once per week) and I sleep for about 12 hours per day.  I'm down to my last 50 dollars and now I need to move in with my parents or be homeless.  

I have ADHD and it is hard for me to hang onto a job.  I also have diabetes, hypertension and depression and have been without health insurance for the last 6 months.  I rely on generic medications which are not helping me much.  I used to take Strattera (which helped me a lot), but when I lost my job, I lost my insurance and was no longer able to afford it.  I have now lost my second job because I can not afford the Strattera out-of-pocket.

I don't mean to offend, only to speak how I feel)

I'm writing this because of what feels like a terrible injustice in the SW subreddit.  There is the claim that ""reddit loves you,"" but how is this even legitimately possible?  It often feels to me that it's ""reddit loves you if you're seeking attention, or are willing to take the selfish way out.""  Someone in a self-induced coma will receive the care and attention of dozens of strangers, but someone who rides it out, suffering quietly every day, gets nothing.

I'm not really asking for a change... I'm not sure that it can or *should* change.  SW is an amazing, vital service, but it can't help everyone.  It can't help me, that's for sure.  I can't kill myself; too many people whom I love rely on me to be there, no matter how much I have to suffer.  Ending it all would be a purely selfish act, freeing myself but distributing the suffering to others.

The real reason behind this post is that I don't believe I'm alone.  There have to be others here, lurking SW, who feel the same way.  I'm betting on it, otherwise I wouldn't be embarrassing myself like this, saying ungrateful, offensive things (which the moderators are invited to delete if I've overstepped SW's bounds).  I'd like to think I understand how somehow feels if they don't believe they can be a part of what's going on here.  And in turn, it makes me think that someone else out there similarly understands how *I* feel.

My mother died of cancer just over 10 years ago, and I grew up under a very strict dad. My sisters always, and still do, side with him on everything, even to the point of defending him for beating and yelling at me, calling me the monster. Since my mother's passing, my father had a lot of failed relationships with different women. One of which had two kids of her own and they all moved in with us. Her son was a pretty cool guy, actually, but he was very popular and I just wanted to hang out with him but he didn't find me interesting and was embarrassed to be around me. In 2008 my old man nearly died in a construction zone accident, and being from the states, the medical bills were enormous. We were thrown into poverty, and almost every day he and his girlfriend would yell at each other. She left after an explosive couple of weeks, and my dad began to berate and hold grudges on other family members. We moved across the country to California in a moving van (after breaking down in Iowa for days), and hoped to start a new life. We live in a very small house outside San Francisco. High school was miserable. I was bullied periodically and it really hit me hard. I made a few friends, but they're very busy and we don't hang out that much. Most of them have moved away. One night on the 4th of July in 2009, I went for a walk in the middle of the night. I came home at 2 am to my drunk father, who got back from an Independence Day party. He beat me half to death, screaming that he was worried about the loss of his poor little boy, and that I had shamed everyone. My sisters were screaming at me to submit to him. He smashed my video camera, and threw me all over the place. When he left my room to talk to my sisters, I tied a tow cable around my ceiling fan, and with tears flowing from my eyes, tightened it around me and jumped off my bed. My dad came in buck ass naked and tried punching me in the face as I dangled there. He would later claim that he was trying to knock me out to keep me from dying, but the fucker was holding the rope and looking me dead in the eyes and smacking me. I'm shocked that I DIDN'T pass out. I freed myself and he yelled that they couldn't pay for the insurance for this, stumbling all over the place. My aunt (on my dad's side) picked us both up and took us to the nearby clinic. While in the lobby, my dad told the nurse to make sure I didn't go anywhere, that I was a suicidal idiot, wasn't good for the world, and that I could wander off. FUCK. HIM. I had to be strapped to a gurney and taken to a rehabilitation center where I had to suck up to my dad, apologizing for everything that I did, just so I didn't have to spend another god damned night. We were very bitter since then. He beat me on quite a few occasions. Today, I am working a job that I do not like to make ends meet. I enrolled in a community college, but couldn't keep up with the courses due to my part-time job and stress. I was heavily dependent on the financial aid, and now I'm thinking about dropping out. My father is very low on cash, and we may have to move into an apartment and get rid of our dog. My aunt has been someone I have literally ran away from my house to be with many times, and she is still puzzled by all of this. I have no degree in anything, and I doubt I'll have a future. I never had any interest in women, or guys, or whatever. I try to drag my friends with me into doing things like going to the movies, but they are often too busy, and when they are not busy, it is very late at night. I'm sad that I'm broke, and I haven't the foggiest clue what to do for my future. Nothing seems quite right. Not just my life... politics, the news, society. I'm 18 years old, almost 19.

I'm a 40 minute drive from the Golden Gate Bridge. I want to jump bad. Either I kill myself or I kill my dad. I'm really losing it tonight. Anything? Thanks.

EDIT: Drove to the hospital last night. Nothing about my thoughts of suicide, just some stress-related chest pains. Bill is very high though",,False,,t5_2qpzs,1375994559.0,,,True,t3_1jxyfh,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jxyfh/im_going_through_a_rough_time_in_my_life_guys/,

I can't drive, I have no motivation, I've been clinically depressed since I was 11 (and nothing has worked for it), and I have a litany of other mental health issues.  Nothing makes me happy.  I have no friends and I don't want any either.  I can't stand being around other people; if anything, it makes me even more depressed.  I never leave my house other than to see a movie with my father and I don't even feel like doing that anymore.  I barely even feel like getting out of bed.  I am an empty, meaningless shell of a person.  I see no real point in going to college because I'll just be a mindless drone like everyone else and you can't get anywhere in life unless you have connections anyways.  Society only values you based on how much money you have and the masses are just tiny drops of oil in the machine that the elite run and benefit from.  But I have to go to college and get a job.  It's my obligation to.  I just don't know how I'm going to do it.  I feel like this world wasn't meant for me at all and I have no place in it.  I hate myself and I hate the world.  My mind is a wreck and I feel like it will always be that way no matter what.  I want to kill myself, but death is just too terrifying a concept for me to face and I wouldn't want to devastate everyone around me either.  I just can't stop thinking about it, though.",,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,True,t3_1kdrhe,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1kdrhe/i_start_college_in_a_few_days/,
