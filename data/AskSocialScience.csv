The failure of the moderators to do their jobs makes a mockery of this subreddit.,531,110,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/17dp3p/social_science_is_not_crystal_ball_reading_the/,"Please. Social scientists cannot predict the future or describe alternative realities. We don't read portents in bird entrails or tea leaves. We can't know what would happen if Russia had turned into a balloon in 1974 or if everyone suddenly thought that tables were rabbits or anything else that people just make up. 

Science is about things that are real. We should be citing research or at least established theory and saying that we don't know and why. 

This is not /r/ArmchairPhilosophy.

It is bad enough that the moderators allow top-level comments filled with speculation, jokes, and inanity, contrary to stated policies. But retaining ridiculous posts is the icing on the cake. 

Social science is real science. But compared to /r/AskScience, this subreddit is a joke. It's embarrassing. But it is correctable.

Preposterous, inappropriate posts and comments should be deleted. Posts that do not comport with the rules should be deleted. Please, moderators, do your jobs.

I wasn't the person who removed it, but I support the decision. Below is my response to his message. I thought it might be a productive line of discussion regarding the nature of the sub. Perhaps the other mods or community members see things differently. What is your opinion regarding the censorship of ""sensitive"" subjects? Where do you draw the line between politically correct and intellectually honest? Maybe I'm approaching things from the wrong angle. What do you think? 

**User xrxx wrote:**    
Hey I know you are prbly a super open-minded enlighted tolerant librul and everything but maybe you could stop censoring posts from this subreddit just because they disagree with your ideology.

**Response:**    
A statement like ""you never see a smart black"" isn't a matter of politics or left or right leaning ideology.  It is a statement of fact and not opinion, and it is a demonstrably false one. It might be true that *you* have never seen a ""smart black"" because you have not been looking very hard. Perhaps you should do some reading on Nobel Laureate Sir Williams Lewis or Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. Or maybe engineering and super computing are more your style? Then you should look into computational fluid dynamics and a fellow named Philip Emeagwali. Maybe your more of a statistics person (a personal favorite). Then you should check out David Blackwell. He was, after all, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, so he can't be too dull witted. 

I don't mean to knock those who responded to your post, but Obama is decidedly *not* the person to cite regarding ""smart blacks"". If you want to find smarts, look at mathematics, engineering, economics, programming, and the whole rest of science and design. There are plenty of examples in all of these fields. Take your pick. If you want to pretend that you understand stellar and galactic mechanics better than N D Tyson then be my guest, but I suspect that neither of us do or probably ever will. If you have any mathematical theorems named after you, then I'd certainly be interested to discuss them, otherwise you are not quite on equal footing with Dr Blackwell. 

It is important for science to be open minded. Scientists should never let things like politics or tradition limit their thinking, because you can't find answers to questions if you are afraid to ask them. In this spirit a question like ""Are there IQ differences between races"" is a perfectly legitimate one. The validity and scope of ""IQ"" is still not a completely settled question by any means. 

But this wasn't the question; it was **why** there are differences. This tells me that you have already found the answer to your question and are simply looking for others to find reasons to back up your preconceptions. That's not how science works. It's inappropriate in the same way that the question ""**Why** is Spearman's Rho the best method of statistical analysis?"" is, when the correct question is ""**When** is Spearman's Rho the best method?"". The former is trying to find reasons for *their answer*. The latter is trying to find *the answer*. 

I don't have any problems discussing scientific questions of a sensitive political or social nature and neither should the other mods so long as they're worth their salt. Racial inequality, gender differences, abortion, gun ownership, fiscal conservatism, social welfare, free market capitalism, so on and so forth... are all real issues that have real impact on ourselves and our society. As such, they are quite worthy of study and discussion. But that discussion has to start with the right questions. Not that they can't be questions that are controversial or that make us uncomfortable; that's perfectly fine. But they have to be honest questions looking for honest answers, and not looking for a pseudo-scientific circle jerk about conclusions we've already reached. That isn't science, it isn't how science works, and it's not what this subreddit is for.

My wife thinks it's unusual to have no friends, mostly because she has lots of friends and everyone else she knows has friends. My argument is that I'm a typical introvert, and there are lots of introverts, so there are probably lots of other normal, happy people who don't have or want friends.

Are there any studies or other empirical, non-anecdotal evidence to settle this? How common is it to have no friends?

I later discovered that much of the scholarly literature on fans did not mesh with my own experiences, so I decided to do a little digging. The result has been in-depth content analysis, interviews, and surveys of fans, fan works, and fan producers. These methods painted a picture of fans that is much more complicated than many scholars seem willing to admit. I am currently in the process of writing and synthesizing the work I have done during the last two years.

I am well versed in the scholarly literature on fan studies, and would be happy to talk about my own experiences doing research, some of my preliminary results, and how these results fit into the larger scholarly discourse on fans.

So how did countries like Sweden evolve out of this plethoric small-scale corruption?",130,20,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/18r2rb/in_countries_like_sweden_where_organized_internal/,"Ref: http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/to-cut-afghan-red-tape-bribing-is-the-norm/2013/02/17/93fc708e-6eff-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html?hpid=z2

I used Sweden since that's what I know. I used ""plethoric"" after checking its meaning (insert Princess Bride movie reference). I'm mostly concerned about small-scale pervasive and expected bribery in Russia, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and such. Plus of course the greatest con currently in progress, the fact that it takes so much money to get elected in the US that you have to get money from corporations and special interests to pay for the TV election ads that the very busy, 20-second-attention-span American people will pay attention to, so you end up having to write legislation to please the people with the money. But that's a minor issue.

The real issue is how to get the rest of the world out of the small-scale bribery mire. I'm hoping facebook, twitter, pervasive cell phones, electronic payments and websites like I Paid A Bribe http://www.ipaidabribe.com/ and others will super-fast track the process that I'm hoping r/askhistorians can explain to me. See http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/business/web-sites-shine-light-on-petty-bribery-worldwide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0

Edit: I admittedly don't have massive evidence that Sweden used to be mired in bribery, but know for a fact that military commissions used to be sold, same as Civil War-era USA. Additionally, a very (until recently) ethnically homogeneous society of a few million people with natural borders and a history of subservience to authority and premium pride paid to academic/scientific achievement, is not terribly easy to relate to the countries with the current problems. Are countries without natural borders just ...screwed, socio-politically?

My particular research focus is on the capacity of alternative and local food systems to increase community quality of life. I am approaching this question by looking at a particular geographic space (exurbia, the rural-urban interface, or the rural-urban fringe), that tends to foster tension over both agricultural and community issues. I can answer any questions about my research, but I also have a broad knowledge of agriculture and food systems from the local to the global scale. I am more familiar with domestic issues, but can at least speak to international issues as far as they tie in with food systems in the U.S.

I can also (but probably to a lesser extent) answer questions about Rural Sociology in general. Like, What the heck is rural sociology anyway? I can start by telling you that a lot of what contemporary rural sociologists look at stems from the idea that space constitutes a dimension of inequality. From there we move into topics such as human interactions with the environment and natural resources (particularly with regards to extractive industries), agriculture and food systems, community development, rural poverty, the effects of urbanization, and general inequality of resource distribution. 

I hope this all gives you a good jumping off point. Ask away!

Top-Tiered Comments:

Should be serious responses. If the submission poses a question, serious answers; if the submission is an AMA, relevant questions. Memes, jokes, or other unhelpful comments are not permitted as top-tier comments, though exceptions may be made if part of an otherwise informative comment. See Answers section for the specific rules regarding answers.

Answers
Good answers will be informed, comprehensive, serious, and courteous.

Answers must be substantiated by either making reference to a specific work, author, or theory within their field supporting their answer.

Good answers may often challenge assumptions implicit in the question, but should provide some guidance as to the right way to address the question.

Dismissive, rude, incorrect, or unsourced comments are strongly discouraged! Answers should keep a focus on social sciences, not opinion, anecdotes, speculation or guesses, all of which are strongly discouraged.

**My Background** 

So I'm a graduate student in economics, concentrating in monetary economics, macroeconomics, and time-series econometrics. My areas of specific expertise are in monetary theory and policy, but I have a pretty wide background in all areas of macro. Beyond academia, I've done short stints in Washington, DC, working on primary statistics for the US government (think BEA, BLS, Census). I have an unusually close view of the data-collection process. 

User Jericho_Hill and I go back a ways, at least half a decade. I think we first crossed paths doing applied statistics in DC during the mid-2000s. [Jericho did an AMA a week or two ago. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/137n9l/i_am_an_econometrician_ask_me_almost_anything/) He might wander in here from time to time.

I know there are two or three people who I've already promised answers to on certain topics. I'm hoping they will show up in this thread.

**Subject Matter**

To get you started, I'm willing to field most (if not all) questions in the broad areas of:

* Macroeconomics (growth, business cycles, monetary economics, ...)
* Economic policy, both fiscal and monetary
* The Federal Reserve
* Econometrics, particularly time-series
* Pedagogy in macro/economics in general
* ""The state of economics"" post-crisis
* The history of macroeconomics
* Some of the short-term trends in the US economy (the recent recession)
* Some of the medium-term trends in the US  (the productivity slowdown, the stagnation of median wages, etc)
* Some of the long-term trends in the Western economies (the Industrial Revolution, taking a long view, etc)
* My own views on macro policy
* Data collection and life at BLS, Census, etc
* Grad student life in economics!
* Life advice for undergrads!
* Life advice for undergrads, specifically those majoring in economics!
* Silly stuff
* League of Legends stuff
* Other things as they come up

**House rules**

1. **One topic I'd like not to touch on here too much is international macro.** I'm willing to field questions about the Euro, etc, but my answers on those topics will be somewhat more speculative. I will be taking a variety of courses in international macro this spring, and plan on holding an international macro AMA in May. If you can save international questions until then, you'll probably get better answers. This one will by necessity be more US-centric.
1. I'll try to answer from about as mainstream of a position as I can. Where my own views depart significantly from the mainstream, I'll mark it as such.
2. I'll be answering in as neutral, fact-oriented way as possible. If I am giving an answer that is speculative, I'll try to mark it as such.
3. Other economists may feel free to chime in, and I welcome the input, but remember that this is my show! Get yer own AMA.  :)
4. Economics, and particularly macro policy, can sometimes become a divisive subject. Try to avoid too much partisan bickering in the comment section. Keep it clean guys.
5. Be excellent to each other.

Thanks to Jambarama for organizing the expert AMA series.

I keep seeing people say things like ""it will fuck up his/her life forever"" and things like that, but I just wonder if it really has to. Is there some sort of innate physical reaction? How much of it is feeling a certain way because you feel like you should feel that way based on social norms?

If there existed a society in which sex isn't viewed as dirty or immoral or if there was a study done on someone who was not exposed to those lines of thinking, would they react to being raped in the same way? 

And to clarify, I am not talking about violent rape, but even that should not be any different from getting mugged. Why does the sexual component enhance the harm done to the victim?

--
Though people's reactions to the situations I named above don't make much sense to me, I could understand having trust issues if you were raped by a family member or someone you were close to for a long time, but why should they be any different than if they stole a large sum of money from you or lit your car on fire?

I don't want to say these kinds of emotions are invalid because so many people have them, I just honestly don't understand them and would like to know if there is any biological basis or if studies were done that can answer my question. Thanks!

They studied investment rates in relation to the income share of the wealthiest 1%.

They couldn't find any positive correlation between increased income among the top 1% and increased investment in the real economy, what little they found was a negative correlation. Their conclusion was that the very rich kept investing the majority of their profits in the financial sector. 

Edit for clarity:

What the study found was this: gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP has decreased in the last thirty years. This is despite the fact that tax policies during the same period have given the top 1% a bigger share of the income and the stock market index has increased considerably. They ought to have been able to increase their investments not only in the financial sector, but in terms of gross fixed capital formation. But this is not what the data showed.

I'm a bit unsure as to exactly how accurate ""gross fixed capital formations"" is as a measurement of ""investment in a real economy"" is, so if anyone can shed some light on potential problems with using that, be my guest.
 
I liked the fact that this study was not just a model based on assumptions, but based on empirical data (though very blunt data on national levels). 

Are there any good opposing studies done recently that support the idea that low taxes on the super rich (or alternatively: just having richer rich people) lead to increased investments in the real economy?

Edit: here's the most succinct chart they used, but they were clear in saying that it's a simplified look at the issue:
It's top 1% income share share of GDP on the x axis and investment share of GDP on the Y axis for 14 OECD countries between 1970 and 2008.

Peter Singer argues that, if we accept that allowing death of innocent people to occur by inaction is morally wrong, then we have a moral obligation to give all of our money, beyond that used for basic necessities, to the world's most vulnerable. One of Singer's premises is that we each have a moral obligation to give away most of our money *because* we know that most others would not. But still, what would happen if every family making more than $30K per year suddenly gave their money away to charity in order to help the poor?

I'm not looking to have a debate on the merit of his moral philosophy -- I just want to push it to its conclusion and see what would happen.

We may need to make a few assumptions
*$30K is a rough estimate; cost of living may differ somewhat from place to place
*Some donations would bring poor families in wealthy countries up to the 30K/year level; the rest would be donated abroad

To achieve this goal, we're proposing the following rules, which are based on r/askhistorians.

**Submissions**: 

Submissions must be questions, expert AMAs, or very sparse meta posts. Other posts should be approved by the mods before submitted.


**Questions**:

 Before submitting a question, we encourage you to do a quick search in google, wikipedia and asksocialscience. Many questions have been asked and answered.
Questions must relate to social sciences (listed in sidebar) in some meaningful way. Users should make every effort to ensure that their questions are clear, specific, and novel. The more tightly-focused the question, the more likely you are to get an answer. Also, Walter Rule applies here, don't come with a strong opinion already established and simply ask, ""am I wrong?""


This subreddit cannot help with personal issues or homework, please direct those questions to professionals or appropriate subreddits.


**Commenting**: 

There are two types of comments: top-tiered and non-top-tiered. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/vZveY.png) is a graphic showing what is meant by these terms. Each type of comment is governed by different rules.


**Top-Tiered Comments**: 

Should be serious responses. If the submission poses a question, serious answers; if the submission is an AMA, relevant questions. Memes, jokes, insults, or other unhelpful comments are not permitted as top-tier comments, though exceptions may be made for jokes if part of an otherwise informative comment. Speculation is not allowed in Top-tiered comments. If you don't know the answer, please don’t clutter the comments section. If you are going to answer, please provide sources.


**Non-Top-Tiered Comments**: 

These comments are less restricted, but still subject to moderation if blatantly off-topic or uncivil. Requesting sources and related follow-up questions are always appropriate.


**Answers**: 

Good answers will be informed, comprehensive, serious, and courteous. Sources are a must for unflaired commenters and strongly desirable for experts. Good answers may often challenge assumptions implicit in the question, but should provide some guidance as to the right way to address the question. A bad answer is the opposite of the above. Dismissive, rude, incorrect, or unsourced. To avoid political screeds, if you have a strong personal feeling about an issue, please consider sitting out of the top-tier comments, and making follow up comments instead. **Always report bad answers!**

The rules ~~take immediate effect but~~ are open to discussion and we want your feedback before enforcing them. We welcome any comments and thoughts.",,False,,t5_2sml9,1355640086.0,,,True,t3_13tn27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/13tn27/meta_official_rules_revision/,moderator

This leads me to ask, does IQ actually measure innate, biological intellect, or does it measure some culture-sensitive construct that we think relates to intellect?  Is it possible his results were in fact correct - Hispanics perform more poorly on the IQ test, simply because it measures concepts that are more strongly part of the upbringing of the average ""white"" child (more exposure through early childhood via parents on one end, through to simply better beginning-of-life surroundings)?  

I haven't looked at the dissertation, but I wonder if he even took his sample from an appropriate population.  Assuming his subjects were from the Boston area, perhaps the average non-Hispanic Caucasian has higher SES than Hispanics, or Caucasians on the whole, from the get-go?

I do also recognize that there are different types of intelligence.  I am interested specifically in whatever types the IQ test attempts to measure.

To reiterate, does IQ really measure intellect, or does it measure some imperfect proxy of intelligence?

[The man himself explaining his claims](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTbdnNgqfs8&amp;t=8m50s). I'll summarize my understanding here:

After graduating with a degree in economics, he was hired by an engineering firm as an economist. A NSA liason contacted him and trained him to ""fudge the numbers"" on economic analysis for developing nations. He was sent to countries such as Indonesia, Panama and others and produced development proposals with inflated figures, for example forecasting 17% electricity demand growth in Java in the 1970s when a more realistic figure would be 6-8%. These proposals were used to convince those countries to take out large loans from the world bank, IMF, etc which ultimately left the US as a major debt-holder, giving the US and US corporate interests ""soft-power"" over those nations.

I do consider John Perkins to be an unreliable narrator, however I find this to be a very compelling and plausible narrative. It also provides an alternate view of history, for example the US-Saudi relationship is cited as the greatest success of this program which *prima facie* seems to make a great deal of sense.

I'm currently in my final years as a graduate student at a well-respected policy program, focusing on cybersecurity and international development issues. I've had work cited in numerous major media outlets, and I'm currently working on some great projects related to technology and decentralization of governance.

Public policy differs from law in one important way: it is about implementation practices and the creation of rules that dictate those practices, as opposed to the laws that create the mandate for those services/practices. I can comment about some laws, but I am not a lawyer.

How can these statements be reconciled? Were unions necessary for this process and how can their contribution be modelled?

My intuitive evaluation would be that the market power wielded by industrial revolution era factories and large employers made them effective monopsonies which meant the formation of unions was necessary for reasonable bargaining to take place (as in you effectively had a single buyer [large factory] single seller [union] situation).

A discussion perhaps.,81,18,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1cxr3t/whats_the_deal_with_diamonds_a_discussion_perhaps/,"This is something I've been pondering a while, but I'll keep my question as brief as possible.

One of the most frequent Reddit TIL posts, or just general ""oh wow look at this"" posts, is regarding the diamond ""cartel"" DeBeers. The general consensus on Reddit is that high levels of diamond demand were created by an ingenious marketing campaign from DeBeers and since then they've been the standard stone for engagement rings and other items of jewelry. The consensus then appears to be that DeBeers spent decades tightly controlling the supply of diamonds in order to keep prices as high as possible.

My problem with the second part of this analysis is the near-complete lack of evidence which goes with it. Clearly, the marketing campaign by DeBeers has driven decades of high demand and, consequently, high prices. This is really no different from any other luxury good and is pretty basic economics, and in this sense, the idea that Diamonds are a ""scam"" seems somewhat ridiculous, as, regardless of the origin of the demand, clearly there is big demand for them.

So now we move to supply. Where is the evidence for a massive over-supply of diamonds? I certainly can't find much in the way of substantive evidence, although that may simply be a consequence of the activities involved. Most people point to [*this*](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/?single_page=true) article which suggests that DeBeers did engage in restrictions of supply, but that article does not really have any sources to back this up.

That being said, there seems to be some pretty big confusion in discussions of diamonds about the difference between ""industrial diamonds"" and jewelry-grade diamonds. Many people point to the fact that DeBeers have been hit by antitrust cases and been found guilty of collusion. However, they were found guilty to have engaged in these practices in the *industrial* diamond market, not in jewelry grade diamonds. The two are completely separate and thus this is pretty weak evidence for price-fixing in the jewelry market. 

Top-quality jewelry grade diamonds are, according to several sources, actually quite rare ( see here on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_clarity ) although, once again, these sources are fairly weak. I can't find any substantive evidence for their being a large over-supply of these types of diamonds.

There is clearly a mark-up on diamonds when they are sold at retail, but if we take diamonds as a retail good, that's not an issue, and it's something created by the natural forces of demand and supply.

So really, I'm here asking for evidence of diamond companies dramatically restricting the supply of jewelry-grade diamonds in order to drive their prices up, particularly in the modern market. DeBeers doesn't have nearly as much influence as it used to, so pointing fingers at them seems fruitless. Even if DeBeers were doing shady things previously, their lack of influence now would mean that the modern price of diamonds (which is still remarkably high) is a product of market forces.

**TL;DR: Reddit loves to talk about how common diamonds are, and how it's all a total scam. I can't find any genuine evidence for this, especially for the modern diamond market.

In both, I committed to make the changes necessary to achieve a greater quality.

---

*First, I promised more mods.* We have 5 new mods, let me introduce them:

/u/besttrousers is an expert in Behavioral Economics and mod of /r/Economics.

/u/Integralds is an economist as well, expert in Monetary policy and Macroeconomics.

/u/Fjosnisse has expertise in European integration and defense.

/u/Jericho_Hill is our third economist, with expertise in Econometrics.

/u/bks33691 is the team anthropologist, expert in religious studies and is set to do an AMA this Friday.

All of them are verified social scientists, experts of their fields and committed to the job that is modding this subreddit.

---

*Second, I promised changes on the rules to help increase the quality of answers.*

The rules have been adjusted where necessary, we now ban **anecdotes, speculation and guesses** as can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/wiki/rules). The rules are now in wiki form by the way, but only mods can edit it.

I have changed the sidebar a little as well, now it should be clearer what is considered a good answer, what's a bad answer and what isn't allowed in this subreddit. As well as a change in voting guidelines, please read them:

**Upvote** good, detailed answers that show a deep understanding of the field and have proper sources.

**Downvote** inaccurate or shallow unsourced answers.

**Report** off topic, politically motivated, speculation, guesses, anecdotes, bigotry, personal attacks and unhelpful comments such as memes and empty jokes.

---

*Finally, I promised stricter enforcement of the rules* and we already full on this.

I think this covers what the community has been asking for and I hope we can see a difference soon, now it's just some deleted comments in most threads, I think it should get better once we adapt our culture here.

Oh, and the new stuff... it's not ready yet, but I promise we will have some and the new mods are planning special things too.

In the near future I will create a Questions guideline to improve the quality of questions made and some other things, which we will be introducing when they are ready.

Girlfriend comes from an abusive home but still supports her mother, even though she got beaten and verbally abused daily until she moved out 4 years ago. Why would you continue to support someone who only showed disgust towards you?

**Long question**

I tried finding information about this and could only find loads of information about relationships with boyfriend/girlfriend or wife/husband. A wall of text background:

The reason I'm posting this is that my girlfriend and her 4 siblings used to be beaten badly by their mother when they were kids. Some times it went as far as they got strangled, lost consciousness and would wake up later to learn that either some other sibling or their father had stopped her from more or less killing them (the father being indifferent to the beating is another topic; please leave it out when commenting). They got beaten daily and more often than not it ended in bleeding wounds. The reasons could be anything from having asked her if she could help with buttoning their jackets (this happened and she was 5 yo at the time, first beating in memory) to going to the toilet at the ""wrong"" time.

The abuse was not only physical but she would call her daughters whores and that they disgusted her, that their cousins were much better in school, in looks etc (from what I've gathered the mother bullied her husband into becoming an alcoholic and dieing of liver poisoning). If she even saw them talking to a boy she would call them whores, that they weren't her daughters etc. They eventually moved out one by one and last weekend the son moved out because he was finally fed up. Before moving out she would do nothing but yell and complain at him (and the other daughters as well, the physical abuse stopped when they grew old enough to defend themselves). After the son moved out she called my girlfriend, crying that she had no one. Quick analysis says that she finally realised that she had pushed everyone around her away and now she would live and die alone. My girlfriend feels sorry for her and has tried to help her throughout all the years, to make sure that she gets to her twice a week dialysis which she doesn't want to go to even though she knows that she'll die if she don't.

So! After this WoT, my question is; **why would my girlfriend and one of her sisters keep supporting and helping their mother even though she has abused them physically for their first half of their lives, only to continue to abuse them verbally and mentally for the other half?** I read about the Basic Needs but I can't see why these would have to be satisfied by their mother.

- Unbalanced aggregate demand: Can an economy really survive with such low ratios of consumer spending and imports?
- (Unsustainable?) growth - up to 10% per year for many years running. Surely there will be a point where expansion hits its nadir and the bond rate (do they even have bonds?) plummets like we've seen in Western countries in recent years
- Massive economic inequality - I believe China is one of the world leaders in Gini scores. Okay - maybe their economy isn't based on consumer spending, so it won't fall in the same traps ours did because of inequality, but it still looks deeply unhealthy, especially in regard to potential revolution.
- Eventually likely to run out of labour force participants to stop expansion. 
- Long term problems: Ageing population, development of human capital not in line with speed standard of living is rising at, economy not exactly diversified in terms of industry, technology likely to replace manual labour which China has relied upon, environmental problems, reliance on dollar in currency fixing, potential fall out with trading partners over authoritarian policies (eg rare earth ban).

To me, this points to an obvious bubble - the same potentially applying to India in regards to inequality, political fallouts, overspecialisation of economy. I can only see the other two BRICs and the countries of the middle east falling foul of the Singer–Prebisch thesis because of their reliance on raw materials and the MIST countries are barely large enough to take the combined power of the EU and US on. 

So why is it still commonly understood that younger generations may not benefit from a higher quality of life that their parents enjoyed in the west? Why do we still look east for a forecast of the future?

Perhaps it would be nice to know what the percentages are for the top 1%, the top 10%, the middle class, etc. Either way, any info is appreciated.

What inspired this question (a rather colloquial story):

So a friend of a friend of a friend has a big ol' lakehouse down in florida, and he invited me to stay for a few days. Of course I was like hell yeah, and I went.

At first, it was nice. I was just living the rich life, ridiculously beautiful home, good booze, etc.

But, after the first day, it started to bother me.

This dude is from a rich ass family. Florida royalty. He is like 25 years old, plays video games all day, and is honestly stupid as a bag of fucking rocks. He went to a shitty little college, took like 8 years to finish, and you honestly can't even talk to the dude without being legitimately shocked at how stupid he is. He works a crappy job, and will tell you all day long about how brave and honorable he is, because he works a job despite coming from wealth. He isn't some spoiled brat either. He's an ignorant redneck with the right last name. And yet, here he is, living the high-life, no financial worries, in a MANSION that was just given to him. Meanwhile, a vast majority of Americans are struggling to get by.

And, fine. He's the spoiled trust fund kid. It happens. This isn't me jealously whining, I am trying to make a point. It isn't even about him.  The case is that his family made their wealth back in the 1800's. So, there are DOZENS of his family members around the area. They are all disgustingly-rich. And they have POWER. They are on hospital boards, they own most of the land in the area, they know people who work at Coca-Cola and dozens of other massive corporations, they've worked with presidents closely, they know foreign kings (no joke) and get so many favors its INSANE.

So, THIS is this a failure of capitalism? It seems like capitalism works, but only for a few generations.

Have we've reached a point in our economic, capitalistic development where achievement isn't even close to being the largest factor in regards to wealth? Is it all about last names, money hording, and luck?

If this uninspired millionaire I visited can be in the top 1% by being a lucky fool, and thousands of geniuses go poor... capitalism isn't functioning as intended in my opinion.

The most homicidal country, Honduras, has about 91.6 homicides per 100,000 residents per year, about 300 times higher.

Homicide victimization rates also differ dramatically between different demographic groups, but not as much as between countries when age isn't taken into account - the 2008 rate for white females was ""only"" 20-30 times lower than that of black males.

How much do rape victimization rates vary between countries and between demographic groups within the same country? I can't find much reliable data (or any data at all for most countries). Even with unreliable, dramatic differences in variability should be obvious. I would expect the variability to be less. According to a [2000 survey](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/183781.pdf) by the CDC and the National Institute of Justice, the incidence of rape was roughly at least 3.7 per 1,000 people per year, assuming no one under the age of 18 is raped (the survey only sampled adults). Honduras has a homicide rate about 20 times higher than that of the United States, so if the rape rate followed the same ratio it would be 74 per 1,000 people per year (implausibly high - multiplying it by Honduras's life expectancy gives a back-of-the-envelope estimate that the mean person is raped over 5 times in a lifetime). While the article doesn't break down rape incidence rates by race and gender simultaneously, it does give lifetime victimization rates, which don't differ as much as the homicide victimization rates (the lowest male rate that didn't suffer from small sample size was 2.8% for whites, and 20 times higher than that is 56%, compared to the highest female rate of 34.1% for American Indians and Alaska Natives).

Do rape rates vary as much as homicide rates? (I only looked at a few countries and demographics; maybe more detailed data would show that they're outliers.) If they don't, why is that the case?

If the US government mandated certain standards that have to be adopted by all retailers selling clothing, this seems like it would have the effect of immediately forcing all the ""sweatshops"" currently in operation to revamp their factories, improving safety and work standards and whatnot.  It also seems like it would avoid the problem of regulation coming from the host country, since that tends to increase the cost of doing business and thus incentivizes capital flight to countries with less regulations and lower standards; since the regulation is on the demand-side, and not the supply-side, companies won't be able to lower the standard of work below a certain level.  

Are there any negatives that I am missing?  Would some dynamic come into play that removes the incentive for investment into developing nations, creating job losses and whatnot?

Amongst fellow young adults around my age (21), there is actually a surprisingly low amount of car ownership. My own story - I don't need a car, nor do I want the expenses associated with a car. I plan on buying a small, ultra-efficient motorised scooter to do the 8 mile journey to get me to-and-from work. Low taxes, low fuel cost, low insurance, and I can breeze through traffic jams.

Even more so - won't we eventually reach a point where we simply don't have enough jobs? Each individual person will get more and more productive, but we're already reaching a point where we consume an immense amount of resources.

My newest book, [The Rationality of War](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Theory-101-Rationality-ebook/dp/B008X12GIW/ref=pd_sim_kstore_1), uses game theoretical models to explain why states are peaceful most of the time but violent the rest of the time.

During the day, I am a PhD student in international relations and formal modeling at [University of Rochester's Department of Political Science](http://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/). I am in the early stages of writing a dissertation explaining how bargaining prompts most states to forgo the development of nuclear weapons. The ongoing situation with Iran pushed me in this direction.

I also like to do some sports research when I have a chance. Here's a recent article on [the game theory of breaking balls](http://wjspaniel.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/breakingballsfinal.pdf) published in SABR's journal, and here's a working paper that explains [the timing of contract extensions](http://wjspaniel.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/new-working-paper-risk-aversion-in-sports-contract-negotiations/).

I also cleaned up the language slightly in case this sub wasn't into slang terms.)

I'm curious how much of our turn-ons and desires and attitudes towards sex are social, and how much is innate. I was reading about a man who had never seen a woman in his life:

&gt; Another clue to the monks' attitude to women is provided by the writings of Robert Curzon, an English traveller who visited Athos in the 1840s. On his wanderings around the monasteries, Curzon came across a man who had been left as a foundling on the peninsula, and thereafter been brought up by the monks. This experience meant the man had spent all his life in Athos, and therefore had no idea what women looked like. The only idea of the female body that the man possessed was derived from icons of the Blessed Virgin. Perhaps that is why the man asked Curzon if all women had haloes.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jun/17/gender.uk

&gt; Another experiment with monkeys who were brought up without mothers found them lacking in maternal behavior toward their own offspring. A similar study showed that monkeys brought up without other monkeys of the opposite sex had no interest in mating-all of which suggests that both mothering and mating behavior are learned, not instinctual.

http://jackiewhiting.net/collab/exploratory/motherhood.htm

What kind of effect do you think it would have on a person's sexuality to be isolated from the opposite sex? Would it affect someone's orientation? Would it change how strong their sex drive is?

Would a straight man who had never seen a woman before get erect if he saw a naked woman as an adult?

Would he want to have sex with her?

Would he be turned on by or interested in the sight and smell of her sexual organs?

Would he instinctively know how intercourse worked?

He'd probably figure out that rubbing his sex organs felt good. Would he think about any fantasies while he did so? Would he come up with the idea of a female body without ever seeing one?

Would he be more likely to be attracted to men, or to sexually experiment with them? Would he be more likely to be asexual?

What if he were gay? Would he grow up thinking that everyone was gay? Would he think that was the only way things could be?

And same questions for a woman who had never seen men before.

I know this is all speculative, but I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance for your help. I've been thinking about this topic a lot recently and some solid info rather than my own philosophizing would be awesome.

My question is thus: It seems to me that moreso now than ever, mental health issues are very 'clinicized'. Depression is 'a chemical imbalance in the brain' and requires medication, etc etc. How exactly can we determine one rate of serotonin absorption as 'better' than any other? Obviously the symptoms of depression are pretty punishing and negative, but isn't it presumptuous to discount sociological/environmental factors and just drug people up?

Many people with depression that I have known, often talk about the political and social factors that they believe have made them depressed. Is there any way to objectively say that they *should* be able to cope with what is going on in society moreso than they can? Starving AIDS and malaria-riddled orphans in Africa for instance. Is it really *unhealthy* for that to be something which can make someone feel that life is worthless? When I talk to people with and without depression about the sorts of issues facing humanity, the people without depression tend to say that they 'don't think about it' and the people with depression get eaten up about them. It seems evolutionarily advantageous for people to focus on their own lives rather than getting miserable about the things going on around them.

An analogy. Imagine that depression is akin to lefthandedness. It is a variation, rather than an illness. We don't treat it per se, and yet it can have a pretty considerable impact on the way someone writes. Smudginess, reduced legibility, and things of that nature (in the analogy, symptoms of depression). Things which, in cultures where people write from right to left, are not issues. Is there any way we can definitively say that it is the handedness which is the problem, and not the writing direction?

I wrote the following quote a week ago in a discussion here on reddit but it has bugged me ever since. Is my stance on terrorism actually supported by academia or am I completely wrong in my beliefs? 

The quote, slightly edited: ""The whole point of terrorism is to disrupt the normal function of society and to create fear. The terrorist has an agenda with a political goal. In the case of al Qaida the goal is to radicalise the sunni population in order to get closer to their ultimate goal of creating a new califat based on islamist ideals. The act of terror against America is ment to provoke a strong and violent response wich in turn will help to sever any positive connections between America and the Islamic nations. The violent response from the US is therefore expected and even desired in order to create a common and external enemy that will weaken the position of moderate Muslims and undermine the authority of western friendly governments in the Islamic world.""

2: Women can feel comfortable being naked in front of each other, commenting on each other's body parts, and may act in ways that would appear gay if done by men.  
3: Women seem to be more likely to be bisexual, or at least experiment with their sexuality. Most arguments I've heard on this revolve around environment (our culture is more tolerant of lesbians than they are of gay men), but there could be a biological component to this instead.

And then there's the question of whether it's a modern phenomenon or not.  When did prison rape get noticed by authorities?  Was it prevalent before the 20th century, when Christianity would have had a stronger influence on prisoners' conduct?

1. More suburbanization, since commuting becomes less onerous.
1. Traffic fatalities drop.
1. Fuel prices rise slightly.
1. Driving manually becomes socially unacceptable in some circles because it's dangerous, and becomes associated with poverty.
1. Nightclubs boom: people who previously couldn't endulge because they had to drive (people who live in the suburbs or who don't live on bus lines) can now get drunk and get home safely (even sleeping in the car!).
1. Quality of life for the elderly and disabled goes way up.

Considering the successes of Nazi propaganda, the cultural grip Hitler had on his people, and the overwhelming popularity of the regime, did the German language maintain any of these linguistic transformations after the war?

For Marx, class is a shared relationship to the means of production i.e. something work-related, not income-related.

Whenever I've watched documentaries on prisons it looks like some of the biggest prison problems have to do (at least partially)with having such a large society of people confined together. 

I'm not talking about overcrowding, but pure numbers. If we had prisons of let's say 10 people together who ONLY deal with each other, wouldn't that fix a lot of the gang, race and violence problems.

Obviously it would be very expensive to just have a prison of 5-10 inmates, but I'm thinking about blocking them off into sections and having them eat, exercise and ONLY meet each other so each section is not accessible to another section. There would have to be some changes but I believe it would be possible. The dynamic of 10 people is entirely different from a society of people. My thought is that the violence, gang issues and race problems would be less of a factor. Also, it would be much more difficult for any prisoner to control the prison population.

Have there been any studies on this? Any thoughts?

I've noticed there are some posters here with economic flair and I wanted to avoid political leanings as much as possible (**science**).  This almost seems impossible with economics today so why I posted here.

[Here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QPKKQnijnsM)

Here's are the basic claims in text format:

* Harvard surveyed 5,000 Americans (My believed to be [Source PDF!](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf))
* Wealth of USA 54 Trillion in 2009  
* Top 1% of Americans have 40% of the wealth (defined?) 
* Bottom 80% have 7% of the wealth 
* Top 1% take home 24% income *Today* while 1976 it was 9%  
* Top 1% own 50% of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds  
* Bottom 50% own 0.5% stocks, bonds and mutual funds 
* The CEO (assumed average) makes 380 times the average worker's pay

However, this leaves me just addled and not feeling empowered with scientific merit as to what to really think about the video (I do think its biased now, but I don't know *HOW* biased).

Let me also appeal to why this is important.  I'm generation ""x"", and I feel especially responsible to be aware.  That is I know the common Reddit demographic is under a huge strain in the USA and is very partial to this type of information.  In short, I'm really in tune at how the various generations think and I'm trying to communicate to my fellow generation as concisely as possible through this video.

However, they just see the flaws and dismiss it...

**TL;DR  I currently believe there is more than a kernel of truth in this video but can't convey that without science.  Am I wrong?**

defined as the total value of everything someone owns minus
any debt that he or she owes. A person’s net worth includes his

as property, stocks, bonds, art, collections, etc., minus the value
of things like loans and mortgages.

1348573641.0,39,self.AskSocialScience,10g1ih,Will the children born today write by hand and own (physical) books when they grow up?,55,16,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/10g1ih/will_the_children_born_today_write_by_hand_and/,"So, we had a bit of an interesting debate around the lunch table at work today, about the impact that technology in general and iPads and the like in particular is having and will have on those growing up today. During this discussion, a colleague of mine made the following claims:

- Children born today won't really learn to write by hand, since they'll never have reason to do so, and will exclusively type as adults.
- Amongst children born today having one bookcase full with books in your home when you are in your 20s-30s will be a rarity. 
- Public libraries will disappear rather rapidly because no-one will read printed books anymore but simply use electronic readers.

Now, we didn't have time to go into it in detail, but his stance seemed to be based mostly on the idea that electronic tools like this are more practical and now widely available and that there simply won't be a reason to keep writing by hand and reading printed books.


Although I do think that electronic readers and the like will have a big impact on people's reading habits, I felt his claims were rather rash on the following grounds:

- Technology changes things, but not always as quickly as people predict. When I was a kid and computers had just become/were just becoming a common household object everyone was on about ""the paper-free office"" which was bound to soon become a reality. As an administrator, I can verify that very large amounts of papers are still being shuffled around offices.

- Electronics of this sort are only affordable (or at least, affordable on a scale where each child in a family has their own  in addition to those owned by the parents) to certain demographics in certain societies (that is, financially stable people in industrial societies). This still leaves many, many people depending wholly or partially on ""old school"" pen and paper, and it seems to be that a complete switch would only be plausible if it effected an entire society. I feel that affordability will remain an issue for quite some time, even if prices are bound to decrease gradually.

- Electricity is fickle. My own country has very stable electricity and generally good internet coverage, but blackouts still do happen occasionally. Additionally, leaving your charger at the house by accident happens so unless battery life goes up a LOT or public charging stations or somesuch become widely available, it's still likely that people would occasionally end up in situations were scribbling something on a piece of paper will be the best/only way of leaving someone a message or retaining information or a reminder to yourself.

- It seems to me that most kids are introduced to pens/pencils not by writing but by drawing! Although drawing on electronic mediums can be fun for users of all ages, but drawing with pen and paper strikes me as stimulating in a different way (physically selecting colors, being able to cut and paste and get the whole 3D thing that you can't get on a screen). Additionally, even while drawing on a tablet, most people (in my experience anyway) still use a stylus which, let's face it, is basically a pen so even a child growing up in a crayon-free house would be somewhat accustomed to the mechanics of working a pen/pencil.

- Practicality/durability. Tablets and the like can probably be great tools for learning and entertainment for kids, if used right, but they simply cannot take the same abuse (at the same cost) as a plain piece of paper or a kids' books (I'm thinking particularly of those cardboard books for young toddlers who don't yet read). In order for something to replace pen and paper for kids, I think it would need to be possible to be used without parental supervision or perhaps rather, with intermittent parental supervision. Although electronics seems to gradually be getting more durable, I have a feeling that it'll be a long time before a tablet can be drooled on, dropped, bitten, flung across the room, ripped at and juggled with at as low a cost (and as low a risk of personal injury) as a sheet of paper can. 

- And, lastly, that human behavior to such a large part is transmitted down through the generations. Even if a 20-something 30 years from now wouldn't have any *practical* reason to write by hand and read paper books, they would still have parents, relatives, teachers, bosses etc who were doing it and chances are that would mean that they would've learned to do it too. For this reason, if non-electronic text ever falls completely out of fashion, I think it will take a lot longer than the time it'll take for children being born today to grow up.



Okay, sorry for that little wall of text, I got a tad carried away! What I wanted to ask you kind and knowledgeable people is: what do you think about these arguments (on both sides)? Will people stop writing by hand? Will books become an entirely electronic thing? And, if so, what sort of time-span are we talking about here? Really I'm just curious about the topic in general, whether any studies have been made on it so far and what the predictions of those in relevant fields are on the topic?

It seems to me, with every economic downturn economists and politicians point to the declining economic growth as the culprit. For some reason, big problems arise when the economy stops growing. For some reason, our societies seem to be built around the certainty that our economies, our populations and our resources will keep on growing in the future.

For example, if 2 workers are needed to support 1 retiree on social security, that means that those 2 will eventually need 4 workers, and those 4 will need 8 workers, etc., meaning that this system works as long as the population grows. (The actual rate seems to be closer to 3:1 in the US.)


I just don't understand. How is this not a system that is doomed to fail when it stops growing, like a pyramid scheme? 
Is an economy with zero growth sustainable? If so, why aren't we preparing for that, instead of trying to prop up economic growth with spending?

1338387358.0,44,self.AskSocialScience,uc49w,"I live between two cultures and recently tried to explain to a friend why Eastern European women to him (and many other West men&amp;women) appear to be ""sluts"" and he did not understand a word I was saying. Let's talk human sexual behavior.",68,24,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/uc49w/i_live_between_two_cultures_and_recently_tried_to/,"This post might be a bit simplistic but I'd like to hear the opinions of people with more than simplistic knowledge in the matter. I'm from Eastern Europe (EE) but I live in Western Europe (WE). Living between the two culturally similar but often times very different entities has given me a lot of room to compare and maybe have a more intricate level of understanding of the cultures.

For those who do not know there's a stereotype that women from EE are a lot more promiscuous than WE women. It's a very persistent stereotype throughout both cultural circles with some EE people taking pride on some level and others using it as self-criticism.

A WE friend of mine recently made a comment about an EE girl we know as being ""pretty hot but a total slut"". I know her and her friends and I've been going out with them quite a lot and I never got the impression of her being ""morally loose and cheaply promiscuous"". What I tried to explain to him was that for me it was behavior within what could be considered normal for a 22 year old in the context of people engaging in clubbing. I tried to dwell deeper into how I understand it:

She is acting out her own sexuality the same freaking way anyone with a sexuality is. She is very much above average attractive and confident and she shows it - that is her sexuality, strongly attracting him in the way, and he interprets that as ""slut"" because he feels his own attractiveness and confidence come under attack if not from her then from other potential competitors. 

His theory was I couldn't see it because I'm also from EE but she probably sleeps with anyone willing to. I know this is not true first hand[.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/619/Untitled-1.jpg) She might be dressed in revealing outfits and sometimes dance in a very erotic way, teasing but as soon as someone starts touching and going over the line she stops and sends them off. I've never seen her be any different in typical club flirting and pre-relationship courtship than WE girls, same age and context. But the question remains: why are EE girls stamped as ""sluts""? My theory is just that some EE girls just like some WE girls are just acting out their sexuality in a more aggressive way with alpha-female confidence but because there is a strong ""us vs. them"" mentality when you know they are foreign women they sort of stand out.

After this he thought I'm calling him out as a bigoted sexist and blamed me of being too political.

Could I be right? Aren't we all trying to show off our attractiveness and act out our sexuality?

1369687744.0,41,self.AskSocialScience,1f5ohy,[Meta] Can our verified social scientists put some of their credentials on the sidebar?,52,11,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1f5ohy/meta_can_our_verified_social_scientists_put_some/,"I've been a subscriber to r/asksocialscience for a about four or five months now and on a number of occasions I have seen some really questionable posts from ""verified"" social scientists on this subreddit.  I was prompted to post this after reading a comment  by a flared user that was completely devoid of any semblance of scholarly integrity, it was full of profanity and hyperbole, and it was blatantly wrong and baseless.  It has since been deleted so I can't link it but the point is that it's not the first time that I've seen something like this, and I'm sure others have seen this as well.  

I have a Bachelors degree in a social science field and I do not feel qualified to answer some of the questions that are pertinent to my field, yet I feel that there are verified users on this subreddit who are less qualified than I and still answering those very questions.  

I'm not asking for a CV on the sidebar or a photocopy of a diploma or anything too extreme (I'm sure the mods have a good success rate at weeding out the frauds who apply for verification).  But I would like to see at least a bit of background info so I can know what kind of experience the person has in the field that my question pertains to.   

I'm not asking for anything that would help to identify people in real life.  

I would like to see what kind of qualifications experts have on the issues and who exactly is equipped to be answering specific questions.  I think there is a huge difference between someone flared in anthropology who has a PhD in the field and someone with the same anthropology flair who graduated with a BA and now works in the private sector.  I'm not saying that one is necessarily better than the other, as each offers their own unique perspective, but if I ask a question about interpreting the findings of X author, I'm going to be far more inclined to listen to the person with the PhD who has undoubtedly spent their adult life familiarizing themselves with the extant literature.  

I feel that this subreddit has the potential to be a refuge from the inanity of r/politics, and the rest of Reddit in general, and maybe this step towards a little more transparency could be beneficial (transparency=accountability)?  There are some excellent flared users here who consistently post informed, well-articulated and well-cited responses to questions, and I think it's unfair that they are lumped in with those who make posts regarding topics that they frankly aren't qualified to answer.  

TL;DR: I envision this as entirely optional and currently flared users could post whatever they would feel comfortable with on the sidebar whether it be a CV or something as simple as ""four-year degree, private sector"".  I'm not asking for the mods to post peoples information without their consent.  But I would like to see some of the credentials of some of those who consider themselves to be social scientists.

Edit: This need not only be what level of degree an individual has obtained as that's not always indicative of what they actually know - a lot of people are getting hung up on that.  When I say credentials I mean the things that make them qualified to answer a question about say the social impact of malaria whether it's extensive NGO work in Africa, research expertise, a PhD in economic development, or some other factor - each has their own unique and valid perspective.

**Background:** Currently, physical copies of console games can be bought and resold at will without restrictions, just like most CDs and DVDs. This will not be the case for games on the new Xbox One system. Physical discs will be tied to user accounts, and users must pay a fee to transfer them — or, more accurately, must pay a fee to play a disc once it's been transferred. As anyone who subscribes to /r/gaming knows, the gaming community is not happy about this.

**My question:** From an economics standpoint, wouldn't the apparently consumer-harming effects of this change be offset by lower prices in a market equilibrium? (I am not a trained economist, so I am genuinely curious to hear the opinions of those who are.)

Let me make what I'm saying a bit more concrete. Right now, when I buy a new game for $60, I know that I will be able to recoup some of that cost in resale value if I choose to sell back the game. If there were no resale market, there would be some games I'm no longer willing to pay $60 for new.

Even more straightforwardly, if I had to pay a fee of, say, $10 (Microsoft hasn't announced the actual amount yet) to transfer ownership of a used game copy, shouldn't used game prices decrease by $10?

To be clear, I don't doubt that the change in the sales model is going to induce *some* transfer of surplus away from consumers and game resellers, and toward game manufacturers. I just wonder if there's any good economic reason to believe that this will be as large as most gamers fear, given that prices ought to adjust downward in response to the change.",,False,,t5_2sml9,False,,,True,t3_1f5jx6,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1f5jx6/video_game_pricing_and_the_xbox_one_controversy/,

The school was in the lower midwest, approximately 10 miles from the Mississippi River and 100 miles down river from the closest city, St. Louis.  The following is a sampling of some of the names of my black classmates and kids a few years older and younger:  

* Benisha and Venisha (sisters)
* Shacairy
* DeAndre
* Lashonda 
* Juwan
* LaWonda
* Clatrice
* Patrice
* Iyesha 
* LaQuansa

There were kids with typical white names, but they were the exception.  Boys tended to have more typically ""white"" names, but often had what I think to as retro-names . . . Fred, Marvin, Carl, Maurice.

I always figured this was how black American naming had always been until I met their parents who had what would be considered standard white American names (Emma, Michael, Martin, Gary).  I have read that the civil rights movement and black nationalism helped to spark this change, but I am interested in knowing more, and want to know exactly why and how this change happened so quickly (within 10 years or so).

Now that I have moved from my hometown to a much more affluent part of the country, I notice much less of a distinction, maybe geography and economics plays a role.

Disclaimer: I know that any question about race is always a difficult one to put forward and to answer.  I do not mean any offense.

By 2000, it was barely 1%, even though that 1% produces more than enough food for the rest of us. Various technological advances have allowed a small number of workers to do the work of many.

Virtually all occupations related to the production of goods are in decline since their peak, as a percentage of the population. You don't need fifty guys with pickaxes in a mine when one guy with a remote controlled drill can do the same work in less time. And service jobs are threatened as well: you don't need 12 cashiers if you have 12 self-checkout aisles.

The trend looks to continue into the future. Right at this moment, Google has cars driving themselves on public streets (albeit with humans as backups). In twenty years will we still need bus and taxi drivers?

From the 50,000 foot view, this looks fantastic. Six day weekends for everyone! All tedious jobs handled by robots!

Unfortunately, if you replace your bus drivers with a fleet of robots, you have a very efficient transportation system but now those drivers can't afford the fare because their job is gone. 

Historically, we've been pretty adept at creating new jobs to fill in the gaps. But there's no economic law that says this will always be the case. As technology reduces the need for simple labor, the remaining jobs will require increased specialization and longer learning curves. The unemployed bus driver cannot become a ""robot bus driver mechanic"" in a month, and even if she could, there won't be enough of those jobs to go around.

While the dehumanization of the enemy certainly facilitates killing, these two works, among others in similar veins, establish two schools of thought that cannot both be correct.

 In the  case of countries like  Qaddafi era  Libya, present day  Syria, Shah-era Iran and Baathist Iraq one could say that this reflected  the will of  their respective   dictatorships.

 But even in relatively democratic nations like Turkey or not democratic but less autocratic nations like Jordan Egypt and Algeria there is a long history of the armed forces siding with secularist elements within the nation and opposing Islamists. 

Why is that? 

From an American perspective this seems odd, since the armed forces in the United States are substantially   more religious and socially conservative than the population as a whole, and I am under the impression this is also the case in other western nations like the UK and France... 

so why is the opposite the case in the above mentioned nations?  This further strikes me as odd since the  "" historical enemy"" of most Middle Eastern nations for the last 60 years has been Israel... and the strong religious elements underpinning that conflict would, one would think, make the armed forces of nations  opposed to Israel magnets for religious fanatics... but that doesn't seem to be the case, especially among the higher officials ( whereas again, in the United States,  the high brass is more religious and more conservative than the  enlisted base) ... why is that?",,False,,t5_2sml9,False,,,True,t3_1kdpc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1kdpc9/political_scienceinternational_relationshistory/,

It's only $456.25 a year! On top of that, the $1.25/day threshold counts all consumption, while the Census Bureau's only counts after-tax income. The World Bank keeps track of the $1.25/day poverty rate for developing countries, but not for developed countries, probably because it's very rare for someone to live on less than that after government transfers and charity. How could I estimate how many people actually live on so little? Right now, I don't even know whether it's more like 100 (0.000031%) or 100,000 (0.031%) people in the US.

The question only makes sense if it's possible to consume only $1.25/day without starving to death (remember that any food given to you is counted in the $1.25/day). It might be possible - for example, you can get 4500 calories of pre-cooked oats from Walmart for $3.18, so that's 1769 calories a day - enough for a small sedentary person living in a warm area. Add a multivitamin pill (a few cents) and some occasional other food, and you can probably avoid dying. It's a pretty ridiculous example, but I just wanted to show that it's not obviously impossible to survive with so little, so that the question isn't meaningless.

EDIT: the point of this question was to estimate how many live this way, not how to discuss the minimum cost of living.

&gt;31% of the boys and 32% of the girls said it was acceptable for a man to rape a woman with past sexual experience;

&gt;87% of boys and 79% of girls said sexual assault was acceptable if the man and the woman were married;

&gt;65% of the boys and 47% of the girls said it was acceptable for a boy to rape a girl if they had been dating for more than six months.

The cite given for those stats is *5. White, Jacqueline W. and John A. Humphrey. ""Young People's Attitudes Toward Acquaintance Rape."" Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden crime."" John Wiley and Sons, 1991.*

So, /r/AskSocialScience, what *is* the deal with these stats? Did the authors play some clever word games to manipulate via statistics? Or is our society really *that* fucked up when it comes to knowing the boundaries of what is and isn't rape?

When you consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will understand better how [people used to think about political power] – Question Inside.",50,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1bul56/political_dynasties_have_disappeared_but_economic/,"The quote is from A History of Western Philosophy, by Bertrand Russel, chapter XIV, Locke's Political Philosophy. Here is a more expanded version of it.

&gt; The hereditary principle has almost vanished from politics. During my lifetime, the emperors of Brazil, China, Russia, Germany, and Austria have disappeared, to be replaced by dictators who do not aim at the foundation of a hereditary dynasty. ... Political dynasties have disappeared, but economic dynasties survive. ... When you consider how natural it seems to us that the power over the lives of others resulting from great wealth should be hereditary, you will understand better how men like Sir Robert Filmer could take the same view as regards the power of kings, and how important was the innovation represented by men who thought as Locke did. -- Bertrand Russel

It got me thinking about removing the hereditary principle from the economic sphere. That is to say, not allowing the super wealthy to leave their children hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Would you support such a policy?

Please avoid intellectual laziness. This isn't a poll. State your reasons and how you came to such conclusions. If you haven't reached a conclusion please state any merits or demerits that you see if they haven't been stated already.

I've yet to form a conclusion but I have put some thought into the issue.

The first thought is that any system to limit economic heredity wouldn't be a perfect system. Much like the economic system we have today isn't perfect. I don't believe a lack of perfection is any grounds to reject a system, especially if the system is an improvement over its predecessor.

Second, I imagine that a lot of people will state that if a country were to enact such a law then the rich would flee with their money. This is possible. This is an imperfection, a problem. It's a point which requires thought to craft a solution, not a reason to dismiss the idea. Two sets of capital controls would help, one set for countries who also limit economic heredity and one for those who don't.

My third thought is that, it seems to me that it would be fair that parents should be allowed to leave their children a certain percentage of their wealth. It's human nature to want to see your children prosper and it would be easier to implement a policy which works with human nature rather than against it. The proper amount which should be left is debatable, but tying it to median income levels seems to be reasonable.

Fourth, it's quite clear that having wealth will not guarantee that it'll be invested. As a recent [massive investigation into tax havens](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/icij-journalists-expose-mass-web-of-global-tax-evasion-a-892505.html) has revealed, there are a lot of people who don't want to contribute to the society which made them who they are. I'll repeat that last part. They are rich because of the support of their society and do not wish to support those who supported them. The question this raises is, which society will be stronger? The society which shares it's wealth with one another or the society which hoards it in tax havens?

My fifth thought is about how to decide how to allocate such great amounts of money. A budget committee which allocates last years contributions is probably the most fair method. The budget could also be voted on by elected officials. The money could be used to help fund university education or other areas which the private sector neglects, such as [surprisingly profitable space exploration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies) for example.

**My most important thought**

The dissemination of power has proven to be advantageous on most every occasion. Enabling women workers gave us Marie Curie. School girls in Afghanistan have acid thrown in their faces while we benefit from female intellectuals from all walks of life. Liberation from serfdom enabled the mobility of labour allowing cities to grow and become industrial hotspots. Imagine how China would have become the manufacturing powerhouse it is today if it's farmers were legally tied to their plot of land. Finally, the liberation of political power from a monarch or ruling class is another example of how society has benefited from the dissemination of power. When the Church was at it's peak we were gifted with the inquisition. Iran, which is under the power of a religious ruling class is gifted with strict Islamic law. If there were a balance of power it might be more like the Iran we knew in the 70's. There are numerous examples of how the liberation of political power has benefited society. The question is why would economic liberation be different?

Anyways, I have to take off now, I'll check in later for a hopefully good conversation.

I think this is going to take a creative, multi-disciplinary approach, and there will be no ""right"" answer, obviously.

Let's suppose the Redditors in r/Collapse are right (and I know a lot of you may disagree, but this is just a thought experiment). Suppose within the next decade or two, the cumulative effects of the following will be greatly felt across the United States:

* economic depression (due to a confluence of many factors, many already in play)
* demographic changes (migration, racial mix, aging, fertility, finances, crime, obesity, skill sets of ordinary people in the area, etc.)
* epidemiological vulnerabilities (spread, vectors, etc.)
* government no longer be able to provide assistance (debt, default, loss of reserve currency status, IMF, whatever)
* peak cheap petroleum (say, $200/barrel oil, even $300)
* increased religious intolerance in some regions
* social and political polarization
* increase in racial tensions, hate crimes (exacerbated by economic woes)
* increasingly expensive electricity
* increased use of coal for electricity generation and heating
* increased use of wood for heating
* decline in water available for consumption or agricultural use (aquifer depletion, gas well fracking)
* soil fertility (topsoil loss, increasingly expensive fertilizers, pesticides and resistance, etc.)
* potential nuclear power plants issues (Fukushima, Three Mile, Nebraska's Fort Calhoun, San Onofre, etc. - fallout)
* potential break-up of the United States (what kind of areas would have naturally defensible barriers or buffer zones (deserts, rivers, mountains)
* increased crime (gangs, criminal syndicates, corruption)
* decreased social and personal mobility
* navigable rivers, road passability, mineral wealth or landfill mining that can sustain scarcity industrialism and scavenging

If you want to relocate to another part of the United States, with a mind to not just your future but that of your children in the decades and century of challenges to come, where would be some likely candidates.

Again, I don't think there is any right answer. One major area of concern I have is **race and religion**. It has played massive life-and-death roles in the past for people, and likely will again. So what's right for a conservative White Christian family may be different for a gay couple with their adult children, or a Black doctor, or an Asian Buddhist extended family, or a Muslim engineer-turned-farmer, an interracial couple, etc. But I want to get some ideas. To narrow it down, suppose there will be two kinds of places people will look for when considering relocation:

1. A place where most everyone is White and Christian.
2. Multi-cultural/racial and religiously diverse area.

I've looked at a lot of maps of places like USDA growing zones, population density, nuclear plant across the continental U.S., water maps, farmland maps, even demographic make-up, etc. I'd like the input of interested professionals and insightful amateurs. Thank you.

P.S. - If you think this is too broad a topic and want to discuss in more detail with me via private message about my own situation and what I'm looking for, please feel free to do so.

* Companies now will have to increase revenue and increase costs to make the most profit and pay no taxes. Increasing costs would translate as paying more for employees, using higher quality materials, reducing environmental impact etc, all the good stuff
* Companies will reduce price of goods (to get closer to margin cap) this means more demand and more consumption.
* More domestic jobs created because companies don't have to outsource work
* More money to employees, more consumption, faster growth

Edit1:

* Will reduce widening gap between the poor and the rich
* Most employees now earn more thus better quality of life for everyone
* Some companies don't have to fire employees now to increase profits, they can reduce other costs that were there for getting the margin

Why do some people type correctly, with spelling and punctuation present while other people use little/no punctuation and words spelled differently?

I used to think that people who tiped liek dis were younger people but I've seen older people, including adults, who type like that. I also thought perhaps education was a factor but I've seen plenty of instances where educated folks type jumbled messes. My ex-gf's mom, a nurse, once sent me a text that said 'hus fone is dis'. It wasn't a surprise that her daughter typed the same way as her and every now and then, whenever she'd text me, I'd have to reread her texts to figure out what she was saying or ask her to clarify because of the way she spelled things and the lack of punctuation.
On the other end of the spectrum, I know people who dropped out of high school who type correctly.

Are people more inclined to type correctly/incorrectly depending on what they're doing/who they're talking to? I think it's a no-brainer that even people who type hard-to-read sentences on Facebook/Youtube, etc will make an effort to spell correctly and use proper punctuation when writing a paper, for example but when talking to friends on Facebook and such, they'll type 'freely'. Maybe it's due to laziness? Apathy? Or some people think it feels too formal? 

I have a friend who I text often and sometimes it takes me a second to figure out what she's saying. On Facebook, she types normally.

On various websites, you'll come across many different 'typing styles'. On reddit, it seems like almost everyone types/spells correctly and uses proper punction, or at least people generally try to do so. On Youtube and Facebook, you'll probably find a mix of both. Is this due to the target audience/demographics of the sites? Facebook and Youtube seem to appeal to everyone from every walks of life; I think I saw somewhere that most of reddit are 20-somethings that are in college/college-educated.

I frequent a general aviation forum (Pilots of America) and everyone there seems to type/spell correctly.

I always considered it inhumane and unreasonable to think it could be done humanely but my brother disagrees. He says, in theory, it would work very well, making sure our species evolves in the ""best"" way to prevent something like Idiocracy from happening. I think his view of the future of humanity is myopic and doesn't consider the increasing technology that could lead to genetic engineering and/or give way to Kurweil's prediction that we'll all be digital entities. I think we should put value on cultural evolution rather than biological evolution.

He also thinks that people of ""good"" genetics should reproduce more than people of ""bad"" genetics -- not forced, but people should make the choice themselves. I think it's unreasonable to assume we can determine which genes are best for the future of humanity. I think the future is far too chaotic and unpredictable to think we will know what's best for us.

Our argument was inspired by watching X-men 2. He told me he would be on Magneto's side, because they favor allowing mutants to live according to their mutation, e.g., a pyro living as a pyrotechnical, whereas Professor Xavier thinks mutants should simply live side by side non-mutants. All this on the premise that mutants are the next step in human evolution. I respond that evolution is too chaotic to determine what the ""next step"" is.

Also, my brother thinks people shouldn't be forced, but that people should do what they are genetically best at doing. I think this disregards the plasticity of the brain and our choices and skills, the social constructs that influence our social position and mobility, and the effect ecology can have on nurturing our biology.

Just wondering if any undegrad economist regret their choices. I guess I am being more specific towards those who are not going to be a professional economist or academic.

I'm sure you'll agree if you went to a decent university your economics degree must have had some kick ass difficult combination of maths and essay writings and some more. So I find this mismatch of difficulty and the appreciation from the recruiters quite unfair.

Job market wise, you don't need any specific degree for a typical ""analyst"" role. Perhaps the tools you learnt in economics give you more of an analytical mind than others but I don't think its enough to give you an edge. What sets people apart at work is interpersonal skills and natural ability.
But other engineering/science/language degrees holders can still take up these analyst jobs in banks/insurance/accounting companies and at the same time able to go into their degree specific roles. So I feel I am being hard done by the fact that I didn't really learn a unique set of skills or knowledges.

I have worse things to say about those who did business or accounting as a degree. But I think they are the smart ones - they still land the same kind of jobs as economists while cruising through their degree.

I guess it really comes down to viewing your degree as a tool for the job market. Clearly business/accounting students do. But we economists shouldn't.

But how would this happen? And what are the consequences of this?

People in Greece currently have the Euro. Most of them have a job and earned some money. Their bank accounts are filled with Euros. If a state leaves the € currency, you can't just take that away from them, can you?

Say they go back to Drachma. Maybe 500 Drachmas = 1 Euro on the day of the change. People now have their old Euros and earn new Drachmas. All citizens have the same level of wealth as before.

As time changes the Drachma's value declines. 800 Drachmas = 1 Euro. And this could be expected. The citizens with more Euros now become relatively wealthier than before.

1. Most people who support democracy will argue it can only work in a representative form. Direct democracy would largely fail because the general population do not have the correct information/ability to make the correct policy decisions. So, we elect representatives who act on our behalf. Yet, if we cannot trust people to make the right policy choices in a direct democracy, why do we think they will elect the right representatives? Why do we not just ignore representation and go straight to government by specialists? For example, engineers and scientists have a better understanding of climate change than the ordinary man on the street, so why do we entrust policy in the hands of your average person?

2. Self-determination is one of the foundations of democracy. If a nation/ethnicity within a pre-existing country wishes to govern itself, it would be difficult to justify not allowing them to do so. But, if we follow this to its logical conclusion, how far down can we divide the sub-units of a country until self-determination is not justified?

I have never, ever, seen anything like I do in the midwest when it comes to gas prices. Here in Dayton, Ohio and most everywhere else around here (couple hundred mile radius), the gas prices are intensely erratic. Everywhere else I've ever lived, gas prices go up and down by 2-5 cents at a time and usually nothing more. But in the midwest, gas prices spike violently, as much as 30 cents over night and can go up 50-60 cents in a week. 

It makes no sense to me, whatsoever. Here's the kicker, it only happens when Speedway changes their price. Everyone only does what Speedway does. If Speedway goes up, within 2 hours everyone will adjust to match speedway. And the same on the way down. 

You ask where my evidence is? 

http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx?time=24

Go to town. 

Pick almost any two towns from around the country, try putting Colorado Springs, Boston, Jackson, Miami, Salem...Now for your third choice, choose a midwest city. Try Dayton, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Lexington (to a degree), Cleveland, etc. 

Also try changing the scale. Put a city like El Paso and then put Dayton and change it from 2 years to 1 month. Look at the spikes in Dayton vs the very consistent price in El Paso. Change it to 3 months? 6 months? 9 months? 1 year? Always the same thing, every else is small changes over time where as this little patch of the midwest has very large ups and downs that overtime result in an average similar to the whole country. 

So there is this little region in the midwest that has awful gas spikes. The average price over the years is pretty close to the national average, but the day to day is outrageous. Like if you forget to fill up in the morning and have to fill up that afternoon, you can easily end up spending $4 more or so for a tank.

Also note worthy is that the price NEVER falls the way it raises and I mean NEVER. So today the price rose 26 cents. Typically it will not take 7-14 days for that price to fall back to where it was. So it rises instantly and falls gradually. 

And like I said, people only do what Speedway does. It's very weird. I kind of want answers and good ones, because no one in Ohio has ever given me an answer that makes any sort of sense. 

Tl;dr, gas prices in and around Ohio are intensely erractic when compared to the rest of the country. The Average is the same but the day to day swings are much much larger. Also of note, the price is clearly dictated by Speedway, everyone just follows Speedway's price a couple hours after they set it.

While reading, I chanced upon some references to something called a 'cultural turn' in social sciences. While I understand that it refers to a focus on 'culture', I've got some questions.

Wikipedia wasn't the most helpful in helping me understand this. It described it as a “wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences"" which emphasized the ""causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification.”

What exactly does that mean? 

What led to this cultural turn? Why was...whatever that came before it not good enough? Was it some kind of massive philosophical shift or something?

What did it mean for social science? I get that the focus of study changed, but how? Was it a change in how people viewed the world? Did it mean a change in methodology? 

And more importantly, what exactly *is* culture?

On a side note, I've always been interested in geography. Did this cultural turn thing happen there as well? What were the results like?

Myself and the mod-team would like to take the time to hear what you think about the subreddit, how you would improve it, and what you want done. There is one issue in particular though that we feel deserves special attention and that issue is: the flair system. The mods of /r/AskSocialScience are always working hard to improve the subreddit and so we want your input and insight on this important matter.

Presently, we are using a system that requires proof of enrollment or graduation in a specific program that relates to their stated area of expertise. Four options have come to the table that the mod-team is 'decidedly undecided' about:

1. Keep the current system for awarding flair. This involves either e-mailing from a university e-mail, linking to a university directory, providing proof of a degree or proof of enrollment in a university program.

2. Adopt a system similar to that found in /r/AskHistorians and /r/AskScience. We would require 3 (min.) to 5 (max.) properly cited comments in the subreddit that demonstrates expertise in a specific field.

3. Adopt a system that combines options 1 and 2 (comments + proof of degree, enrollment, etc.)

4. Keep the current system and award flair each month to the users with the highest voted comments in a specific field.

This kind of decision inevitably stirs up a very particular kind of comment from both reddit and the real world; that those accused of sexual assault should be anonymous until their guilt or innocence is decided (obviously the implication is that they would remain anonymous if it were found they were innocent unless they chose to reveal their name).

To me, the fact that we *always* have this debate after good news about toughening laws on rape speaks to a really nasty way our society views women - as prone to confusion at best and liars at worst - but there is no reason to assume just because people want a law for the wrong reasons that it is a bad law.

Now I want to be clear that I am asking about *all crimes*, not just rape, although it was a discussion I saw on reddit about sexual assault that triggered this line of thought. It seems many people want the accused to be anonymous in sexual assault cases because the victim is too (and they think it is 'fair'), but I don't agree with this line of reasoning. What I do agree with is that *ceteris parabis* it is better innocent people do not even have the taint of an accusation of eg theft, murder, fraud about them because the rest of our judicial system seems built around the principle of protecting the innocent rather than punishing the guilty at all costs.

So why don't we offer the victim and accused anonymity in all cases (maybe just anonymity from the press since it would probably be impractical otherwise)? What would be the effects if we did? Would there be any effect on the reported or actual rate of crime?

We're considering buying a house (in Houston, it's worth noting) which after that read makes me hesitate. Recently I watched Sal Khan's videos on rent vs buy from just before the bust where he questions the assumption of ""housing always goes up"" from the perspective of the Bay Area. He was right, and that area crashed more spectacularly than others.

In the wake of the bust, I've heard about how in the glut of foreclosed homes and frozen credit, empty homes are being snapped up with cash by investors. My first question is, what is the motivation behind this purchasing spree? As credit thaws, families looking to buy are finding an artificially reduced market size and/or are being undercut by investors paying cash, both placing upward pressure on prices.

Are the investors looking to hold onto the homes as investments to grow in value, despite recent history? Are they renting them in the meantime or are they sitting idle? Will this be fueling a second bubble wherein homes are seeming to be purchased and the market is on the rebound but all that buying is just speculation?

Just found this subreddit after subscribing to /r/economics recently. Both seem great. Since /r/economics doesn't seem to like self posts I wanted to ask here:

Can someone summarize the European debt crisis? 

I'm not totally unaware, I'm an avid news reader and a [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/) fanatic.

We have votes questioning austerity, Spain crumbling, etc. But I just feel like I'm missing a crucial piece of narrative or explanation. 

Why is the debt crisis a crisis and not, say, merely a problem? Is this an issue of monetary union without fiscal union (somewhat covered in this recent [post](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-funniest-graph-ive-ever-seen-about-why-the-euro-is-totally-doomed/256793/) )? What was/is so important about a tiny country like Greece? Will Spain and Italy fall? (And what is the worst case scenario anyway? What is a ""fall""?)

Is the UK safe from many of these issues or is it's economic proximity going to draw it down too?

However, I feel that it also raises a number of questions which I believe could be better answered by some of the members of the subreddit who have a greater grasp of the situation.

1.	Where does the animosity or uneasiness felt by many British citizens towards the EU come from? Is it due to the historical and cultural differences between the island nation and her continental neighbours that drove Churchill to describe Britain as “with Europe, but not of it.” Or is it more to do with the fact that the Thatcher era put Britain on the path of deregulation and liberalization, which some feel is now being threatened by Brussels’ decision to increase the power of the state through pan-European regulations and laws. 

2.	Despite the fact that the EU’s share of world GDP is steady declining due to the strong growth of Asian and BRIC economies; two-way trade between the UK and the EU accounts for approximately 48% of the UK’s total goods and services exports. Now although the EU and the Eurozone remain the UK’s biggest export markets, the UK relies far less on the EU market than the majority of other member states; with only Cyprus and Malta relying less on inter-EU trade. In light of these economic realities, is a unilateral UK exit a realistic option? 

3.	The UK Independence Party has for several years now thrown their support behind the notion of a Commonwealth free trade area as an alternative to British membership in the EU. They state that as the member-states of the Commonwealth handle trade worth $2.8 trillion annually with foreign direct investment outflows of $100 billion, which account for more than 20% of international trade and investment; they should be considered a “very serious” player in the sphere of international trade. Is this policy politically and/or economically achievable, or is it just the daydream of old Empire revivalists?  

4.	Given France’s relative political and economic decline within the EU against Germany, Britain is becoming increasingly important as a balancer against German dominance of European affairs. Why then, are smaller European states, including the pro-free trade northern nations, unwilling to publically support the UK in its bid to repatriate some powers from Brussels in exchange for their continued support of the European project?

Am I missing a much bigger picture by mostly viewing western-centric news sources? 

Is the answer much deeper than: well, it's mostly because the west hasn't had great relations (understatement) with middle eastern cultures, and the imposition of western forces on their lands is creating a breeding ground for religious extremism? and that the outlet for this extremism just happens to be found in Islam, and it probably would've been Hinduism for all we know if that was the main religion of that culture?

&gt;Gentlemen, I am a woman in my late 20s and I truly feel that there is a lot of romance in this article. I also believe that ""love"" is a very complex emotion. I love my family and many of my friends, however I have trouble believing in ""true love,"" that thing that fairy tales are made of. I know that some day I will get married, and I know that it will be a careful, pragmatic decision based of the acceptability of my partner as a parent, however, I also know that I will take into consideration how we get along. I may not end up feeling that ""spark"" of ""true love,"" but loving them as a friend is a must. I would rather have Will than Ross any day of the week!

Love is obviously a complex emotion, but from personal experience I would argue that true, romantic love (beyond the initial infatuation) is like orgasm: when you've felt it, you *know* you've felt it. 

However, I've also encountered many accounts from people (including significantly older people) who seem to be convinced that 'true love' exists in the same realm as Sasquatch and Santa Claus. While I'm aware that sociopaths lack the ability to feel emotionally attached to others, this seems to be much more prevalent among normal, caring individuals then I would at first suspect.

I'm a Bachelor student of Political Science and Law in his third year at a university in Europe. I specialize on International Relations and Security and am currently writing my thesis about the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union.

Because I'm reading quite a lot outside of university about IR, security etc. I sometimes come across references to game theory and how it is apparently also used outside of economics, e.g. for political science. In my courses at uni, game theory was never even mentioned and I recently started worrying if that is a bad thing.

So, wise AskSocialScience community, I turn to you and ask: how relevant is game theory for my specialization and does not knowing it by heart constitute a knowledge gap that I ought to close as fast and thoroughly as possible? And if the answer is yes, where should I start, what are some good resources to read up on game theory in general and its applications for political/social science in particular?

After my Bachelor I plan to go on and pursue a Master's in either IR, international security and/or law. I'm still flexible for my possible career path, but government service or research in academic as well as non-academic institutes are the highest up on the list.

(2) More control over our food supply being a goal worthy of pursuit. 

(3) More abstract arguments like society being more ""connected"" with where its food comes from.

Above all else, the big problem I see with the idea is whether it's even plausible. If we were to eat only what we ate in Canada, we would cut out a lot of things from our diet.

If you've volunteered as an expert, you should already have gotten a message from me about it.  Here's an FAQ:



**Why**

The [subreddit is growing fast](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/p429s/state_of_the_subreddit/).  So far, we have great discussions, and we want to keep it that way as we grow.  A number of users have suggested verification as a way to keep expert comment quality high, and we agree.  



**How**

You can verify either through [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskSocialScience) or gmail (asksocialsciencemods@gmail.com).  Please message/email us with your reddit username, your specialty, and evidence you have a bachelors plus relevant experience or bachelors plus grad school.  A link to a directory with your name as part of the work/university from the work/school email address is great.  A picture of your diploma with your reddit username works as well. 



**But, Credentials Could be Faked!**

Yeah we know, we're trying to raise the amount of work required to fake your way into an expert tag.  


**Other Stuff**

We're going to be adding some more mods to deal with the volume.  Both modmail and the email address - asksocialsciencemods@gmail.com - will be accessible by all of the mods here and we will check whenever we get modmail about verification.  

**Privacy**

 This is important, and we understand ""trust me"" isn't worth the hard drive space it takes up. We will not keep your name in the spreadsheet or anywhere else.  If you verify through modmail, please make sure you can delete whatever form of proof you've submitted, reddit does not allow us to delete modmail messages.  

If you verify through gmail, we will delete (not archive) emails after they've been verified and empty the trash. We'll never save or post your real name anywhere and we will never link it to your reddit account in any way. I can send you a screenshot of the ""all mail"" or ""trash"" from the email account (let me know if you want that). 

That's really all we can do, but if you have ideas on something else we can do, please let us know.   


**Do you Need More Experts?**

Yes!  If you have a bachelors degree + graduate school experience OR bachelors + relevant work experience, we'd be glad to have you.  Just email us at asksocialsciencemods@gmail.com with your username, field (see sidebar), and a brief specialty.  Be sure to include a directory listing for verification (see above).



**I'm Done Volunteering as an Expert**

If you want out, we're sorry to see you go, but we understand revealing personal information is risky.  To make things easier for you, you don't have to do anything, we will remove flair from any unverified experts after a few weeks.  

**Questions?  Comments?  Feedback?  Hate the idea?  Love the idea?  Let us know!**

When the Fed first started quantitative easing, someone told me that the US must be really desperate if they're having to print money. I tended to agree, thinking that ""printing money"" meant the government was funding its spending through the printing press because I naturally associated ""printing money"" with Weimar and Zimbabwe. And of course I was wrong.

Then I tried to educate myself about the topic, and realized the creation process was done through computers, and that the US government was not funding its deficit through the Fed. But I still wondered who exactly was gaining from the process. Who decides who gets richer from this money creation?

Finally I realized the Fed is creating liquidity and not wealth, as the bond and security purchases are done in secondary markets where the instrument-holder sells the instrument in exchange for the newly-created money. They give up something and gain something of equal value (though perhaps this is not true of mortgage backed securities?) I hope my current view basically reflects reality.

My question: does anyone know how well your average person understands the term ""printing money"" and its process? Is some view similar to that described in my first or second paragraph common? If so I wonder if it isn't a failure of communication on the behalf of economists to allow the phrases to become associated. Quantitative easing as I understand it now seems a completely reasonable policy. In the past I thought it was crank economics.

At the end of FY 2013 everyone submits a tax return that lists their gross income, etc. The tax rates are set so that the tax revenue equals the deficit from the previous year (minus any payments already made through excise, etc), payments/refunds are calculated and bills/checks sent out. Taxes (income, interest, etc) are assessed throughout the year based on the last rate calculated. If the economy improves, people get money back. If it gets worse, people pay more.

Additionally, the tax rates would still be graduated, but each tax bracket would be responsible for a particular portion of the deficit. Everyone making under $10k, for example, must collectively pay 10% of the deficit, so the calculation becomes (deficit * 10%) / (sum of gross income minus deductions/exemptions) = tax rate.

Some amount of borrowing would be allowed, but it would be limited to a specific % of GDP each year instead of ""whatever the difference is"".

This way, the argument isn't what tax rate would finance our spending but rather what spending we could afford or would lower the tax rate.

I have gotten the impression - though I am by no means sure about it - that this is the case in the entire English speaking world. In mainland Europe though I think exam questions tend to be a lot more specific and a lot less open ended and there is no choice in questions: you have to answer everything.

I would love to hear the thoughts of someone more knowledgeable than myself.

My understanding so far: Populations are divided into neighborhoods of roughly 20-250 people (small enough that the participants know one another), who elect neighborhood representatives each year by secret ballot based on their personal assessment of their characters and leadership abilities. Those representative go to the district council and elect district representatives, who go up to the next tier and so on up to the national level.

There is a lot more to it of course, so if you decide to read up on it yourself, chapter 1 describes how decisions might be made in a hypothetical society using this method, and chapter 2 outlines the problems with our current system (such as the inabiliity of a two party system to provide true representation).

I'm not referring to how actual Communist countries worked, I more or less understand that. I'm referring to the ideas from Marx before the Soviet Union was founded, though latter ideas would be acceptable too.

I'm trying to understand how Communism would work along these lines: in a Monarchy the King, who is the eldest son of the previous King, is in charge of the country. He has absolute authority to make laws, appoint officials, draft an army, judge and punish criminals, and collect taxes as he sees fit.

In a Pure Democracy the whole population is votes on each law, and those laws are used to appoint officials, determine taxes, set punishment for cimes, declare war, and even determine the procedure for making new laws.

I can describe other forms of government similarly, but I cannot do so for Communism. I know that Communism is a classless society, and resources are distributed according the principle of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"". But how is it decided what one's ability requires him to produce and similarly how is it decided what one's needs entitles him to? What mechanism is used to distribute resources in this fashion? How would justice be handled? (Can you steal if their is no private property?) How would the country interact with other countries, for example reach trade agreements or go to war?

**Edit:** It has been pointed out Communism may be more of an econmic system rather than a system of government but my question still remains, I don't understand how it functions as an economic system either.

Other parts of Communism that people talk about a lot for example the ""proletarian rising up against the Bourgeoisie"" and ""seizing control of the means of production"" appear to me to be irrelevant to how Communism would actually work because this would only happen once. A society where the proletarian are constantly rising up against the Bourgeoisie makes no sense. Am I correct about this?

Or maybe I can just handle pain well. I've had 3 healthcare incidents:

- The first time I was sent home with a broken collar bone (undiagnosed). Horrific pain for the next few days and I even did things like play football. Makes me sick just thinking about that incident, actually.

- The second time I was nearly sent home with a boxer's fracture, the doctor said it was nothing, the only reason it was diagnosed was because my father actually said to the doctor: ""really? I could have sworn it was a boxer's fracture"", and the doctor said ""oh yes that's probably it, I'll get you an x-ray"".

- The third time I fractured my skull and a paramedic made me walk home 2 miles telling me it was nothing. Again after a night of agony, I spent 2 weeks in hospital.

So that's 3 times I've been horrifically undiagnosed. I've learned from my mistakes - the next time anything happens to me I'm going to exaggerate the pain in an effort to make doctors take me seriously. 

But that gets me thinking, isn't there a game theory analysis for this kind of situation? I mean if everyone exaggerates then the net effect will be zero, surely. Does there exist a ""race to the bottom"" of exaggerating your condition in terms of health service?

So my question is what was the big deal about marginal utility? From the wikipedia article it seems that the main thing is that you look at the individual units at the margins instead of the product as a whole. Why is this so much more useful than just saying subjective utility determines prices? Whats the big deal about the ""marginal unit""? And why did this change economics so much?

Well, I notice economics becomes much more mathematical after Jevons, so is the main thing that it becomes easier to apply concrete mathematical calculus and quantification to economics?

There was enough interest for me to get it started, but due to my own busy schedule and an issue with a previous account here I could not continue it. Now things have settled and I figured I would try it again.

Oxford University's All Souls College (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford) is a relatively prestigious institution which is said to have one of the most difficult exams for entry. You are welcome to read more about the college itself, but it does not matter much for this exercise. 

The college posts their ""papers"" (exams) from previous years to help applicants study and for general interest. There are eight topic areas covered: Classics, Economics, English, General Papers, History, Law, Philosophy, and Politics (http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/content/Past_Papers).

What I propose is that a group of us get together to answer and discuss some of these questions. Depending on the amount of interest, we could potentially start a subreddit. There are a lot of questions in each category and what I did last time was assign each its own number and then used an integer generator to select the questions randomly. This is a flexible framework, but we could allow maybe 3-4 days for everyone to post their replies without any feedback and then open it up for discussion and debate for the rest of the week and then rinse and repeat. Again, this is not a set framework and if one questions becomes particularly interesting then we could obviously extend discussion times appropriately.  

Personally, I am no expert whatsoever in any of these areas. This was something a friend and I did when we were in graduate school just to keep our brains working during academically dull periods of time. This is also obviously an exam from a British higher education institution, so if you are not British like myself then it may require us to conduct some light research.

We can discuss further details should there be interest. If interest, just respond here or send a PM.",,False,,t5_2sml9,False,,,True,t3_1bx6cu,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/1bx6cu/oxfords_all_souls_learning_experience/,

I got this question from an interaction I had with a couple of stores yesterday.

I was looking to buy some protein powder to make healthy shakes for me at home.  I went to the local GNC  (can I call out companies like this?) to look at some of their stock.  I found an appropriate product at 92.99 for 5 pounds, which seems on the steep side.  I whip out my phone and check Amazon. and find the same SKU for 53.99.

My understanding of the situation is that Amazon is a much larger company and with no brick and mortar presence.  This enables them to absorb the overhead to a greater degree and offer lower prices well continuing to remain profitable.  The large price difference seems out of place though.

Finally, I was referred to a local store, that offers the same SKU at 54.99, just barely more than Amazon.  To my knowledge this is not a chain, and my understanding is that smaller businesses are less able to absorb the cost of overhead and therefore have to slightly markup items to remain profitable.

So, my question is the relation between these three prices.  Does this spread make sense, or is GNC charging way too much, or is the local chain not charging enough to remain in the black.

I would like to know what would happen in a world where the price of products is determined by the time it takes to produce them. For the sake of simplicity, let us imagine that the traders cannot change the price of items, they are really only worth the amount of time it took to make them. To clarify, ""time"" is not actually traded, but the currency would allow people to buy and sell things worth a certain amount of time. Thus, the currency would be valued by time, like a bill of 5 hours, or coins of 10 minutes.

The idea that struck me was that I thought this might be a good representation of their worth. Also, I'd imagine that (although I'm not sure how) people wouldn't gain or loose a lot of money, it would balance out, as their daily earnings would cancel with their cost of living. Then I thought about if there would be profit, or if there even could be.

A few examples:

* Following 9/11, the increases in authority by the US police and security organizations will inevitably have a negative impact on personal liberties and freedom.

* By banning firearms magazines greater than 20 rounds, what is to stop further restrictions down to 15 rounds?  Or 10?

* When you start giving people free housing, free money, free food, then what is stopping you from giving them free education, healthcare, etc.?

It appears to me that one should acknowledge the potential long-term path certain policy decisions may end up taking.  Other concepts, like the Overton Window come into play, where one can push the limit of public policies until they become acceptable, are perfect examples of 'moving goalposts' in terms of policy reach and scope.

An example for this is: Today, the TSA is quite a common sight at airports and publicly acceptable (much to the chagrin of Reddit), which allows for the expansion of TSA presence into train and bus stations, further increasing the reach and scope of the organization.  Once this becomes commonplace, then the TSA will expand further and further.

As a freedom-loving human being, I think the utmost caution needs to be taken with any broad stroke public policy which deals with our healthcare, education, safety, and security.  Any increase in power and scope of Gov't authority needs to be weighed heavily and be difficult to accomplish.

It could be used successfully by a society that embraces racism, it could used successfully by as society that embraces all humans, it could be used successfully by a society on the far side of the moon. Capitalism provides a market, it's up to us to decide and battle against social inequality. Sure, businesses can act unethically, but that has to do with business ethics and not the market structure.

So simply, is Capitalism in its true sense and purpose a social movement, is it fair to compare it that way to socialism which is based more on a societal structure?

I was reading a book by Terry Eagleton the other day, and he put forth a theory that the general public's contemporary attitude towards the arts is a result of the Industrial Revolution. Modern public opinion (just look on Reddit!) largely views study of the arts as a waste of time and unproductive towards society. This isn't to say that a person can't engage in their free time, but public funding or personal effort at the expense of more ""productive pursuits"" is somewhat derided (AKA ""you deserve to not have a job unless you got a STEM degree""). In other words, the arts are seen as a ""nice, pretty thing to have around"", but not a fundamental element of society, worth serious investment.  Eagleton suggests that this utterly utilitarian viewpoint was brought about the by drive for profitability and increased efficiency in the last couple centuries, due to the industrialization of society.

This cycle of reinforcing own-group awesomeness leads to people assuming more and more of the good traits of humanity is actually some monopolized value unique to their own group, and through the electorate more people are elected who feel/think/believe this way as well. Over time, this leads to deepening divides in what is considered palatable by a consensus of people, coarsening of our overall rhetoric about one another, and contributes to a sense of anxiety and dysfunction in what could be any and all sectors of our economy and society.
