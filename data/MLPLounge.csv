Guess who is earning a degree in computer science, and can converse with nearly all the scientists on board in their native tongues? He asked me if I wanted to be one of the people in charge of assisting with technical difficulties, and to work alongside the other agencies in distributing supplies and assisting repairs. It would mean three months of training, and a three week seminar at a space camp in Krasnoyarsk, but the end result would be going into space for a few days to the ISS to work. I was told that the position was still wide open, but because of my experience and skills, and the fact that he could get me a reference that would go to the top of all agencies, I would get the position, nearly if not certainly for sure.

No big deal. Enter Honey Boo Boo mom lookalike contest winner. I'm ordering my food and upon seeing my shirt she remarks loudly to her daughter, I shit you not, ""It's one of those weird pony people. I bet he's a faggot, too."" At first, I was gonna be all mad and bitch her out, but then I came up with a better plan. I gave my debit card to the dude at the counter and said (quietly) ""I'll pick up their order too.""  I get my food and sit down.  [The cashier was super helpful, and way cool to do this.] I watched as she Jabba'd up to the counter. She orders Frosty shakes for her and her demon spawn. The cashier runs my card again and when she goes to hand him cash, he points at me and says ""That ""faggot"" over there picked up your tab."" (I guess he heard her comment too, because I about fell out of my chair laughing when he said that. That was an awesome ad-lib.) ALL of the colour drained from her face. She was speechless. She took her diabeetus in a cup and left with her kid. I went back up to the counter, got my card, thanked the cashier and left. I listened to The Black Eyed Peas on the way home, and I just finished my sandwich.

EDIT: Sweet...Pony...Jesus...This story got a TON of response. I guess I should say I'm sorry if any of my language offended you or anything. I'm not good at clean comedy. Also, if the fat jokes offended you, I'm sorry. I was still kinda cheesed at this woman when I wrote this. That said, I won't edit it. It doesn't seem right to censor myself on the off-chance that I've offended someone. I'm one of those people who believes in personal accountability.

From behind me, I heard, ""AW SHIT. THAT THE MOON?""

I turned around and spotted two guys about my age, that looked pretty gangsta. Converted in nude lady tattoos, silly gangsta caps, baggy jeans barely clinging on with the aid of their belts with super bling buckles.

""Naw, man. The moon ain't that color,"" his companion corrected.

To my surprise,  they kept watching the broadcast! They seemed a, little confused about what it was, but genuinely interested, so I went ahead and explained, ""That's the Curiosity! A new rover! It should be landing on Mars tomorrow night/Monday morning.""

""Shiiiit, for real?!""

""Yep. They'll be doing a real-time video and everything!""

They flipped out. Like, serious childhood excitement. It was awesome.

1342405324.0,172,self.MLPLounge,wmeo7,Why a 24 year old fireman watches MLP:FiM,207,35,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/wmeo7/why_a_24_year_old_fireman_watches_mlpfim/,"Like the title says, I'm a 24 year old man, and I work as a firefighter/EMT. The city I work in is small, but part of our territory is a stretch of interstate highway that sees a lot of bad wrecks in a regular basis. I also work in a hospital's emergency department. I've been doing this for just over a year now, and I love my work. I love fighting fires, cutting cars apart, doing rescue work...mostly, I love helping people when they need it most. 

And I watch My Little Pony. 

I know that it's not too unusual for a man my age to watch MLP. I look around and I see a culture that breaks a lot of the old norms, and one that's very accepting. My friends know that I watch the show, and while they aren't into it, I have no problems from them. Like I tell anybody who asks, I'm a fireman, an EMT, an ex-lumberjack, and a blacksmith. If I like something, it must be manly to like it. 

The reason I chose today to share this is because I wanted to explain to the community how MLP isn't just a show to pass the time with for some of us. For me, I've had to deal with some things that are...well, unpleasant. The results of careless actions, or accidents, that have left people hurt or worse. On scene, it doesn't matter how bad it is, because all I think of is ""I can fix this, I can do this!"" But afterwards, when it settles in, even the most grizzled chief can have a memory crawl up on his chest at night and keep him awake. And that's where ponies come in.

My Little Pony is one of those things that is good right down to its core. It's more than just the colorful world and cute characters, it's about the fact that there's something I can turn on and watch that's well-crafted, pure, and relaxing. It's hard to put my finger on what exactly it is about it that helps after the worst calls, but I can come home at 4 in the morning, turn on an episode, and by the time I've finished washing up, I'll feel a little better. It doesn't make the problems go away, but it helps to process them. 

I may be the only firefighter in America who watches this show, but I doubt it. I may not meet somebody with a Fluttershy sticker on their helmet (if only they made them rugged enough for that), but I wouldn't be surprised if tonight somebody's having a hard time falling asleep, with that memory crawling up on them, and they turn to the magic of friendship to help hold off the dark.

Thank you for reading this. I know it was a little long winded, but it was nice to get it out. Be safe out there.

*EDIT* I want to thank everybody for their kind words and support. It's good to hear from people who also find support in hard times through this show, not just soldiers, police and firefighters, but anybody who's having a hard time with life, school, or work. This really is one of the best communities I've ever been a part of.",,False,,t5_2t403,1342446177.0,,,True,t3_wmeo7,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/wmeo7/why_a_24_year_old_fireman_watches_mlpfim/,

I only know this person through an anonymous account, so I do not know who (and won't reveal anything further unless needed.)

To make the story short, we texted and talked over the phone, and they (using gender neutral term ""they"" instead of him or her) planned on overdosing and did so mid conversation.

I called the local police department (I admit I made a lucky guess on their location, all I had was the area code.) Since then, all I have heard is they were put in the emergency room at 6:12 AM on January 22. **I do not know if they are still alive, as the hospital has told me they can not tell me this.** I have left phone messages to the one of the officers who searched for this person, and with the hospital's mental health evaluator.

Other than this, I have no idea on the situation. They could be dead, could possibly be alive. I called the person's phone, with no answers, and recently with a response indicating the phone is dead/off.

1. Post anything you have to sell, or something you're looking to trade.

2. Caveat emptor.  If you don't trust someone, don't sell them stuff or buy things from them.  PayPal has some decent ""buyer/seller"" protection, even for personal transactions.  
3. No selling or buying sexual favors.  You give it away for free or not at all.

So post away and let the games begin.",,False,,t5_2t403,1366491624.0,,mac,True,t3_1crcgw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1crcgw/1st_plounge_swap_meet/,

* Age: 36  (no, that's not a typo)
* Gender: Male  
* Location: Monterey, California, USA
* Occupation: US Navy Officer
* Education: Bachelor's in Computer &amp; Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado.  Masters in Electrical Engineering (in progress).  Several certifications (CISSP, Security+, Navy Nuclear Engineer, Submarine Warfare, Navy Urinalysis Coordinator, etc).  I'm also certified to handle asbestos, refrigerants, and hazmat in the state of South Carolina!

* Favorite soap: Irish Spring Sport

The brief history - Graduated high school in Colorado in 1995.  No money for college, so I joined the Navy. I spent 3 years learning, and than teaching nuclear power, then got a ROTC scholarship and went to college.  5 years later, I graduated and went into submarines.  8 years of THAT miserable existence later, I came to my senses and transferred into communications.  Now the Navy has seen fit to send me to grad school into Space Systems Engineering, where I'll wind up with a Masters degree in electrical engineering.  (if I can get my damn thesis done anyway).  In the meantime, I also got married at the ripe old age of 30, and had a lovely daughter, and one more on the way.

I think I signed up for this almost a year and a half ago, when they first started.  Lady Luck finally smiled on me and my name came up.  So, AMA!",,False,,t5_2t403,False,,mac,True,t3_1fnfhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1fnfhq/i_am_bandalo_plounge_member_of_the_day_ama/,

But I see the code. Take a good look next time. You go to that slurpee machine and fill up your cup as far as it can, to the brim of that little dome shaped lid thingy. I swear by the gods it's full, you're getting every cent's worth out of this slurpee.

So you go to the counter, you pay for your slurpee, you go to the car, and you look at it again. And what happens? *It's not fucking full anymore.* **IT SHRANK**

[](/tstardy) The drink, *shrank.* It was full, and now it's like, 96% full. It compressed itself as you walked out the door. And it's getting smaller still! Without even drinking any, it slowly shrinks smaller.

THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU, MAN. THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU! You pay for a full cup of slurpee and then IT SHRINKS! Saving precious pennies in slurpee resources every single time. 

And what's that money going to? Research. Soon, they'll learn to make shrinking hot dogs. Think about it, you buy a full sized hot dog, then as soon as you walk out the door, it's half the size it used to be! Shrinking doughnuts? Shrinking fritters? The possibilities are endless.

With this kind of technology, 7-11 can scam the entire world into buying full sized items, only to have it be compressed upon exit of their establishment.

And he really liked the Katara drawing I had (same one I posted here not too long ago) Well we started talking for a bit about guitar and Pensacola. I found out he was born here and his dad was a fighter pilot for the Navy. And after like 10 minutes he asks me if I'm going to the show. I told him I couldn't afford the tickets and he says hey just write your name down real quick and I'll put you on the list. I did and he made a phone call and sure enough. I got into Deluna Fest to see PJ for free. They killed it too. Mike is a total badass on the guitar. Eddie was climbing all over the scaffolding and stuff. And after the last song some kid made his way to the front of the crowd with an American Flag and starts waving it. The rest of the band stopped playing but Mike started shredding the National Anthem. It was so crazy. Had a blast.

True, he doesn't have any characterization, which is especially surprising given how fleshed-out the series villains generally are, but in the end the story wasn't really about him at all.

The episode, in a nutshell, is about Twilight learning to do the right thing even if she thinks she'll fail a test because of it. King Sombra isn't so much a character as an event that forces her to make a difficult decision.

[](/sp)

I’ve told this story nearly every two weeks for the past year. I’ve never written it down, which is slightly shocking. I know, professor, that you’ve told us to tell something just on the edge of being too embarrassing to be told, but, truth is, I’ve gotten way too used to this story. A year ago, I was mortified and slightly amused at my own deviance.

Now, it’s just hilarious.

One and one half years ago, I was hanging out in the Art and Drugs dorm. You know the one. I doubt I even have to state its name. If you don’t know, look harder.

I was hanging out with some old hipster friends of mine from my freshman year, when I had lived there and famously completed an acrylic painting of a demonic lawn gnome, which is hung on the third floor to this day. I’m sitting by the front desk and see these three bearded guys bring down a laptop. They’re giggling.

Once again, it’s *that* dorm, so I don’t think much about it. Figure they’re at a six out of ten, or something, and are on a giggling spree that none of them will remember. They plop themselves down at one of the couches, flip open the laptop and start watching something.

While still conversing with my friends, I hear something from their corner of the lounge. The last thing I ever expect to hear coming out of a laptop being watched by three men. A sound that haunts me to this very day. I hear a dulcet soprano singing, *“My Little Pony, My Little Pony... AHHH, AHHHHHH, AHHHHHH, AHHHHHH~”*

I spasm, like my body has discovered a violent foreign presence and is rejecting it from my ear canals for my own health. After I recover, I tenuously make my way to these three. They spot me, look up from their computer, and just start *grinning.*

I wave. “Hey, guys.”

They bro-nod in my direction, that subtle uplift of the chin.

I shuffle. “So. My Little Pony, huh?”

One of them starts laughing big deep belly laughs from a sizable gut.

“Yeah, dude. Ponies, man.”

I wave my hands about in a sloppy figure eight. “So, are you guys high right now? Because that would explain everything.”

They bellow with laughter and start rolling around on the couch. “Naw, not yet, dude,” says one in between cackles.

I’m highly dubious.

One of them breaks away from their merrymaking and looks over at me.

“Alright, here’s the short version, man.”

The other two suddenly stop laughing and sit up straight like a family at mass. The one speaking holds up his index finger.

“One, it’s not My Little Pony. It’s My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Remember that. Always remember that. Two, it isn’t just us, there’s, like, thousands of college guys watching this show. Three, we aren’t kidding; we aren’t watching this because of, like, irony or something. We really genuinely like it. And four, we didn’t want to like it, but, really, like, found ourselves just, like, watching it, man.”

I gape.

“Well, uh, wow!”

I regain some measure of composure and smile thinly. This has to be a joke.

“That’s hard to believe.”

I back away slowly and tap an invisible watch on my wrist.

“Hey, guys, sorry I have to jet, but I have class in five. Have a good day!”

They all laugh. “Sorry we freaked you out, bro! Check it out on Youtube! I dare you! You’ll like it, we swear!”

I huff, stomping my way to nowhere in particular. Why in the world would I ever do that? It’s a show designed for little girls. Little girls! Girls younger than my little sister. There has to be something sick in their motivation, or they’re lying, or something. It can’t be that simple.

I’m not going to do it.

Four hours later, I take a deep breath, and sit down at my desk. I open my laptop. After navigating to Youtube, I type in, “My Li-” Immediately, Youtube, thinking itself helpful, suggests, “My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Episode 1 Part 1.”

I take another deep breath. I press enter. The first result has three million views. My eyes bulge.

I click.

Immediately, my eyes and ears are assaulted by visual and aural diabetes. There’s pastel colors *everywhere*, and then there’s little magical pastel colored miniature horses, and they’re playing with a beach ball, and there’s a Sun God pony and a Moon God pony and they start having a civil war, and then other things in the plot happen, and--*crap* there’s the theme song--and then Twilight Sparkle the unicorn and her dragon assistant get assigned to watching over the 1000th anniversary of Celestia’s overthrow of Nightmare Moon, to be hosted in Ponyville, in which Celestia will raise the sun with her magic, and then Celestia tells Twilight to make new friends and she’s, like, “Pfft! No way, I’m trying to save the world here; that’s stupid!” and then Nightmare Moon escapes from her moon prison, and then part one is over.

I stare at my computer screen.

I click part two.

Of course, Twilight Sparkle and her new friends become living gods and defeat Nightmare Moon with the power of friendship and Celestia allows Twilight to continue work on her doctoral thesis in town so she doesn’t have to move away from her friends.

Episode two is next. Then three. Four. Five. Six.

At this point, I get my favorite pony. Her name is Rainbow Dash. She can fly at mach ten without exploding into a cloud of horse meat.

Season three is coming in a few weeks.

What has happened to me? Why don't I care?

The answers to those questions are another piece entirely, but, friends, I have a challenge for you:

Find an episode online. I dare you to watch it.

I suppose a lot of people need some background on what that means. Without getting technical, and focusing on the parts important to this (Rather than things like sensory overload and dislike of repetitive sounds), it essentially means that firstly, I can only focus on one thing at a time, and I hyperfocus on things. This means that for one reason or another, my mind chooses one thing, and obsesses over it. It becomes involved with everything I do. The second, is that I can't socially interact. Or I couldn't at least.

Up until very recently, I had no friends. Online or in real life. This is largely because, I couldn't convey emotion well. I couldn't understand it. It's difficult to explain, but they had to teach me that crying people were sad. I couldn't read the cues that tell me how people feel, I had to learn what came naturally to others. And without time to carefully choose my words, I could never express how I felt, or even understand why I felt that way. Essentially, I was acting. I just tried to convey emotions that I was supposed to have, even if I didn't understand them. I was like a very well programmed machine. Every interaction was so much effort just to try to look normal, I could never make friends like that.

I've acted with many of you as well. I've had to ask people if I'm socially acceptable, because I can't tell myself. All I ever really wanted was friends, and I could never make them. However, since around when I started talking to you guys, I almost feel natural sometimes. Like my feelings are real for the first time, and I can finally be honest. I've looked at other people, and been able to tell how they feel. Interaction is finally becoming enjoyable, and I'm doubting what I do less and less.

And I think the reason is ponies. I wanted friends so much, I hyperfocused on a children's show bout making friends. And shockingly, it seems to be working. I think I'm improving more and more each day. I think I can finally understand who I am, or at least begin to, And then, maybe, I can hope to understand some of you as well. I finally learned to feel.

I guess I just wanted to share the effect a work of fiction can have on a man. If I'm just a kid grown up, then who says I can't learn how to be a friend now? Better late than never, as it were. 

I don't believe I have more to say. Without acting this time, I love you all. Very much.",,False,,t5_2t403,False,,colgate,True,t3_13xenc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/13xenc/i_think_i_figured_out_why_i_started_watching/,

I don't know why, but I made a post on /r/army asking something about contracts and one of them went through my history and starting pulling things out of context and telling me that they don't think I'm Special Operations or Ranger material just on the context of me being a Brony.  Bullshit. I've been training myself for the past 4 years and they know nothing of who I am. 
This was demoralizing at the least. I really thought that my nations soldiers would be better than the average asshole on Reddit but apparently not. 

And for you guys on /r/Army who will undoubtedly go through my history again. Why do you give a shit what I do with my life? I'm trying to do something good with my life and y'all are just bashing me for something completely unrelated.

Thank you everyone. You guys have helped me get a perspective on the whole thing. 

Edit: Me and the dude in question had a chat and I seem to have misunderstood him. He stereotyped me as being the sterotypical brony, which im not, and I said some things I shouldnt have.

It's been a month since I last had any sort of mind altering substance in my system. No drugs for 30 days. It's been hard, but I'm proud to say I've gotten through it. Now originally the plan was for this to just be a month break, then go back to using, but I'm feeling so much better I've decided to just extend it indefinitely. I'm feeling good and I see no reason to descend back into drug use. With that said I have a few shutouts for people who helped me through this over the past month.

[](/sp)
First is Kandy- Kandy, your sense of humor and your willingness to be there have been a huge thing for me. We call each other names but at the end of the day, you are one of the coolest ~~tulpas~~ friends I have

[](/sp)
Next is Mango- You've stayed up with me through most of the nights of the last month, and I think your insanity helped preserve mine. You're a awesome guy and I really enjoy hanging out with you. You do what makes you happy and I really respect that.

[](/sp)
Oblivinite- You generally seem to stay quite, but you always jump on any and all opportunities to help others, seemingly regardless of what it is. You have tremendous talent and you are a great person. Don't ever change and pursue your  dreams.

[](/sp)
Wordsmith_Pony- Your morning posts let me know it's probably almost time to go to bed, but not after I've had a chance to see whats going on with you. You seem to have a hard life, but you always seem to be in a good mood while in the good morning threads. I hope things get better for you and I wish you the best

[](/sp)
Sprakle- Even though you've stopped staying up all night, your humor and ironic cynical-ness really helped my through the first half  of  this month. We really do miss having you in the calls, and as soon as time allows it, you should start hanging out with us  again!

[](/sp)
Hemi- You are just overall a cool guy. Like seriously. From what I've heard about your real life, and from dealing with you, you seem like a reliable person worthy of anybodies trust.

[](/sp)
And finally Happycamper- You were one of the first people I met on the PLounge. You immediately stuck me as a amazingly nice person, and you have time and time again proven my first assumptions right. You are always there for me, whether it's cheering me up or shooting spaceships with me. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me.

[](/sp)
To everybody else/anybody I forgot (I'm terrible at remembering things), thank you. You have made this last month for me so much easier, and I'm looking forward to spending more time with all of you. You guys have brightened my life, even if it is only in a small way, and I can not thank you all enough for that.

                              Signing off (For Now)

I'm a bit of a stranger here, so I feel a bit out of place, but I'm posting this on behalf of a good friend.

His name is Brian Gapp. He's 16 and an avid My Little Pony fan. Unfortunately, most of his friends like me and his older brothers who are several years older than him have always made fun and teased him about the show. Most of it was just for fun, but we could be pretty relentless about it.

So that brings me to this last Tuesday. On his way driving to school he was in a pretty bad car accident and it was at least an hour before he was found. He was rushed to the hospital, but has been comatose ever since.

My friends and I were all been looking for ways to unite in solidarity with him and we decided to change all our Facebook pictures to ponies until he wakes up and he can see them. It's small, but love and positive energy never hurt anyone.

So why am I here? Well, because I'd like to know how good of a community the brony family really is. I know it would mean the world to Brian if he could see even some of you supporting him. I humbly request that anyone who wants to go to the Facebook page we recently made for him and show your support, even if it's just a single post. I've seen the power reddit can muster, and even a tiny fraction of that would be amazing. Or if you'd rather just post here, I'll be sure to show him this page when he wakes up :)

Again, I'm sorry for kind of barging into this subreddit being a complete foreigner, but I'll do anything to make sure Brian has the support he needs.

[] (/twismug ""gather round children! Storytime!"")

You see, my exams finished yesterday, and I'd arranged to go out to the bar with some of the mates from my floor. However, one person (besides myself) attended, a lady whom we shall call C. Now, C had just had her boyfriend break up with her after leading her on and getting sexual favours off her, as she explained to me that night. I'm always happy to hear the troubles and tribulations of my friends, even if they just need someone who can listen while they tell a story. Upon returning, we were confronted by the perpetrator himself, considerably drunk and shouting at me.

I don't know what he thinks happened, but I was completely sober and we'd done nothing but talk. At any rate, I have a gf whom I love very much and would never abandon for anything or anyone, but here was this guy shouting at me for making poor C feel better. Now, usually I'm quite witty, but nothing came to me right away. 

[] (/flutterwhoa ""Kind of a low blow, right?"") That is, until he started on my panic attacks. As I've posted (far too many times) before, I have a bit of psychological trouble, but it was the way he phrased it that sparked something inside me.

""And it looks like all of your so-called friends have abandoned you!""


He couldn't have said anything more perfect than this. A smile 
suddenly appears on my face.
""Oh no, I'm sure they're doing their best to find me.""
He seems taken aback at this stage (this guy is about 6' 4"" while I'm 6' 2"", but I don't fight. I just want to talk my way out of this).
""I know what they've all been saying about you! You're pathetic and weak!""
Now I know this isn't true, so I put on the same smile. ""I guess you're right! I am pathetic and weak, and I appreciate their understanding.""

Now he's losing his shit, and I'm having no trouble smiling now because I can't stop picturing him as a Discorded butterfly. Heck, at this stage I can't even believe what's happening. This is too good to be true, right?

The next thing he says completely does it.

""Well doesn't it piss you off that they're all judging you behind your back?""

""Not really. In fact, I'm lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.""

He winds up to punch me in the face, and I stand my ground (I've been hit so many times before, mostly for my punny humour, that I can take a wallop or two), when my RA comes to the rescue. I personally count that as a win. Drunk gentleman 0. Passable Fluttershy Impression 1.

But it might get slightly heated if people take this the wrong way, so let's try and remain civil.

One thing I've noticed over the months that I've been involved in this fandom is a rising trend of fanon (mostly fanfiction) that treats ponies as a perfect nigh-infallible race. This is often coupled with what seems to be a misanthropic view of humanity, often used to contrast with the seemingly perfect pony society.

Probably some of the more notable examples of this would be some of the Conversion Bureau spinoffs, especially the ones where becoming a pony is not just a necessity due to a doomed and dying world (often because Equestria is consuming it bit by bit), but is shown to be an outright improvement to the characters and their personalities.

These characters are show to be far less aggressive, far more agreeable, and consistently happy about everything. All differences are put aside, conflicts are almost non-existent, and everyone works together in blissful harmony in the heavenly Equestria.

So I'm just wondering... Am I watching the same show as everyone else?

I got hooked on this show because the characters and personalities were so enthralling, and most of all, believable.
There are conflicts. There are fights. There are disagreements. Not everyone is everyone's friend, because everyone is unique and have different (and thus often clashing) personalities.
Ponies can be malicious, greedy, snide, uncaring and just downright arseholes. There are clear class divides between the rich and the poor. There are conmen who'd gladly put your family on the streets if they'd profit from it.

Even the Princesses are fallible. If they were perfect beings, would Luna have ever succumbed to Jealousy? Would Celestia ever make mistakes like she did during the Wedding? 

So the point I'm trying to make is... I'm a fan of G4, and I've never noticed anything that shows that ponies are a perfect race without conflict. Are these people getting it confused with G1 or something?

In the past couple of months, my life has changed exponentially for the better. For years I was confused and hated myself because of my gender. I attempted suicide twice. And I convinced myself that I had a fetish. That I was a freak.

But in the last six months, I've come to terms with myself. And you know what. I'm a girl. I told my parents and a small group of friends. 
Hopefully, I can start hormones in the next 3 months, if my endocrinologist and therapist approve. I'm fourteen, btw.

My friends have been incredibly supportive, (and going to an arts high school might help with this)
But, I've finally come to except that maybe, one day, I could be cute girl like all my friends.

1327957459.0,108,self.MLPLounge,p3hx6,"To anyone who it might concern, a serious discussion about the current state of the main subreddit.",174,66,501,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/p3hx6/to_anyone_who_it_might_concern_a_serious/,"First, I'm posting this in the Plounge because I feel like a proper discussion about this is necessary, but that posting it in the main sub would only bring pointless and uncessary talk.

This is something I've been discussing with Tailszefox for a little while, and we've come to an agreement that something like this was needed. Keep in mind that everything said here is a statement from us both.

So, I wanted to make a proper discussion about some things that are becoming more and more of an issue, and, worse, the fact that nothing is ever done to solve them, or even aknowledge them. All I see is either people saying that ""it will pass"", or hoping that it will get solved by itself without anyone ever doing anything to actually solve it.

Honestly, I don't feel the same joy I did when browsing the subreddit some months ago. It frankly lacks good content, with too much circlejerk. Interesting discussions are quickly derailed and disregarded. Moreover, whenever an issue is raised by someone, people are quick to just say ""You're wrong"", ""You're taking it at heart too much""n ""It will pass"", ""This happens all the time"" without actually discussing the issue in any way. 

Behaviors that some users have, and about which some people don't agree with, are never dealt with properly, and simply keep happening, creating further confusion and tension. The worst part, however, is the fact that the people who could be doing something to prevent all of this, the mods, aren't doing anything. I grew tired of seeing them disagree with something that happened within the subreddit, only to not do anything about it and shrug it off, or make empty promises about eventually dealing with it and not coming up with any kind of action, simply waiting for the issue to pop up again.

Instead, I simply see them create more circlejerking and make no constructive posts, which makes me wonder if they really have the well-being of the subreddit at heart. Seeing how quickly the subreddit is growing, I really think all of this is detrimental to the subreddit, and I honestly think something needs to be done about it before it gets out of control.

Now that this is out of the way, I'll address each of those things in more detail:

The first and the easiest issue to notice is the constant stream of subpar posts. Posts complaining about the lack of quality in the sub keep appearing, so it's clearly not something that ""will pass"". Good and original content often doesn't get a proper chance to shine, because these kind of posts keep getting a lot of attention, even those that are, in essence, no-content, and bring nothing new or interesting to the subreddit. Examples of this include posts solely about upvotes/downvotes and the sub's relation with them, meme posts getting out of hands and spawning dozens of variations, posts about other posts (and posts about posts about other posts, and posts...you get the idea), etc.

Next are the regular posts saying how we are all awesome and flawless, and how this community is great, which is basically a way to push all of our problems out of the way, pretend they don't exist and simply not deal with them, because apparently, we are good already, so we don't need to do anything.

This also  encourages people to never disagree with anyone: whenever a controversial post appears, it's always pretty much one-sided. I never see anyone try to disagree with anything because the mindset that doing it is seen as being harsh and thus ""wrong"" is set on everybody. I have caught myself wanting to defend an issue, only to realize it would be useless to try because no one listens to you when you try to support an idea that the majority doesn't have.

Plus, defending an unpopular opinion often leads you to receive heated replies and disrespectful reactions, despite the fact that we pat ourselves on the back for being so ""nice"" to each others always. Basically, it looks like you either are with everybody, or you're nobody.

Then, we have cases where users bring an big discussion about a behavior they have seen around the subreddit, with other people agreeing and wanting to see something done about it. Yet, no actions are ever taken, and those issues simply keep appearing over and over again. We got a pretty big discussion about the spamming of the /new queue, got the promise that it will be discussed between the mods and that a proper announcement would be made regarding the issue, and yet I keep seeing it happening.

Another example is the issue of the blank posts and that bot that always makes me feel uncomfortable whenever I see it, because some people love it, some people hate it, and we never get to know if it is okay or not to do it, because we never get any kind of official statement about that kind of behavior, only jokes and personal opinions.

One final example is how posting the source is handled: we see the behavior of posting the source being encouraged, but we also see nothing being done about it when the source is not posted, simply because we have a bot who already covers that and posts in the comments, but we never get to know if we can simply keep doing it or if we should post the source in the first place. We don't know if it would be better to delete the submission and repost it when the source is found, nor do we know if it's okay to rehost something on imgur instead of linking to the source even when we know about it.

With all that in mind, it seems that in the end, users are forced to try to moderate and regulate themselves, but we can see how well that is going. As soon as any user tries to give constructive advice to someone else, it is more often than not quickly disregarded because ""it's not a rule"" or ""that's just an opinion"", so the issue simply stays here and people just hope that it will be solved by itself one day. This is highly unnecessary when we consider that a simple mod interference would solve everyone's problem immediately.

All I'm saying is that we are in a situation where we are destined to keep having bad and annoying stuff all the time unless we have an official saying about all these (and all the future) issues, big or small, polemic and controversial or not, because not addressing them is clearly doing more ill to this community than good.

All of this is really harmful for the whole subreddit, for new users and regulars alike, who are seeing such not-constructive behaviors being endorsed, and with the subreddit's growth rate, things can only get worse. If I'm making this post, it's because I really think that things got to a point where something needs to be done. 

I've been seeing things like this ever since I joined the subreddit, but they were pretty minor back then, and only now have they reached a point of making me feel worse after visiting the subreddit than allowing me to have fun and pass a good time with people I enjoy being with. I say this not with the intention of trying to regulate content for my own taste, but because I honestly think it's detrimental for everyone and the subreddit itself.

All I ask for is to take some more consideration about the path the entire subreddit is following. Do we really like how it is right now? Will we like how it will be when we get a few more thousands subscribers? Are the comments being constructive and helpful for most of people? Aren't we hurting some with what we say, even if they don't voice their opinion? Are all the mods doing what they are meant to do? Are they being mods at all? Should a more serious approach be necessary to solve the issues already, even if it means having to regulate some controversial topics? Are we really making progress with how things are or could we do it better?

So, here we are, that's all I wanted to say about it. You're all free to disregard me and think the subreddit is fine as it is, but I felt like this had to be said to make things at least clear. I'm not enjoying the current state of the subreddit, lots of other users already said how they don't like it as much anymore as well (the proof being that the Plonge has become sort of a refuge for those people), and the only way we're gonna make it better is if we take some action as soon as possible, instead of complaining about how bad it is all the time.

A little word to prevent some basic replies: don't simply say ""deal with it"", because it is something I've seen for a long time around, and it really never looked so serious like I think it is now, so it would just be postponing the fateful day where it may become something serious for everybody.

Don't simply say ""it will pass"" too, because the very reason I'm doing this post is because I've seen it too much and it's starting to become a regular thing, some of them even happening daily. I doubt it will pass as easily as saying it.

And no, it's not that I'm taking it too seriously and should relax and enjoy things. The very reason I'm making this post is because I can't do that anymore, I feel more annoyed going to the subreddit instead of enjoying it.

Remember, all I'm saying is that we should be a litte more self-critical regarding  what we are doing in our community as a whole, and what we can do to make it better. If people are upvoting stuff that we think shouldn't be upvoted, it's up to us to try to show them why they shouldn't do it.

That's it, discuss as you see fit.

Edit: I'm not answering anything else because what I think I had to be said was already said so I'd be adding nothing. My (and Tails') intention with this post was to bring up that there are issues around that we need something to be done about it, be it from the mods, be it from the users, and what can we possible change about ourselves to improve the situation of the subreddit. With that being said, I hope we have a proper discussion in the future on how to handle everything, and that we'll find the better direction for everyone in the subreddit.

Berry Punch would be the drinker, Roids would be on... steroids, and Pinkie Pie would probably be on everything else known to mankind.

Twilight would fit as the judgmental host of the show and would go around breaking the 4th wall and telling kids how miserable these ponies were because of alcohol and drug abuse. Near the end of the show Twilight will say that the druggies all need a supplier, who in a twist will end up being Rarity. Bitch please, Twilight will say, we know you weren't making that much money on dresses. Twi will then burst into Rarity's bathroom where she's using her tub to make various drugs.

...Which then led me to thinking about how ponies go to the bathroom. I don't think I've seen toilets in any of their bathrooms, (screenshot if there is), and even if there is, how to the male ponies pee? I don't think they can hold their ding dongs not only because they don't have hands, but because they would have to stand upright for about a minute and their ""arms"" probably aren't long enough. So I guess they'd just pee sitting down? That is, if they use toilets... maybe they just all go outside or all have outhouses. Actually wait... I think Fluttershy has an outhouse. Hmmm...

A few months ago I discovered MLP. It was great--I did the standard ""obsessively watch all the episodes"" thing for a week, ordered some toys and T-shirts, you get the idea.

I soon learned that wantonly ordering ponies off the internet is not a habit conducive to saving money. But I *really* wanted a brushable-mane Rarity. I'd already bought Applejack and Rainbow Dash, I wanted to get brushable versions of all the Mane 6, and Rarity is my favorite pony. Do you see my predicament?

So, I made myself a deal. Ponies for grades.

UCD's Engineering program is among the more difficult programs they offer. CSE students have to take the most advanced lower-division math and physics classes that Davis offers; they're the type of classes where a 55% is a solid C. And I was taking integral calculus, largely considered to be the hardest class when compared to the skill level of the students--it's the only class for which UCD's Engineering school will accepts a 'D' as a passing grade. 

I knew I could get a C. But I didn't *want* a C, and I *definitely* did not want a D. I wanted at least a B, and hopefully an A! So I studied a little...

[](/lunasad) And I bombed the first midterm. I didn't know it at the time, but this effectively put an A out of reach for me. I didn't give up, though. I studied a *lot* for the second midterm... and the third... and by the time the final exam rolled around, it was totally possible for me to get a B in the class. All I needed was a 140 out of 200 on the final exam (my highest score on a midterm had been 76/100, but my lowest had been 55/100). So I took the test... aaaand...

[](/happyluna) I DID IT! I got a B in my calculus class. Even better, I got A's in all my other classes this quarter! Remember, kiddies: hard work, diligence, cramming, energy drinks, and the promise of ponies will get you farther in life than anything else. 

Now, I'm off to buy myself a Rarity.

**TL;DR:** Bribing myself with ponies got me good grades.

[](/dwyes) Whelp, we surprise intervened my roommate this morning and it went surprisingly well.
[](/sp) 
[](/dwhuh)  After a bit of sappy talk and rational explanation, my roommate broke down and decided to try out some ideas we had. He claimed he drank to help him sleep, so we took a safer route. 
[](/sp)
[](/dwha) We got him some melatonin tabs which are a natural remedy to help people sleep. After testing them and seeing how well they work, he submitted to going dry. We poured out all his booze and until he proves trust worthy, isn't allowed to go any where without someone with him to stop him from getting back into it. He also isnt allowed to keep his melatonin with him as we dont want him to replace one addiction with another. Finally, we put a lock on the booze fridge to stop him from taking what isnt his. 

[](/sp)

[](/dwhello) For the first time in over 3 months, my roommate got up before noon, did all his homework, spent time with his girlfriend to save their relationship, *and* he went to all his classes.

AMA"".  In the body of the post, I gave some information about what was going on surrounding the disaster that was LPU, and continued to answer any questions that I could (the post has been deleted since then).  However, thanks to the absolutely terrible wording of the title and body of the post, many were under the impression that I was trying to get attention and make myself look like a hero from this terrible event.  Because of this, I wish to apologize for my words and actions.

I am truly sorry for making myself, and by extension, my colleagues from Celestia Radio and beyond, look like pompous, arrogant people.  My wording on the post was absolutely terrible, and did not clearly state my intentions, which were to give the MLPLounge a centralized place to ask questions and get information from a person that was directly involved in the LPU disaster.  I also want to apologize to my friends, the musicians at the con, as they were hit the hardest out of anyone else, and my post trivialized their plight by looking as though I was trying to get glory and attention for helping to sort out the mess.

I am sorry for anything I said or did to trivialize the horrible events that occurred at LPU.  It was extremely arrogant of me to word it the way I did, and I can promise that it won't happen again.",,False,,t5_2t403,False,,rarity,True,t3_19cbqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/19cbqc/a_formal_public_apology/,
