1352468546.0,703,self.eldertrees,12wuhx,This morning CNN's Don Lemon stood up against an entire morning show panel preaching his beliefs about why marijuana should be legal.,821,118,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/12wuhx/this_morning_cnns_don_lemon_stood_up_against_an/,"I'm posting this to bring it to people's attention, I want people to post the video when CNN posts it, and seek it out. It was far and away the best thing I've seen on CNN for years.

If I find the video I'll post a link, but I want people to know about this.

During CNN American Morning this morning, Don Lemon was a part of a panel discussing the recent legalization in Colorado and Washington.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta basically stated that, ""studies show there are hardly any health risks"", Sanjay was straight forward about facts, but the rest of the panel was treating pot like a joke.

One panelist made jokes about cheetos and video games, another panelist (Christine Romans) spouted the classic ""Reefer Madness"" bullshit about how it's horrible for the kids, is a gateway drug, and shouldn't be made available, even saying ""What about the children"".

Don Lemon is the fucking man. He was professional, precise, and argued with logic. He stated that ""it's only a gateway drug if you're prone to addiction, and if you're prone to addiction anything is a gateway drug"". He stated that alcohol and tobacco are far more dangerous, but both of those are legal.

He was bombarded with attacks, got mocked and made fun of, but stood his ground and stayed professional ... arguing with facts.

My favorite line of Don's, ""I don't have children, but if I did, I'd rather they smoke pot than drink alcohol."".

I hope this clip comes online soon. People need to see it, and people need to applaud Don Lemon ( @DonLemonCNN ) for standing up publicly against what we stand up against everyday.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_12wuhx,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/12wuhx/this_morning_cnns_don_lemon_stood_up_against_an/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15ini6/landlordtenant_drug_test_update_1227/

So my buddy had gone through the steps mentioned in the previous post. He had refused the drug test and spoken to his lawyer about drafting a letter about his rights and the harassment. He was ready to stand his ground, all while trying his best to get out of his lease.

Well, there was an interesting twist.

Yesterday after work the landlord's wife stopped by his apartment and knocked on the door. My buddy answered (which I thought was sort of dumb, I would have just ignored contact), and the wife was standing there with a box of cookies.

My buddy tells me the wife apologized profusely for her husband. She said that she was unaware about her husband asking my friend for a drug test until late the previous night, and said her husband was out of line and apologized.

She basically told my friend that the downstairs neighbor is a pain in the ass. She said he constantly complains about everything and is a thorn in her husband's side about every little inconvenience. She said she understands that they have responsibilities as a landlord, but this dude has apparently called bitching about people parking in front of the house on the public street. Basically he's a douche.

She said she doesn't put up with his incessant bitching, but the husband just tries to shut him up by appeasing to his every demand. She said this was a perfect example.

She said she was furious at her husband because he annoyed my friend about a drug test when he was a good tenant. She said to my friend, ""You pay your rent on time, take out the garbage weekly like we ask, and have been a joy to have here. I don't even care if he smokes weed as long as his rent check clears."".

She said she informed her husband that he has to stop cow-towing to the downstairs neighbor, and she gave my friend a copy of a note she left at the downstairs neighbors apartment. The note basically said that they have no reason to believe that drug use is going on in my friend's apartment and they will not be investigating it further, and that if he wants to contact the police to have them contact her directly.

She said she had asked her husband to call and apologize to my friend, but ""he's stubborn"".

My buddy was shocked obviously, but he's happy with the end result.

He was going to eat the cookies, but they have nuts and he's allergic.

He asked that I pass a thank you to everyone who gave advice.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_15kkmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15kkmc/landlordtenant_drug_test_third_update_the_epic/,

For some reason people can drink alcohol, caffeine, or even prescription drugs if it has been prescribed to them in order to feel good, and we don't call it abuse until it starts negatively impacting their lives. However it is instantly considered abuse the moment that any illegal drug is consumed. Indeed simply being arrested for minor possession of cannabis often requires some form of substance abuse class, regardless of how often or how much the person uses. We need to change the dialogue about substance abuse, especially among health care professionals (both physical and mental health) to better define abuse for various drugs, illegal and legal, before just classifying everyone as an abuser.

I have tried many drugs, both legal and illegal and I can tell you the only one I have really abused is alcohol. While certain drugs are easier to abuse and have the potential for greater abuse, we cannot say that someone is an abuser, no matter the substance, unless there is evidence that using it is impacting them or those around them in a negative way.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_14wcus,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/14wcus/taking_any_drug_for_recreational_use_is_not/,

The results were hilarious and I wanted to share.",480,73,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/12o09f/elder_trees_i_had_an_idea_for_a_social_experiment/,"Last Thursday night I was relaxing on my couch with my Buddha, watching the NFL network and reading some different football message boards and sub-reddits. This is something I do all the time, but very rarely do I do it while stoned.

When I was reading through the different posts and whatnot, I realized in my high-state that most intense sports fans always try to ""one up"" other sports fans in terms of knowledge. It always seems like a game where people want to pull out the most obscure statistics about players/teams/etc, as if knowing something other people don't know gives them some sort of real-life feeling of self worth.

This happens in other types of mediums as well, but I specifically noticed it with football this time around.

While toking a bit, I realized how ridiculous this was, and I wondered if people were just like this on the internet ... or if they were like this in real life too. Thus, I hatched a plan to find out.

I go to the bar with some buddies of mine every Sunday for the game. It's always a good time. We have a few beers, eat some wings, and basically just relax every Sunday.

I'm a big Dolphins fan, and I have a customized jersey that someone got me as a gift a few years ago that has my last name on it. I never wear it, because I feel weird walking around with my last name on a jersey. Yesterday, however, I decided to wear it to the bar ... simply so I could see how many people make comments on it and whether or not I could convince them that my jersey was actually of a player that existed.

It took a little while for someone to come up to me, but when they do they ask, ""Who's that player? I don't remember them?"". Stone faced I reply, ""Oh man? You don't remember him? He was the wide receiver for the Dolphins in the late 90s. He got injured two or three years into the pros and was forced to retire early.""

The guy immediately looked puzzled, and I thought my goose was cooked, but then he said, ""Holy shit, you're right. I forgot about him. Shame about that injury too. He was going to be huge."". He gave me a high-five and went about the day.

Throughout the remaining 5 or 6 hours we were at the bar, at least 3 or 4 other people came up to me about the jersey, and I gave them the same story. Not one of them called me out on my bullshit. One of them actually asked me if I remembered that ""huge kick return he had against the Pats"", to which I of course replied yes.

All of my friends were in on the joke with me, and were getting just as big a kick out of it as I was.

All in all, it was a hilarious mini-social experiment. It truly made me think about the lengths people will go to to ""fit in"" and ""pretend they're in the know"".

Doing this gave me perspective on the way I present myself to others, and made me cognizant of times in my life where I may have done something similar. It was a clear situation where marijuana opened my eyes to the actions of others (and myself) in a way I never would have thought about while sober.

Figured I'd share :)

Sadly, the very term ""legalize"" has taken on a connotation that doesn't sit well with people outside of the marijuana movement and libertarian thinking.

Instead, I suggest we focus on ""ending prohibition"". The term ""prohibition"" is incredibly loaded, largely due to the fact that we were all taught in school about how alcohol prohibition did not work.

When people hear the term ""prohibition"", they immediately think about the government trying to control something they cannot control and all of the negative consequences that goes with it. Let's use this to our advantage and make people think of marijuana prohibition in the same light.

",348,42,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/zfz0c/had_the_most_touching_moment_of_my_life_so_far/,"I guess I'll start off with a little back story on myself.  I'm 22 and have dealt with some problems in my life.  Not huge problems, but personal battles with anxiety disorders and whatnot.  I've tried multiple times to progress my life, but because of my self destructive tendancies, I always find myself 2 steps back.  I'm a generally likeable and charming person, but my self concious always messes it up eventually.  For instance; I moved to London recently to stay with a few friends, got 2 jobs within a day, and was having fun.  Until a month later I had a mental breakdown which led to verbal confrontation with said friends, and having to move back to my family home.  

My father is a painter, and always helps me out by giving me work when I am down on my luck.  I'm a damn hard worker, and am always complimented on my work ethic by the people I'm doing jobs for.  So recently, because of his busy schedule, he gave me my own job to do.  It's just a small job of wallpapering a living room, but there's a damn lot of prep work (scraping emultion off of an the entirity of the room, sanding the plaster down, yadda yadda).  

Anyways, so I'm working for this guy.  He's an old man in his 90's, single, no children.  The guy is the friendliest person I've met.  Usually on a job it can get annoying when people are constantly talking to you, but I don't mind when this guy does.  He has dozens of amazing stories about his experiences in WWII, his turn to pacifisim, and basically just his life experiences.  

Yesterday, the subject of marijuana came up when he asked if I smoked marijuana, and after a little hesitation, I said I did.  He's been smoking since his 40's, and said despite having no children and a deceased wife, that he's really enjoyed all his time; and mainly thanks to marijuana and the people he's met because of it.  

So I've been putting in the hours at this job; 7am-9pm.  This is usually a bit of a drag, but for some reason I don't mind doing it at all.  He definitely enjoys the company.  At the end of yesterday's work day he comes up to me and says ""I've got a little present for you"".  To be honest, after our conversation I thought he was going to hand me a little bit of marijuana.  But what it was was a silver and onyx ashtray from 1905.  He tells me how it was his fathers, and that he's smoked with it all of his life.  He even brought it with him on board his ship in WWII.  

Nothing has touched me more than this in my life ever...and it's all thanks to Marijuana.  I told him that when I finished his job that I would pop by for a smoke every couple of weeks.

I legitimately had one of the coolest things happen to me tonight, and I just want to share it with you all.
I've been dry for about 2 weeks now. New town, no dealers, no bud... Big bummer. I was cleaning out my MFLB the other day for resin, and ended up tearing the trench. Big bummer again. I finally got around to emailing them about a warranty claim, and got a response today saying to tear out the screen. So I do, and what do I see? MOTHER FUCKING HONEY. Booya! I end up scraping up just enough to put on a cigarette.
I decided to go for a drive (I was about a [4], totally fine to drive), and about 10 miles down a country road I see one of the most beautiful grey foxes I've ever seen. Well, more than any I've seen in pictures since I had never seen one in real life. I basically lock eyes with the thing while I'm slowly driving by, and decide to turn around so I can get another look at her. I'm slowing my car down and she freaking follows my car! She looked like the most curious creature ever. That's when I decide to pull into this driveway and just watch. She comes probably within 10 or 15 feet of my car and just stands and looks at me. I'm completely euphoric at this point, as foxes are my all time favorite animal ever. So freaking cool. So as she finally turns around to walk off, I look and see ANOTHER FREAKING GREY FOX. The first one catches up to the second one and they just majestically walk off into the woods.
I know that probably seems like a really lame story, but to me, I needed it. I've been having a really rough few weeks, and this really just made me stop and think. I got so happy over seeing 2 foxes. Why on earth do I need to get so worked up about trivial things when I can find joy in things like that?

1356614583.0,281,self.eldertrees,15ini6,Landlord/Tenant Drug Test (UPDATE 12/27),324,43,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15ini6/landlordtenant_drug_test_update_1227/,"Hey everyone. First off, thanks a ton for the crazy amount of responses. My friend read through all of them after I made him aware of the thread **( here's the link to the original thread for those not sure what I'm talking about: [http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15gwd9/can_a_landlord_demand_a_tenant_currently_living/])**.

Sorry I couldn't reply to people yesterday, I posted the thread before I left the house for work and was gone the majority of the day.

Before I get to an update, I wanted to clarify a few things that people seemed confused about last thread:

- This story is NOT about me. It's about a buddy. My buddy is not a Redditor.

- This is not an apartment complex with building management or anything. This is a 3 family house owned by a private individual. He's described the landlord as ""very blue collar"". He works as a construction worker or something on a full time basis.

- There is no weed currently in his house. He brought it over his girlfriend's place. The only thing he has on him is his Magic Flight, which is in his car.

Anyways, here's an update on the situation :

The landlord apparently called my buddy yesterday afternoon around 6pm (fortunately, after my buddy had read the advice in this thread). He said, ""I bought the drug test at CVS, is there a time I can come by this week and we can just take care of this.I know you're not happy about this, neither am I, but I just want to make Randy (the downstairs neighbor) happy so he puts an end to this."".

My buddy said he dealt with his landlord as nicely as possible, obviously I wasn't there for the conversation, but my buddy said the gist of what he said to his landlord was, ""You have no legal right to make me take a drug test, and I refuse to do so. This is where I live, and I don't appreciate being harassed regularly when I've done nothing wrong. This has severely disrupted my life. If this continues to happen, I'm going to take the proper legal steps necessary to ensure I can live in this apartment in peace."".

Apparently this spawned a conversation where the landlord (who obviously was completely ignorant about the law) tried to convince him that he had every right to drug test him because he lived on his property, and that if he refuses to do so he will call the police and ""get them to take care of this."". He pulled the whole, ""I'm trying to be nice about this"" line, acting as if he was doing my friend a favor.

My buddy stood his ground, firmly said no, and spent the night looking for different apartments. He also sent an email to an attorney friend of ours who he is hoping he can get to draft a legal document about this harassment.

My buddy also went and tried to talk to the neighbor causing this trouble. He said the neighbor was home when he knocked on the door, but the neighbor didn't answer. He left the neighbor a note with his cell-phone number on it, asking him to call him at his convenience so they can ""discuss any confusion they may be having"".

He said a half-hour or so later the landlord call him again; he let it go to voice mail, he didn't leave a message. He's convinced that the annoying neighbor contacted the landlord about him knocking at his door and the landlord was calling about that.

So, basically my buddy is standing his ground while looking for a new situation. It's obviously uncomfortable, but he's doing all he can do at this point to deal with it in a mature manner.

If I get anything more to update you guys with, I'll be sure to let you know.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_15ini6,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15ini6/landlordtenant_drug_test_update_1227/,

I suffer from mild PTSD. For the first year or so I was back, I was tormented with nightmares. sleepwalking too. cannabis absolutely fixed those problems right up, as well as helping my to relax, calm down, and not be a pile of anger with a trigger finger.

Over the last year or so, I occasionally feel like I'm not using it to medicate anymore, just to get high. I wondered if it was a problem.

The answer, i think, is a strong NO. yesterday I didn't partake and woke up crying from the war dreams. Sure, cannabis obviously isn't going to fix my issues, but neither will the VA who won't even call me back and just throws 10 different kinds of pills at any veteran complaining about problems. Cannabis just masks my problems, but in doing that it gave me my life back. 

Have a wonderful day everyone. time for a wake and bake.

TL;DR: don't feel bad ever,ever,ever about smoking trees. also, war is good for nothing.

I have only started using weed about 2 months ago, at the age of 34.

After years of believing the propaganda and bullshit associated with weed, I started using it as part of my own spiritual journey in waking up my true inner self. 

Since I started getting high a couple of times a week, and using that time to either re-discover the beauty of nature, the love for my family, or focus on my inner-monologue, I have found out how to begin healing a LOT of anxiety and self-confidence issues I have/had, and am a lot more happy with simplicity in life. I'm a better father, and hopefully, a better husband.
Anybody else use MJ for similar purposes? Stories?

thx

I've only been smoking for about two years now, and before that time I hadn't really paid any close attention to marijuana legalization. 

Like most of us, I was absolutely thrilled this last election when Washington and Colorado finally found some common sense and legalized cannabis. It's great to see legalization starting to get some serious traction, and I really have high hopes for my generation.

However, every time I think about how much we're moving forward, I think about the 60's. I know Reddit's deity Carl Sagan himself believed legalization was only a few years ahead of his time, and I'm sure people at the time believed it was right around the corner.

On that note, I guess my question to those who lived through this time is do you think we're actually gaining any ground? Having a very shallow amount of experience in this area, I have no idea what to think of the recent push for legalization. I'd love to hear any sort of opinion from someone who lived through this time. Thanks!

I read in the news this morning that the UN is encouraging President Obama to intervene with states where voters have decriminalized cannabis (Colorado &amp; Washington). I read another article 10 min later that former DEA chiefs are also urging Mr. President to ""act now or it might lose the chance to nullify Colorado and Washington's laws legalizing recreational marijuana use.""

Well, guys, I'm fed up.  Voters approved these initiatives, it is heinous that cannabis is still an issue, and that states where the voters have chosen to allow cannabis may come under fire for practicing their constitutional rights.

So I called the White House this morning, for the first time.  I've signed petitions, sent many many emails to various political offices, hell, I've even picketed!  But never made an actual phone call voicing my concerns.  For those of you who are reluctant to take that step, allow me to let you know something.

It took 10 minutes.

10 minutes to stand up for voters, for YOUR rights.  I think I'm going to try and call once a day, or at least more than once a week.

President Obama needs to see that citizens won't stand for this injustice.  He is hearing from everyone else, now he needs to hear from us.

The number is 202-456-1111. Here is what I said:

""I am calling to urge President Obama to allow states with voter approved medical and recreational cannabis initiatives to continue to provide cannabis without federal interruption.

I also encourage Mr. President to remove cannabis from the Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act.  It's time to put an end to federal raids of medical patients and their medical cannabis providers.""

Make sure to thank the volunteer, and keep it brief so we can all get a word in.

It took 10 min. Easiest thing I'll do all day, probably.

Just a few times a week. I was poor as shit but wanted high uality bud so I learned to ration it out very well and treasured the time I spent banging on my guitar while high.

I quit towards graduation to get ready for corporate America. I still smoked on occasion but for the most part, I left it out of my life. Corporate America can suck the soul out of a man faster than a Hoover vaccuum so I ended up turning to booze to bide my time. Long story short, booze got the best of me and I lost my job.

I cleaned up and got another job a month later, kicked the bottle and was feeling great about my life. Evenutally I hooked up with an old friend who still smoked and partook every so often. I subscribed to [/r/trees](/r/trees) and bought into the ""everything's better with weed"" mentality and eventually started buying. Now that I was working full-time I could afford to buy more often and was smoking way more than I did in college. I would lie to my loved ones and say I was going to the store and sit in my car and get high. I was losing focus on what the actual important things were.

Eventually I put down my pipe and realized I had substance abuse issues. I used alcohol or weed to numb myself after work and spent my time at work, itching to get out so I could get get high and relax. I was slacking at work and slacking in my relationships.

I know this is a marijuanna appreciation society but I know there's a chance that there's someone out there like me who was only exposed to the pro-weed view on reddit but found that conflicting with the effect weed was having on them.

Worse, an article published on the same day in Rolling Stone magazine indicated that a ringleader for this anti-marijuana activity is Vice President Joe Biden. A former top White House drug policy advisor was quoted in the article saying, ""As long as [Biden] is vice president, we're very far off from legalization being a reality.""

This is wrong. Mr. Biden should end his war on marijuana users and respect the voters of CO and WA.

(x-post with r/trees),250,24,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/171z0f/knowing_my_rights_saved_my_skin_xpost_with_rtrees/,"So I was going up to my friend's place a few hours away this weekend for the purpose of dropping off some growing supplies/copious amounts of weed before I move so if the wrong people help me move, they won't see that stuff.

I was driving along in my car (doesn't have a trunk, so there's no real ""hiding"" place, so I covered everything in a drop cloth in the back) on a two lane country-ish road, and I go to finally pass the person in front of me who's been going 5 mph under the speed limit the whole time. And who do you think is parked on the side of the road RIGHT there? None other than a smokey. So I got pulled over, got my license and registration out, officer walks over, asks me if I know why I was pulled over. I apologize and explain I was just trying to pass as quickly as possible to get out of the oncoming lane asap. He starts to go to his car, and I ask him if there's any way he could let me off with a warning, and he says that all depends on what my record looks like.

He comes back over, and asks me what my address was, it's different than my license, and he says he's going to write a ticket for failure to update my address. I thank him (this always makes my blood boil because I'm thanking an officer for a ticket lol), and he starts to go back to his car. He gets to the rear of my car, and says, ""Hey, what do you have under the tarp?"" I tell him some clothes and blankets because I'm visiting my friend, and he asks if I can lift the tarp for him. My stomach jumps into my throat, and my heart starts pounding. I get out of my car and walk to the back door, and with my hand on the handle to open it, I pause and ask if I'm allowed to exercise my right to deny an unwarranted search. He says something like, ""Sure, but I was cooperative with you, but it's your call."" I apologize for not reciprocating his cooperation, he asks me to get back in the car, he pulls out his flashlight and starts looking in all the windows for anything suspicious, I show him that everything that's visible in the car isn't going to provide reasonable suspicion, and he goes back to his car. My mind was racing and visualizing my life being over etc, waiting to see another cop car pull up with a canine unit or something, but after what seemed like an eternity (maybe 5-10 minutes?) he comes back with my ticket for failure to update my address, I apologize to him again, and we go our separate ways.

Moral of the story, know your rights, be courteous to the officer, and you CAN get out of sticky situations!

Marijuana has evolved from an almost taboo subject to a serious political topic in recent years, and support behind the responsible use of this substance is at an all time high.

While we do have many problems and topics that the general public want answers for, however, we should do our part to make sure marijuana and hemp are a major topic in the upcoming elections.

[Here is a brief overview of the multitude of uses for hemp](http://azhemp.org/Archive/Package/Uses/uses.html)

Here is another number that you should know: 338 billion.

$338,000,000,000; that is the estimated total revenue of Alcohol sales in the United States in 2008. If marijuana was not only legalized for medicinal purposes, but also viewed as a control substance, and regulated and taxed like alcohol or tobacco, you can bet that marijuana sales will generate a lot of money for the government, not to mention jobs of building facilities for the growing/harvesting/curing that will be required to accommodate the demand generated by the consumers. This is not even taking into consideration of jobs generated through logistics and other factors that I have not thought of.

Also, if recreational use of marijuana were to be legalized, then wouldn't that allow the U.S. to grow hemp? If so, then thousands of jobs could be generated just from the production and processing of industrial hemp, not to mention all of the industries that could be brought back home and thrive, with the legalization of hemp and marijuana use.

Feel free to discuss! I felt compelled to post this because of Romney's statement saying that Marijuana is not an important issue, and that topics such as the economy are more important. Well, if you legalized recreational marijuana use, perhaps marijuana can help the economy. Because it certainly couldn't hurt it anymore it seems.

As of late I've been extremely depressed and stressed, primarily I found this stress to be related to work/finances/and the overall stress that comes with being self-employed. I found that this stress was taking over my life, and carrying over into unhappiness in other venues.

I wasn't as talkative or friendly in my relationship with my girlfriend, I wasn't as nice as I could have been to clients, I was short and curt with friends and family, I wasn't as nice to strangers as I like to be.

I didn't like being this way, but then last night the realization that I make my own stress, and that I'm the chef behind the stove in the kitchen of my own unhappiness, began to seep through.

Sure, I may have stress in my life, but who doesn't? I shouldn't let that make me unhappy. I shouldn't allow the strains of being self-employed, and wondering where your next check will come from, to get me down. I should look out the window, see the gorgeous weather and realize how fortunate I am to have this life. I should look at the relationships I have with friends and family, and realize how lucky I am to have them in my life.

My friend is a 32 year old College graduate. He works a traditional office job every 9-5, and is one of the most reliable trustworthy people I know. He, like all of us, smokes weed.

He has been renting a unit in a 3 family house for around 4 months. He smokes regularly, but normally does it outside and on the porch away from the house. He said he never smokes inside because, ""There's a no-smoking rule in the place, so he wants to be respectful to the landlord."".

Apparently one of the neighbors in the multi-family (whom he says is a 40 year old single dude, who's a bit of a prick) reported to the landlord that he smelt what he thought was marijuana.

The landlord approached my buddy and questioned him about it over a week ago. My buddy of course denied smoking. He said the conversation with the landlord was around 5 minutes and rather casual. He thought that would be the end of it, but wanted to be careful regardless.

Right after the conversation with the landlord, my buddy told me he was done smoking at the apartment. Said it wasn't worth the risk of putting up with that anal-retentive neighbor. He actually moved all of his weed and glass to his girlfriends house, and said, ""I'll keep my Launch Box in my car, but otherwise I'll just smoke over there."".

Apparently on Monday morning the landlord called my buddy and said that the other neighbor keeps harassing him about whether or not ""druggies are upstairs"" and he ""feels unsafe being in the same building as people who might be dealing drugs"".

The landlord said the neighbor asked the landlord to drug test my friend. He said he wanted to purchase one of those home drug test kits from CVS and see if he was smoking weed.

My buddy refused, to which the landlord replied, ""Well if you have nothing to hide, why won't you just do it."", my buddy replied about his rights and whatnot, but the landlord basically said, ""Listen, I don't want to make this a big deal, but if you don't do this I'll have to get the authorities involved."".

My buddy ended the conversation saying he didn't need to tolerate accusations, and said he will not take a piss test.

Basically my buddy doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have any weed at his house, so if a search was done he'd be safe, but he would obviously fail a piss test.

He asked me if the landlord has a right to randomly drug test him like a job would, and I told him I had no clue. Thus I turn to you guys.

Any suggestions for my friend? Does the landlord have a right to piss-test him? Can the cops actually do anything?",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_15gwd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/15gwd9/can_a_landlord_demand_a_tenant_currently_living/,

When I was 25, with a steady girlfriend and a full time 9-5 job, I looked back at being 21 and said, ""Man, life was so easy for me then. I miss that.""

Now, at 30, I'm engaged, I own my own business and have a ton more responsibilities, I look back at being 25 and say, ""Man, life was so easy for me then. I miss that.""

I'm sure in 5 years, when I have kids and even more responsibilities, I'll say the exact same thing about 30.

Not sure why I didn't.  Maybe some of you still young but not as young as you used to be introvert ents can relate:

Hey, just turned 30. Life is a bummer. Then reports came in the northern lights would be visible so I took it as a sign it was time to give our jolly green friend another go 'round but it turns out barely leaving your house for seven years leaves the old contact list a bit empty.

It's Brentwood (NY), I thought. I should be able to throw up a handful of bills, scream ""quarter of dank please"" and have a pocketful of tasty nuggets before the money hits the ground. I asked a waiter who, frankly, looked like a child to my old man eyes if he knew where the good bud was. The polite young man assured me he did but at the promised hour the ashy bastard was nowhere to be found. Just like the aurora borealis.

Day 3 and I loiter at a gas station full of paraphernalia but no one comes inside. Everyone pays at the pump with credit cards. Yet another case of convenient technology ruining human social bonds. Doesn't mastercard know I'm trying get blazed? Will we never be free of their corporate tyranny?

Late night relocation to local bodega. It's across from an apartment complex and full of likely suspects. I mean, there's an always empty 24 hour pizza place next door. The whole strip mall is a front. Discretely and with great panache I strike up conversations. No small task for a pathological introvert who looks like a former linebacker turned mexican assassin. The bodega folks are amused and friendly but coy. Only when I've given up hope does a stock boy tell me he has what I need. We settle on a price and nearby location.

By the dumpsters I wait. Two men approach, their heads swiveling in every direction but mine. They're making me feel overdressed. I wasn't raised on Long Island and so am no stranger to back alley bad vibes. They get about nine feet away before I ask if they know the stock boy. This prompts one of the gentleman to reach into his pocket for a shiny sliver of I don't know what because I broke the fuck out. I never ignore my spider-sense.

Sober and defeated I sit. I'm a grown man, god dammit. All I wanted to do was incinerate a little plant matter while the sun bombards the atmosphere with radiation.

This is why I never leave the house.

tl;dr- 30 year old man without friends tries to find trees; almost gets stabbed at bodega.

EDIT- I am sincerely grateful for all the well-wishing and advice from you fine folks.  It's nice to see people just be people, y'know?  Doesn't always happen that way.

I'm reading this really excellent (though named goofy) book, ""The Pot Book,"" edited by Julie Holland, who's a nationally-known psychiatrist. Anyway, the chapter I just read was basically philosophizing on weed. Here's a quote:

""Pot facilitates intuition, the dishabituation of thought.... This altered brain state has a synchronous relation to human counter-cultural styles. Pot could never be an opiate of the masses. Unlike the numbness of rum or the work uses of coffee, Coke and cigarettes, it won't keep the machines running. Nomadic cultures revered pot because it was a tool for change- for making it and dealing with it: an unsettler. China was first the land of hemp and mullberry, but as its civilization crystallized, cannabis use was discouraged in favor of opium, more likely to keep the kids down on the farm. Pot won't change you physically- there is almost no physical response, no lethal dose. But in its revelation of the habitual and the cultural, it can change your social identity and your self-perception, which are the origins of subversion.""

&gt;Can I ride my bike to Washington to smoke some weed?

&gt;Yes, but you can still get a DUII-Drugs while riding a bicycle. 

Just drive / ride safe guys, be sensibl[e](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/574715_495979360436376_1835706863_n.jpg). They're saying, officially, ""Yes, feel free to go smoke pot in Washington."" Hell yes. You won't see the police department's in also-neighboring Idaho saying that. Just don't drive back impaired enough that you get pulled over, which is common sense.

&gt;I want to go to Washington and get high. What's the safest way to do it?

&gt;Get a designated driver, take public transit, or plan to stay the night in Washington. 

It's nice to see pot use treated like alcohol use - even though you might still be OK to drive yourself back, it's still a nice change in official perspective. They're treating it like a temporary indulgence, not a cardinal sin / crime. That's awesome, and how it should be.

&gt;Can I bring marijuana into Oregon from Washington if I have a medical marijuana card?

&gt;Yes. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows for card holders to possess certain amounts of marijuana. It does not dictate where card-holders can get it and there are no changes to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program because of Washington I-502. 

Awwwww yeahhh

They also said when in Washington watch out for feds:

&gt;The Portland Police Bureau cannot predict or control the enforcement activities of federal authorities.

The bulletin notes that Portland police do not prioritize enforcing the citations of less than an ounce of pot (in fact, it's their lowest priority - wink wink).
It's like they're on Washington's side, I seriously think they're just waiting for Oregon to legalize it too.

Good sign.

One more excerpt:

&gt;Can I get a violation for being stoned [in Oregon]?

&gt;Unless you are operating a vehicle (bicycles included), you cannot be cited for consumption of Marijuana.

""Go get stoned in Washington and come back to chill! Just don't have the pot any more when you get back - put all of it inside you! Baked as shit in Oregon? We're cool!""

1349898316.0,181,self.eldertrees,119o9c,My experience with Cannabis,218,37,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/119o9c/my_experience_with_cannabis/,"I read a lot of posts like ""how cannabis changed my life"" etc., etc. and as I am sitting here alone this evening I start to think about the past 3 years. I used to be a ""normal"" person without girlfriend, just minding my own business and trying to do my best in school. I already thought about life and the universe back then but not the way I think about it now! I was more like an ""everyday life-dude"" and time passed quickly until my best friend introduced me to my (now) girlfriend. My life changed dramatically! Suddenly I didn't play video games all day long and I slowly started to appreciate going out with friends, having a real talk whilst drinking a cool beer and other stuff. Sadly it was the time when school made me learn quite a lot and I was thrown back again. Before I finished school my best friend introduced me to another thing which changed my life dramatically for a second time. It was, as may be imagined, cannabis! My first reaction was: ""Hell no, I don't do such drugs!"" (I was a bit ignorant!) but after some research I came to the conlusion that I should give cannabis a try because it's a controllable drug that doesn't kill your brain cells. We smoked 0.6g in our metal-pipes we bought earlier and I felt a little buzz and liked it! Now, a spoon, bubbler, bong and finally SSV Vape later I changed a lot...

It's not easy to describe the change. I often try to explain it like this: In the past I saw everything very superficial. After a lot of awesome sessions with my best friend (after vaping some bowls we always talk about philosohpy, psychology and science in general) I can rethink of various mindblowns we had. Not only ""my god this food tastes awesome"" - mind blowns but real enlightenments. Animals, plants, water, earth, wind, chemistry of life and death, everything is rational and follows a certain logic. 
We tried edibles 2 times already without success and one evening we sat down again to try a third time. 1g of fresh greens, so 0.5g for each. Suddenly my best friend said: We're going to waste 1g (7€) of greens if this doesn't work now. I said: ""I don't want to be part of this monetarian system where people think about wether an experience is worth the money it costs. This is our life, let's do what we want to do!"" - well the edibles didn't kick in but it was the right choice!
When I think about humans and their behaviours now, it makes me laugh and cry. We're just animals with a really complex society. 
We can see light waves reflected by the objects around us, we can hear sound waves ejected by whatever makes noises around us. We can feel sb. touching us because certain receptors get activated and send information to our brain, a meatball of insanity.
Whatever happens in life, I don't care wether I will succeed or not. I am an entity of things born in a huge explosion. I'll just try to be part of the universe as I research our earth as a geoscientist.

I want to know and I want to be, that is all!

thanks for reading!

Will this matter in 1 year?""",205,28,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/y76ym/feeling_worn_down_and_stressed_to_do_worries_of/,"Last night I was having a nice peaceful session, and I happened to be watching some news program discussing the upcoming Presidential election. I began thinking, but not about politics or the future of this country, I thought back to 4 years ago ... remembering exactly where I was and what I was doing when it was Obama and McCain going for the White House.

Four years ago, I was living with a buddy who I didn't get along with. I was working a low paying job that barely gave me enough to pay bills and get by. I was single. I was bitter. I was stressed over life as a whole.

I thought back about the things that I thought were ""huge deals"" at that time. I specifically remember having countless sleepless nights over issues related to pleasing my boss at work. I remember tossing and turning trying to figure out how I was going to make rent the next month, and whether I had any hope for a financially comfortable future. I have memories of various other things that, while horribly important to me at the time, now hold absolutely no significance in my life.

I then thought about my worries of today. I'm at a completely different point in my life. I now live with my girlfriend, I don't work a crappy job that barely affords me to pay the bills ... I actually am now self-employed, working in an industry I've dreamed of being involved in my entire life, and making more than enough money to survive because of it. I still have things that worry and stress me, but then I thought to myself, ""In four years, how many of these things will matter?"".

Upon thinking of that, I was covered with a blanket of peace.

In four years, the stress involved in knowing I need to clean my basement this week will be laughable. In four years, the worry about having to get my car checked will be a moot point. In short, the things that can cause me stress and sleepless nights nowadays will be insignificant ... so why cause them to have a significant impact on my life now?

I'm not saying ignore life's problems. That's not the point at all. Procrastination and denial can snowball and cause minor issues to turn into major ones, I'm simply saying one should change their approach for how they handle these minor issues. Don't stress about them, don't think they're the end of the world ... because they're not.

Life is a book that normally runs 80 or so chapters. I'm on chapter 30 right now, there's alot more that needs to be written, and the story can change dramatically along the way.

I hope this may have been inspirational or therapeutic for someone. I know just writing it out was therapeutic for me.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_y76ym,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/y76ym/feeling_worn_down_and_stressed_to_do_worries_of/,

So every time I see one, I tweet or email the author and tell them to stop. My favorite approach is to say that it is **editorializing** the story to use such puns. That usually gets their attention. Here is one of my results:

Article: http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/state/Is_Montgomery_Co_senators_push_to_legalize_pot_a_pipe_dream.html

*Melissa,
The pun in the article title is part of a tiresome trend where journalists covering cannabis legislation use puns and jokes instead of giving the facts. Perhaps it is because you and your colleagues are nervous reporting on something illegal at the federal level. 

If you would kindly not use puns of this nature in your future articles on the subject, I'd be much obliged. I don't consider it professional. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is editorializing, making light of an issue which affects millions. 

Also, there is a typo: ""However, legalization marijuana for medical use has widespread bipartisan support.""

Thanks,*

Her response:
*I appreciate your feedback and for making me think about why I chose
to use a pun in this story.

I agree that this is an issue that affects millions of Americans,
which is why I thought it was worthy to cover Sen. Leach's plan in the
first place. I don't feel nervous about reporting on something that is
federally illegal, but I do think I wanted the article to reflect the
uphill climb that Leach's proposal has in Pennsylvania. Perhaps I
could have found a more eloquent way of doing so, and I will think
about your comments in the future as me or editors insert puns into
stories on serious topics.

Appreciate the feedback, again, and the willingness to reach out,
Melissa*

The one I work at most is very part-time through Recruiter A and no drug test was required.

Last week Recruiter B called me about an amazing opportunity for a 2 month long assignment making a mind-boggling amount of money. We talked about the requirements for the job and I told her about the MMJ. She said just take your medical card with you when you get tested. She sounded like it was such a non-problem.

Then today Recruiter A called me about a 4 day long assignment. Normally such a short-term assignment wouldn't require anything BUT this place is part of a very large national company and they require both drug testing and a background check. Background checks, no problem whatsoever (I lead such a boring life LOL) but I again mentioned the MMJ and she, like Recruiter B, said just take your medical card.

So I'll probably go in and get that drug test today. And find out if the recruiters just have no idea what they are talking about.

The entire issue honestly ... makes me angry. I could take oxy for my pain, it would come up on a drug test and all that would happen is a doctor would verify that it was a valid prescription at the pharmacy and that would be the end of it.

However, because I choose to not go the route of highly addictive pills, it makes life much more uncertain for me. The hypocrisy is astounding. 

**Update**: My recruiter asked for my permission to talk to the client about it and ask them how they would feel. I figured you know, this is a 4 day assignment that pays barely more than minimum wage. I'm not going to be heartbroken if they say no. On the other hand, I was kinda hoping that the client being an *oncology* clinic would weigh in favor of them being ok with it. And they are.

As you already know, meeting up with Internet strangers has a certain element of danger. Meeting up with Internet strangers to do illegal drugs is, of course, that much more dangerous.

I just want to make some things clear: While not against the rules at this time, I do not personally endorse using this subreddit for high risk meet-ups. 

If you choose to use this as a place to meet people, you do so **at your own risk.**

If somebody has contacted you to meet-up, and you're not comfortable with it, you have two options:


**1)** Refuse. Thanks, but no thanks. End of conversation.

**2)** If you feel the user could be a danger to the subreddit, message the mods **through modmail.** We will investigate to the best of our limited abilities.


What you shouldn't do? Anything else.

If you try to ""out"" another user as a possible narc, **you will be banned without warning.**

Why? Because:


**A)**It's impossible to defend yourself from such an accusation. How do you prove that you're *not* a narc? 

**B)** If the user actually was a narc, they could just create more accounts. 

**C)** The only thing you can possibly succeed in doing is creating a hostile environment for that user.

**D)** Half of us are high and a little paranoid when we browse this subreddit anyway. Encouraging that paranoia is just going to make browsing an unpleasant experience. 


...It's just a nasty form of harassment, and it will not be tolerated.

This is a public subreddit. There's always the possibility there could be narcs among us. Be aware of that when you consider arranging meet-ups, yes, you could be walking into a trap. But unless you *actually* meet up with that person and get arrested, you have no evidence and there's no point in starting a smear campaign.

The commercial itself doesn't contain any of their 'facts' but it encourages kids to learn through Above the Influence. As many of you know, AtI has outdated, disproven facts. Looking at their marijuana fact page, it basically says if you smoke you'll become [stupid.](http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/facts/drugsmarijuana/) I have no problem with teaching kids to make informed, responsible decisions. That's how I approached marijuana when I tried it at 16 and that's how I want my siblings, kids, nieces and nephews to approach it. With that in mind, I'm thinking we should use our number strength and call AtI out on their scaring kids straight tactic. Both a friend and myself posted on their facebook page calmly and peacefully asking why they insist on keeping kids misinformed with scare tactics. Neither of us got a responce, they just deleted our posts. I think with R/Trees and R/Eldertrees help, at a certain time and date, we could all post a similar non-threatening message on their facebook. They can't delete 250,000 posts easily. 

The message (which I'm open for new suggestions or edits) should say: Dear AtI, why are you misinforming people about certain drugs? I, as a legalisation and medical supporter, feel that your facts are incorrect and outdated and you are unfairly using scare tactics to steer young people away from cannabis. I am in complete agreement that people should make informed, responsible choices but they should have correct, truthful unbiased facts with which to do so. Please use facts backed up by studies to inform young people accurately about the pros and cons of marijuana rather than propaganda and misinformation.
 
It's clear, it's civil and it's true. Maybe it's a bad idea, but I hate the idea of AtI getting to my little sister. Thanks for hearing me out, and if you like the idea please uptoke for visibility. It's a self post, so there is no karma whoring going on.

**EDIT:** Citing links proving our points in our posts

**EDIT:** The date for this is going to be Friday, June 8th at 4pm Eastern Standard time. We will use the message in this post, though I strongly urge you to post any pro-marijuana studies as well. Personal stories. Make them realize we're people, make the kids realize our lives haven't been destroyed after trying a joint. Remember, if we don't try the only option is failure. Tell your friends, family, peers. I believe in us, and I believe in our cause.

If the cops come to your house and smell Marijuana, or a Bong, or ANY paraphanelia they can and WILL charge you. 


Alaska has a bunch of lovely laws to slam on you if you use, possess, display, or etc. etc. any amount.

Misconduct Involving Controlled Substances: I - VI degree.

Anything under an ounce ( I got pinched for .2 grams ) is a MICS - VI. 

1 year probation. 

**so why does it say its legal to grow up to 25 plants?!**

because above 25 and its federal. Under 25 and its deemed a state level crime.

Alaska has a ""RIGHT TO PRIVACY"" STATUTE that will get charges dropped **if you can afford to hire an attorney and take it to trial**.

You will argue it happened in your own residence, and therefore they were intruding upon your privacy. This will get the charges dropped.

**tl;dr:  If you can afford to hire an attorney and have him present Alaska's ""RIGHT TO PRIVACY"" law as your defense in court, then you can get the charges dropped. Its not legal, its a loophole. If you can't afford an attorney, you are not safe.**

1343526610.0,154,self.eldertrees,xbo2j,The Evolution of a Stoner and How to Smoke Weed: A  Philosophy,193,39,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/xbo2j/the_evolution_of_a_stoner_and_how_to_smoke_weed_a/,"Distclaimer: This is a long article.  I wrote this article for you guys about a lot of things I’ve been thinking about. I’m not going to ask you to read it, but for those of you who feel like learning something , you might get some use out it.  

Chances are you know how to smoke weed. Pack. Light. Inhale.  Doing so, you release your brain of the stresses on your mind, and replace it with creativity, and wonder.  Getting high. I’m not writing this about ways you can smoke weed to get you the highest. I’m writing this about how you can get the most out of your high, far much more then just an ordinary head-rush.

First off, stop smoking right now.  That bowl sitting next to you…save it for later. If you’re high, concentrate a little extra more. If you’re about to get high, post-pone your sesh for later; read this first.  If you’ve been for a smoking long time, then you might be familiar with the habit of smoking up after a day of work because it helps you relax.  After smoking a few bowls or joints, you might eventually sit down at your computer and restart yesterday’s task of visiting all your favorite websites such as r/trees.  After all, it is indeed fun, and why not do it every day.  But after you come down, you’ll have to be returned to reality just like every morning when you wake up and get out of bed.  There lies an issue, those two similar feelings.  Both of which, are regular activities.  I can tell you right now, only one of them actually should be regular, sleep.  Not smoking.  I know, it sounds down right rude to tell people how to smoke. But I can guess that right now you don’t feel the same way you do about smoking as you did when you first started.
	
I’ve smoking at least once a day for since around August of last year.  Sometimes I bought more, sometimes I bought less.  But I can tell you at some points I was going through an ounce a month. (Now again, some of you may smoke more but that’s beside the point.)  This is too much. Period. Obviously my tolerance went up a lot, but I always got a least a little bit high and I always had a good time with my friends.  It wasn’t until recently I had to stop.  And I did, I gave up smoking.  I couldn’t keep up with my friend’s amounts, I had to focus on school as it’s getting harder, and I just never even had money.  Dealing with all of these issues eventually forced things to come to a head and I decided to quit, at least for a little while.  Let me both tell you and warn you.  It sucks. Knowing how much fun is.  You feel left out of the circle when you have to pass the bong to the next person in the rotation without even hitting it yourself.  But once you get over it, even in a similar process of that when you break up with somebody, it becomes normal.  That’s when I eventually started smoking again; when it became no big deal to say no to a fat blunt.  Since then, I feel as if I transformed from an ordinary college student reminiscent of the guy from the Nickelodeon show, Totally Kyle, into a somebody a little more like Yoda.

If you’re still with me, I’ll get more to the point.  If you do this process, this phoenix-like process, dying and restarting your inner-stoner, you will learn so many things to help you live and appreciate life with such an elevated appreciation.  The first time I got high after I quit, as you can guess, I got pretty high.  The familiar and missed sensation of being high. But something had changed. Something was there that wasn’t there before.  I felt as if I had this pure ball of happiness inside of my chest that had me smiling from ear to ear.  And it had nothing to do with my love of the great physical high that I was feeling (the famous “shutter-visioned” high).  It had more to do with the complete understanding and acceptance of how awesome my life is.  Now don’t take this in as a brag, anybody can have the same feeling regardless of where they are in there lives.  What I felt was the ability to take nothing for granted, I was thankful and I appreciated everything all around me.  This beautiful, serene feeling stuck with me.  Not in the same magnitude (though I eventually learned how to control the magnitude), but I remembered the feeling very well in the following weeks. It had a strong impact on me is what I’m trying to say.  And because I remembered it, I was able to extrapolate and interpret the feelings as time went on.  The more I learned and understood them the more I was able to feel them.  Just by realizing these thoughts and feelings I began to appreciate anything and everything around me.  I learned to accept bad times in your life and bad feelings as periods of growth.  You can’t live life to it’s fullest if you shield yourself from it’s negative aspects, for they are just as much part of life as good things.  I’ll let you learn your own feelings and thoughts on your own.  But I want to stress how great smoking can help you access these feelings in the first place.  Weed is a wonderful thing, where music becomes a feeling and expression, where eating can be an experience to love, and opening your mind is like opening a book to learn from.  You just have to go deep enough. 
It’s this kind of person who loves and lives life to it’s upmost potential and it the kind of person I think everyone is capable of and who I think you, r/trees, would appreciate the most,

From,
A fellow Ent.

1345331867.0,150,self.eldertrees,yg5iw,A guide to getting involved in marijuana law reform ,165,15,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/yg5iw/a_guide_to_getting_involved_in_marijuana_law/,"Posted this a little while to /r/trees where it got buried, thought elder trees might appreciate it more.:

I feel there are a massive amount of people out there who truly want to contribute to trying to legalize cannabis in their community but don't know how they can do it. They either don't know where to start, worry about putting their name behind something involving the taboo of drug use, or have other concerns. The goal of this guide is to allow people to contribute to the movement to their best of their abilities regardless of where you live, how much free time you have, your age, or anything else.

**General tips:**

* **ABOVE ALL ELSE, Educate yourself!** The truth about cannabis will set us free, so get your hands on any knowledge that could be useful to legalizing cannabis, whether it be about health, public policy, sociology, race, botany, psychiatry, etc..,. Check out the 'Further Reading and Information' for a good place to start.

* **You're going to have to be bold.** Regardless of the level of involvement, you're going to have to step outside your comfort zone in one way or another. But in the end, it will not only help the overall goal, it will enrich your life and make you a deeper and more productive human being. 

* **We're allowed to disagree with each other as a movement.** We can disagree on the details of what the post-legalization world will be like and how the future laws will be, we just have to agree that pretty much any post-legalization scenario would be better than the status quo. 

* **We have to be willing to compromise to a degree.** One of the reasons alcohol prohibition failed (other than it being a terrible idea), was that the ""wets"" (pro-prohibitionists) were unwilling to budge in the least on their ideals. We have to realize cannabis prohibition is not going to end overnight, and we must be tactical with our efforts. 

* **Don't lie or make up statistics.** We don't need to stoop to the prohibitionist's level. If someone makes a good point, acknowledge it. If you don't remember a stat, don't make it up. Be rational and reasonable at all times, don't claim cannabis will solve all our worldly problems, and make sure your stats and argument have a legitimate source to back them up.


**Organizations**:

* [Drug Policy Alliance](http://www.drugpolicy.org): A very influential organization that works towards making policies regarding all drugs based in science, compassion, and reasoning. Led by my personal hero and Harvard Law Grad [Dr. Ethan Nadelmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Nadelmann), the DPA, to put it simply, has their shit together. On Cannabis..:
&gt; The Drug Policy Alliance advocates for the elimination of criminal penalties for the adult use of marijuana, the creation of a legal regulatory market for the production and distribution of marijuana, and the establishment of laws that provide and protect access to medical marijuana by patients. 
&gt; DPA’s reform advocacy includes drafting and promoting state and federal marijuana laws, managing state-based ballot initiative campaigns, aggressive, high-profile media work, and providing legal, policy, and communications resources and expertise to patients, activists, journalists, litigators, and elected officials.  We supply honest, evidence-based information and analysis about the realities and consequences of marijuana prohibition, the potential social and health effects of marijuana use, the current scientific and medical research, and smart policy alternatives to the failed prohibitionist approach.


* [Students for Sensible Drug Policy(SSDP)](http://ssdp.org/): An International organization for  looking to end the War on Drugs. From their website:
&gt; We are the only international network of students dedicated to ending the war on drugs.  At heart, SSDP is a grassroots organization, led by a student-run board of directors. We create change by bringing young people together and creating safe spaces for students of all political and ideological stripes to have honest conversations about drugs and drug policy. 

SSDP does an amazing job at pushing the envelope while still being respected by school administrations. They basically aim to operate in such a respectable and classy manner that schools have little to do but respect their right to speak openly, as well as lobby the public and officials. I am the current President of my University's chapter and could not praise the organization enough. Check out their website and get in contact with them if you're even considering starting a chapter or getting involved, the national office is full of extremely kind and knowledgeable people. They also have yearly conferences that are awesome, and you may be able to get funding to attend these conferences from your school if you're organization is school-recognized.

* [Marijuana Policy Project(MPP)](http://www.mpp.org/): From wikipedia:
&gt;The Marijuana Policy Project, or MPP, is the largest organization working solely on marijuana policy reform in the United States in terms of its budget, number of members, and staff. Its stated aims are to: (1) increase public support for non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies; (2) identify and activate supporters of non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies; (3) change state laws to reduce or eliminate penalties for the medical and non-medical use of marijuana; and (4) gain influence in Congress.

* [National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws(NORML)](http://norml.org/): One of the oldest and well known pro-cannabis groups, NORML is a great resource. From wikipedia:
&gt; Since its founding in 1970, NORML has provided a voice in the public policy debate for those Americans who oppose marijuana prohibition and favor an end to the practice of arresting marijuana smokers. A nonprofit public-interest advocacy group, NORML represents the interests of the tens of millions of Americans who smoke marijuana responsibly.

* [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies(MAPS)](http://www.maps.org/about/mission/):
&gt; MAPS' mission is (1) to treat conditions for which conventional medicines provide limited relief—such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, drug dependence, anxiety and depression associated with end-of-life issues—by developing psychedelics and marijuana into prescription medicines; (2) to treat many thousands of people by building a network of clinics where treatments can be provided; and (3) to educate the public honestly about the risks and benefits of psychedelics and marijuana.
MAPS is founded by [Dr. Rick Doblin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Doblin), who once did a [video AMA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj0xySL-pIQ).

* [Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP)](http://www.leap.cc): An organization comprised of current and former law enforcement officials who are against the War on Drugs.  From their site:
&gt; We believe that drug prohibition is the true cause of much of the social and personal  damage that has historically been attributed to drug use. It is prohibition that makes these drugs so valuable –  while giving criminals a monopoly over their supply. Driven by the huge profits from this monopoly, criminal gangs bribe and kill each other, law enforcers, and children. Their trade is unregulated and they are, therefore, beyond our control.


* [Moms for Marijuana](http://www.momsformarijuana.com/):
&gt;Moms for Marijuana is a grassroots network and organization of parents and other citizens across the world who are concerned with the ignorant war that continues to be fought against the Cannabis (Hemp or Marijuana) plant, and how it is negatively affecting the future generations of this earth.

**How you can help:**

* **As mentioned before, join an organization!**

* **Lobby politicians.** You may have an opinion on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of your government officials, but they're all we have. So if you vote, vote wisely, and contact your legislators in a variety of ways in support of pro-cannabis bills. They actually do listen to their constituents many times, as they want to be re-elected and often have no strong opinion one way or the other on many bills. Present yourself in a respectable manner and rely on logic and statistics, and even if they refuse to listen, they'll look bad to the neutral observer.

* **Help educate the public.** Counter any ignorance you find online or in real life. If you feel comfortable enough, write letters to the editor of local papers in support of reforming cannabis laws. Attend rallies, protests, and other events. And most importantly, encourage your friends to get involved and educate them. 

* **Speak with your wallet.** Even if you don't have the time or abilities to get involved, you can still donate to the cause. Most of the listed organizations above take donations or have paid memberships available. You can also donate to political campaigns that feature cannabis friendly platforms. Even if you just save up spare change from blunt purchases or throw a dollar in a jar every time you pick up, every cent helps!

(X-post from R/Trees) ",164,18,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/sdswa/420_viral_facebook_marijuana_fact_post_pleas_read/,"Hello fellow ENTs. Our wonderful holiday is only 4 days away, and I'm sure you are as excited as I am. I had an idea of something we could do to use the momentum of 4/20 to spread some knowledge about cannabis and support legalization. 

Everyone has seen the viral posts that people spread on Facebook to support things such as breast cancer awareness. I think we should raise awareness for the legalization of cannabis this 4/20 by all posting some true facts on our Facebooks. 

I have compiled a list of 10 facts about marijuana that many people don't know, and would probably greatly change their opinion on the substance. I could use assistance editing them, and providing credible, scientific sources for each one. Here is the list I have made, with a short introduction. 

Today is 4/20, which is known by many of you to be a marijuana holiday. Although 54% of Americans have admitted to trying pot, and the majority of citizens in support of legalization, cannabis prohibition is still being fully enforced. Considering the relatively safe nature of cannabis, prohibition is a gross infringement on our civil rights. Remember, you don't have to be a marijuana smoker to realize that prohibition is completely unjust. Here is a list of 10 TRUE facts about marijuana, just a few of the many reasons why cannabis should be legalized. 

1: Marijuana has never caused a single death in almost 5000 years of recorded use. Where as Alcohol kills 85,000 people a year, and tobacco kills 435,000 people a year. 
Sources: http://www.ukcia.org/culture/history/chrono.php

2: Marijuana does NOT kill brain cells. This myth stems from falsified experiments/studies in the 1960's, and has since been debunked and proven false by several scientific studies. 

3: Marijuana is NOT a physically addictive drug. Its use can be habitual, but users of the drug, when deprived of it, will not suffer any physical withdrawal symptoms. Although Some chronic daily users might notice some symptoms from discontinue use due to the changing states of consciousness, such as loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. This is akin, but less severe, to a coffee drinker stopping caffeine intake. 

4: Marijuana is NOT a gateway drug. Many studies have proven that There is no property of the plant that makes the user more prone to use other substances. It can, however, be a gateway to other drugs because prohibition itself forces marijuana into the black market, where dealers can offer the buyer other 'harder' drugs when purchasing marijuana. Legalization greatly reduce this risk. 
Sources: http://www.drugpolicy.org/facts/drug-facts/marijuana-facts

5: Marijuana does NOT lead to mouth / lung cancer. Although all smoke contains carcinogens, there has never been a case of a marijuana only smoker developing lung or mouth cancer caused directly from cannabis smoking, even with chronic daily use. Smoking isn't even necessary for marijuana consumption, with alternatives such as edibles and vaporization. Recent medical studies have actual shown that marijuana use can slow, and even reverse the growth of cancerous tumors. 
Sources: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html


6: Marijuana has been proven to be an effective treatment to many physical and mental diseases. It is often able to remove the need for, or greatly reduce the dosage of prescription drugs. A few examples include cancer, AIDS, Crohns disease, anxiety, PTSD, glaucoma, and depression. 

7: The prohibition of marijuana costs the US $7.7 billion a year. If it was regulated and taxed like alcohol or tobacco, the US could gain $20.9 billion from tax revenue from sale, tax revenue from marijuana related business's, and savings from law enforcement and prison costs for arresting and prosecuting non-violent marijuana related crimes. 
Sources: http://www.drugsense.org/cms/wodclock

8: The hemp plant has a wide variety of uses. From textiles, to paper products, to clothing, to livestock food, and bio fuels. 

9: 8 out of 10 of The states that have already legalized medical cannabis have seen a decrease in youth (ages 12-17) usage. Government regulation removes business from the black market, and makes it more difficult for minors to obtain marijuana. 
Sources: http://i.imgur.com/xbVPt.jpg

10: People under the influence marijuana are much, much less likely to commit a violent crime than those under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. 

Copy and paste this to your status if you support the legalization and regulation of marijuana. Users and non-users alike, let us join together to fight for our civil rights and finally have marijuana legalized! 



Thank you all for reading. Please comment and let me know if there are any edits or changes I should make to the post. Also, please help me gather sources for all of these facts, and possibly some pro-legalization websites to attach to the bottom of the post. 

Please uptoke for visibility so we can actually make this happen. And most of all, please post this on your Facebook on 4/20 if you can. I will repost this in eldertrees again on 4/20 to remind everyone.  Thank you everyone. Let's spread the knowledge of our wonderful plant!

TL;DR : We all love marijuana. Let us spread some knowledge of cannabis for 4/20 and post this list of true facts on our Facebooks. Comment if you have sources or edits for me.

I'm not asking for a hookup (this is not the place and there are people I can call if I'm desperate), but I find it so hard to keep a consistent dealer now that I'm approaching 30. 

Most of my friends my age just don't smoke anymore. Being in a non-medical state means they would rather just drink and avoid potential complications with the law. I find it hard to befriend younger smokers because they don't fully trust a clean cut older guy and I don't have a ton in common with many of them. 

Dealers come and go, but they've been going a lot more than coming lately and it's a hassle. Sorry to vent on you guys like this, I'm just annoyed about this today.

I've noticed that I've been smoking more and more so I created some set of rules for myself.

I smoke about an ounce per month (which isn't a lot but it's just under a gram/day). I've noticed myself becoming somewhat unmotivated/lazy.

So what I did was set a rule that if I do not do some type of workout that day (running, weights, etc) for at least 30 min then I am not allowed to toke up.

Anyone else do something like this? If so, has it helped?

He called me this morning asking if I remember a conversation I'd had with my mom Friday night. When I said yeah he told me to come over. He had two grams and wanted my help trying it. I had my mflb on me, so I had him rip a trench and see how that did him. Well, it was wonders. His eyes cleared up, he could walk around without pain, and his hands stopped shaking. He shed a few man tears, nothing I could hold against him. He thanked me profusely, and apologized for how he treated me. At that point what anger I still had fell away. It stopped mattering at all. I started crying, too. I told him it was alright, I hadn't been the easiest kid to raise. I said what he did made me who I am and without it I might not be as strong as I am. I had realized he, almost literally, forged me into the man I am. I forgave him then and there and it feels like a mountain's fallen off my chest.

1355379165.0,128,self.eldertrees,14rtzc,Just wanted to share some Entish wisdom I have learned over the past few years,160,32,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/14rtzc/just_wanted_to_share_some_entish_wisdom_i_have/,"I would post this in /r/trees as it might be more beneficial for a younger crowd but it would end up buried and it is equally applicable to all of us regardless of age. I wanted to share a few lessons that I have had to learn the hard way so hopefully others here won't make the same mistakes I have. Most of this will only be applicable to people living in non-legal states, especially those in the south where I live, where marijuana laws are strictly enforced.

First be aware that what you are doing is illegal, and you can and will be put in jail. It is very easy to become lackadaisical about trees because we do it so often, it is relatively harmless, and most people just don't care if you smoke. However, the police do care, and if you are arrested you will be put in jail and it is going to cost you a lot of money (I have been arrested for possession of less than an ounce twice and after all was said and done I have spent over $10,000.00 as a result). Furthermore it is difficult to keep off your record, and even if a charge is expunged, law enforcement still keeps a record of it and it will be used against you.

Know that if you are not smoking in the privacy of your own home, you are putting yourself at risk. Be aware of your surroundings, and only light up if you are absolutely certain no one else is around, and even then try to be discreet about it as you never know who may come walking up. I was in the middle of the woods camping at night in what I thought was a remote location, when park rangers accompanied by a drug task force agent came out of the woods, saw my friend rolling one up, and arrested both of us for less than a gram. Now I prefer to take edibles with me on camping trips as they are much harder to detect without a dog.

Just because you don't have anything on you doesn't mean you won't  get arrested. Be careful who you are around as their unsafe habits can get you busted. I was a passenger in a car, the driver pulled out a bowl to smoke. I stopped her and stashed the pipe under the seat. She got pulled over and they arrested both of us, her for DUI and possession, and myself for possession, despite the fact that she claimed it was all hers at the time. If it is within reach, you can legally be charged with possession.

No matter how much you may know or like the person, there is a good chance that they will screw you over legally if it is their own best interests to do so. The aforementioned girl who got me arrested said she was going to claim it and get me off the hook until she met up with her lawyer. He wouldn't let her confess to anything so I got stuck with the charge. Don't assume that someone else is going to do the right thing and fess up and be prepared to hire your own attorney. 

Speaking of lawyers, if you do find yourself in trouble do some research and don't go with the first person who you get a letter from or hear on the radio. After my first arrest my lawyer conned me out of an extra $2500 by telling me we should fight the charge in court and then once I agreed and paid him, miraculously a better deal was on the table from the DA the next day. The second lawyer, a big shot who i paid top dollar for, passed me off to some lackey attorney in his practice and wouldn't represent me himself. I had no confidence in the attorney I was stuck with to win my case and ended up taking a plea deal. Attorneys will tell you up front that you have a winnable case in court regardless, because they want you to hire them, but once they are paid, the last thing they want to do is go to court. It takes more of their time and effort, and they would much rather that you take a deal because it is less work for them. Ask questions up front and get satisfactory answers, and make sure that the lawyer you hire is the one who will be representing you and handling your case from beginning to end. 

Finally, if at all possible, do not drive with anything on you late at night, especially if you, or anyone with you is intoxicated. Later in the evening cops are out actively looking for people who are drunk/high and your odds of getting busted are much higher than in the day time. Also if you are going to drive stoned, do not have anything on you. Leave that shit at the house and it will be waiting for you when you get back. 

Remember as Gandalf would say, keep it secret, keep it safe.

",161,32,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/1aqqba/feeling_some_stress_and_i_need_to_share_with/,"I recently switched from smoking ciggs/smoking trees to vaping only, and the effect it has had on my health has been almost instantly noticeable. Unfortunately my wife still smokes both daily, and it is taking it's toll on her health. About a year ago she had an irregular gyno test, and they told her she has some pre-cancerous cells. Nothing life threatening, but it could eventually need to be surgically removed if it doesn't go away on it's own. The doctor told her to quit smoking to increase the chances that her body would fight it off, and I begged, pleaded, even screamed at her, but still she refused to quit smoking. 

Fast forward to today, over a year later, and we get another call from the gyno. Her test was irregular again, they need her to come in for more additional testing *in three months*. Three months of sitting around thinking,"" Gee, I hope my wife doesn't have cancer. I sure hope she quits smoking ciggs this time.""

I hate the stress this is putting on my life, because I love my wife more than I love myself. She's the most important thing in my world, and I can't imagine losing her. I have mixed about the fact that with all these complications (coupled with the fact that I have a high-risk chemical job) the odds of us having (healthy) children just isn't in our favor. I would like to pass on my genes one day, but we both smoke weed on a daily basis (while watching cartoons and generally loving each other); having kids would mean saying goodbye to all of those things forever. I'm glad the doctor said that worse case scenario this can probably be surgically removed without being life threatening, but the entire ordeal is really stressing me out and making it hard to focus on my work (which is life-threateningly dangerous, focus is important). 

tl;dr: **my wife needs to quit smoking ciggs because of her multiple irregular obgyn tests. I love her and the cancer scares are stressing me out.**


Thanks for letting me get that off my chest, it's really way too personal to talk about with any of my friends in real life, and you guys are the best anonymous friends I have. 


**edit**

I sat down and read this post to my wife, as well as everyone's comments. I really appreciate all the helpful advice and general support, you people are good folk. My wife tells me she wants to get serious about quitting again, and she wants me to help keep her accountable without being overbearing; I think I can swing this. I'm sure everything will work out in the end, and I **REALLY** appreciate the advice from people who have gone through this and turned out OK in the end. I love you all.

1359423979.0,129,self.eldertrees,17guss,If you like having cannabis be illegal then do not read this post,181,52,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/17guss/if_you_like_having_cannabis_be_illegal_then_do/,"I'm trying this yet again on reddit, and so far it's been a tough sell.

Even though I say it below, I AM NOT REALLY TRYING TO MAKE ALCOHOL ILLEGAL.

Sorry for shouting, but even when I spell it out people take the petition literally.

Forgive the wall of text, the TL;DR is sign my petition (at the bottom of this) to help provide ammo in the war against the War on Drugs.

The DEA recently refused to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. They deem it to have no medical value that it has serious risk of abuse and harm. This is the same category that includes heroin. 

A majority of the population disagrees with that assessment. There have been many petitions to the White House to redress this, and all have been summarily dismissed by Gil Kerlikowske, our ""Drug Czar"". If you don't know who he is, or what he believes in, I encourage you to google him and take a look.

I am trying to take a different tactic. I have submitted a petition to the White House to make alcohol a Schedule I drug as well. Before I share the text of the petition here, I would like to explain my reasoning:

  - first and foremost, the intent is to have the petition *be denied*
  - secondly, there is no expectation that this petition would effect any direct change
  - the denial of the petition would require some statement on record of why a dangerous drug should be allowed to be used recreationally
  - any mention of ""drugs"" will be met with the same non-response: they are bad, m'kay?
  - the petition is as brief as possible (save for the obligatory ""think of the children"" bit at the end). This is to minimize any spurious issue that they can focus on and deny
  - the 18th Amendment is used as a model for this reasoning (this enacted Prohibition). This is the only Amendment to ever be repealed.
  - the 18th Amendment is used at ""face value"" to require it to be repudiated by the responder
  - lastly, I don't want alcohol to be illegal -- there is 0% chance of them acting on it if it makes the threshold for response. This is a ploy.

So far I've been met with the following responses:

  - I don't want to sign something that I don't believe in (making alcohol illegal)
  - petitions are a waste of time
  - but I like alcohol!
  - I see your reasoning but I don't smoke cannabis so I don't care

So why do this, and why ask for signatures? Because the cost is minimal (a minute or two of one's time), and that maybe, just maybe,
the response might be useful later in the repudiation of the existing policy. And it can't hurt to try.

The following is the text of the petition itself, as well as a link to sign it. I need 150 signatures to have it be ""public"" on the site itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Make alcohol a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Being that alcohol has no redeeming medical value and currently is estimated to kill at least 80,000 people a year in the US (http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), it is the moral duty of this nation to protect its citizens from this danger.

Making alcohol illegal will reduce crime and curtail consumption, as was very well demonstrated by the addition of the 18th Amendment to the United States constitution.

In order to protect our children from this danger it is imperative that we act quickly to stop this menace from doing any more damage.

Now, I actually do have this disease, but to say that I actually need cannabis to treat it is a bit of an exaggeration - other than excluding certain foods from my diet, it doesn't really affect me much.

The real reason is that I'm sick and tired of buying from dealers (and it is becoming harder and harder to do so). I am a software engineer in my late 20s and none of my friends have connections anymore - I was only able to buy occasionally from a ""friend of a friend of a friend"". It would take hours of calling, texting, and waiting around for the dude to finally come through, and then he'd get all annoyed that I didn't want to smoke a bowl with him after (I drove there and don't like driving high and reeking of weed). In general I find that now that I'm a few years out of college, I don't like associating with dealers - they're shady, unprofessional and not discreet, and often involved in harder drugs.

Not to mention the legal aspect of it. I have a good career, a wife and a baby on the way, and although my city is fairly tolerant, I still don't like to do anything to jeopardize my family or career. I still really enjoy cannabis - its a great way to unwind from a long day at work and I'm finding that I much prefer it to alcohol (no hangover and no calories). With my MMJ authorization, I can now walk down to my friendly neighborhood dispensary, pick up a variety of strains or exotic edibles, and then walk back home without worrying about carrying weed around in my car and getting pulled over. I no longer have to buy a lot and stockpile it because I now have a near-guaranteed supply, and it's always very high quality.

The only issue is that I feel strongly about legalization and I worry that it is unethical to ""abuse"" the current MMJ system like this and could hurt the legalization cause if there are too many others like me (I put scare quotes around ""abuse"" because I don't really believe it is harmful to myself or anyone else to do this, but that is definitely how anti-legalization interests would frame it).

Based on my experience with the MMJ scene here, I am pretty sure I am not alone. Everybody at the dispensaries and the clinic have the same ""nod and a wink"" thing going on and they all use the same code words. Not to say there aren't people who DO legitimately need it, but everyone understands that many of the folks going through there just want to get high and no one really sees a problem with that.

I'm curious what this community has to say. Is this really common and am I worrying about nothing?",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_w72b9,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/w72b9/should_i_feel_bad_for_getting_my_mmj_card_when_im/,

I'm mid 20s, in my last year of graduate school, in the USA. 

I am currently on a rotation that involves me going in at very early in the morning and usually being able to leave before sunrise. Over the past few weeks I have been taking advantage of this and going to the beach to watch the sun come up. I've been thinking a lot lately about one specific personal issue sort of centered around the point of my life. It had been bothering me more and more over the past months. 

This morning I went to the beach and watched [this](http://i.imgur.com/sPhlN.jpg) while smoking about half a bowl. I was just sort of listening to my stream of consciousness when I came to this problem, thought about it in a ton of different ways, and then the answer came to me. And it felt sort of like I had just discovered something amazing. I guess people may refer to this as an epiphany, but that can be a bit hyperbolic. That doesn't matter, because I really felt good about this solution and that it's the right one. And now I feel awesome about life. 

It is impossible to say that it was definitely the cannabis that did it, but I think it certainly helped. The way it alters my thought patterns allowed me to gain insight in a way that not only hadn't I previously considered but that never existed to me in the first place.

We've been pretty good friends, hiking together every week and writing a lot of songs together, good conversations, similar interests, that sort of thing. We'll call him Diddlesnaps, for funsies.

In the last couple of years I started smoking cannabis, and a little under a year ago I started very small time selling, just enough to smoke for free

I became Diddlesnap's most regular hook-up, and tbh he was a terrible customer. He never wanted to pay what I was charging (which was never exorbitant; just enough to break even) and would bitch and moan until I either cut him a special price or gave him an extra couple of grams. I would tell him not to tell anyone I had cut him a deal, and he would promptly tell *everyone,* so all the friends I sold to would be annoyed or offended that he got a better deal than them. Yes, this guy could really be a douchebag.

But the worst part was that Diddlesnaps had no concept of being discreet, no matter how many times I warned him. He would constantly text me or message me on AIM blatantly asking for marijuana, and if I couldn't get to him quickly he would text bomb me. 

I finally lost my patience this week when I was at work, logged onto AIM on my *boss's computer*. He was irritated that I couldn't leave work to sell him weed, so he started IM-bombing me saying ""I need marijuana!"" over and over. I had to block him. 

The next day I told him I wouldn't be selling to him anymore, because he refused to be discreet and I wasn't going to risk legal trouble over such trivial amounts of cannabis. He flew off the handle, called me lots of profanity, and hasn't spoken to me since.

I'm sure the general consensus will be ""Good riddance, what a d-bag,"" but what bothers me is that before cannabis entered the equation, he had been a great friend. 

I guess I'm just looking for some insight, advice, comfort... It feels bad when you think someone cares about you as a person, then prioritizes drugs over you so quickly and easily. 

Have any of my fellow elderents lost friends because of cannabis?

1343140834.0,108,self.eldertrees,x2oos,Trees and Civil Disobedience,139,31,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/x2oos/trees_and_civil_disobedience/,"Last night during a pondering session with my MFLB, I was going through people's arguments against cannabis use and my own justifications for the millionth time.  It got me thinking, why do I put so much effort into trying to prove to the world that my hobby is ok?  Why can't I just treat it like any other crime where everything is hunky-dory as long as I don't get caught?

The answer, I think, is that we don't see it as a crime and we want the rest of the world to have a similar view.  This is important because that's a radically different message to send than ""Fuck tha police, I do what I want!""  If we ever want cannabis to be legal, we need to show society that we're responsible about it even while it's illegal.  This is why we generally discourage teen use, smoking and driving, and otherwise just being an inconsiderate ass-hat about it.  We try to show that cannabis use can be conducive to productive, creative activity, and a person is perfectly capable of making sound decisions under the influence of it.  We act almost as if it's legal already and that there are just certain rules we have to abide by as responsible citizens.  We have to use it in a way that is exemplary to society if they are ever to consider it a legitimate activity.  

One could argue, and many do, that breaking the law is immoral in and of itself.  This is where the idea of civil disobedience comes in.  Not to equate this with the Civil Rights Movement (although I would argue this is a civil right), but I doubt any of us would have a clue who Rosa Parks was if she had just said ""Well I'd better get to the back of this bus.  It's never ok to break the law no matter what!""  No.  She stayed put and openly defied the law, but I don't think there's a civilized person living today who wouldn't say that *she* was right and the *law* was wrong.  The Civil Rights Movement wouldn't have been nearly as effective without civil disobedience like this.  It was a clear-cut example of the people nullifying an unjust rule and replacing it with their own.  In hindsight it was obviously legitimate and those who participated are American heroes, but at the time they got the dogs and the fire hoses.  They were just ""those wild niggers"" on the news that the ""civilized"" people shook their heads at from their white-bred living rooms.  Again, I'm not trying to totally equate that struggle with ours.  Smoking weed is obviously a choice; being black isn't.  Are you seeing the parallels though?  

In civilized society, sometimes we have to be moral pioneers, scrapping certain rules and replacing them with better ones.  It's how progress happens.  After all, how would anyone know weed isn't the devil in plant form like the government says it is if it weren't for the people who didn't listen and smoked it anyway?  What would have happened to all the medical marijuana patients had everyone in the world just taken the federal government's word for it that it has ""no medical value?""  We're doing more than just getting our kicks, society be damned.  We're straining for justice for ourselves and for everyone else, which I find it hard to consider ""immoral"".  We might be ""niggers"" right now, but hindsight will prove us right one day.

I would like to share with all of you a lifestyle change that really made my highs much more enjoyable.

So a few months ago I was smoking quite a bit. During this time I was drinking a lot of coffee/caffeinated beverages (energy drinks), and chewing tobacco (dip). I was definitely addicted to the dip, and kind of used caffeine as a crutch, not necessarily as habit. I needed dip to feel normal/not irritable during the day; it sucked. 

When I was addicted to the dip and consuming all of this caffeine, my time spent high felt very sad. I was always very tired, always thinking about how sad I was, I always got very depressed, and weed turned into something that just was not fun anymore. So I stopped for a while.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I decided to give up caffeine and dip. I haven't dipped in about 2 weeks, and have been very light on the caffeine (only like once a week). Two days ago, i decided to smoke some weed with my friend. It was incredible. I felt that happy go lucky high that I had previously lost. Everything was all right, I didn't once think about anything depressing, and I didn't really get tired at all. It was everything I missed and everything I need in a high.

Now I'm not 100% sure that this lack of dip and caffeine is what made my high so enjoyable, but it might be. So if you're ever in a spot where your highs are just not fun, examine your life habits, and maybe cut some stuff out. You never know what could help.

1360935718.0,111,self.eldertrees,18kvyp,Seeking some elder wisdom about someone close to me who is an addict,128,17,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/18kvyp/seeking_some_elder_wisdom_about_someone_close_to/,"Hello fellow elder ents,

I've been a long time lurker and have seen some great advice given out in this subreddit. It just so happens that I am in need of some now.

My best friend of the last 15 years will be coming up to my house this weekend. We both live in different states so it will be the first time he's been up here in 6 months. We have a very close relationship in that we've both been through some hard times together and can relate to each other on that. 

However about 4 years ago he went to rehab for abuse of prescription pain killers. I knew he used them once in a while but didn't know that it spawned into a daily habit. When he told me, he broke down crying because it really hit him when I told him ""I had no idea"". He had been to my house several times before this and was apparently high and I didn't know it. 

Long story short, he had his slip ups, but he's been clean for the past year and half (as far as what he tells me). We've always smoked together and partied together in high school/college, and he still smokes though he's not much of a drinker. Except I feel like his smoking is getting a bit out of control. I can see his traits as an addict start to take form of his smoking habits. 

For example, he probably smokes about 2 blunts and 5+ bowls a day. He's a laborer and works for the state and that's really all the other people he works with do as well. He's also getting to the point of posting on Facebook when he is smoking a bowl, stating that he is in fact smoking a bowl to some tunes (and we're not in high school, we're both nearing 30). His family knows he smokes, but I feel they would rather have him be doing that then the pills he was doing 4 years ago (as would I).

But I'm worried about him and don't know how to talk to him about it without coming across as hypocritical. I smoke too, usually once every day and a couple times on the weekend. When we used to be together growing up (when I was in college) we would smoke the day out because that's what we did back then. Now, to me I can't do that anymore, just because I don't see a point. But I digress...

So he's coming up tonight, and I want to talk to him about it without being confrontational or hypocritical. I care about him and when I've brought up talk about him smoking 5 blunts a day before I've said ""What about your future man, your kids? Don't you want to be around to see that?"". His response ""I'm living on borrowed time man."" So it's that kind of attitude that I feel is becoming his down fall.

I will smoke with him, although probably not as much as he will. He's a good friend, and I'm just worried about him and about the path he's going down. I just don't want anything bad to happen to him. Any advice from you guys is very much appreciated.

Mason jars are used for pickling, and making jams, they're ideal for preserving things because you can get a very good airtight seal by screwing down the lid.

They collect kief that can be brushed out.

They almost completely eliminate any ability for humans to smell through the jar. Scientifically they do not eliminate smell, and certainly not for dogs. However store and oz in a bag in one part of the house, and a oz in a jar in the other. The difference? One part of your house reeks of weed, and the other doesn't smell like anything.

The herb that goes into the jar comes out of the jar in the same state it goes in. That is to say it doesn't dry out and become flakey like in the bags, if you put herb in the jar that has the perfect texture for rolling or whatever you like (I like it dry enough that it busts off the stemp but also clumps nicely when rolling). HighTimes did a test to see how long they could store some weed in a jar and they kept their weed in it for a few months and it came out okay.

One thing to note is that you want to get as much air out of the jar as possible so if you can fill it with a lot of herb good. Alls to say a smaller jar for smaller amounts is better.

Mason jars come in lots of sizes.

Here's a pro tip. When you buy your mason jars, leave the box of mason jars in your trunk or car, take 1 mason jar that you will be using and now your herb has a home for travel.

Put the herb filled mason jar back in amongst all the others and since it wont smell it will look like you just bought a bunch of mason jars ect...

Meanwhile the USA is full of Gangs that only get by from dealing drugs. How about a little practice what you preach? 

Oh yeah.... I should mention that while they were visiting the Secret Service, and some Military personal couldn't restrain themselves from breaking rules.

",122,22,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/us6v8/teenagers_smoking_marijuana_particularly_daily/,"I grew up being warned about the health effects of using marijuana, especially in adolescence. The cited consequences on the brain has always hit me the hardest. Why would someone choose to affect their *mind*, the thing that makes them who they are? It is their personality, their emotions, their intelligence, their mental health, their entire future. Why risk that?

So now I want to find out if what I was warned about is true, but looking through the one thing I can trust to be honest and unbiased - science. 

I'm going to share some of the articles I found. There's a bunch here, but there are *lots* more that I haven't mentioned or even looked at. I do recommend checking out some of the articles - they're a good read, or looking for some that I haven't included. Feel free to add or critique whatever you want. If anyone has access to more full articles and want to take a closer look, it would be appreciated. 

My personal conclusions from this is that smoking marijuana at a young age is unhealthy and should be discouraged. What do you think?


**Reviews**

[This review concludes ]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037578/?tool=pubmed)
&gt; Decision-making and risk-taking problems aren’t necessarily evident immediately after smoking; however, if cannabis use is heavy and chronic, impairments may emerge that do not remit with abstinence, particularly if heavy use was initiated in adolescence such that maturation of executive functions was not achieved. Acute cannabis use impairs inhibition and promotes impulsivity, and over a period of abstinence, these deficits are most evident in tasks that require concept formation, planning and sequencing abilities. Working memory is significantly impaired following acute exposure to cannabis; however, these deficits resolve with sustained abstinence. Evidence is less clear in regards to verbal fluency abilities; however, research suggests that chronic, heavy use may impact verbal fluency abilities even after long-term abstinence. The long-term effects of cannabis on executive function is most clearly demonstrated when studies use chronic, heavy cannabis users, as opposed to light, occasional users. Yet even occasional cannabis use can acutely impair attention, concentration, decision-making, inhibition, impulsivity and working memory.

[This (spanish) review concluded](http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1726-46342012000100019&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en)
&gt;The use of this substance has been consistently associated with various health problems, many of which have in common a disturbance in the cognitive manifestations of behavior, including memory, attention, emotion and decision making. Well documented evidence that cannabinoids, the active ingredient in marijuana, a negative impact on short-term memory, working memory and decision-making. Moreover, cannabinoids temporarily affect attention and interaction between cognitive and emotion events. These findings help to interpret clinical and epidemiological evidence of problems such as traffic accidents, psychosis, depression, poor educational background and other difficulties with the use of marijuana has been found associated.

[This is a review of the possible mechanisms as to why cannabis use could cause long term cognitive impairments and schizophrenia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361072/?tool=pubmed) 
&gt;All in all, these findings suggest that a downregulation of cortical GABAergic function underlies the effects of CB1R stimulation on cortical functioning. In turn, pyramidal neuron excitability will be increased, resulting in an overall disinhibition of the PFC and dysregulation of prefrontal-dependent processes. Overstimulation of the CB1R over sensitive developmental periods could alter the trajectory of any of the above-mentioned circuits leading to the deficits associated with schizoaffective disorders.

[This review looking for a causal link with schizophrenia found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748375)
&gt;Together, the seven studies were all prospective cohorts and represented 50,275 human subjects … Only one study of the seven did not show a significant association between cannabis consumption and increase of the risk of developing a psychosis. However, this study had some bias, such as low level of cannabis use and the lack of evaluation of cannabis use after inclusion. For the six other studies, data show the existence of a significant association between cannabis use and psychotic disorders (with an increased risk between 1.2 and 2.8 in Zammit et al.'s study), particularly among vulnerable individuals (that is with a prepsychotic state at the time of inclusion). Therefore, all the studies that assessed a dose-effect relationship showed this link between cannabis use and the emergence of psychosis or psychotic symptoms. The fact that all causal criteria were present in the studies suggests that cannabis use may be an independent risk factor for the development of psychosis. Results seem to be more consistent for vulnerable individuals with the hypothesis that cannabis use may precipitate psychosis, notably among vulnerable subjects. In particular, early onset of cannabis use during adolescence should be an environmental stressor that interacts with a genetic predisposition to induce a psychotic disorder.

**Studies**

[An Internet sample concludes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435998/?tool=pubmed)
&gt;Daily use of cannabis does not impair motivation. Its impact on subjective wellbeing is small and may actually reflect lower wellbeing due to medical symptoms rather than actual consumption of the plant.

[This study concludes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10208322)
&gt; that beginning cannabis use during early adolescence may lead to enduring effects on specific attentional functions in adulthood. Apparently, vulnerable periods during brain development exist that are subject to persistent alterations by interfering exogenous cannabinoids.

[This study on non-human primates found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970490)
&gt;Chronic marijuana smoke exposure resulted in an 'amotivational' syndrome--even in weekend-only smokers--that resolved within three months of exposure cessation.
(note, I don't have access to full article. This is from the abstract)

[This study found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12412835)
&gt; that cannabis-associated cognitive deficits are reversible and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use.
(note, I don't have access to full article. This is from the abstract)

[This study using MRI and PET scans found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10772599)
&gt;Subjects who started using marijuana before age 17, compared to those who started later, had smaller whole brain and percent cortical gray matter and larger percent white matter volumes. Functionally, males who started using marijuana before 17 had significantly higher CBF than other males. Both males and females who started younger were physically smaller in height and weight, with the effects being greater in males.
(note, I don't have access to full article. This is from the abstract)

[This study concluded](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12633916)
&gt;Early-onset cannabis users exhibit poorer cognitive performance than late-onset users or control subjects, especially in Verbal IQ, but the cause of this difference cannot be determined from our data. The difference may reflect (1). innate differences between groups in cognitive ability, antedating first cannabis use; (2). an actual neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the developing brain; or (3). poorer learning of conventional cognitive skills by young cannabis users who have eschewed academics and diverged from the mainstream culture.
(note, I don't have access to full article. This is from the abstract)

[This study concluded] (http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/198/6/442.long)
&gt;Our findings indicate that early-onset chronic cannabis users are cognitively impaired compared with controls, suggesting that early exposure to cannabis is associated with more adverse effects on the brain.

Everyday I had a huge guilt trip knowing that I kept a part of my life separate from my parents (who are divorced).  I knew fully well that it was safer to keep my mouth shut, but I honestly couldn’t. I did not want to live my entire life with this weight on my back that only grew as I aged. I cannot live my life knowing my parents never knew all of me. Not only that, I would have had to spill the beans sooner or later. My parents believe I am still pursuing a degree in Biology (which I was for 3 years), but I have secretly changed to planning, public policy, and management (PPPM) so I can focus my time on Drug Policy here in the U.S., and so I can pursue my Master’s in Public Administration with a certificate in non-profit management. Hell, I’m the next leader of my college’s Students for Sensible Drug Policy from Sept. 2012 and on. Cannabis helped me self-evaluate my life. I am honest when I say I never was interested in Biology; I did it to keep my parents happy. I knew I had to tell them before this beast grew larger. 



 	One day, my father sent me an email saying he would like to visit me for a weekend. The email also contained a link to HP’s poor business decisions and its recent layoffs. He wanted him and me to discuss their decision so we had something to talk about. At this point I debated with myself. Do I send him an email that confesses the other part of my life that has been hidden in the dark? Am I ready to discuss my disgust with the War on Drugs and my newly found hobby as a cannabis connoisseur? How do I do this? What is the worst that can happen?   	He wouldn’t kick me out/disown me would he? No, I already live on my own. So I replied to him via email. I sent him a news article that talked about cannabis legalization in Colorado. In the email, I asked that he too should read over it so we can have something to talk about. You know, just an ice-breaker; this didn’t say I supported or smoked weed, but just wanted to keep him up to date with recent events.


   	That’s when shit hit the fan. I received a text wall of copied youtube comments, followed by youtube videos, of how cocaine and opiates are terrible addictive killing machines and the drug user is the scum of the earth. He then compared it directly to cannabis and how it leads to group sex with other drug users, consumes your life, and turns you into a monster. It was all reefer madness arguments sprinkled with his fear that I, his own son, was man who smoked the deadly marijuana.


   	Which was true. I smoke/vape (and will soon cook) with cannabis. But I didn’t tell that to him. I only sent him a news article about the possibility of cannabis becoming legalized in 2013. I was awe-struck. I never saw so much anger, and ignorance, spill out from my own Dad. So I carefully analyzed and deconstructed his arguments. I didn’t know what else to do, and I didn’t want to keep my mouth shut. I was mad at him. And it was a mistake.



   	After our emails, he told the neighbors and his co-workers that I smoked marijuana. They were very supportive to my Dad and were upset about my decisions. He also emphasized that as long as I do drugs, I am not allowed into his house. I asked him about his alcohol cabinet, but I never got a response. I guess he did not consider alcohol as a drug.  


	I knew I fucked up big time. And it was selfish of me. But I just couldn’t bare the weight of denial any longer. I couldn’t look at my parents straight in the eye and lie anymore.

""Thank you for contacting me about H.R. 499, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act.

 

Marijuana possession and distribution currently is prohibited under federal law because it has a high potential for abuse and does not have a proven legitimate medical use.  The Food and Drug Administration has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease.

 

If marijuana is decriminalized, I believe more people would use it and then become addicted to other drugs.  It also would lead to greater profits for drug cartels who would continue to traffic marijuana in the underground market to fund their distribution of drugs like cocaine and heroin.

 

Allowing states to determine their own marijuana policy conflicts with Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce and Supreme Court precedent.  Instead of encouraging the use of marijuana, we should strengthen enforcement of federal drug laws to protect Americans from the devastating effects of drug use.

**FIRST PART: Introduction and a sob story**

My country of origin is a small post soviet shithole called Latvia. Keeping or growing Cannabis plants containing more than 0.2% THC is considered severe crime and such act can and will be punished with up to 15 years in prison and complimentary property confiscation. It's legal to grow and cultivate hemp, however certified seeds are recommended.

The idea of growing Cannabis came to me after quitting job and simply browsing random message boards on the internet while drunk. The concept of growing it seemed very simple and I was curious. Seems like alcohol can be as effective gateway drug as Cannabis.

At some point in life I considered that working hard, with the best intentions, in a work field that requires formal education should earn sufficient salary to be independent, putting enough food on the table and having a feeling of self-complacence as an individual and part of a functioning society. Turns out I was wrong.

I had a white collar job in accounting with some manual labor aspects. I psychologically burned out at the point where I was working 80 hour work weeks with hourly salary equivalent to 1.14 USD or 0.85 EUR ""after taxes"". My employer paid roughly half of my social security taxes he was legally supposed to, so term after taxes is used very vaguely. And this is not even the worst part. Salary was paid monthly and was always delayed for another month or so. With unpredictable income like this imagine covering your daily travel costs, having a place to sleep and wash, having something to eat, being clothed accordingly to your professional status, having a full set of healthy visible teeth and most importantly, pretending to be optimistic about your work duties and life. 

I'll admit that some of the living costs here are relatively cheaper when compared to other more developed countries, but our salaries are not following this ratio by far, so poverty and suffering is almost inevitable for the majority.

Anyway, my stunning career ended when I confronted my employer about the fact that my salary is unfair. In return, I was told that I should be infinitely thankful for even having a job (even if it doesn't pay?) in this economy. Single confrontation about my salary was enough to make the work conditions even more stressful and humiliating. Meanwhile, my degenerate employer was openly doing tax fraud and helping to realize some small time money laundering scheme, but you can't really take that to court if you want to keep your professional reputation intact.

&gt; In summary: I quit my job because of the pressure, overtime combined with extremely small and degrading salary, internal affairs and having to urinate publicly on the street when the closest establishment with free restroom was closed at 4PM. Ended up growing Cannabis for personal recreational use with no prior experience with this plant.

Of course there are few people in my country that do have civilized work conditions and reasonable salaries, but even they consider themselves to be underpaid, which seems funny from my perspective as I'm terrified from committing to a relationship because it could end with pregnancy and a child that would have to live in almost extreme poverty.

In my 20-something years of life I have come to the conclusion that I fucking hate my country and its retarded mentality.

**SECOND PART: Grow diary and first time impressions**

I bought my seeds from ""Pick 'n' Mix Seed Bank"" because they had some good reviews and would sell even a single seed per order. I made the payment using my personal debit card and can confirm that the transaction description is very neutral. Also there is no sign of card fraud up to this date. They use standard, soft, white envelopes and the seeds are packed safely in a DVD case with soft inlay for extra protection.

It seems that customs rarely check the shipments from within EU and getting your seeds found in random close-up examination has chances of winning small fortune in a lottery.
Here are some pictures of the parcel and seed packaging:
[(Picture of parcel front)](http://i.imgur.com/nMh2llN.jpg)
[(Picture of parcel back)](http://i.imgur.com/fgoVjjl.jpg)
[(Picture of seed packaging)](http://i.imgur.com/wxBYEgJ.jpg)

So I bought 3 feminized seeds:
1) Seedbank: Nirvana, Strain: Auto Blue Mystic
2) Seedbank: Delicious, Strain: La Diva Automatic
3) Seedbank: Bomb, Strain: Auto Bomb

I chose autoflowering strains because I was doing partial outside grow with good 2 months before first frosts and these strains promised times from seed to harvest in around 60 days. I should mention that I chose very bad timing for outside grow that would completely depend on sunlight.

Two of my seeds were germinated in wet paper towels and the plant sprouting time was longer when compared to the seed that was put straight into the soil.
[(Picture of sprouted seed before putting it in a pot)](http://i.imgur.com/3Rw9dXt.jpg)
[(Day 5 from seed)](http://i.imgur.com/Nx5yXQf.jpg)

[(Day 25 from seed: Auto Bomb)](http://i.imgur.com/KHHgfsn.jpg)
[(Day 25 from seed: All plants together)](http://i.imgur.com/zLmGoJN.jpg)

At this point I was happy to confirm that all three plants indeed were female. They also had some faint odor. Feminized seeds have something like 99% chance of plant being female thus saving space and grow resources.
[(Day 31 from seed: Some of the first preflowers on La Diva)](http://i.imgur.com/Ha9AInY.jpg)
[(Day 32 from seed: All plants together)](http://i.imgur.com/Ptd7xkP.jpg)

As the flowering progressed, the plants had very distinctive Cannabis odor which is fine for outside grows, but a problem for those who do closet grows. Smell wise Auto Bomb had the strongest one while Blue Mystic had the most neutral one with La Diva being somewhere in between.
[(Day 44 from seed: Early flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/3DD1yUj.jpg)

Around this time I started flushing La Diva and Auto Bomb plants. Trough the vegetation and flowering I was using liquid fertilizer for flowering plants in combination with some multi purpose fertilizer in form of white pellets, but nothing very fancy or exotic.
[(Day 56 from seed: La Diva Flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/s6Ibaqv.jpg)

As some of the buds had matured for the first harvest, I found out that majority of them had significant amount of mold.

La Diva and Auto Bomb had first mature buds around 60^th day after seed. With more light getting to the lowest branches rest of them matured within one week. Blue Mystic actually had longer vegetation period and first pickable bud was around 70^th day.

When drying the buds a single seed fell out. It's a cross between La Diva and random hemp plant. [(Worthless, but still illegal to grow.)](http://i.imgur.com/VfBpzG6.jpg)

Because of the mold I lost very much of my potential yield. Shamefully, I must admit that those three plants yielded something like 15 grams of dry, smokable buds in total. If I took out all the stems I would be left with something closer to 10 grams of smokable flower and sugar leaf mix. But even with a yield so little my total costs were less than the street price starting at 20 USD per gram. Local gypsies sell a bit cheaper weed, but it has very shady origin and distinctive acetone smell. And these are the same gypsies that could be mugging me on the street using a mother fucking scalpel, but I digress.

Auto Blue Mystic turned out to have the biggest yield and the best mold resistance. As you can see in the picture below, the buds turned out to be very airy and unusable for selling purposes.
[(Average look of dry nug from Blue Mystic)](http://i.imgur.com/HnJdhjg.jpg)

All of the trimmings with clearly visible trichomes and molded buds were used to make cannabutter. In total I used 13 grams of trichome covered goodness. The only negative aspect about cannabutter is the awful smell when making it, so well ventilated room is preferable to do this. I melted butter with 80% fat content in a bowl of boiling water, added the plant mass and left it to simmer for 3 hours while stirring it occasionally. After that I left it to cool down. Most of the plant matter sank down and green colored butter hardened at the top for easy retrieval. Butter itself has awful smell and even worse taste, but you only need to add very little of it to any recipe that won't suffer from butter or originally has it in it. When cooking with cannabutter you should avoid too high temperatures as it does degrade its potency. Eating some cannabutter cookies for breakfast would let me experience the high for the entire day so edibles are my favorite in terms of discretion and ease of usage.

First time smoking weed I used carved out stem from my biggest Cannabis plant. It worked great as a small one hitter, but dried up quickly and started to burn a little on every toke, producing very harsh smoke. To get comfortably high I needed something like 1/10 of a gram so it served its function well before I bought some rolling papers. I was surprised that as a non smoker I didn't go into coughing frenzy when smoking weed like I had when trying to smoke a cigarette. I'm not a fan of the smoke taste that autoflowering strains have, but I can't say it was bad as long as I was inhaling it lightly and drawing some clean air along with the smoke. I would love to try vaporizing, but it's something I simply can't imagine affording and makeshift vaporizers seem more like a waste of time and resources.

I think I share the thoughts of majority when I say that using Cannabis for recreational purposes simply makes everything better. Unhealthy obsession with food aside, it's the perfect antidepressant that makes me feel like everything's just right. It lets me forget all the negative emotions like guilt, shame, anxiety and instead allows me to focus on everything good at the present moment. The high is bit lazy, but when having the right motivation, I found myself able to be more creative in ways that I didn't expect from myself, while being relatively shallow personality in everyday life. I'm pretty interested in trying different strains, especially something more sativa dominant.

I believe that using Cannabis recreationally is a great way to relax and feel good at the end of a hard week or month, but when used excessively and on a regular everyday basis it can and will cripple your mental performance.

I don't understand why the fact of alcohol being legal in a country isn't sufficient ground for legalizing or at least decriminalizing Cannabis in the same country? Alcohol is a toxic depressant and is perfectly legal and socially acceptable almost worldwide. Alcohol abuse creates much more suffering to the people around the abuser when compared to Cannabis. People don't die from overdosing and are less likely to become violent or completely inadequate while under the influence of Cannabis. In my opinion it would make more sense to either make alcohol illegal as well or completely legalize Cannabis for recreational use. The fact that so many people use cannabis despite the legal consequences that can potentially ruin their lives proves that intimidation and punishment doesn't justify their purpose. Until then, I might as well legally poison myself with cheap beer and all its fantastic properties. For less than 3 USD I can get drunk to a point where I become extremely depressed or violent and vomit in convulsions so strong that I can't breathe and have a massive hangover for the next day. It makes perfect sense that the only thing that everyone must be able to afford in my country is not food or contraception but dirt cheap alcohol.

Since experiencing Cannabis high I have drastically changed my view on alcohol. I don't crave for a drink like I used to. Now I rather smoke/eat Cannabis every other week or month while having a stash that would let me get high every day if I wanted to for a single month or a bit less, depending how fast my tolerance would build up. In comparison, just a year ago, having a bottle of alcohol simply lying around wouldn't survive more than a day before I would succumb to the temptation. At least in my case Cannabis is the lesser evil if I'm lucky enough to evade the potential legal consequences.

&gt;In summary: Even a complete moron can grow Cannabis with arguably successful results. I neglected my plants in terms of optimal light, temperature, humidity, proper soil and fertilization, but they still turned out good enough to make me high countless times. Before trying Cannabis, I felt unconcerned about this topic, but now I understand that prosecuting Cannabis users and those who grow for personal use does more damage than decriminalization or even legalization would do.

Here are some additional flower pictures from my grow:

**DEAR SUPPORTERS!**

We have had a deal regarding the next 3 months rents at our coffeeshop with the landlord, for a few weeks now. We told them that the rent money would arrive just a few weeks late, since we have had so many unexpected expenses building the place. Pressure from police, construction workers, business partners, politicians and what not has delayed the project unexpected. For those reasons, we informed the landlord that we would be late making the payment. The landlord seemed to accept!

Meanwhile the police has contacted our landlord, it was bastard dirty harry wanna-be, Bjarne Christensen police commisioner. Bjarne tells our landlord, that they face 4 years imprisonment for letting us rent the place. Which naturally worries the landlords a group of 4 partners, so they decided to send us a letter asking for the rent money immediately or face being thrown out.

I want to let you all know, that Bjarne Christensen, the same cop! Was at my coffeeshop a month ago, on that day he found a big piece of hash and in front of everybody he put it in his pocket. 30 minutes later, Bjarne gave back the hash telling us all that they would leave us alone, since our work is harmless, not that criminal and maybe even a help for the police and politicians fight against hardcore gangs.

So Bjarne broke his own laws, he actually broke many, since he was offering me tons of money if I would be willing to rat out people, people that I do not even know who are??? I think he is one evil person, a real threat to any civilized society and I got some of that shit on TAPE - be my guest media!

So what I want to say!

If I do not pay up NOW, I have to move out on monday the 22. nd of oct. - I would never move without a fight, so if I decided to stay here, they have to take me to court before making me leave the adress.

My lawyers say PAY NOW , if you pay now, the landlords are left without a case against you. The pressure from the police is irrelevant since, it is empty threats and an abuse of power.

But you see, I do NOT have the total 205.000DKR which is upfront payment of 3 months rent, taxes, utility bills and other payments that are needed.

THEN - came Danish comedian Omar Marzouk and offered to give me 5.000DKR, then came the local Århus youth office from danish political party Venstre and told me they wanna support us financially as well. I think that FLY filtertips are also looking into helping us out. Cause if we dont pay by friday, we will loose in court next month. This is really unexpected news, it hit us like a hammer to the face. And it is not even an question of the police getting us shut down, it ijust money issues. So those must be fixed. As Omar and VU ÅRHUS told you all, please support us to raise this money. We need it and we need it because then we can continue the freedom fight that we are fighting.

They decided to use dirty tricks and threats, lets show them that we can beat that! Cause we are united! ♥

**TL;DR;** Dude opens a coffeeshop in Denmark and tells everyone he's going to sell weed and run it after the dutch model. 

The Police, Landlords, and everyone important, pretty much tell him that they don't (and can't) directly support him, but won't crack down on him, as long as he keeps it nice and tidy. The police even visit him a couple of times, take some weed, and the give it back to him, telling him that they like what he's doing, and that it would help their work.

1 weeks time ago they made a 180 and all of a sudden the police raided the shop, taking contraband but not issuing fines and threatened the landlords with jailtime, if they don't throw out the coffeeshop, even though they would never be able to sentence them in Danish court. So now the landlords want the coffeeshop to pay up before friday (the 20th), or they will cancel the lease :(

This is corruption and blackmail on the bad end of the scale, and if the shop could just raise the money, they could flip two giants birds to the cops and the landlords, and maybe buy themselves out :)",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_11mn2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/11mn2m/important_smokenhagen_coffeeshop_needs_your_help/,

TL;DR - I cherry picked some of the timeframes for you:
""...A total of 1,271 urine specimens were analyzed by 1D-GCMS from 33 participants residing on the closed research unit during monitored abstinence for 3 to 30 days...

...These participants had a mean ± SD age of 25.2 ± 4.5 years, weighed 173.1 ± 33.2 lbs with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.0 ± 5.3; 6 individuals were classified as obese with a BMI ≥30. These heavy, frequent cannabis users self-reported first cannabis use at 15.7 ± 2.8 years, and currently smoked an average of 3.7 ± 2.3 blunts/joints per day, on 12.5 ± 2.5 days in the last 14...

...Thirty-four of 43 specimens tested positive for a 79.1% detection rate over 25 days...

...Detection times of psychoactive THC and 11-OH-THC in these self-reported chronic users were much longer than previously reported. Last THC detection times after admission to the study ranged from 3 – 24 days for the Persistent THC Group with extensive self-reported cannabis histories of up to 22 years...

...These data demonstrate for the first time that following long-term frequent cannabis smoking, THC and 11-OH-THC can be measured in urine for up to 24 days (using a limit of quantification of 2.5 ng/mL), negating their value as urinary biomarkers of recent cannabis use. These results support the hypothesis of Hunt et al that the rate-limiting step in the terminal elimination of THC is the slow excretion of THC from tissue stores that may be extended following chronic cannabis exposure (Hunt and Jones, 1980)...""

So, Lets put that into perspective. If you have a 20kg dog(45lbs) and have some top shelf weed(buds with around 20% resin content(2) ). You could safely give your dog between 270g and 810g of that dank stuff to your pooch and he/she will not die. 

I don't know about you but I don't have a pound(454g) of weed to give to my dog. 

But if you have the [smallest dog in the world](http://news.softpedia.com/news/World-039-s-Smallest-Living-Dog-67256.shtml) say 650 g then 9.75g - 16.25g would be nonlethal. about half an ounce.

As always Science FTW bitches. 

(edit) Fun fact LD50 of chocolate for humans is 1g/kg making it at minimum 5x more toxic to us then THC is to dogs

I'm not saying to get your dog high. I'm just trying to dispel this misconception that its toxic. whether or not the dog wants to get high is their own choice.

So, I hate to bring negativity to such an awesome and friendly subreddit, but I think this is probably the best place to talk about this. I've recently come to the realization that the only reason I haven't killed myself is Cannabis. I've gotten to the point where I smoke pretty much every night, and a lot of days, because it's one of the only things that makes me content enough that I wont start thinking about suicide again. I'm pretty worried that this might not be a very healthy approach to my situation, but it's working decently for now. One of the great things that comes with Cannabis is the community, like /r/eldertrees . I love how excellent you all are to each other for the most part, it's refreshing. So I guess this is a weird way to say thanks, to the Ents and to the smokers who haven't discovered reddit yet. Hopefully you all keep being just as friendly and helpful to each other, and keep the culture heading in the right direction. I've always been so grateful of how consistently awesome all of the fellow tokers I meet are and it's definitely helped me to be a bit happier.

I've had this before, but when I went back to being sober, those thoughts seemed pointless. 

This is the second time that is happening, and I'm still paranoidal about the a set of similar of questions and I can't find a way to get around it.

I just wanted to shout out here and see if someone else can relate/ advice. I am also very curious to hear your thoughts on paranoia when high. 

UPDATE: I'm finally sober. The paranoia left me once I started engaging in something different. I'm typically an introspective person and love moments of questioning. But all kinds of paranoia arent' the same. I was having a nice evening when a reply to an email I had posted to someone earlier turned up. I shouldn't have read it then, but I did. I started reading in between lines and started dreaming up that the mail was full of stuff against me. I couldn't figure out whether what my mind was telling me was correct. 

When you start imagining that a lot of people you care about are considering you like a fool and laughing at you, and you have an email that has hidden meanings which validate that, that was a shitty kind of paranoia. When I hit these kind of moments, I  typically look to see a larger perspective. Things like the age of the world and compare it to our relatively short lifespans. Human mistakes, vanity and the understanding that everyone else is as imperfect as I am. It usually helps, but this time it fell short and that is when I reached out to you.

Since coming to college i have become gotten very into weed, i live in Ireland so tis'nt legal or medicinal grade or anything, i used to drink every night as a way of self-medicating but i fear that weed has become my new medicine as i smoke up nearly every day. It's great and all and i have found it really helps with my mood swings, helping me become stable in a manic episode and making me feel neutral during a depressive episode but is this a healthy way to deal with it? I REFUSE to take prescribed medication as the side-effects scare me far too much and they mainly control the manic episodes and i dont want to be turned into a hollow, controlled shell of a person.

So Basically im wondering; am i on a slippery slope by using weed to treat my depression? Will it make my depression worse? Thanks for any and all help.

**TL;DR:** 19 y/o Irish chap has shitty depression, too scared of side-effects of anti-depressants to take them so smokes weed but is worried it may have worsening effects on his depression in the long run.

Her first response was, ""How do I even get it?"" 

So the breaking of the news went better than expected however she has not agreed to try it, citing random drug screens due to receiving schedule II narcotic prescriptions.
    I said, ""you know I am no doctor yet, but honestly the use of marijuana medicinally quite commonly alleviates the need for multiple prescriptions and alleviates the pain while also helping you sleep at night. I have found studies and articles I would like to send to you to review including some interesting films."" 

She seemed really interested but hesitant so hopefully we will see what the power of enlightenment will do if she watches the films and reads some articles... Thanks again for your help guys and I still get to keep my allowance! 

TLDR: Talked to mom over the phone about using pot to control her pain. It went better than expected even after admitting use; I still have my allowance.

1.5) Replying ""take it to r/trees (or anywhere else)"" or any other variation of that sentiment to posts that don't violate any posting guidelines is mean and will be flagged as spam. If you think a post is in violation of the guidelines, report it - there's no need to leave a post that makes someone feel unwelcome. **(this one's obvious- just don't be a condescending jerk and tell people to go somewhere else with their posts. If you don't think they belong here, report the post to the mods.)**

2) Please leave rage comics and image macro memes over at r/trees. If you're posting images, make sure they encourage discussion of some sort. **(We're not here for image sharing, we're here for discussion. If your image promotes discussion, you're fine. If not, it's going to get removed. Memes, images of pineapples/pipes/grinders/munchie fuel/buds/people smoking, and anything that's considered karma whorey will be removed)**

3) DAE like [popular thing]? Of course we do, but please leave those posts in r/trees as well! **(Posts should create a discussion or make an attempt to. DAE's are yes or no questions.)**

4) Don't be shy with the posts. Questions for your fellow ents? Awesome highdeas? Please share! **(We don't want you to be discouraged from posts because you are self conscious. If it doesn't break the rules and you want to post it, go ahead. If you're unsure if it would break the rules or not, message the mods. We'd be happy to help)**

5) Please save nude/sexy photos for r/trees or r/treesgonewild. (This does not apply to NSFW comics or artwork.) **(For clarity- art is OK to post. It always brings discussion.)**

6) Please don't hate on r/trees. If it weren't for r/trees, this subreddit wouldn't exist. Threads created to put down r/trees will be flagged as spam. **(We're not a haters club.)**

7) These ""rules"" are subject to change and I will happily add/remove/edit guidelines if anyone has any suggestions to improve it. **([Message us with your comments/concerns.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Feldertrees) We're ultimately here to help, and if you have a suggestion for making this place better, we will talk about it between the mods and see what we can do to help.)**



Thanks again for keeping this place active and helping it grow. Hugs and nugs, frients.


**Edit-** I forgot to add this. Our ban policy is pretty lenient. We will give you every chance to earn your way back in, and ban only as a last resort.

I used to post on another forum before I came to Reddit earlier this year, and that forum was great because I had been on it since 2003.  Only problem was that the forum was targeted to 13-18-year-old children/teens, and they started to get really aggressive with the ban hammer.  That said, I ventured off and found a fantastic place to call home.  A place where we can freely discuss pot, share pictures, and all that.

However, there was one awesome aspect of my old forum.  We used to have TinyChat nights where everyone would go on and have discussions.  We'd smoke together, tell stories, and eventually, we all began to bond.  It was great.  And as such, we all became friends.  One time, we bought one of the guys in the chat a 5 lb gummy worm, and he ate it on cam.  I mean, it was fucking rad.

So how about we set up something like that?  Let's get together on a chat system where you can decide to reveal your identity, whether its your username on here, or something as simple as your face.  I mean, it's the ultimate in privacy.

Just a suggestion.  I'd be willing to join in a weekly smoke session with a bunch of cool people.  Seriously.

Where are the dispensaries that resemble a doctor's office or pharmacy? Why aren't dispensary employees not required to wear standard business casual attire or the public-comforting white lab coats?

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure, which has been lost in my archives for well over a decade. It happened exactly 15 years ago today, to the *minute* (I’ve timed this to publish exactly at 12:15…you will soon see why). 

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, right in San Francisco where it all happened, but I had no idea what I was in for. It turned out to be my first experience with edibles and my first glimpse at the elusive level [11]. Bear in mind that I had thought at that point that all my drug use was way in the past, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), and posted it on my blog/website (yes, some of us really had them even back in those days), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, I remembered this story as one of the best things I had ever written, and a classic example of someone writing under the influence of cannabis. But I couldn’t find it anywhere, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, other than fixing broken links and removing/changing names and such, except the original psychedelic background, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet, but [this is the closest I can find](http://www.hempire.co.uk/showthread.php/45797-Ganja-Goo-Balls-anyone-know-the-recipe?p=815917&amp;viewfull=1#post815917) to what I remember from the ingredients used.
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever,
Old Hippie

P.S. Dedicated to D.T. and all good daddies everywhere.

1366208412.0,72,self.eldertrees,1cj7ad,Anxiety for days after smoking. Fuck.,92,20,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/1cj7ad/anxiety_for_days_after_smoking_fuck/,"I've been smoking regularly for around 2 years now. Every puff was a pleasant happy experience and I used to pride myself about never having bad trips.

In the last 3 months, things started changing. I was experiencing a lot of stress from my work, but till then I used to smoke to get a different perspective of the world and it used to help. But now smoking was inducing ever more paranoia and anxiety. 

The anxiety is all about work, how I might be letting down others at work (which when I evaluate when I'm sober, I'm not. I'm doing a good job). How others are perceiving me. How me smoking instead of working at that moment is not okay. I work in a tech startup, and our definition of life and work is very blurred. My expectation on what I should be doing and how productive I should be becomes at odd with my perception of reality when I'm high and it just fucks me up.

I'm from India; it is relatively easy and safe to get Cannabis, but its quality is highly variable. I would love to try a high CBD variety, but no one in the supply chain even understands what that means.

My paranoia also stems from my perception of my own weirdness and insecurity. I'm insecure in how I worry other people perceive me. I'm also worried about being a cog in this huge machine of reality and being unable to influence it. The sad part of all this is that I'm actually reasonably successful at what I do, is very well employable and is an honest human being. But when I'm high, I start worrying how I'm not doing working enough at my job. I also go back to the emails I wrote, the tweets I made and think that they are yucky/immature and start worrying how other random people on the internet perceive my words. I consider all of them as 'mature normal adults' judging me and my weirdness. But in my sober state I can tell you that in the scale of 1-10 of Reddit eccentricity/weirdness, I am probably a 4.

The complete guide to not giving a fuck is the kind of article I need to assimilate to get over my anxiety (http://inoveryourhead.net/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck/), but it isn't helping much. 

I have also noticed that my mood becomes really sullen and depressed for a couple of days after smoking. It improves gradually as I keep away. I also start experiencing high BP which stays with me for a couple of days. Also, when sober, the thought of smoking up increases my BP and makes me anxious - maybe because of the bad experiences I have with it.

I'm leaving my current job in a month and going off and living/working by myself for a while. It involves a change of scene and I wont have access to cannabis then. I also will be away from my work, people and other expectations that typically give me anxiety. I hope that will help and I will be able to return to normal after a while. 

Do you have any thoughts on this? One of my worries is whether I'm running away. I'm also wondering whether I might have a chance of developing schizophrenia and cannabis is accelerating it. Do you have any reassurances? Do you look back at the anxious periods of your life and think that the anxiety was stupid? How eccentric do you think you are? Does that ever affect you? Do you have any thought patterns that would help me.

Irrespective of whether I get any answers or not, I love this community and the fact that there are other breathing real alive considerate humans out there. And in my hippy moods, I just love everybody and celebrate the weirdness of humanity as a whole. I just need to get over mine.

After over a month of research and some serious internet crawling I decided on the Arizer Extreme Q v4.0 2012 model.  Fortunately I've found all my researched backed by some great posts right here on reddit and I'll be linking to those posts.  I purchased mine with the warranty in tact from ebay for under $150.
Link to eBay listing: http://bit.ly/XcYh79

I suggest scoping out the right hand column over at /r/arizer for tons of info on how to clean your device and what temperatures seem to work best (especially useful if you buy an older model EQ.

I prefer to use the bags, especially in groups but unlike the volcano, the Arizer bag system has no stopper or valve to prevent vapor from escaping the bag.  Fortunately there is a replacement glass tip you can use on your bags.  Here's a link to one on eBay super cheap: http://bit.ly/Xd0uiT

I also recommend purchasing a decent grinder to get a nice fine grind: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/arizer/comments/rthso/find_a_grinder_online/

Consider replacing the PVC piping with surgical silicone tubing, as PVC cannot be washed with Isopropyl Alcohol.  You can get some nice ISO hash every few months when cleaning your glass and **Silicone** tubing.

This leads us to ABV (Already Been Vaped).  My first vaporizer was a no-name box vape from a noname eBay seller which only lasted about 3 months and was prone to catching my herb on fire (well smoldering in the glass).  We used to call ABV ""second rounds"" as we would go back and vape it again later at a higher temperature then toss it out when it was nearly blackened.

I've learned lots of things from my research on the internet, and am happy to report that the subreddit /r/abv has tons of great info, including my personal favorite thing to do with ABV: Emulsified Coconut oil ABV gel caps.  Keep in mind to use size 00 gelatin capsules (avoid veggie caps) and try out this recipe, don't forget the soy lecithin, it's very important!  Here's a link to Bit_Chewy's awesome recipe: http://www.reddit.com/r/abv/comments/16q9hl/my_abv_recipe_with_coconut_oil_and_soy_lecithin/

Using coconut oil and soy lecithin avoids a lot of the variability of our digestive system as described in this article by an awesome eldertree OldHippie: http://beyondchronic.com/2012/08/capsule-warning-avb-experiment-wrong/
To avoid the first pass problems you should eat at least 30-60 minutes before taking the coconut oil capsules, not only that but it helps avoid the liver's response when consuming on an empty stomach and improves the potency of the capsules and effectively bypassing a lot of breakdown by the liver.  This a great rule of all cannabis edibles, eat before you eat.

Soy lecithin granules and size 00 gelatin capsules can be purchased at health food or vitamin stores or Amazon.  High quality coconut oil at most grocery stores.

I would like to thank OldHippie and Bit_Chewy and all the other great ents here in the various subreddits and other discussion forums from which I did my research.

Many, myself included, thought this piece of legislation actually had a chance due to the democratic majority in Congress. That turned out not to be the case, however.


Anita Hofschneider of the Associated Press reports that house judiciary committee Chairman Karl Rhoads decided to kill the bill after learning from House leadership that the initiative does not have enough votes to pass the House. You can read he article here: 


http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21138215/hawaii-house-committee-to-vote-on-marijuana


There was no vote.  One man made the decision.  


There has been a divide among the people of this nation for many years now about the potential legalizing of cannabis.  Recently, polls have started to show that more and more people have begun to lean towards an end to prohibition.  There are countless scientists, doctors, economists, judges, farmers, enthusiasts, and unemployed people that could tell you about the many benefits cannabis could have for our society.  I won't get into that here...  Except to say that whether you are for, against, or undecided, you should watch the video:


[The Union: The Business of Getting High](http://youtu.be/6jO_ncXj7RE)


Learn something.  Keep an open mind and then, after you have the facts, make your decision on where you stand.  This issue isn't about what your parents told you when you were growing up. Its not about some myth you heard from so and so who heard such and such on a tv commercial at some point.  Get the facts.  Be informed.  This is and will be an important issue for years to come.  I often see people make comments like the following (which was taken from the comment section of the article previously mentioned):

&gt;No, I do not want it to pass I am allergic to the smoke. Do you want to be taken cared or bussed by stoned &gt;nurse&amp; bus driver?""

If we look at this person's concern realistically and compassionately, we can note the following: Most if not all bills being presented, including the one in Hawaii today, make smoking legal in a private setting.  Not out on the street corner, in the grocery store, or at Burger King.  As to the nurses and bus drivers, I agree.  I don't want these people to be high on the job either.  That's why there will be laws and regulations in place to prevent this.  You have no more right to show up to work blazed up than you do showing up sloshed from drinking a bottle of vodka. What needs to be understood in this situation is the fact that the people who would come to work high in a state that has legal cannabis, are the people who would come to work high regardless of the law.  You will be no more vulnerable to this situation than you were before.

Now, to continue on the path of compassion and realism, I would like to point out my concerns.  With the exception of politicians receiving funds from lobbyists, why would anyone really care if I smoke/vaporize/eat/plant/harvest/juggle/stare at/sleep on/or play baseball with the buds of a plant?  Why is this even an issue to people?  I have total respect for people that don't like the smell or, like the comment above, have trouble being around the smoke.  I wouldn't impose myself on these people.  Much the same as when I used to smoke cigarettes and would go outside if it bothered anyone.  I don't drink and drive.  Hell, I don't even like drinking very much and probably wouldn't if cannabis was legal.  For people that have a problem with legalization, I ask, where do you draw the line?  Do you drink alcohol?  Because, you know, it is very dangerous not only for you, but the people around you.  Do you smoke tobacco?  Because, well, that's dangerous not only for you, but the people around you.  Do you have sex?  Because, well, that's dangerous too.  Should I have the right to tell you how many McDonald's Big Macs you can or can't have because they can kill you?  You might say, hey, these things aren't the same.  Yes, they are.  All of these things cause chemical reactions in your brain and give you pleasure.  I'm an adult.  Stop telling me I can't sit down and enjoy something that makes me happy in the privacy of my own home. 


Oh, and by the way, I don't even use cannabis.

1362255501.0,71,self.eldertrees,19jdnh,I like my boyfriend more when he's stoned than when he's sober :(,106,35,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/19jdnh/i_like_my_boyfriend_more_when_hes_stoned_than/,"I don't know what to do about this. We used to be really close and have a really strong connection. We were really passionate about each other. Over time, that has faded. He has become really focused on work, and that's what he thinks and talks about most of the time. I try to have real conversations with him, but he's so distracted that he listens, says ""yeah"" or ""uh huh,"" and then goes back to what he was doing. We just don't seem to have much in common anymore. I'm not terribly unhappy, really.. just a bit unsatisfied.


But on rare occasions, he will relax for a night enough to smoke, and everything changes. He becomes enthusiastic about things. When we talk, he won't just silently listen, he'll *engage* with me, share his ideas, and become excited about talking with me.  He gets cheerful instead of somber and ultra focused. Sex is really fun, and we are finally able to connect again.


The thing is, as much as I like weed (although I can't smoke anymore because of my job), I know it's not healthy to encourage him to be stoned all the time just so I can get along with him better. I've talked to him about the fact that I like that he engages with me more when he's stoned. He apologized that he isn't as interested when he's sober, and.. that was kind of the end of it. I get that, it's not like he can just flip a switch and change the way he feels and reacts to things. He also doesn't like being stoned too often because it makes him so much less functional. 


So.. what should I do here? I'm hanging onto the memory of how into each other we used to be, and to how much fun we have together and how close we feel when he's high. Am I using weed as a crutch here? Is that bad? I've never been in this situation before.

How can I change my smoking habits?,81,9,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/vk5q0/tendency_to_bingesmoke_every_day_at_home_by/,"I enjoy smoking, but I think I'd enjoy it more if I used more occasionally. Problem is, once i have some, my tendency is to smoke every day until I run out, and the gaps in between are getting shorter. I do not want to quit completely, but I feel I might be dependent in some way, and it is getting in the way of my productivity and motivation, as well as my enjoyment of cannabis.

I'm only going through an 8th in just under a month despite smoking almost every day as I tend not to smoke massive amounts to get really high, just enough to maintain a casual buzz and make killing time watching TV shows and crap more interesting. My problem is that if I have any weed and don't have to be anywhere, I will smoke. Cue arrested development marathons and adult swim cartoons. Which is fun and all, but gets repetitive every day, and is using time I could be spending sorting out stuff to sell or throw away for when I move, learning a language, arranging my travelling plans, practising bass.

I'd much rather have a productive and active day, then go smoke somewhere in the sun - a joint earned is a joint enjoyed or however the saying goes - but instead I'm just smoking impulsively. I'd like to hear from people who smoke occasionally by choice, and how they stop themselves from reaching for the bong at every opportunity.

Edit: lots of great advice guys, I'm currently skint and out of weed anyway so I'm going to have to take a few days break at least. In the meantime I'm going to start getting into the habit of deadlining my goals. I'm going to start with something small: to go through all my clothes and sort them into Keep, Sell, Throw Away/Donate. If I haven't got that done by the end of tomorrow, PapauNewGuinea can kick me in the balls.

Edit 2: Arbritrary 'Woah, front page! Thanks for the imaginary internet points guys!' Sincerely thanks though, I can draw much wisdom from you guys. I think there's a sap analogy in there somewhere lol.

Once I pick up some more I will take up BbFlat5's advice and try and go on more high-ventures and try to use weed more to improve an activity, rather than using it as an excuse to sit at my PC all day.

1352134302.0,71,self.eldertrees,12o9x3,I've been eating raw cannabis for a year to see the effects on my asthma. ,79,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/12o9x3/ive_been_eating_raw_cannabis_for_a_year_to_see/,"*Edited: 11/7*

Salutations everyone,

For a year straight I've been eating raw cannabis for my asthma and I would like to share the results. First the video and doctor that spurred this idea deserves recognition. While learning more about cannabis last year I came across a video called [Leaf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0nLdVJiIg) (15min), describing Dr. William Courtney's results juicing cannabis and tumor suppression. The word to take away from this is anti-inflammatory. While I don't have to deal with tumors or the same afflictions described, my thoughts were to reduce the inflammation that occurs in my trachea and allow an easier time swallowing or breathing. I was not disappointed.

On November 5th 2011 (a Saturday) I wanted to first test what eating would do to me. So I could ensure it would not interfere with work. Mind you I don't have the quantities described in the linked video. Additionally I get cannabis, like most people, dried. During the day I didn't feel any psychoactive effects. Like the video describes you need to heat cannabis for the psychoactive effects. When relaying this information be sure to describe to people this is not the same as edibles. I took three doses of .5g of cannabis with each meal. In the first day my body felt warmer. Not feverish, but generally warmer.

During the first days I noticed my circulation was getting better and my metabolism was speeding up. The first majorly, life changing result, was waking up on the fourth day and noticing my chest tightness was greatly lifted. My chest could expand much easier when breathing. Not even my inhaler could temporally alleviate my chest tightness. This has been permanent. With my chest-tightness being lifted my shortness of breathe was the second symptom to gradually lift.

Being able to breathe better, I wanted to attempt expanding my range of breathe. Six months in I decided to get back into running because I felt I could now. I'm 29 now, in high school I did long distance running and it was tough then. My asthma started to burden me at the end of HS. My inhaler would at most lighten the problems for about 20 minutes. In the last six months I've worked up to running 3 miles in 24 minutes, don't think I started doing this pace. I slowly began with 10 minute miles and worked up the pace every two weeks.

While doing my exercise routine I also felt how food impacted my runs. I eliminated soda and drinks with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Two out of three meals during the week are vegetarian, during the weekend anything goes. I don't have food allergies or drink dairy to begin with either. The reason this is important is because of the comments about my exercise/diet being the primary reason my asthmatic symptoms have been alleviated. Which sounds feasible but I tried similar changes in 2004 and 2008 with nowhere near the respiratory changes taking place. Additionally the chest-tightness, shortness of breathe, and (subtle) trachea inflammation changes were before these exercise/diet changes.

In the later months is when my trachea inflammation started to loosen greatly. I was starting to cough and produce saliva differently. I noticed when I took water bong hits and coughed, my bronchial muscle spasms were minor. Now I don't have them, even when using harsher equipment like a pipe without water. If I have an obstruction now in my throat I cough like *normal* people and don't experience my trachea constricting then filling with fluids. 

Lastly, I haven't used my inhaler in 11 months. I went from 230 pounds to 185 pounds and several waist sizes. I now have also reduced my dosage to .5g, twice a day. I can only imagine results if given cannabis before the drying stage and in larger quantities.

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them the best I can while at work. If you know anyone with a respiratory problem, such as asthma, please tell them about this simple process. I've had people message me over the year while commenting about this in other threads. I hope they can also share their results if they started to explore this in regards to [Cystic Fibrosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001167/).

*Side notes from my logs*: 

I did this with only Sativa strains. Indica strains gave me a headache after eating them, which I only tried twice to confirm this odd reaction. I don't experience this when I smoke Indica's.

When I began exercising I noticed on days I ate cannabis and tried to exercise immediately after, I was sluggish or not feeling well. I needed to allow the cannabis to be digested like any food.

Be kind with grammar as the text hasn't been very revised&gt; Back story: My mom suffers from Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Degenerative Disc Disease, and more... My sister chose hard drugs and crime for some reason so my mom attributes trees as the gateway. I want to make her better to treat her constant debilitating pain and I think trees is the most practical answer... Read on for the letter Thanks in advance, also I will link this thread so she can see what y'all have said.

Dear Mom, Possible Intro I honestly don’t know how to really start this letter to you. Do I start by expressing the fact that I am so tired of seeing you in pain and the condition that all of your conditions have put your body in; or, do I start with telling you that I use cannabis on a regular basis and aside from my difficulties understanding my courses, I have a fully functioning and rather enhanced life from cannabis. Would it be wrong for me to say that I prefer the cannabis to treat my depression and help me cope with my emotional instabilities in a manner that no counselor or medicine has ever done for me before? Maybe I should start by saying that I am still against cigarettes and their ravages on the body but I still consume cannabis. How about that I love my daughter more and more and realize how important she should really be to me because cannabis allows me to truly sort out my emotions. Most importantly though I will state this clearly, cannabis is not my gateway to the hard drugs like crack and heroin. I love myself, my family, and my body too much to put it through what those drugs can do to you. Jensen’s drug abuse and crime are a special case that speaks more so to her psychological predispositions as compared to her use of cannabis in high school. I whole-heartedly support the decriminalization of cannabis and the regulation of it to keep it out of young children’s hands. It is the same as alcohol and tobacco in my eyes. Children shouldn’t partake in cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana but I believe that consenting adults have the right to choose for themselves, whether or not to consume the substance. Mom the truth is that I am writing this to try to reach out to you and help you cope with the illnesses that have ravaged your body and continue plague your daily existence. I am writing this because I don’t want to lose my mom to a drug overdose or some unforeseen drug interaction. I want you to get better and I really believe that cannabis could truly help you gain independence from the thousands and thousands of dollars that you spend on prescriptions. Not to mention probably experience better management of pain and less adverse side-affects than your medicines currently cause you. I personally recommend that you watch The Union and The Trillion Dollar Plant first, then read the articles (all of which are attached to this document), and then read the rest of my letter. I say this because I know how our family views drugs and I think you would read this as if it were a bad drug, when in fact it is viable medicine to treat you. I am not presenting this to you so that you can become my stoner-friend, instead I am sharing this to you because I want us to have our mom back; the mom who enjoyed life and didn’t have to always be in pain.

{A.D.D. Thought Break!}

I recommend watching this documentary before reading further into my research. It becomes obvious the prejudices that taint peoples mind in the face of facts that have been long kept illegal. Also the trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry that you contribute to on a daily basis has had major influence on keeping cannabis illegal. They don’t want a medicine that can be simply grown in the ground getting out and tainting their market. Momma, I am sending this to you because I want to help open your eyes to the world and the more I see you in pain and locked in your bed, strung out and loopy from your medicines, I know something needs to change. I miss having my mom who always wanted to be there and I miss seeing you not in pain. I know that based on our families history that your moral prejudices will probably kick in and you will feel as though you are betraying society or becoming a bad person! Mom, that is far from the truth! In my opinion If it is a treatment that is effective in combatting the pain, helping you sleep at night, and getting you back into life then I am all for it. Honestly all that I have ever seen in the drugs you take is a fog that transcends your conscious mind. It has really made me question the effectiveness of modern medicines especially given my major and possible career fields. I have always believed in the natural approach, I really don’t like doctors who always over prescribe medicine to their patients. I would never do anything that I thought would hurt you because I always will love you and respect you! I just want to have my mom back and not see her in pain. I think the greatest thing is how many different methods of administration the cannabis has that aren’t just rolling up a joint and smoking. By and large the most effective method of administration is the vaporization of the herb to release the cannabinoids in a mist of vapor. There is also ways to extract the active ingredients into oil that you can use for cooked goods that contain the medicine making the administration completely oral and non-respiratory. There are also oils that can be purchased that when place on the skin administer the dose of active ingredients. What I am trying to convey is that the image that you and I both have of drug enthusiasts is far from the case in the modern day cannabis market. I also believe that when it is decriminalized the market and the money is going to be there for people who are progressive and ready to capitalize on a long untapped market. The truth in this capitalization is rather evident in the fourteen states that promote the decriminalization of cannabis.

I want to also decisively interject that I have no desires to pursue or try any of the hard drugs like Crack Cocaine, Cocaine, LSD, PCP, Methamphetamines, or Heroin. Just like the drugs that you take these are processed and not natural at all. These drugs are manufactured to create and fuel a dependency. We know the effects of this dependency all too well. Not just Jensen, all of us do considering the class of narcotics mom is taking, the amphetamine salts that create the active ingredient ADHD drugs. Jensen is just a special case where she can’t set her boundaries in her decisions. She is the type of person who manipulates people and procures what she wants. Was it marijuana that made her that way? No, I honestly don’t think so. Between all the abuses she suffered she never got to truly grow up and she never learned that self-control that maturity can yield. Essentially, Jensen is a special case that may never be cured of her self-abusive addictions. I have told her before that I would have never cared about it had she stuck to marijuana. It was the crime, deception, and reckless use of unregulated man-made drugs that I couldn’t tolerate. The show The Union that I have provided the link for you to watch is quite intriguing in the method of factual presentation. It is rather crazy though to think that America supports pharmaceutical companies synthesizing dangerous drugs from plants in nature and selling them for profit. However the plant that doesn’t need to be refined and synthesized is the one that they are keeping illegal. Just watch the movie and watch it with an open mind and clear any prejudices to the idea.

I have also found some other research that I found. I could keep adding research and studies conducted by not only the US government but also reputable hospitals, universities and alike that are seriously investigating the uses of cannabis in the treatment of conditions. Mom one thing I know about you is that you love the Eastern culture including stuff like feng shui and you can appreciate this. Cannabis is an herb that has long been used to treat illness and help make people better. Most of the medicines you take are manufactured and have some have only been around for no longer than a decade. Please don’t be mad at me for using cannabis or even suggesting it to you. I will never forget who my family is and I will always be there for my family no matter what! I love you guys way to much for that to ever happen. Plus, I love my daughter way to much for that to ever happen. I never want to waste away in a pit of doom and gloom because I use cannabis, I actually have more vigor to explore life and experience things that make me happy. In all honesty, Rachel can even attest, cannabis has made me better able to express my emotions and not immediately go to rage mode. I can also talk about and sort through the things that have been eating away at me for years. I honestly was never able to sort through all the emotions that Kenne put on me through. I put myself in a shell for so long that the shell is what became normal for me. Hell just as proof that it doesn’t make you lazy I would kind of like to show off something that I made by hand while using cannabis. PV4 Pocket Herbal Vaporizer is what I named it and I copied the style off of this Magic Flight Launch Box a commercially available pocket vaporizer. Like I said I love you so much and never want to let y’all down! Austin. Cannabis is a medicine that is not anything like the hard drugs that truly plague our society; it is a medicine that I think can truly help you.

So I'm sorry that I didn't update earlier, but our justice system takes it's godamn time sorting you through. Eventually, I got my letter in the mail that said to come to the prosecutor's office.

From there I met a pretty nice guy (call him J) that gave me the option of confessing guilt and getting probation for six months + testing + fees + 40 hours of community service.... or I could go to court. Well, after probation it gets struck from your record, so even though I feel like I had a good case, I gave it up. All in all this entire ordeal is making me lose around $1100 and 8 months of not smoking... plus the community service of course.

It's not a terribly exciting update, but I thought I'd make it anyways. Remember guys, if you have cannabis in the car, GO SUPER SUPER SLOW. I didn't realize the road had a 30 mph speedlimit, but I can guarantee that it won't happen again.

Marijuana Policy Project has mentioned Massachusetts as one of the four states they're looking at- along with Maine, Oregon, and California- for fuding a legalization initiative in 2016. Young voters come out much more in presidential elections, so it makes sense to wait until '16. Also, it gives us more time. So let's use it!
There's already a group forming in Massachusetts to start holding events, putting out information, and raising money for a ballot initiative in '16. Our plan is to write the most progressive ballot initiative yet for Massachusetts. Let's *really* legalize weed. Let's allow unlimited stores, home-growing, no new DUI provision, etc. I believe it will pass it framed properly in Massachusetts.

As for Maine, Oregon, or California... I don't know what's going on exactly. Maine is looking good, Oregonites are probably nursing their wounds, and California- please, please form one cohesive effort, and stop all the infighting.

I just want to say something to everyone...

...and that is you are all unique. Each and every individual has their own perception on life and their own set of beliefs. Everyone has their own alternative view, and that to me is amazing.

As a future educator, I need to teach my students material (as per the curriculum says). But to me that isn't enough, I want to teach them that there is much more to life than redundant and boring school work. There are many ways to complete a task and I can structure certain tasks to stimulate certain skills (such as collaboration) out of students.

Collaboration is the act of working together, something all of mankind has done since it has walked the Earth. Some may argue having differing perspectives or opinions may be counterproductive, however anything is possible when we work together.

More importantly, I want everyone to realize the potential they have within. There may be times where you hit an obstacle and it may be hard to cross, but understand with perseverance a person can succeed. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. I hate to hear ""I'm stupid"" or ""I can't do it"". You can, you just don't know how yet. When you do though, it won't be so hard after the learning curve.

I dream of a world where everyone has basic foundation to work from to reach their potential. This includes sufficient food, water, access to education and a suitable shelter. I believe that everyone has something to offer - and that is their own unique perspective and potential that they may share with the world.

This realistically is punching above my weight, but one day may come true. Reddit has shown time and time again what collaboration can do, and maybe one day we will all be able to collaborate enough to allow everyone to explore their potentials and achieve their ultimate happiness.

Thank you all for your contribution on reddit for informing me and providing me with information at my finger tips to help me see the bigger world that is out there.

Cheers to all of you and I hope you all have a fuckin' kick ass weekend!

*I'm hoping to announce another mod by tomorrow, but I've learned my lesson about promising dates, so stay tuned.*

*Without further ado...*


**Why do you want to be a mod or r/eldertrees?**
 I understand and appreciate the importance of this subreddit. I would like to be a bigger part of keeping the community a happy and respectful community of likeminded ents, and I believe as a moderator I could really do that. I have been a member of Reddit and the r/trees &amp; related subs since November 2010 and have grown to love and appreciate many of my fellow Redditors as well as those communities. r/eldertrees provides a haven from the memes and ""driving at a [10] lol"" posts that have become all too common on r/trees. As an individual who is in a very different place in my life than those posters, I appreciate the ability to come to a different community where ents more like me can conversate without those types of posts.
**
What will you do to help the community grow?** 
In addition to regular comments and posts, I plan to promote the subreddit when I see potential subscribers and answer any questsions members may have. As someone who is on Reddit quite a lot, I could respond to any questions to the mods in a timely fashion and really help this place grow.

**Do you have any ideas for events that could bring us together as a community/promote bonding?**
 I think regular ""themed threads"" might be a good idea. On r/Entwives we've had a ""share thread"" theme that I think we could modify. Having ""Community meeting"" type threads on a given theme to give a sense of family would be nice. Example, on Thursday have a ""What are your favorite T.V. shows, r/eldertrees?"" post that would get discussion going between community members to help build lasting relationships with fellow ents. This could be weekly, bi-weekly, or what have you. I would be more than happy to take on the weekly thread topics, if needed. :) I also think that having a guest AMA every month would help, be it a dispensary owner or a NORML employee or something to that effect.

**Any general ideas to improve the subreddit?** I think just growth and increasing the number of subscribers conversating would be a good start. Too many changes at once makes the community look unstable, so I think we should establish a ""base line"" before making any changes. Things are awesome as they are, anyway. :)

**How old are you?**
 I am 21 years old, if it makes a difference, I will be 22 in May.

**How long have you been smoking?** 
I started smoking shortly after I turned 18, so 3+ years.
**
What timezone do you live in?** Eastern Standard.

**Gender?** Female

**If you could travel through time and toke with ANYONE in the world, who would it be?** My daughter 20 years from now. Toking with people is a great way to really grasp who they are as a person, in my experience. With all the negativity about how I have decided to raise my child, I would like to be able to get to know her as a person, in the future, for some validation that I'm doing it right. There are plenty of historical figures I could see myself lighting up with, but when it boils down she is the only person I am really, really trying to do right by.

Aside from her, I suppose second place would go to my mother as a teen. I didn't get a lot of chances to know her before she had to re-learn to speak when I was in my pre-teens. As kids we underappreciate our parents a lot of times, and I am guilty of it. I'd like to know her likes, dislikes, dreams and thoughts from before she became who she is today.",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,,True,t3_osz4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/osz4x/everybody_give_a_warm_welcome_to_our_newest/,

So much so, that walking any further from the driveway to inside was too much for him.  Hating to see him like this, I pulled my grandmother aside and asked her if using marijuana would be something they would consider doing.  She seemed on board, spoke with him and they agreed to give it a shot.  I baked them a batch of brownies, but due to my grandfather's size, it wasn't enough.  The fact that he has diabetes means that he could never eat more than just one.  So we asked if they would consider smoking it instead.  They agreed and so tonight I am going over to their house with the sole purpose of getting my grandparents high.  It's amazing.

UPDATE:  Okay, so when Grandma tried the brownie, apparently she got really dizzy and sleepy, BUT she said for the entire day she had absolutely no backpain, which is a chronic ailment for both of them.  We bought a new pipe, grinder, and some screens to bring for them along with our pipes and vaporizer.  They tried both but they had difficulty with the lighters.  They quit smoking cigarettes 50 years ago and my Grandma was worried about wanting to pick it back up if they used the pipes.  Grandpa used the vape a bit, and shared with Grandma.  He still says he's not feeling anything, but I noticed some change to the way he talked after awhile.  I told him to continue to use it and let me know in a couple of weeks how it goes.  So I took the new pipe and left my vape for them.  It was nice to have an evening with them where I felt like they saw me as an adult.  We had real conversations and were able to open up to each other more than ever.  If nothing else, it's brought us closer together.  Thanks, trees!

Update 2:  Not sure if anyone is still following this, but they decided that the vaporizer wasn't going to work because it was too harsh for my grandfather.  He has since noticed a difference when eating the brownies so I think that's the avenue we're going to take.  It seems like they'll be going through one batch every month, so it's not too bad.

I recently read this post about [side effects from a tolerance break](http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/xkpms/question_possible_side_effects_from_a_tolerance/). It reminded me of something I encountered lately.
First of all, some information about me. I'm male, a bit shorter than 200cm and 81-83kg. I do not smoke cannabis daily, rather occasionally (3-4 times a week) and in big sessions. My body fat content is rather low, about 8-10% I think.

Here is the story: A close frient came over and we made us two muffins, each containing about 1g. We ate them and while waiting for them to kick in, my dealer called and asked if he could come by. About 30 minutes later he and his girlfrient came over and we started a big session. After the 2nd joint the muffins kicked in and we were stoned for about 3 hours at a constantly high level.
Now here it comes: The next day, about 18h after I smoked the last joint, I went to the gym to work out. At that point I felt absolutely sober and fine. I started my routine, first warming up and then using heavier weights. 15 minutes later I noticed that something unusual was going on with me. It was a well known feeling. As I sat there heavily breathing and sweating, I started getting high! It was not a strong high, maybe [3], but nontheless I was stoned.
Can anyone of you eldertrees confirm this with own experiences?

Now in relation to the post I mentioned above, I think I have a rough explanation for what happened; I am not an expert though and might be wrong, but at least it's something you eldertrees can work with. 
THC is a lipophilic substance. It tends to accumulate in your body fat (this is the same reason why they can find THC in your blood days after you smoked your last joint). Now when you start working out, as soon as your body burns fat, the THC accumulated there is set free  -&gt; you're stoned. Is this a good approach or did I make a mistake somewhere? And how is it related to the symptoms described in the tolerance break - post? I find this issue very interesting and I'm curious what you think about it.
Please excuse my poor usage of English language - I'm not a native speaker.

We need some help. My wife's father and brother moved to California to legally grow. They acquired a license (215), and operated within the framework of said license.
The brother was delivering in the father's vehicle, and saw a California Highway Patrol. The cop passed him, then slowed down, and got behind him and turned on his lights. Brother pulled over. The officer walked up to the passenger side, and opened the passenger door, without even first informing of why he pulled brother over. After the door was open brother asked why, and police said ""swerving"" (which he was not). Officer than asks how much marijuana was in the vehicle. Brother was picked up, and charged with 2 felonies, even though he was issued a (215) license from the state of California, and was within the supposed legal limit.
Brother was taken to jail. He did not give consent to a search. It was also father's car, which he had permission to be driving. After taking brother into custody they issued a warrant, and raided the property. There were multiple residents on the property in trailer and a house. Everything was legal. The father, living in the trailer, had his trailer raided, and a separate amount of marijuana in the trailer along with personal property was confiscated, and told would not be returned.
So now even though these 2 were operating supposedly under California State law, and making sure they did not do anything illegal (under California state law), have had their work taken by the California state police who are not recognizing the state's issue of a license. So now brother faces 2 felonies, and father has lost personal property.
So father is scared to call the police about his personal property, because he thinks the police are going to charge him and arrest him.
So California, is growing with a license legal, or not?
Is this common to issue a license, then arrest when people function within the boundaries, only to be arrested? That sounds more like entrapment.
Everything was lost in the ""raid"" and this is not a wealthy family by any means. So an expensive lawyer is not really an option.
Is this a racket by the cops? Is this how it works?
Does anyone have any advice?

I'm noticing on r/drugs in particular a growing amount of people who just accept that smoking cannabis can lead to ""cannabis psychosis"" and addiction.

Now I'm no r/trees fool, either. I know that cannabis can lead to dependence, but that the dependence is closer to a gambling addiction or a videogame addiction than anything else. And yes, if someone is predisposed to schizophrenia, it would probably not be the best idea for them to smoke a high-THC, low-CBD strain.

* A small pyrex dish with a lid (tinfoil can be used to fashion a lid).
* A small pan (the dish should sit on the rim of the pan without touching the bottom)
* Empty gelatin capsules (I recommend OO size, O is too fiddly and OOO is hard to swallow for some).
* A pipette (I used a cheap plastic one bought from ebay in a pack of 5 for £1).
* Cheese/Muslin cloth.
* Extra virgin coconut oil (high content of healthy fats, ideal for extracting THC into).

1. Half fill your pan with water and put it on the stove.
1. When the water is boiling place the dish on the pan.
1. Put 10-20g of coconut oil and 5-10g of already been vaped weed into the pyrex dish. Alternatively put 3-10g of fresh weed in. If using fresh weed then decarboxylate it by putting it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees celcius and grind it to a fine powder when it comes out (more fine = more surface area = better extraction). **Make sure you use a probe to test your oven temperature against the dial,** on my oven I have to set the dial 20 degrees celcius lower than my desired heat.
1. Put the lid on the dish.
1. Reduce the temperature on the stove so the water remains boiling but not so it is boiling so hard that your water will quickly evaporate away.
1. Walk away for 2 hours, coming back from time to time to make sure the water hasn't evaporated from the pan. If it's running out then boil a kettle and fill it back up to half way.

After 2 hours then you're done with the boiling pan. Leave the pyrex dish to cool a bit then poor the mixture into cheese cloth. You want the mixture just cool enough that you can touch it without burning it as the warmer it is the easier it is to strain. Tie the cheese cloth into a ball around the weedy oil paste and squeeze it as hard as you can. You'll lose some weight in this process. You could just put the paste directly in but the plant matter gives some people gas or an upset stomach and the shelf life of the capsules will be reduced.

Now you can use the pipette to fill up your empty capsules! They start off a dark brown colour but turn green as they cool.

These capsules will last for several months at room temperature. I store them in the fridge. When making this recipe with 5g of weed that has already been vaped to a dull brown colour then 3 capsules gave me a real nice mellow stone.

Pics:

* After the capsule was freshly made, a nice dark brown colour - http://i.imgur.com/OcpcI.jpg
* After the capsule has been in the fridge for an hour, now a nice lime green colour - http://i.imgur.com/NtcDX.jpg

Dear TroutM4n,

For the first time in five years, the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on an amendment to prevent the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. [We need you to call your member of Congress and tell him or her to support this amendment.](http://control.mpp.org/site/R?i=-I_BNHJBztVchS4i9j6RJg)

At the start of the Obama administration, it appeared as if there would be a new approach to medical marijuana by the federal government. Unfortunately, that new approach was short-lived, and it can now be said that Pres. Obama is even worse than Pres. George W. Bush on this issue. Obama’s Department of Justice is relentlessly attacking state-approved medical marijuana providers.

Medical marijuana champions in Congress have decided it is time to send the president a message. The Rohrabacher-Hinchey-Farr amendment will be proposed during the debate on the FY2013 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill on the floor of the House. The vote could happen as early as today!

[Please visit our action page to look up your member of Congress and use the short script we have provided to send a message encouraging a “yes” vote on this amendment.](http://control.mpp.org/site/R?i=s5L0429oyxwopjrs7OuVFw) These calls really do help.

Thank you for taking action!

I have just came back from an evening run and it was so amazing that it would be sad ""tears lost in the rain"" way not to share it.

The country i reside in is a small post soviet nation. There is no talk of legalization and no pro marijuana lobby that could change that. There is still a lot of stigma in my generation (30+ years old) to smoke trees unless you attended an art school and while younger generation is more open - i still feel anxiety/fear and have to hide a lot of my smoking. 

So today i waited till dusk, smoked some trees plugged in my phones with some fast drum and bass (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVnsusd-rPQ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu-E44Spnow) and went running to the nearby stadium. It was amazing! My anxiety went away, the trees blocked out the constant chatter in the mind about being tired, i felt the music giving me wings as i was running completely relaxed and breathing just the right way - not too heavy and not slow.

Felt like a F16 flying just above ground! My body - a bone and muscle machine which can outrun other animals - working in perfect harmony and some amazing technology blasting a perfect soundtrack trough the tiny earpieces.


**TL;DR**

1. Smoke trees.

2. Take your favorite music with you.

3. Go running at dusk in spring.

4. Enjoy your healthy body and your life.

1344272685.0,64,self.eldertrees,xrut5,"This got lost in a sea of vacuity; so I present to you, eldertrees, my ""Guide to Purchasing Functional American Glass"". ",70,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/xrut5/this_got_lost_in_a_sea_of_vacuity_so_i_present_to/,"Hello my friends, I come to you today because of the recent surge in posts on certain boards relating to functional glass for consumption of cannabis and/or cannabis concentrates. 

What I want to let you guys know is that most, if not all, of the pieces that I am seeing are ""production line glass"". This means that the pieces have very low quality control when they are created, and are often times sold from the back of large distribution vans to whatever head shops will take them. 

You may know these bongs as [""acrylics""](http://i.imgur.com/CGo4O.jpg) or [""bongs with a rubber grommet""](http://imgur.com/a/OXwYN); and they are entirely a scam if you are looking into high end glass.

Any piece of high end functional glass should be measured by the artist behind the work; if your head shop does not know/will not tell you the artist behind your piece of glass then the onus falls on you to get the hell out of that store. 

**The basics;**

[This is a slide](http://cdn101.iofferphoto.com/img/item/139/764/475/D7iYegFY9HpHBlb.jpg). The slide holds your bud and is often refereed to as the ""bowl piece"". It comes in standard measurements of 14mm or 19mm for the ""joint"" wherein it will connect to your downstem/ashcatcher.

[This is a downstem](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/14/downstem.jpg/sr=1). The downstem also measures either 14mm or 19mm, but length also becomes an issue depending on your style of tube. 

[Here is a tube](http://www.everypipe.com/images/sized/media/uploads/DSC03280-640x0.JPG). This is a straight tube set-up with a downstem and a slide, to show you what the full set up would look like.

[Here](http://media.photobucket.com/image/medicali%20straight%20tube%20with%20ash%20catcher/hxcas1laydying/Pieces/photo.jpg) is another straight tube, but this time the slide is placed in an ash catcher, which rests in the downstem. The ash catcher will have a glass on glass joint which is also measured either 14mm or 19mm, you will need to make sure that the ash catcher fits into the downstem AND that the slide you have will fit into the top of the ash catcher. 

------
Now that you have come to understand the basics of what functional glass should be, let us go ahead and take a look at what has so many people interested in the art form of glass blowing contemporaneously; **PERCOLATION!** 

What makes a glassblower unique in the contemporary day and age is the aspect of their glass blowing wherein smoke is passed through tiny ""diffuser holes"" so as to cool down and smooth out the hit.

There are many examples of percolation styles out there,

**Bongs;**

In terms of consuming flowers, you have the [Stereo Matrix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCyHs06cdAU) by Mobius Glassworks in California. 

Then you have Sovereignty; which puts out everything from the $1,200 [Peyote Pillar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kckGPfJsj8) to the [really nice gridded upstem with a natural splash guard](http://aqualabtechnologies.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/8f06e1086824bc142942bfe64f6cb67f/a/l/alt_6-7-12-116.jpg).

Or you could look into Toro Glassworks (Upstate NY), which debuted [the circulator style](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hKj9PKOo_WA/S_3GIeTy2eI/AAAAAAAAARU/9p9i23nK3v4/s1600/Toro+Circ+Trashcatcher+Milk.JPG) a few years ago, and whose quality control is bar none.

Luke Wilson makes some nice [15 arm Tree percs](http://www.tokecity.com/forums/attachment.php4?attachmentid=112692&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1241985086)

Nate Dizzle makes a very serious style of percolation called the Swiss Perc, [his designs are immaculate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtpZIX8JnDo).

**Bubblers;**

Zob has some very nice styles of bubblers, [here is an example of their wubbler with a circ perc](http://nvsglassworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/zob_micro_flat_disc_2.jpg), but they also feature a zobello perc in their bubblers, [which is very nice](http://aqualabtechnologies.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/8f06e1086824bc142942bfe64f6cb67f/a/l/alt_7-3-12-922.jpg).

When a Toro tube is shrunken down for use as a bubbler it is called a [""micro""](http://media.photobucket.com/image/toro%20micro/jkid4lifetvlive/Milk%2520Gifs/MicroToroWorked13ArmToCircBubbles.gif) or a [""macro""](http://nvsglassworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/toro_macro_bubs1.jpg).

[Hitman Glass makes a bubbler called a side car for use with oils](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3dMBMP3pIE), it is very well made and comes from a great blower.

**FAQ;**

*What is this oil thing I keep hearing about?*

Oil is cannabis concentrate which is extracted using Butane and has a consistency much like that of honey or molasses, hence the name Butane Honey Oil or BHO for short. To utilize BHO you need a special set up, consisting of a nail, a dome, and a special type of slide.

[Take this example of a Hitman SideCar](http://i.imgur.com/kTWxj.jpg) and you can see how the nail is placed into a special joint in the glass, that nail is then heated to roughly 800 degrees Celsius, before you place the dome over the nail and sublimate concentrates using the heat from the nail. This process is called ""dabbing"". Nails can be made out of either quartz or titanium, the V3 from Highly Educated is considered top class for Ti nails. 

[Here is an example of dabbing through a Mobius Stereo Matrix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwitkCrl6A).


*Are the only artists around the ones listed here*?

Hell no! There are local artists in every city and every state around the country. Some are better than others. Some do work on commission, some operate as a production line, and some make awesome glass simply because of how much they love the art form. 

*Why do you like glass so much?*

I smoke a lot.

*Changed some wording to be less pejorative towards production line glass.

**User Ate_A_Preach provides a very handy guide for buying good quality artistic glass from local artists [heady glass] which will stand the test of time and space. Note that these types of pieces are distinct from the ""scientific"" pieces described above. 

&gt;Find a shop that sells glass in your area, then find out if they sell pipes. There's a really nice place near me, talk to the artist, he'll check your ID and bring you around to a roped off part of the shop and you can see marks in the counter where he slams the glass to show how strong it is. I have a small Sherlock I purchased from him, my favorite thing about it is the mouth piece, you can see that it's not perfectly round and therefore not machine made. If you're going to drop more than $50 on glass, buy something with personality that was crafted as a piece of art. You will appreciate it far more than something that rolled off an assembly line in China.

1342277322.0,62,self.eldertrees,wjtla,A message from the DEA (former),80,18,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/wjtla/a_message_from_the_dea_former/,"I wanted to be a police officer my entire fucking life, I never got there. I got into the DEA and rose fast. Something I always did when I was in high school, was go to school high. It was fun and recreational and I lied about it when I applied, it didn't matter because I got in and beat their system. Now I'm not the type of person to arbitrairly submit to higher authority. It didn't work in protestant school and it didn't work in the DEA. At some point when I realized their random drug tests weren't random, and even if they were I could implement a system to defeat them I saw nothing holding me back from smoking weed in lieu of getting absolutly shit face drunk. A side note: getting shit face drunk in the DEA and beating people up is generally regarded as a good story, smoking a joint and questioning morality is thought crime.

I travelled the world as a DEA agent and where ever I went I used my skills to enter the black market and smoke, and gather information, and smoke. This was a very unique personal trait of mine that allowed me to excel at my job. I gathered intelligence but not personally, from many sources and compiled them with a bit of analysis input and sent it up to higher. The interesting thing that distinguished me from my coworkers was always my ability to have a little extra information, as if I had always just one more source than everyone else but he was a source that was always turning up perfect information. In all sorts of countries that are related to drug smuggling in the US, I traveled and infiltrated the very people I was trying to stop. What the people I infiltrated talked about during our smoke sessions was usually life, religion, opression, racism, and morality. Together, with me as a new member of their community, we would always work to improve something, this was always driven by me. They usually could not explain, due to heavy religious influence how someone can come from no where, proclaim to not believe in God, and then help people. One person literally could not believe that I did not believe in God, because he had never seen someone do an action that was positive that was not under the guise of God. Interestingly enough when I had specific questions about black market operations they always turned up great information. My work was so decentralized that nobody really cared about who was what source, in the end it was everyone's best guess. I had done my job many years before this without smoking marijuana, and I was self determined, motivated and driven like I am today but on a quiter level. For me marijuana works with my natural abilities and there's no moral question of right or wrong in my application of it towards my life, however I would go to jail and loose freedom for a long time if I had been caught. Or perhaps quietly discharged as a professional courtesy; the people I worked for were smart and if I told them the same tale I tell now they would understand and be reluctant to submit me to the same fate of so many 18 year old black males in Alabama.

Before I had fully committed to my own program I wrestled with the morality of smoking weed while on the job. I asked, ""What if my diminished mental capacity or systemically affects my mind to the point where I compromise my self, or others"". I was concerned about my cardio because I was smoking (valid and true concern). I was concerned about getting caught and fired (why submit to arbitrary authority?). I was concerned that it could have affects that I don't know about, and I was concerned that I would be impaired while using it (turns out I'm not.) 

**Digression** A lot of people in the DEA have done tours with the army in Iraq and Afghanistan. I've done a tour in the mid stages of the Iraq war (after mission accomplished). I got in some small level gun fights but never anything overwhelming like in Generation Kill (not that extreme). However it was exciting, this was all after I gave up my high school, school high days. There's also no fucking way to get away with smoking weed in a FOB so if I did think that I wanted to pick some of the weed I was walking through everyday then I would be caught as soon as I smoked it (I shoulda fucken cooked with it, dammit). Anyway, I'm very fast at pistol shooting and my draw to bullet on paper at 10 meters if below 1 second. I can do that once in every 3 or 4 shots accurratley without just biffing the bullet somewhere into space. That is because to do that you gotta go at a, ""as fast as fucking possible"" speed and it's hard. So the point I'm making is that when I'm stoned and conditions are perfect for me ; I can get the subsecond draw more consistantly and with less distraction (fear of messing it up). Now I'm not saying smoke weed and get in gun fights, but I've been in some fucking high stress situations while stoned now (with the war background) and it's not really been beneficial on a thinking capacity but it always did enhance my ability to ACT and not freeze, always. Try smokin weed and playing paintball if you wanna experience that on a smaller level, but play half a day sober and half a day stoned you'll get what I mean. So fuck people who would ever tell me smokin weed would affect my job... Maybe if I was at a [10] sure, but who goes sleuthing around the black market at a [10] (I did actually, fucked up), but I digress... Situations that I describe were always at a [4] or [5], but thats what smoking weed as an adult is like, its managable (unlike drinking, if I drank while doing this I'd be dead I'm sure)

My initial trepidation with smoking marijuana on the job however did seem very valid without knowing where it would lead me. Marijuana doesn't enhance every thinking ability only some, and those some are seldomly very important in everyday life however... However something changed.. I naturally gave up smoking cigarettes with out trying as I smoked more marijuana. If I smoke cigs casually perhaps a pack a week then I will cough non stop all the time like I've been smoking for years. Infact I only started smoking cigarettes 2 years ago and on and off has led to a smokers cought? It went away within 2 weeks of no cigarettes. I've been smoking weed everyday straight for a year now and I've not had a cough attack once (except when I breahted in some water i was drinking). What's important to note is I was still working for the DEA while smoking.

What happend next was unexplainable to me but it gave me a new understanding of the dangers of marijuana. Not the personal dangers it poses to individuals but how it can frame the inner workings of your mind towards person betterment. It became very easy to see the connections in things especially after smoking a bit. My thoughts as communicate because very incoherent and hard to follow but if I recorded my self and sharpened my words into things I could share they were powerful thoughts. All of a sudden I have a daily creativity that was not representitive of the internal noise that used to be my life. 

With this creativity I was able to break down the walls of my mind, deprogram the brainwashing of my life and see true. See and awknowledge the systemic evil I've perpetuated in my life and let the crushing guilt of that enter, destroy and wash through me. What remained after some serious moral inflection was a human mind without fear. 

I don't fear the affects of marijuana. I can't smoke and do math better, but I can smoke and think better. I can think about things and implement my ideas at a later date like always however the ideas are more powerful than ever. It's allowed me to empathize and with empathy comes understanding. Weed is not solely responsible though. We can't smoke weed and do math, but we can smoke weed and think about life.

Smoke weed and do anything really but it can be abused and confused. The real reason weed is illegal in my opinion is that because I am not the only person to realize how weed can be used and what it can help people accomplish. En mass there will be many people like me realizing they do not have to live a life of fear. Fear from the affects of a plant, fear from the consequences of getting caught, fear from other peoples opinions, fear, so much fear.

Marijuana grows out of the ground, it is a specifically intricate plant in that it has a male and female strain that polinates each other to replicate. You can at some point before the polination process pick a budding flower, light it on fire and smoke it to achieve all the good thigns I wrote about above. It's natural and has been used for thousands of years by humans in and out of recorded history. Ignore recorded history and if we know that weed grows everywhere on earth then we know people have been using it since they connected the dots between throwing it in a fire and getting high.

Weed helps you not repress things, if you want to make mental break thhroughs and are ready weed can help. It can help you come to tears if you don't like crying and it can get you to empathize if you've been brainwashed not to.

Nobody questions the morality of a cigarette and we all understand how many chemicals go into them. We think of cigarettes as a natural process of tobacco leaves and rolling them and then smoking however we fail to see the massive post production cycle that is involved to make them amongst other things more deadly (although that is not the design). It's funny then to see peopel questioning the morality of marijuana as described above and blaming marijuana for their problems (such as in /leaves). I see so many people with all substances attempt to solve the problem by quitting the substance, which is often true sound advice. I've often not seen people recognize silmotaniously that their lives are being ruined not because of the substance but because of the moitvating factors that have brought them to fill a void with a substance, they have to break the feedback loop by not being addicted but ironically with marijuana it can help

To the point, does anyone have any idea how to change this? I understand that I am not going to convince everyone over night and this is something that could take years.

Also I should probably mention that there almost no proper organisation around groups that want to legalise.

I'm a dutch Physics and Astronomy major in Amsterdam. As you can guess from where I live; I smoke trees, and have been since I was about 18. I'm fairly open about it too, my family knows it and most my friends know too, it's not a big deal to me really.

We're all ents, we all smoke, and we all love getting baked. But what about the side effects ? Coming from a rather conservative family regarding drugs, I frequently get lectured about how bad marijuana is and how it will destroy my life. The argument I hear the most is ' it makes you more stupid and can decrease your IQ by a significant amount '. Hot-damn, there's nothing I find more frighting than the possibility of losing my intelligence and not being able to finish my education ( god, I hope that doesn't sound arrogant ).

But yeah, you've all heard of those stories. However a few days ago I was watching the news and there was a story about some american study that decisively connected smoking to a loss of IQ. 

Anyway I've dug around a little but all I seem to find are studies that contradict each other. Some studies say it's cool as long as you don't start smoking in your teens ( like I kind of did ? 18 is still teen right ? ) and some studies just state there's no side effects whatsoever. Now what I want to know is, what do you guys think ? I love smoking but I'm starting to 'panic', I don't want my hobby to ruin my career. 

Can you guys reassure me ? Hell, I just want to know more, and /r/eldertrees seemed like the best way to start a discussion about this.

Really interested to read what you have to say.

Peace

I feel like this was an appropriate place to talk about this...

So walking in this man was in a really old looking electric wheel chair with plastic bags and two or three sweaters piled over him with an empty coffee container with some money in his lap, probably from people's kind donations. 

Anyway, so walking in he greeted us off to the side, we said hi and smiled, and continued in. I made the descision that this old guy really needs some dough, so I took out 2 dollars while buying my drink, figure he could get himself something nice to drink as well. After all, I was about to have a great time spinning some poi with some friends, so I'd share the love. 

Walking out I walk up to him and hand him two dollars and said ""here you go buddy, have a nice night."" and I think I gave him a soft pat on the shoulder.  It was strange...as he reached for the money it was obvious to me he was much, much older, frail, and def had some sort of illness. Some of his fingers were stuck, some were bent, and he was shaking as he accepted the money with a ""god bless you.""

Getting in my car with my friend we drive off, and looking back, its obvious he's crying. Alone, in that wheel chair in the cold. It was sad, and I sort sensed him thinking back on his life, maybe it was  a cry of hope, reflection, sorrow or thankfulness...I can't help but think it was one of my few mannerisms that really made him have that silent, burst of emotion. It made me sad the rest of the night having witnessed that, and only wish I could do more.

All I can say is, remember everyone, being genuinely kind...people notice that. ",,False,self,t5_2tclf,True,,,True,t3_p4bxa,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/p4bxa/a_strange_mix_of_emotions_while_helping_a/,

""I have three separate medical issues : In 1998 I was discovered to have a dangerous and rare GI disease known as FAP, and subsequently my colon was re-sectioned; I was treated with the chemo Doxil for two years for a GI desmoid tumor around 2005, and I am currently recovering from radical tongue surgery in March of 2011, which was followed up with concurrent radiation and chemo for seven weeks that Summer. My entire paradigm, every facet of how I operate with the world has been utterly disrupted, and I am undergoing a dispiriting journey back up to something resembling happiness. I take, on average, about 30 pills a day. I can provide a pic to demonstrate, if it is requested. I have had access to pretty much every painkiller that is allowed. But the one drug that I've found to be the safest for consistent use and also quickly metabolizes is marijuana. When I'm nauseous because I haven't eaten all day, and the industrial strength anti-nausea pills I have done shit - I take a hit of hash off a bowl. When I need to quell the near ubiquitous panic attacks - I smoke marijuana. When I can't sleep even though I've been up for nearly two days straight and the Halcion / Ambien / Drug of the Moment help naught- I smoke marijuana. With CNN's Dr. Gupta sudden and very public about-face driving this news cycle, this may be the perfect time to file suit. The gods know I'm the perfect plaintiff., and I feel driven to actively participate in advocating for my strong civic beliefs and I'm tired that my condition often chains me to my home, but I imagine utilizing the the Internet will make this point nearly moot. TL;DR : I want to become a pro marijuana activist, I have cancer and marijuana has dramatically increased the quality of my life. saved my life.

I found out about all of this two hours before I had to usher my cousin's wedding on Saturday, and it being a family trip out of state, I didn't have any substances to help calm my nerves until I got home Sunday afternoon. I feel a little better today, I'm at school as I type this, sober and listening to Green Day. I don't feel like it would be healthy to depend on trees to help cope with this depression, or anything for that matter. Do you think I should take a break until this wave of sadness finally passes or should I just smoke how I normally do? I've heard that interrupting your usual routine is the worst thing you can do when coping with someone's loss, but I also don't want my brain to think I need weed to be happy in general. Am I thinking too much into this? I know most people won't care about any of this. If you don't have advice and just want to comment to cheer me up, that would be amazing. I just want to get my mind off this. I guess it's also worth noting that this is the second friend of mine that's passed within the last three months.

I'll give an example (and convert into USD for the lazy):

* 3 years ago, you would pay £20 ($31.20) for an eighth (3.5g on the dot).
* 1 year ago, it went up to a straight £10 a gram ($15.60 a gram).
* Now the going rate is about 1.6/1.7g for £25 ($39).

So, in the space of about three years, the price has increased by roughly 270%.

Some insights as to how much trees is costing around the world, and if recent economic hardships have taken as much a toll on the price of trees would be interesting! Also, I've always wondered, how much are trees from a dispensary? (In the UK, we can only dream of such things)

1337570787.0,53,self.eldertrees,twyte,Thoughts on smoking &amp; responsibility,60,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/twyte/thoughts_on_smoking_responsibility/,"Hello, everyone. I recently discovered this subreddit and I apologize if this sort of topic has been played out many times already, but I'm looking for other people's thoughts on the ups and downs of regular use of weed, as well as thoughts of guilt. There's a time and a place for everything. In college when I started living in my own place off campus with some friends, we toked just about everyday for 4 years. I still went to class and did all my work. I stopped every now and then for pre-employment drug tests, but would still smoke even when there was a chance I could get randomed on the job (stupid on my part). I never noticed any behaivoral or psychological changes when I would quit cold turkey, but I definitely looked forward to being able to smoke again.

A lot of the time, smoking was a fun way to combat boredom. I definitely lean towards introversion, and weed smoking may have amplified that since it's not widely accepted socially. I would frequently abstain from going out to bars on the weekends with friends because I'd rather smoke with my roommates or other friends. Honestly, house parties and loud bars were never (and still aren't) my thing because they were usually too loud for any sort of stimulating conversation. When it comes to that, I have trouble seeing if smoking weed is correlation or causation. I thought sometimes that I should have put more of my efforts in my free time towards something constructive rather than getting high. I would attempt every now and then to take ""tolerance"" breaks, but I would usually start up again in a few days (earlier than I set out to). Perhaps like others, if I had it, I couldn't not smoke it unless there was a dire reason not to (ie. drug tests). So that means I usually burned through stashes fairly quickly. I spent a lot of money on it, but it was money that I had earned.

This all sounds pretty negative, but in spite of what I've written so far I don't think I would take back the time I spent getting high. I did lots of introspective thinking, hung out, learned from, and talked with good people, and got immersed in music listening (a passion of mine). Like it or not, I have the perspective I have today because of my college experiences. I graduated about a year ago and except for a few times (like concerts), I've been completely clean. I have a good job that I enjoy that doesn't test. Although, it's rough trying to find anything in the burbs, I've thought recently about picking up some bud again now that the weather is getting nicer and the days are getting longer. I'm wondering whether or not I should just leave it behind and move on now that I'm on my own, working, paying bills, staying within a budget, etc. Any advice or perspective you guys have with regards smoking as a college-kid activity vs. as a young ""professional"", and how you deal with self-control issues?

Anywho, we spoke about it on the fourth.  Keep in mind that my grandfather has been in a lot of pain for a long time and I don't know if even if it worked properly it would have helped enough.  We found out on the 13th that he had decided to end the pain once and for all.  My grandfather took his life in the most unselfish way possible.  He tied up all of his affairs, he made sure my grandmother wouldn't have to care for an invalid, and he did his best to make sure she wasn't there for it.  He was an intelligent, wonderful man and the world is better for knowing him.  I think his trying out marijuana was his ""hail Mary"" and it just wasn't enough.

Please call the Maine House today in support of LD 1229, ""An Act to Tax &amp; Regulate Marijuana"". The vote is imminent and we are very close to passing the minority report on the bill. In fact, two members of the Criminal Justice Committee have switched their votes and will be voting with us.

Maine House: (207) 287-1400

The minority report JUST sends the question to Maine voters this fall. If voters decide they want marijuana legal, the Legislature will develop the regulatory structure next session in an open, transparent and public process. 

Thanks for all you do - we are very, VERY close right now!

I know a lot of people that think down on people who smoke cannabis for one reason or another, but more and more I'm hearing of people that think it's fine because they know someone who is able to smoke a lot, and function. The more we better ourselves through cannabis and healthy living, the better our image becomes and the happier we will be.

I took a slow road to health, but 7 years later, I'm working out daily, eating right, smoking my green, and loving life. If you're feeling down, if you feel like you have no motivation, if you feel like giving up, remember that if you really want something in this life (anything), you have to look inside yourself to find the strength to do it; nobody is going to do it for you.

Note: Self-posts asking these questions will be flagged as spam.


&gt;Why is the minimum age 19? Why not 18, or 21?


This is primarily to exclude highschoolers, whose vocal participation is considered by most of us to be bad for the cause. Our goal is not to be exclusive; just a little more mature.


&gt;But 19 is hardly an elder!


The Elder Tree is an *actual* tree. This is a pun. And grammatically speaking, ""elder"" can be used to in comparison to any younger age. In this case, our demographic is elder than r/trees. **If you post saying that you are under 19, your posts will be removed. No exceptions.**

&gt;Can I be a mod?

Maybe, someday. Send a message to ripvanfish and she'll put you down in her list of potential mods. Your post history will be examined so don't bother if you're not an active member of the subreddit. We're not currently looking for new mods, but the community is rapidly growing. :)

&gt;I smoked recently. Will I pass my drug test?

Maybe, maybe not. The only way to pass a drug test with 100% certainty is to be drug-free.

&gt;Where do I find a dealer?

Cab drivers, bartenders, and finding friends in the area who toke are probably your best bet. Please avoid posting this question.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking to say here, I've just been a little concerned.

On new years eve I smoked some hash oil. No big deal I suppose, except that I stopped smoking weed frequently several months ago. On average, I've smoked maybe once every two weeks. I had to cut back because I had such severe anxiety when I was smoking for the last few months of my heavy usage. On new years I wanted to let loose and just get high. I was told the hash oil would be pretty intense and I very much underestimated it. For about an hour my heart raced so crazy, my friends sitting beside me could hear it without even moving close to listen. It was easily the highest I've ever been in my life, and my low tolerance probably did nothing to ease the situation.

Obviously, I got incredibly anxious. After the first hour I relaxed a bit but didn't really shake it till I went to bed a few hours after. I know this probably sounds ridiculous, but since then I've been so concerned about my well being. My heart has never pounded so hard and I've been stewing over whether or not it may have caused an issue. I haven't had any problems since it happened, but do you recommend I go see my doctor just to be sure or am I worrying for nothing?

I used to think that it impairs driving, but I don't feel that way anymore. I find that I am more attentive, more relaxed, I do less multitasking like texting or talking on the phone, and I usually drive under the speed limit.  

Now, I'm not taking bong rips and then getting behind the wheel. I'm usually just puffing on a joint. I usually have to travel an hour or so after my band plays on the weekends and I'll tell ya, if I didn't have a joint to smoke, that drive would be miserable. After playing a show, the adrenaline brings you up so much that there's not much that can bring you down... so it has become our tradition. So for the last 5 years I have been smoking and driving and I have actually avoided accidents, not gotten into them. 

On 3 occasions I have had to react and be attentive enough to avoid collisions and I have done so. 

I bring this up because with all the talk about legalization, the argument against is usually along the lines of ""we'll have people driving while stoned, and that would be really bad, and worse, we can't test for it"" - Now, I find a lot of faults with that argument, but would it be so bad? Seems to me we already have a lot of people driving stoned and from my personal experience, it has been helpful, not a hinderance. 

I would not go out and promote that people should drive while smoking cannabis, but if i had to choose between someone drinking or a sober person with road rage and a texting habit and someone doing what i do... I choose what I do in a second. 

So, can anyone tell me realistically that i am a bad person or I am a true danger to society? Because I have found that the only problem with stoned driving is the paranoia and perception that I don't have the ability to do it... which has slowly gone away. These days, I am just paranoid to get pulled over. But after having been almost hit by a drunk driver while stoned, and then having to give a statement to the cops about it, while stoned... that really doesn't bother me too much anymore. 

I see weed like any other drug. The right dosage and mindset is key.

**EDIT: Just want to say thank you to everyone for your insightful and, might I say, cordial responses. I am not advocating for driving while intoxicated to be legal.

My mom saw a text from one of my friends asking me to pick up for him. She confronted me about this and I promptly revealed that I have been smoking/vaping for the past year. At first this was met with a fairly level-headed discussion, where we talked about how I used it, the intensity of my usage, and her thoughts about it. The conversation remained very civil as we are both reasonable people outside of this context. The following day, I have a similarly peaceful conversation with my dad.

All seems well and good; parents appeared fine with it and I now had a huge secret off my chest. A few days later, I had a pleasant wake and vape. This is where the situation escalates. Gone was my rational mother who would hear my arguments out. She was promptly replaced with an emotional basket-case who spent the next hour yelling at me on the verge of tears.

I don't keep many counter-arguments prepared for this kind of thing, but I am a good example of a responsible user: my grades are on the rise, I'm above average in terms of fitness, and I have a vibrant social circle. I'm clearly not spiraling into self-decline, but all she can see is a burnout.

I've made a point of personal policy to be very open with my mom; we've discussed mature issues before (pregnancy, drinking, sex, atheism, etc...) and I don't see how this should be treated any differently. More so than ever before, she seems hellbent on throwing away the relationship with her son that she spent 2 decades creating.

I love my mom and want to continue having her in my life. I'm asking for the guidance of the elders now because I desire advice from people who are my age AND her age in regards to resolving this dispute. I'm entirely willing to provide you all with any additional information about my scenario which was not sufficiently laid out here. Thank you for listening.

tldr: told my parents I used, everything was fine, time bomb goes off days later, help me sort out the aftermath.

Update: It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I came to the talk prepared and was met with more curiosity than disapproval. They allowed me to make my case and I think we all walked away better for having spoken. My situation may not be the same as yours, but if you believe that your parents are the sort who love you more than they hate cannabis, it's very worth it to have this conversation. Thank you to all those who reached out when I really needed the support, you've all helped to make this very scary confrontation into a beautiful new reality where I no longer need to live with secrets behind closed doors. You being there gave me the courage to be honest with my parents and myself; I hope every one of you gets to know a happiness like this.

Friends and I are in the car, going to East Lansing. We happen to go 45 on an empty road that apparently the speed limit for is 30. Whatever, its a ticket, right? Wrong.

Two of my friends are in the back and they have weed on them. So the cop tells me to come out (WHICH in retrospect, I shouldn't have left my car... but hindsight 20/20.)  They question me over and over again if there's drugs in the car. I vehemently say no every time. They ask if there has ever been, I say no. Basically, I refuse everything. They pat me down, and put me back in the car -- we wait maybe 15 minutes, and a dog comes. This is when we started saying ""oh shit."" They escort everyone out of the car, tell me to keep my keys in the car as well, and after we all leave the car, the dog comes. However, the door is open, so I ask him if I can close my door, which he says no, we can't. 

Long story short, the dog barks at the far end of the car where noone can actually see him (I requested that we watch the dog and they refused. They might have made him bark, we don't know.) During this, my friend says he has a small baggie of weed (FACEPALM.) They find a small baggie of weed, less than an eight. They arrest us and take us to the station... but one of my friends gets to leave cause he didn't say anything (thank god!) but the tow truck comes anyways, they never gave us the option to let my friend who walked drive it (I find out later that he could have! ASSHOLES.) Anyways, cuffs are painful man! They process us and try to write me up for possession on a godamn ticket. The competent cop at the station said you can't have criminal charges on a ticket, (NO SHIT SHERLOCK) so he voids it and sends it to court (they told us the court could possibly refuse it.)

Anyways, I got a couple tickets for it (15 over, no proof of insurance) and they let us go. The never read us our rights either. I am 21, so a legal adult. What should be my next course of action? Should I go talk to a lawyer, or go to the court?

For my birthday, my wish is for a moment of thanks. This has been the best year in my life. The legal use of therapeutic cannabis that I was granted this year has overall greatly contributed to this being the best year of my life.

I continue to have great relief from chronic pain and depression issues. This has allowed me to return full time school in order to pursue my second degree in social work. It has also allowed me to be the partner I have always wanted to be in the relationship of my dreams. I have been able to volunteer regularly in inner city Detroit with the chronically homeless- helping them them and I to heal. I have renewed relationships with friends and family. I Have renewed faith in the people around me with  every good choice I make.

In short, I now enjoy a quiet peace and happiness that comes with following one's dreams. 

I have also continued to become more functional in measurable ways as well. My attendance at my job has gone way up, and in my second year of quitting smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for example, I have only had one cigarette (and that was a ceremony.)

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks for all the posts in my favorite subreddit. You folks make up a community of kind, funny, loving folk and would be exactly the type of folk I would gravitate towards in walking life.

Anyway, Thanks for reading. Now, I am going to continue to clean the apartment to surprise my girlfriend with when she wakes up. I will pray that you are blessed in this next year and that your find even greater happiness and internal peace. Thanks for being here and sharing my Bday with me!

Love,

Are there any studies I can volunteer for or is there anything I can do?",69,18,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/170v1e/im_developing_an_allergy_to_weed_and_possibly_thc/,"I'm 23 years old and have smoked for a few years.  I'm a regular runner and have never had a history of asthma or any allergies (other than a banana allergy that I developed around 21, that was a bit odd).  Over the last 6 months however vaping and smoking have caused fits of wheezing, as I would feel my throat start to tighten up and a lot of mucus would start pooling in my throat.

I thought my lungs were just sensitive to smoke, but eventually it got worse and smoking started giving me full blown asthma attacks, so I went to a doctor and got a rescue inhaler, and would only vape and would always have Ricola and hot tea with honey on hand.  Then that stopped being enough and I started seeing an asthma specialist who has told me I'm most likely allergic to weed.  He gave me an inhaler to use in the morning and at night as well as the rescue inhaler as needed and told me I could try baking weed.

That weekend I made some ""firecrackers"" with friends from vaped weed, in restrospec it was a stupid idea to try eating the actual plant matter of something I'm likely allergic to.  It caused the reaction and a lot of discomfort and I went back to the drawing board.

After that I didn't smoke for 8 or 9 days and convinced myself that I'm probably just allergic to the plant or the pollen so I tried extracting some THC into vegetable oil and making brownies.  I ate them with some friends this weekend and that caused the worst reaction yet...most likely because they were very strong brownies, but it got me thinking I may be allergic to THC and not the plant, according to google only 12 people reported being allergic to THC in 2012.

Is there anything at all I can do?  This seems to be getting worse and I'd like to at least get to the bottom of what specifically is causing the allergy.  When I went to the allergist he had me bring in some weed and he made ethanol and saline solutions and tried to extract the proteins from them for 4-5 mins and then tested me with a scratch test, and it was negative, but he told me it was very likely it could have been a false negative as the solutions may not have had enough time to extract the protein, so that was inconclusive.

Is there anyway I can volunteer myself for a study?  Does anyone else who may be familiar with an allergy like this have any advice?  I still have some vegetable oil that I extracted thc into to make the brownies with, should I experiment with that?  Maybe pour some on my arm or bring it to the allergist for testing?  Should I maybe experiment with benadryl?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, this is incredibly frustrating to deal with.  I only even smoke 2-3 times a week, typically after work or on a weekend, but it helps me immensely with anxiety problems and really increases my quality of life.

Edit: Something worth considering is I could have possibly prepared the vegetable oil for the brownies incorrectly, as they taste a bit like weed and I've heard when you do it correctly you shouldn't taste it at all.  I made sure to not let it come to a boil though, I just put the weed and oil in and my buddies helped me stir it for an hour and a half.

I found that through the use mindfulness and attentive breathing I was able to focus and clear my mind of any anxieties or paranoia (something I am prone to).

 I began to experiment with this while I was high to see if I could amplify the effects. I found that by regulating my breathing with attentive focus, I was able to eliminate any paranoid or negative thinking patterns and just have a good time. Not only that, but it made me feel focused and energetic.

If you've ever got high and felt sort of grouchy for whatever reason, using mindful breathing can completely lift you out of that rut.

Just try this: Smoke a bowl (or whatever your preference is) and close your eyes. Get comfortable. Take a full breath from low belly in through the nose. Hold it for 5 seconds or thereabouts, and let it out through your mouth slowly. Repeat x 5 (or go to 10)


That's all there is to it. See how you feel. 

Focus and willpower obviously contribute to eliminating negative feelings. I really hope this helps in some way, maybe it's stupid I don't know.
