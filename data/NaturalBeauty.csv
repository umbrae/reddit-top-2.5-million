1358121737.0,49,self.NaturalBeauty,16ioso,"Some important things to remember when doing the ""Natural beauty"" thing.",55,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/16ioso/some_important_things_to_remember_when_doing_the/,"With all these new subscribers, I though I'd just go through a few important things that everyone should know.

**1. You can be allergic to natural ingredients as well.**

Remember that natural *don't* equal ""safe-and-wonderful-for-everyone"". You can still get rashes and blemishes from natural products the same way you can from commercial ones. It's very common to get those little pimple-ish things (don't know what they're called in english, makeup-pimples?) in your face from oils, for example. 

The good part is that if you make the products yourself, you can very easily sort out what your skin likes and what your skin don't like.

**2. Essential oils seems harmless and useless for the illiterate, but can cause both skinburns and allergic reactions if used undiluted.**

*Never* use EOs directly on the skin (the exception is said to be Tea Tree, wich is usually said to be fine to use right on the skin), and never inhale them or eat them, unless you perfectly know what you're doing (you *can* put them in food and use them for inhaling when you're coughing etc, but **don't do that if you're not completly sure what you're doing**.

EOs are very high concentrated and have a lot of highly therapeutical properties. If you have dry skin - use one that is good for dry skin and not one that is good for oily skin. If you have sensetive skin, only use mild oils, or no oils at all.

Also remember that a lot of oils has anti bacterial properties; tea tree, lavendel, lemon etc. These can be great against acne or other skin problems. Diluded, that is.

**3. Preservatives *can* be better than rubbing mold into your skin. Also - vitamines, rosemary extract and things like that are NOT preservatives. They're just antioxidations.**

When you use pure oils, you don't need any preservatives. Always keep oils you're not using in the refridgerator to maximize their lifespan. One important thing though is to *make sure that they keep the same temperature the whole time*. If you keep your oils in the refrigerator and take them out to make something, put them back as fast as possible. The only thing that makes the product get rancid faster then being in a warm temperature, *is making the temperature change too often*. Of course it doesn't matter if you choose to keep them in the refrigerator and a month later decide to keep them in your bathroom. Just don't move them back and forward.

If you do keep your oils in the bathroom, put a little vitamin E in it to make it hold longer. Vitamine E is *not* a preservative, nor will it ever be, but it's an *antioxidant*. That means that it's easier to break down then the oil itself, so when the oxygen comes to the oil it will ""attack"" the vE first and *then* the oil (Disclaimer: English is, as you probably have understood already, not my main language, I can explain this a lot better in my main language. If you're interested, try doing a simple googling about it) 

If you use something with water in it, ex a lotion, **you must use preservatives**. Otherwise it will have to through it away in a couple weeks. Same things goes with things you have in the shower/bathtub that gets water in them unintentional.

Remember that most preservatives are considered safe if used in a small amount. When the factories make makeup and skinproducts, they make products that are supposed to hold themself fresh for years and years, and even if the lid gets dropped under the bed and the family cat puts its nose it it. To that, they need a loooot of preservatives. When you make skinproducts yourself, you often only make for the next month or so, that only requires liiiiittle amounts of preservatives. 

If you're 100% against preservatives, don't use lotions at all, just stick to plain oils. They can replace most of the things you need lotions and other waterbased stuff for anyways.

You can read a lot more about what *kind* of preservatives and antioxidants on the internet. I will not go into that here.

And as /u/annaqua already stated in another post, grapefruitseed extract is not a good preservative. What I've learned, is that when they launched it a few years ago it was ""totally awesome"" since it was a natural preservative that worked just as good as chemichal ones. Later on, they discovered that it was the insect spray they've treated the grapefruits with that got stuck in the seeds, and then worked as a ""preservative"". As you can understand, that is not very good.",,False,self,t5_2s4dv,False,,n8,True,t3_16ioso,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/16ioso/some_important_things_to_remember_when_doing_the/,

My hair is fairly long, just passed my mid back. Its been chemically beaten up in the past, the ends/bottom 1.5 feet are fried. 

This shampoo keeps my hair moisture balanced from the roots to the tips. No greasy head, no dried frazzled ends. 

I tried doing the no poo, the castile soap, and everything in between I never felt like anything was working for me, I always ended up with frizzy ends, or gross scalp. 

It even makes a great body wash! Woohoo!

I just made another batch today, infused the oils with 1oz thyme and 1.5 oz fresh coffee grounds specifically for my body.. but, It could be used for hair too ;D If you do make this - the coffee will darken light hair and may give a reddish hue.

 I also use a home made body butter [link here](http://www.learningherbs.com/news_issue_87.html) which pairs pretty good with it.. or anything for that matter! I added patchouli EO to mine, its wonderful!

If you have really dry skin, do an exfoliation in the shower - take a mug and fill it half full with salt and add a bit of water just so it makes a runny paste I also like to add essential oils or dried thyme depending on my mood. Rub your body vigorously with that, rinse it off and when you get out of the shower butter up!!

additionally, i think it may have shortened my period last month and it helped ease the cramps. it also helps me get rid of water weight. 

i either put some (usually around 1 oz) in a liter of water and sip on it as usual, or if i feel like i can't tolerate the flavor that day, i'll put a tablespoon into 4-6 ounces of water and chug it. don't drink it straight, or you might erode your enamel and burn your esophagus.

Don't buy this packages, and if you happened to buy them, **do never ever use them**. You have no clue what they contain, and odds are that the manyfacturers doesn't know it either. Henna + chemicals is a very bad combination.

I know people have gotten bad things over Ebay for example, so be careful when you buy!

And this isn't really about the same thing, but; worth mentioning that

1. Henna is red, and only one colour. There is no different types of hennacolour. So…

2. All packages selling ""black henna"", ""brown henna"" etc - not henna. BUT…

3. There is a lot of other herbs that you can colour your hair with, so these packages isn't always bad. Look through the ingredients, if it's only herbs it's still a good product even if it's not pure henna (even if it's probably more economic to buy all the different types of herbs by themself and mix them yourself). Indigo and katam makes the colour darker, marigold or hibiscus makes it more red, cassia can give blonde hair a strawberry blonde colour etc.

1362540637.0,26,self.NaturalBeauty,19r4le,Can we talk Shea Butter?,28,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/19r4le/can_we_talk_shea_butter/,"If this has been done recently I will happily remove this post. 

Having recently discovered how awesome unrefined shea butter is (especially as a previous acne sufferer) I wanted to open up some dialog about shea butter brands. 

I first got into shea butter with [NOW](http://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Shea-Butter-7-Ounce/dp/B000F4J8VI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362540029&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=now+shea+butter) brand shea butter, $8/7oz, which I have since learned is most likely refined since it is almost pure white, soft, and has no smell. I initially bought it because it was cheaper at my local market than what I later learned is unrefined (better) shea butter. 

Now brand shea butter was not bad, I just didn't know at the time that it was severely lacking compared to unrefined. It felt greasy long after I put it on my face, but it didn't clog my pores. I didn't notice any significant change in my skin while using it, probably because it doesn't contain all of the skin healing properties of shea butter. I also noticed that my acne didn't clear up very much when using this shea butter as a moisturizer - although it didn't get any worse, either. 

I moved on to [Alaffia](http://www.amazon.com/Alaffia-Handcrafted-Butter-Unscented-butter/dp/B002L2E9AW/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362540122&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=alaffia+shea+btuter) shea butter, which is roughtly $10/2oz, is unrefined, and sustainable (per their labeling). The difference between it and the NOW (refined) shea butter was astounding. It smells nutty and smokey (which I love), it has a much darker tan color, and it's pretty solid, I have to scrape some off the top and melt it between my fingers before I apply it to my skin, but once it soaks in there's no residual greasy feeling. I have no doubt that this is indeed unrefined shea butter. My skin looks amazing, the lines that usually mark under my eyes and at the corners of my mouth don't seem to appear mid-day like they used to, and my acne has completely cleared up (I think I was getting acne from using comedogenic oils). 

Today my [Mountain Rose Herbs](http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/butter/butter.php#but_but_s) shea butter arrived ($8/8oz). I expected it to be dark and solid like the Alaffia shea butter, since it also claims to be unrefined (and is a respected supplier), but I was surprised to find that it is creamy yellow in color, very soft and extremely grainy. From what I have read this means it may have been improperly heated and cooled - which concerns me. It has a glorious nutty aroma and sinks right into my skin leaving no greasy residue, but I am concerned that it may not be truly unrefined, and certainly not raw as they claim. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any thoughts on these, or other brands. Specifically if anyone out there knows shea butter well enough to shed some light on my concerns about Mountain Rose Herbs shea butter.

I had made a kind of experimental deodorant a while back but I altered my recipe and have used it for the past day or two and it works SO well! I'm shocked. The other stuff I made only worked for about 4hrs...

**My recipe is:**
* Coconut oil
* Beeswax
* Vitamin E oil (preservative)
* Tea tree oil (preservative and anti-smell-bad-stuff)
* Scented oils (natural oil perfumes I bought at a festival)
* Baking soda (helps make this recipe semi-antiperspirant)

The beeswax to oil ratio was a lot different than lotions. Between the amount of beeswax I used and the baking soda it was almost as thick as an actual thing of store bought deodorant.

Melt the wax and coconut oil and mix well.

Add the vit. e oil, TT oil, and your smelly oils. 

Turn the heat off and add baking soda. I added about 1/8 cup for 1/2 cup's worth of melted oil-wax if I recall correctly.

Let it cool juuust enough to be thick then put it in your mold. I actually used an old washed our deodorant container.

Let set and cool overnight! :)

This doesn't block sweat as much as regular store bought stuff, so heavy exercise or a long day outside in the heat will likely still result in sweaty pits, but for my day job indoors it worked GREAT! No smell and no sweat and I put it on about 18hrs ago.

I had really bad blackheads all throughout my teen age years and nothing ever helped. This oil cleanse sort of takes some time but it really works great so it's worth it. I noticed big changes in a week. I would imagine it would work just fine as a cleanser for you lucky people without blackheads as well.

in a 1/2-1 oz. glass jar:

1 part castor oil

2 parts organic extra virgin olive oil

4 drops tea tree oil

4 drops rose-hip seed essential oil 

1 drop lavender essential oil

(optional, 1 drop lemon eo or another essential oil that's good for skin)

Give it a good shakin' before use. Wet your face. Then, with clean hands, rub a nickle sized amount of the oil on your hands, then rub into face in all sorts of different motions and directions. This lets the oil really get deep into your skin, pushing all the bad stuff out. If you have troubled areas, spend more time rubbing that area. I do this for 5-7 minutes, or until my skin feels very tight. Next I wet a wash cloth with warm/hot water and put it on my face, until the wash cloth turns cool. I repeat this 4-6 times. After this, wet the wash cloth and very gently wipe your face until it is no longer oily.

I've found it doesn't dry my face out or make it any oilier than normal!

EDIT: I've be scolded in another subreddit for suggesting lemon in this recipe. One drop, however, would not hurt. Whatever, learn about photo-toxicity and essential oils. Also I forgot to add that you should do this once a day. At night or morning. If you do this at night, give your face a gentle wipe with a damp washcloth in the morning, and vice-versa.  And valentinedoux (in the comments) is correct, hot water may dry out your skin. Use warm. I have not found that hot water dries out my skin but I also use a moisturizer.

**Fruits and berries**

Almost all fruits and berries can be used for facialmasks, but if you have any specific problems with your skin, you should look up wich fruit to use first.

Dry skin: Avocado, banana, papaya

Oily skin: Pineapple, strawberries, grapefruit, pear

Lemon is also a good thing to but in a facial mask, if you have dry skin orange might be better.

*A little extra that's not really a facial mask but can be used at the same time: Tomatoes can be used as facial scrubs, cucumbers and raw potato is great for tired eyes.*

**Herbs**

Almost all herbs has healing and neutrulizing propertys, so just go crazy! All the common herbs that almost everyone with a decent kitchen keep at home is great; Oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, etc. Just use what you have home(just try to use raw herbs and not herb-mixes, so you know exactly what you put on your skin)!

If you have problem with acne, try using any herb that has antibacterial/antiinflammatory properties. Herbs that are good for acne is for example dandelion root, turmeric and red clover.

If you have dry skin, you don't really have to worry which herbs you use - more or less all herbs will do you good.

You can use fresh herbs, dried herbs, herb extracts or glycerine extract (to make a glycerine extract yourself is very easy). Just be careful that you don't put too much of a glycerine extract in it, because too much glycerine on the skin will get sticky.

**Stachs**

Since I make all my facialmasks with clay, I don't really have this problem, but if you mix liquid things with each other you might need to add something to make the mask a little thicker. 

Both potatostach, cornstarch, ricestarch or anything simular to that is good. You can also use ground oatmeal, that is also very good for the skin.

More things to thicken with is under ""things to make the mask thicker"".

**Other kitchen things**

Eggs. If you have dry skin that needs to be moisturized, use the yellow part. The white part is tightening and can be used for making your skin feel younger/fresher, but if you already have dry skin that might feel *too* tighten.

Honey is an incredible softener, moisturezer and also has great cleaning properties.

Yogurt works calming for the skin, and also have a peeling effect. If you can't get the yogurt to stick to your face, try mixing it with something to make it a little thicker (some starch, xantangum, guar, etc). Cream can also be used for dry skin.


**OTHER INGREDIENTS TO USE**

**Things to make the mask thicker**

I've already mentioned starchs and ground oatmeal, and I will mention clay. You will need a thickener if the thing you're going to use is liquid, you can mix this with both liquids and fruits. Just be careful - if you make it too thick, the skin won't be able to absorb the ingredients!

Xantangum is what you use to make gel, so if you put this in the mix will be a little gel-ish. As I said earlier, I always use clay in my facial masks so I don't really have to use any thickener, but for my hairmasks I often use a little bit of this.

Other things to use like this is cellulosa, pektin or carrageen.

**Emulsifiers**

If you use any emulsifier, like Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate and Glyceryl Stearate (those two are used together), the mix will be more like a lotion.

**Different types of clay**

Rassoulclay is very cleansing (it's awesome to use both as schampo and a bodycleaner) so if you feel like you really need to get your face washed, this is the one you should use. It's not really ment for facialmasks though, it's more of a cleanser, but since I really love it I felt like I wanted to mention it anyway. And of course you *can* make a facialmask out of it.

The different clays have different colors:

The **red** clay is good for normal skin.

The **white** clay (Kaolin) is good for sensetive skin.

The **green** clay is good for oily skin.

The **pink** clay is good for dry skin.

**Moisturizers**

Glycerin is a great moisturizer for both hair and skin, just be careful to not put in too much - too much glycerine will make it sticky and instead dry out your skin. You can put 10% of glycerine in a skinproduct, but I would say that you don't need more than 5% in a facialmask. 

Sorbitol can replace glycerine.

Silk protein is protective and good for the cold season etc, but only use around 1% because otherwise your skin will be uncomfortable tightened.

Sodium Lactate is another great moisturizer, it's a vegetable alternative for the animalistic collagen. Use very little, maybe 3%.

Lactic acid can also be used, but just a few drops then (less than 1%).

**Vitamines**

Vitamine E is very good for the skin, so this can be added. D-panthenol (Vitamine b5) can also be added (this is one of my favorite ingredients when i make my skinproducts), wich is very good for the skin. Just don't add more than 1% of any of them. 

**Seaweed**

I personally don't use seaweed so I really don't have much to write here, but seaweed is very good for your skin, I don't know - google it or something (*If anyone is good at this, write a comment and I'll add it*)

**Oils**

Don't put too much oil in a facial mask, if you do that the mask won't attach to your face. 

I'm not going to write too much about each oil here, that would take too long time to do, I'm just sorting them up by what they're good for. If you want to know more, feel free to ask because I know a lot about them. And also, of course there is a lot of other oils, I just thought I should mention the most commonly used.

Oils for a dry skin: Olive, canola, shea, almond, peachseed

Oils for a oily skin: Jojoba, sesame, olive, thistle (I love thistleoil even if i don't have oily skin), hempseed

Oils for a mixed skin: Almond, jojoba, oive, sesame

**Essential oils**

Never put more then a few drops of EO is the mask, because essential oils are really strong and will irritate your skin if you take too much.

There is so many essential oils out there, so to mention them all would take forever, so here's just a few:

EO that's good for all types of skin:  Bergamot, rosemary, lemongrass, geranium, lavender, patchouli,  

EO for dry skin: Rosewood, rose, jasmin

EO for oily skin: Orange, tea tree, lemon, peppermint

EO for sensitive skin: Cedar, sandalwood

As I got out of the bath today, I realised just how minimal my skin and hair care regime has become, and had to share it, and say thank you for all the amazing ideas and advice that you've been posting!  [Here it is](http://imgur.com/4GPwFKK)

After about six months of experimenting with different ingredients and methods (loved OCM but the steam and flannel were too harsh for my pink, whiteboy skin!), I've finally reached a point were my regime works perfectly for me. My skin and hair have NEVER been this good, and I'm so happy! 

L-R

(jar furthest left is full of cotton buds for toner)

**- toner / aftershave** (witch hazel, lavender essential oil)

**- sunscreen / night face cream** (jojoba oil, beeswax, zinc oxide, lavender eo)

**- hand soap / shaving lather** (olive oil, mineral salt, water) - storebought

**- moisturizer / hair oil / pre-shave oil** (jojoba oil)

**- flick method sugaring paste for body hair** (sugar, lemon, water) - storebought

Only 9 ingredients in my whole regime, and my body loves all of them!

The biggest revelation for me was realising that once you're free from the false economy of the beauty industry, that the products you use can have so many different uses! 

If anyone else feels like contributing, I'd love to see your hauls too!!

p.s) I'm a no-pooer, just put a few drops of jojoba oil in my hair once or twice a week, no scary acv or baking soda rinses for me!

Thayer's uses two different preservatives: alcohol and grapefruit seed extract. Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) is used in their alcohol-free formulations, and there's bad news about this: **grapefruit seed extract is tainted with synthetic preservatives.** (Sources: [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10399191) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16719494) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453769) [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16159196) [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9037863) [6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468864)).

 I wanted to bring this up because GSE is often used and touted as a ""natural preservative""~~, but what gives it the antimicrobial properties is not the natural components of it, but the fact that grapefruits are often sprayed with pesticides,  which get through to the seeds and remain in the extraction process~~. (Edited per /u/smpg's comments below!)

As always, information and education are key to making informed decisions regarding our health and beauty. Feel free to do with this information what you will! :)

*Comedogenic rating* (scale of 0-5, 5 being most pore-clogging): 1

*What it's used for*: Added in as a skin and hair conditioner. 
 It adsorbs (sticks) on to the outer cuticle of hair and forms a film on the hair which smoothes down the cuticle. It lubricates the hair and is thought to contribute to easier wet combing (i.e less friction). In hair serum, for thermal processing, dimethicone is a heat protectant. Shampoos with sulfates are ideal for removing products with dimethicone. ([via.](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/search/label/Ingredients%20Dictionary)) Generally speaking, silicones build up on the hair and can only be adequately removed with sulfates. Sulfates are extremely drying to the hair, and can cause a whole host of problems with hair health. It is best to avoid silicones in hair care, so as to avoid sulfates in hair care. 

In skincare, it prevents water loss by forming a hydrating barrier on the skin. Like most silicones, this ingredient has a unique fluidity that makes it easily spreadable. When applied to the skin, its known for creating a subtle gloss that feels smooth and silky to touch. It also acts a mild water repellent by forming a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in fine lines/wrinkles on the face, giving it a temporary “plump” look. ([via.](http://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/dimethicone)) Because silicones sit on top of the skin, they can trap dirt, bacteria, etc. and cause breakouts. 

Silicones are not readily biodegradable, so they can have negative impacts when they are washed down the drain.

1357537171.0,20,self.NaturalBeauty,163ssk,A very depth information about Essential oils. Probably everything you ever wanted to know....,23,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/163ssk/a_very_depth_information_about_essential_oils/,"

I know aromatherapy and essential oils are becoming more popular, and you are finding them for sale a lot more readily available. I thought I'd give some information to everyone on how to properly buy or identify a good grade essential oil. I've supplied a lot of information =] hope some of it makes some sense.

I have this similar post, not as detailed in some other subreddits, but someone suggested I post it again here, so here it is! With more to wrap your brain around.

Just for the record, I am not a certified aromatherapist. The course is ridiculously expensive.. maybe one day. But I am a firm believer in the use of essential oils as well as herbalism. If anyone has any questions on either, I can try my best to help answer with what I know. Or if someone else here is certified aromatherapist or herbalist it would be great to hear from you :) I have many questions!

I am supplying the information I received from an aromatherapy weekend course, as well as all of my own research since then. So please, do not hold any of my methods, blends ideas accountable for anything. Everything is at your own risk. You should always consult a certified aromatherapist if you are looking to use EO for medicinal use. They can be very dangerous if you don't know the specificity for each oil. There are some oils that cannot be used with pregnant ladies, certain diseases/conditions. Skin sensitivities can be a hazard as well.

If you are planning to use essential oils on your own, just remember **Always use smaller concentrations with animals and children! Always dilute your oils, unless specified by a certified aromatherapist**

First I want to start by saying, I live in Canada.. so we are a part of the Canadian Federation of Aromatherapy (CFA)

There are many factors that can determine whether or not you are getting legit good grade essential oils. Once you read through this post, it should be clear as to why some oils can be so expensive. Fun fact: It takes about 60000 roses to produce just 1 ounce of oil :)

**3 models of aromatherapy** 

**-** German emphasises inhalation of EO

**-** British is very conservative, support high level dilution, no emphasis on theraputic grade oils

**-** French proactive and support NEAT (direct skin use). Rely strongly on scientific studies, emphasises therapeutic uses.

**3 Factors to grow the best crop** – Take into consideration for purchasing essential oils (EO)

**-** grown with no pollution.

**-** Harvested properly. Only oil pockets should be harvested not the whole plant.

**-** Harvested when yield is highest.

**Facts about Essential oils you may not know:**

 - A bottle of EO only needs 3-5% of actually essential oil to be labeled 'pure' which is why its important to research the brands quality.

Oil pockets are specific to each plant they are found in. A plant grown one place will be different to another.

CO2 extracted – not for medicinal use

Steam extracted – is the best. You should only purchase and use this.

Allergic reactions to scents usually come from synthesized material used in place of oil. 

All plants have their own antidotes, there’s no allergens to pure oil. 

Sandalwood tree grows 50 years before it can be harvested. Forest fires have limited the production of this EO.

*It's always nice to incorporate a drop of a persons 'essence' into their blend. Eg; a showy person, likes attention – they may like cinnamon. A down to earth person – Thyme.*


**Quality control** 
*What to look for and ask to see when buying oils. If the seller doesn’t have the information, or isn't sure what you mean...* **DO NOT BUY!**

**Botanical name** – normally on the front of the bottle ie. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) Always *Always* Make sure to check the botanical name, there are sometimes mulitple types of one plant and they can be VERY different, for instance, the regular lavendar you know is called lavendar officinalis, but there is also a Lavendar lespica.. it smells different and is used for a stimulant (complete opposites!)

**Geographical location** – where the plant was harvested from

**Plant harvest** – Wild is best. It has natural fighting instincts, making its biochemical make up stronger. 

**Stage of development** – if the plant was at its highest peak when harvested

**Distilled organ** – not usually worried about in North America

**Mode of extraction** – You always want steam distilled

**Biochemical specificty** - Designation of biochemical specificity is critical in knowing what unique characteristics are available for therapeutic uses and specific purposes. For example, there are several forms of essential oil of Thyme, each having its own therapeutic benefits and uses. Knowing the distinctions can keep you and your family safe, and benefiting from the wisdom of the ages. [site explaining gas chromatography and steam distillation](http://www.frre.utn.edu.ar/quimobi/clean/files/get/item/1870)
 

This may seem tricky to begin with, but look these things up online and you will learn better, or take a weekend aromatherapy course :)

**Modes of use**
*topical* – most common
for Massage, compresses, hand/foot bath, regular bath. If you are using oils in a path, place your salts/oils/oats ect in cheesecloth to hold everything together. 

    Always dilute with skin sensitivities.

    Don't use petroleum based oils, mineral oils, or baby oil they decrease the absorption on skin.

    Essential oils don't mix well with water, they need a medium. Vodka or witch hazel work good, as does any sort of oil – olive, apricot, sweet almond ect.

    Always mix your oils in glass, it can eat through plastic. Once it is mixed with a medium it is alright for plastic containers.

**Aerosols** – affect the limbic system
**Always use a GLASS diffuser**

    Oil goes through the glass and adamises through the air.

    Heating oils – heat kills the biochems therefore leaving no therapeutic effect, but smells nice

    using pads – all the biochemicals evaporate, leaving only a nice scent.

    Plastic – oils eat through plastic. Not a good idea

As I mentioned earlier, diluted EO's don't eat plastic, so blends in blastic are ok!

**Cooking** – helps increase flavour, add it right before serving, don't cook the EO. And you only need a drop or two in each personal serving. A little goes a long way.

    Try these – 1 drop of basil on a bowl of chili

    mix 1 drop of ginger in with sugar for sprinkling on gingersnaps
    
    peppermint EO in icing for cakes, cookies ect.
    
    Peppermint or sweet orange in a cup of hot chocolate. 

**Gardening**  

You can line a garden bed (or plant pots) with a string soaked in a diluted citrus essential oil. 
I don't have much experience with this area, but certain EO's can keep birds away from berries, pests away from trees.. :) you can also use certain EO's on pets to keep ticks away, thyme is one of them! 


    A nice carpet cleaner/pwder I use before vaccuming – 1 cup of baking soda, 20 drops total of (top)sweet orange, (mid)bergamot, (base) eucalyptus. Sprinkle it all around and let it sit for up to an hour, its safe to walk on I sometimes move it around with my feet. Then vacuum it up! Sometimes I sprinkle EO into my vacuum bag too for a nice scent. 

    Floor washing – 1/2c vinegar, with a mixture of orange, grapefruit, eucalyptus


*Fragrance notes are based on volatility and viscosity.* This is what gives you Top Mid and Base notes. Lighter oils are top notes meaning they will disappear quicker you add moire of this, where base notes stay and linger, you need less of this one. [site with good information on fragrance notes and much more](http://www.essentialoils.co.za/fragrance-notes.htm#Holistic%20and%20alternative%20medicine)

Top notes: evaporate quickest, increase the # of drops, most stimulating

Mid notes: Balancer, increase concentration

Base notes: Smell last, is strongest, dont use a lot, sedative/fixative in the blend.

    A good ratio to use Top4 Mid3 Base1, and apply that to your carrier
    More ratios If you're wanting something from an acute problem use 10 drops, ratio 1 top 2 mid.
*Chronic: 7 drops total 2 mid 1 base*
*Synergistic: 8 drops 1 top 1 mid*

**Here is a Blending guide:**

For **normal dilution - which is 2.5%**

x amount of carrier oil - divide by 2 = drops of essential oil
for example: 20ml carrier oil / 2 = 10 drops.

Example of a 2.5% blend - 5 sandalwood, 3 lavendar, 2 orange in 20ml apricot kernel oil.

**Low dilution 1% for sensitive skin and pregnancy** (always check with a certified aromatherapist or someone of alternative medicine before using when pregnant, for children or babies)

X amount carrier oil in ml - divide by 4 = essential oil drops

**Extremely low dilution, sensitive skin, children, babies**
1 drop : 10 ml Or use sweet almond oil by itself.

**Some nice blends:**

Clary sage + ylangylang – calming

Lemon grass – 10 drops in a hotel(or house) tub to help 
cleans air, make it really hot so the room steams up.

Grapefruit – brings joy helps with releasing grief

Thyme – gets rid of ticks

Lemon – cleansing. Good to diffuse in the air when cleaning, or use in household cleansers

Basil + lavender – helps with insomnia

geranium – increases ambiance, brings conversation to a party when diffused in air.

Clarysage – helps with painful periods, dysmenorrhea

Thyme, lineol, honey – good for coughs

nettle herb and rosemary – gives hair a nice effect

wintergreen, lemongrass – good for arthritis relief

patchouli – great for skin in general

vitivere + grapefruit – I just really like this one lol

citronella, peppermint, lemongrass – repel bugs/ants


considerations when blending: [Carrier oil info and shelf lives](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html)

**oil chemistry:** volatility, viscolsity and properties.

Desired therapeutic action – blending correctly allows synergistic affect in the blend (action of oils increase by mixing together)

sequence of blend – changing the sequence of blending can chance the bichem properties and smell

Base oils: It's nice to use a mixture of different base oils here's some general information about some different oils, this info is easy to find anywhere on the internet though.

    *All purpose oils – used for cosmetics, massage, fragrant baths. Oils listed below:*

Apricot kernel – high mineral and vitamins, natural moisturizer. Light texture, increases penetrative qualities.

Sunflower – Fine. Good for massage blends, high in vitamin E

Sweet almond – Soothing, softening properites. Good for babies.

Grapeseed – Good for oily skin.

    *Special carrier oils: help increase skin penetration, nourish dry dehydrated skin, increase a lifespan of oil blends.* 

Carrot oil – lots of vitamins, A especailly.. helps with tanning careful it can stain.

Sesame – 85% unsaturated 15% saturated fat. Used as additive to enrich other oils.

Avocado – lots of vit A, B, lecithin, protiens, fats, gives soft skin, absorbs easy.

Jojoba – long shelf life, thicken reams, resembles skins natural sebum. Suitable for face.

Wheatgerm – rich and viscous. Strong smell. Use 10-20% ratio to other oils to prevent rancidity.


**Chemistry** [site reference](http://www.experience-essential-oils.com/chemistry-of-essential-oil.html)

This may be a bit in depth. But its useful information if you wanna get more serious about your oils!

Therapeutic oil has no propylene glycol or petrochemicals

main groups of compounds in EO's are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds which are further divided...

*monoterpenes:* – inhibit accumulation of toxins, detox kidneys, liver. Enhance therapeutic values of other compounds, balancing.

*High in monoterpenes: Grapefruit, orange, baloomfir*

*Phenolics* – stimulate the nervous system and immune system. Clean receptor sites for cells so faulty information can be deleted from the cell. Antioxidants, increase oxygenating molecules, anti-infectious, anti-bacterial, antiseptic

*High in phenolic – wintergreen, clove, teatree*

*Alcohols* – increase resistance to oxidation. Ability to revert cells to their normal function, anti infectious/viral/bacteraial.

*high in alcohols: rosewood, geranium, rose otto*

*Esters* – reaction of alcohol and acid. Most relaxing, calming, balancing. Regulate the nervous sytem. Anti-fungal decrease inflamation and spasm.

*High in esters: bergamot, valerian, roman chammomile*

* Aldehydes* – Delightful fragrances. Antiviral, inflammation, calms nervous system, helps decrease blood pressure, relieves stress.

*High in aldehydes: cinnamon bark, lemon grass*

*Ketones* – Not as prevalent as monoterpenes and alcohol. Distinctive fragrance. Calming, sedative. Stimulates cell regeneration, increases cell growth and liquivies mucous.

*High in ketones: western red cedar, rosemary, idaho tansy*

*Oxides* – derived from compounds such as alcohol, terpenes, or ketones which have been oxidized. 

*High in oxides – Ravensara, eucaluptus*

    other compounds 20% or less: Alkalines, etheres, carboxylic, acids, lactines, coumarins, furanoids.

Most of these sub-groups can be broke down into specific compounds from there you can really see a total chemical profile of an EO.

    ie. grapefruit profile
    90-95% monoterpenes, 3-8% tetraterpenes, 1-3% aldehydes, &gt;3% furanocoumarines, sesquiterpenones, alochols, thiols. Aka detoxifeir, antiseptic, antiviral due to increased monoterpenes.

The past three nights I've been using the following on my face in the areas (namely the chin) where I have the most breakouts/marks:
-crushed non-coated aspirin
-raw honey
-finely chopped fresh thyme

I let it sit for about half an hour, rinse it off, then put some more honey on to sit for a bit before rinsing that off before bed (honey on pillows = bad!) and using some shea butter to moisturize. It seems to be doing a good job of reducing the look of the old breakouts, and heading off those ones I can feel brewing!

(Until recently I used to use coconut oil and had used it before to help clear up some reakout issues I was having, but found out recently that shea butter isnon-comedogenic, and the coconut oil wasn't working this time around! No, *my precious*! I still use it on my body, but it just goes to show that sometimes what worked previously won't work again.

But lets make this fun! The purpose of this contest is to encourage people to share their favorite natural beauty solutions. So please see this more as an incentive to get you to talk, rather than a competition. Again is no big deal, the prize cost 9 dollars.


**Requirements to be able to participate**: You must be subscriber of r/naturalbeauty. 

**Rules** Don't tell /r/freebies about it.

**How to participate:** Write your favorite or a unique natural recipe, maybe your grandma told you about it? Or maybe you were mixing a bunch of natural stuff and came up with a great recipe? Or maybe you read about it on a book or blog? Doesn't matter, anything that hasn't been discuss on /r/NaturalBeauty yet, is valid. Then once you wrote down your recipe, pick a number from 0-300 (Make sure that your number hadn't been taken yet). You can submit various recipes and pick another number too, as long as they differ from one to another. Your recipes must be rich in details along with the ingredients that you used and where do you get them, the more details you give us the better.

**How the winner will be pick:** The winner will be pick by a random number generator, I will most likely record my self using the random number generator to assure transparency and fairness. This competition will be close on Monday 10PM New York time. And the winner will be announce on by Tuesday. I will generate numbers until there's a winner.

**How the prize will be deliver:** The prize will be bought off amazon and send as a gift. If the person lives where Amazon can't reach, then another form of compensation will be arrange. 

**Example of a submission:** Number **0** I like use  maple syrup on my hair, it moisturize it and gives it a lot of shine. I use Butternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Medium Amber that I got off Amazon on my hair for 30 minutes, then I rinse it off with warm water. 

Have fun! Good luck! Talk, ask questions.

1366437698.0,17,self.NaturalBeauty,1cq85v,HELP!!! Choosing oils for the Oil Cleansing Method (x-post r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide),18,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1cq85v/help_choosing_oils_for_the_oil_cleansing_method/,"I have generally had very clear, not-too-sensitive skin that would err on the dry side in winter.  I skipped on cleaning it regularly since (I thought) I ""never needed to"".  Bad habit to develop!

Over the last two months I've had some issues with my skin (and hair) becoming oilier.  I think something else could be going on that's making things wonky, because this started two months ago kind of without reason.  I want to try the OCM to at least help clear up all the junk that's starting to build up, but I'm completely lost as to what oils to start with and am a little afraid of breaking out further.  I'm not used to dealing with acne, which has been a blessing, but now I'm entering unknown territory and am completely lost as to what would help.  *I'm happy to post pictures if that would help, too.*


**My Skin TL;DR:**

*  I would still describe my skin as relatively balanced, though it has been oilier than it's usual well-moisturized-and-maybe-a tad-dry-ness.  

*  I get lots of whiteheads/deeper junk around my chin (never red acne though), with occasional blackheads.  I also get these popping up on my temples/forehead sometimes.  

*  Lately I've been getting one small red zit after another, usually one at a time.  Generally I only get one or two when my hormones peak every month, so I'm not sure why I'm suddenly getting them so often/regularly.


I'm very good about leaving angry zits them alone or cleansing them safely and appropriately, but I'm still working on keeping my hands away from my chin/mouth area.


I have read [this wonderful post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) about the OCM, and now I'm down to deciding what oils I want to start with from Garden of Wisdom.  I am going for one of the [Balanced Skin Sample Packs](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7018338/7053345.htm), maybe two depending on what everyone recommends.  Oils with anti-aging/wrinkle properties really appeal to me, but clearing up my skin is number one.  After reading through the descriptions of every one of the oil options, I have narrowed it down to these:

*  **Baobab Oil**: absorbs quickly, does not clog pores, conditioning, very rich and stable

*  **Black Raspberry Seed**: light, absorbs quickly into skin, fights signs of aging, antioxidant

*  **Brazil Nut Oil**: conditioning, very rich and stable, high in selenium

*  **Candela Infused Oil**: regenerative, anti-inflammatory, soothing, promotes circulation

*  **Camellia Oil (Olferia)**: excellent skin and hair conditioning properties, anti-aging, fights wrinkles, helps to diminish fine lines, nice and light weight, emollient

*  **Hazelnut Oil**: slightly astringent, tones skin, fast absorption rate, tightens skin, maintains firmness and elasticity of skin, helps to strengthen capillaries, encourages cell regeneration, stimulates circulation

*  **Jojoba Oil Gold**: dissolves sebum and limits oil production in oily skin, protects skin while allowing to to breath, antioxidant, not greasy and sinks right into skin

*  **Meadowfoam Oil**: one of the best oils to prevent moisture loss, conditioning, excellent for dry and dehydrated skin, adds shine and nourishment to hair, very stable

*  **Passion Fruit/Marajuca Oil**: antibacterial, anti-itch, anti-inflammatory

*  **Tamanu Oil**: emollient, regenerative, great around delicate tissue, analgesic, softening


Should I consider something like Flax Seed Oil or Chardonnay Grapeseed Oil for the somewhat oilier skin I've been dealing with?  Or the pH-restoring effects of Pomegranate Oil?  Anyone had experiences with some of the more uncommon ones here?  Good experiences with something else I didn't mention??  *I'm just really struggling.

*Other names*: Dowanol, Arosol 6705, Phenoxetol, Rose ether, Phenoxyethyl alcohol, Glycol monophenyl ether, Beta-hydroxyethyl phenyl ether

*Type of ingredient*: Preservative, fragrance stabilizer; often synthetically derived, though may be naturally derived as well

*Comedogenic rating* (scale of 0-5, 5 being most pore-clogging): ? No data

*Safety rating* (scale of 0-10, 10 being most unsafe): 4

*What it's used for*: Phenoxyethanol is a non-paraben preservative and is sometimes used as a stabilizer in perfumes. Because it is not a paraben, it was greeted with much excitement in the non-toxic beauty world. ECOCERT originally certified products with phenoxyethanol(PE), but has withdrawn PE from their list of safe ingredients. Because reformulation is expensive (in time and money), many ""natural"" beauty brands still have PE in their formulations.

In 2008, the FDA issued a [warning about phenoxyethanol](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116900.htm) in a lotion for nursing mothers, saying that PE ""can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration in infants.""

PE is a commonly referenced allergen with regard to [contact dermatitis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16823706) and [eczema](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18709291). It has been linked to [reproductive system toxicity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6351353) and [neurotoxicity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10959804).

If I haven't got enough time in the morning, I cleanse with manuka honey and moisturize lightly with coconut oil.

I'm really happy with the results, my skin is clear, no spots and super-dewy. However, I am getting a small dry patch of dry, flaky skin on each cheek, and think I could do with some extra moisturizing. 

Although thankfully I've not had this, I've heard that coconut oil can clog your pores if you use too much, and so was thinking of applying aloe vera gel to finish.

But as my skin routine is mostly working brilliantly, I'm scared that this could eff it up and give me breakouts. What does r/naturalbeauty recommend?

EDIT (IN CONCLUSION): I found these two sites (listed below) to be EXACTLY what i was looking for... the ingredients are as 'clean&amp;green' as it gets and while they are NOT antiperspirants they deodorize very well, moisturize and leave a light/pleasant scent behind.

*Other names*: Butyrospermum Parkii

*Type of ingredient*: Butters/oils

*Comedogenic rating* (scale of 0-5, 5 being most pore-clogging): 0

*Safety rating* (scale of 0-10, 10 being most unsafe): 0

*What it's used for*: Extremely moisturizing, shea butter is mainly used in the cosmetics industry for skin and hair related products (lip gloss, skin moisturizer creams and emulsions, and hair conditioners for dry and brittle hair). It is also used by soap makers, typically in small amounts (5-7% of the oils in the recipe), because of its property of leaving a small amount of oil in the soap.

Forms a breathable, water-resistant film and is a leading natural product for moisturizing. A wonderful base for cosmetic recipes or used as a stand alone application, this comes highly recommended for those concerned about naturally healthy skin.

* I really love makeup. Some of the makeup I love is not natural and I don't really want to give it up. Will this just be reversing all the good things I do for my skin? Will I be a walking contradiction? :(

Mine is for applying Mineral Makeup, which is not only a chore IMHO, it is very messy. I usually have to wipe down my counter when I get done with my makeup in the morning. On top of that it usually makes me look older by bringing out fine lines and wrinkles. I haven't tried many ""natural"" liquid foundations because I start breaking out even using some of the better mineral makeup brands and haven't wanted to risk it. I thought I'd exhausted my application technique possibilities when trying various methods to turn it into a liquid foundation with Aloe Vera Juice, Aloe Vera Gel, With Hazel, and finally skin oils (such as jojoba and argan) - it all failed for some reason or another.

I decided randomly to try using coconut oil on my face since a lot of people have boasted about and I was unwilling to try due to problems with breakouts caused by trying new things. What I liked about it, that I didn't like about the other, less solid, oils is that it's easier to smooth on since it melts onto your skin - meaning I could mix it in a bowl first. The second thing is that it actually sinks into my skin rapidly, unlike my beloved argan oil which would leave me looking oily when I tried mixing makeup into it. My skin looks much better using coconut oil with my mineral makeup as opposed to using it by itself, and I get extra coverage - and less mess!

**Soy &amp; Oatmeal Mask**

1 tablespoon ground oat

2 tablespoons soy milk (organic and unsweetened)

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

Massage it on face, lips, neck and hands. Leave it on for 20 minutes then wipe it off with damp cloth.

Unsweetened soy milk is my esthetician's idea. She suggested that I should add soy milk instead of water in oatmeal mask because it helps in hydrating the skin, keep the skin soft and supple, and soy protein can also help keep skin firm. After my first mask, I'm already in love with it. I use this mask once a week.

**Tea Tree Mask**

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

1 teaspoon sweet almond oil

3 - 4 drops of tea tree oil

(optional) - Clean/tone skin with diluted equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar and distilled water. This mask is suitable for people with oily and acne or congested pores prone. I do this once a month.

She swears that her stylist knows what she's talking about (even though I disagree since her stylist said henna causes hair loss...) and so my friend has 3 - 4 types of very expensive shampoos and she cycles through them randomly in order to keep her hair from ""adapting.""

So, I've recently gone nopoo, no soap (except ""pits and bits""!) and once more quit deodorant. Problem: whether you stink or not is *genetic*, ladies. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor#Genetics Anecdotal: My former roommate NEVER used deodorant and NEVER stank. If I break a sweat, it will surely stink, just like my bro.)

Thanks!
**EDIT:** Ooh, should have checked this before I left for class! Thanks for the responses! 
Precisely because baking soda is rather basic and an irritant, is why I've posted. I found recipes that deal with this issue by mixing with cornstarch, but I've found conflicting info on its comedogenicity(?), but I've yet to find a reliable source.
The most effective deodorant I ever bought is the Arm &amp; Hammer Ultra Max, which uses baking soda (It *is* antiperspirant, which I don't care for. We, along with other animals, sweat for a *reason*), but I stopped using it because it stained clothes orange. I wonder if the stain culprit is the baking soda itself... (also has cornstarch, castor oil, some alcohols and, ew, talc).

So long story short, I'm mum to a very beautiful and very exhausting young daughter, I eat more junk food than I ought to, and I recently came off the pill, and my skin has turned into a crazy disaster zone! 

It's nearly all been localized around my chin and mouth, and just as one starts to go another appears! I've tried changing around products and what have you and nothing has really helped.

So this evening I decided to tinker in the kitchen with a few key ingredients which I know are great for healing, cleaning and nourishing and ended up with the holy grail of face mask/cleansers

1 tablespoon high grade (15+) Manuka Honey
1 tablespoon quick cook porridge oats
2 drops lavender oil
A scant splash of rose water

I took the honey and worked the oats between my finger tips to break them up apart a bit, and get some different textures going. Whisked them up with a knife to get it well mixed, and dropped in the lavender oil and mixed again. Then I took the rose water and just added the tiiiiiniest amount possible and kept mixing. It can turn from the right consistancy to just too thin really quickly (easily remedied by adding more solid ingredients but easier to avoid it). 

Just applied it to my poor face and left it for about 15 minutes, put some cucumber on the peepers for extra fancy facial-ness then rinsed off in circular motions with clean cool water.

And seriously what a difference! My pores are already shrinking and the spots have become much less angry and red, and appear flatter too. The areas of my skin without blemish look really radiant and even toned. So impressed! I'm going to use this a few times a week and see how it goes.

If it's already in the tube you can just hold it in your hand for a while or leave it in your car for a little bit on a warm day.

Possibly there are other people out there with my hair that want to try going shampoo free, or have already tried it and are ready to give up, so I thought I'd share what worked for me. This is a long post, so if you want to skip some, go past the .~.~. line.

My hair is long, light brown, super thin, super fine, and super straight. I have virgin hair to just below my shoulders, and about 8 inches of dye damage below that. My hair has a tendency to look greasy at the roots, even the day after washing. Using shampoo every 2-3 days, I never had problems with my hair, despite the fact that I dyed it constantly. It used to float around me, weightless and silky and feathery and awesome. [This isn't me - it's a random picture from tumblr - but she has almost the same hair.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/b7225187f66046d0e68f1c50032569e2/tumblr_mgzlhygZPl1qgpxw8o1_500.jpg)

I've been basically free of shampoo for well over a year, and for most of that time my hair was a an oily mess. It never looked clean, and it never felt clean. I started with baking soda and vinegar. The first wash was great, but after that - no matter how much I adjusted the formula - it was a downward spiral into oily, waxy hair that clumped all the way up to the roots.  

I tried water only - oily and waxy. I tried conditioner only (with my grease prone hair, what was I *thinking*?) - not waxy, but majorly oily. I tried Terressentials clay-and-aloe pure earth hair wash - oily. I thought maybe the aloe was the problem, so I tried mixing my own clay without it - dry and frizzy and coarse, if I didn't get it completely rinsed, and when I did rinse it well... oily.

I tried liquid castile soap. I tried shampoo bars - some storebought, some homemade. I tried castile soap mixed with coconut milk. I tried whole soapnuts and soapnut liquid. I tried everything with and without vinegar rinses. I tried white vinegar instead of ACV, and lemon juice instead of vinegar. I gave everything I tried at least two months, to ensure that any problems I had weren't simply transitional.

The best I could hope for was the-day-after-washing hair, and no matter how (relatively) clean my hair felt, my roots were still oily and dirty looking. I tried to convince myself that a little oil was natural, and that I had just been brainwashed by cosmetics manufacturers to desire artificially squeaky clean locks. I tried to just live with it. I wore my hair up every day and I was miserable.  

So, without further ado...  

Here's what works.  

Finally, I settled on shikakai powder. It was still lousy, but it was better than the other things I had been using, and I decided I could live with it. One day a friend gave me some henna. I added the henna to my shikakai.

**It was like magic.** At last, I had **job interview hair**. Hair clean enough that I could go to a job interview without cheating with shampoo first. My hair isn't weightless or feathery anymore - in fact, it has a little more volume and substance than it ever did, which is actually a good thing - but it is clean and smooth and I am happy with it.  

.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.

I have sensitive skin and a dry, itchy scalp, so the night before I wash my hair I rub my scalp with coconut oil and tea tree oil. (I can actually do this now!) Before I get in the shower, I brush my hair then mix about 2 tablespoons of powder into a cup of hot water. The powder just consists of equal amounts of henna and shikakai. In the shower, *before turning the water on*, I slowly saturate my dry hair with the mixture. A little at a time, starting with my scalp, I splash some on my hair and rub it in. 

By the time my hair is soaked down to the tips, I have usually been massaging the thick liquid into my scalp and hair for about 10 minutes, so I turn on the shower and rinse it out immediately, then wring as much water out as I can. I clip my hair on top of my head, do all my other shower stuff, then unclip it. I splash a few tablespoons of my herb-infused vinegar into the now-empty cup, fill it with water, then soak my hair with it. I let it sit for a few minutes while I splash the rest of the vinegar mix over my face and body, then rinse. 

I don't know if this would be needed with virgin hair, but since my ends are dyed and brittle, every few weeks I soak *just my ends* in quinoa water. This is just the incredibly protein-rich water that I have soaked and rinsed my quinoa in before cooking it. Depending on my mood, sometimes I'll rub in a tiny bit of aloe or argan oil after the shower, but only to the ends of my hair.

And that's that. I brush it, let it air dry, and it's great. I'll probably start experimenting with additions again at some point, just because I think my process still has room for some improvement, but right now I'm just enjoying my shiny clean hair.

* I didn't want to clutter the paragraph with it, but just in case anyone is interested, here's what is in my rinse: raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar infused with calendula, chamomile, coltsfoot, comfrey root, horsetail, kelp, lavender, marshmallow root, nettle, oatstraw, rosemary, slippery elm, St. John's wort, and tea.",,False,self,t5_2s4dv,1359759515.0,,,True,t3_17q0gl,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/17q0gl/henna_shikakai_shampoo_alternative_for_fine/,

I've read through the FAQ and various other posts but I still have a few questions. 

First off I would say my skin is pretty average, I don't have acne but I get some breakouts on occasion. My skin seems oily by the end of the day but not overly so. I would say my nose and upper forehead are the most oily while my lower forehead is a bit dry. Otherwise pretty normal, no real sensitivities or anything.

So that said, I'm interested in starting off with honey, and ACV / baking soda? I also have some tea tree oil and argan oil. I don't really know how to go about applying these things and how often? Can I wash my face every day or will that make me overly oily?

Long story short... sodium laureth (or lauryl) sulfate is a common ingredient in a lot of health and beauty aids. It is what makes lathery stuff lather! Most of the population has no issue with it, but for us lucky few it does! I dealt with varying degrees of red ""parentheses"" around my mouth ever since I can remember (thankfully I'm a makeup addict!). After doing some research it turned out that I had Perioral Dermatitis caused by an SLS sensitivity. I went to the doctor, and she agreed! I started buying SLS free toothpaste (Sensodyne) and I haven't had a problem since! The redness away in about a week!

I hope that this will help some people! I'm psyched to have found this subreddit! I am super picky about what products I use, and I'm going to click on this subreddit til I burst tonight! YAY!

Thought I'd write a little review since we're [always](http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/172tb8/sunscreen_help/) [talking](http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1awwf9/crap_sunburnssunscreen_options/) about how difficult it is to find a good sunscreen!

**Packaging**: Love it. [It's simple, clean, and in a brown bottle](http://0.tqn.com/d/beauty/1/0/K/J/1/john-masters-organics-sunscreen.jpg), so you know JMO isn't messing around with letting sunlight break down their products. It also has an airless pump, so no worry about contamination there. The bottle isn't huge, but 3 pumps give enough product to get my face and neck, which is good. 

**Pros**: Well, for starters, it works as a sunscreen. I am outside often with my job, and I have yet to see any change in my skin color or get a sunburn (crucial since I've noticed *sun damage*--ack!!!--on my forehead/temples, which is actually sort of terrifying to me). 

I also have chronically dehydrated, acne-prone skin, and it's helped moisturize my skin without causing breakouts. *This. is. huge.* I've avoided daily sunscreen wear for years because I've been scared that any and all sunscreens would break me out. When I started using this, I got a few tiny pimples on my forehead at first (a place I *never* normally get pimples, evereverever), but I can't be sure it was from this product since I had just tried a few days earlier a different sunscreen that I didn't like. Now, I'm not breaking out, my skin actually looks pretty great (haven't had a single breakout since that first forehead one). 

It smells nice, too. I sorta love the smell of physical sunscreens anyway because it reminds me of being on Lake Huron, but this one also has a really slight citrus smell to it. Any scent, citrus or sunscreen or otherwise, goes away within an hour, though.

It doesn't leave any creepy, ghosty white veil or residue, and absorbs relatively quickly. 

**Cons**: This is a heavy sunscreen. It probably won't be for you if you have oily skin. I'm hoping that once it goes from ""hey! Springtime! My and your and everyone we know's favorite season!"" to ""infernal NYC summer, why does anyone live in this horrible hell?"", it won't be so heavy that I have to find something else. My skin is generally dehydrated on my cheeks, but balanced on my T-zone, so sometimes it can feel a liiiiiittle greasy on my forehead, but it's not awful for me. 

It's also more expensive than something you'd just grab at the drugstore. I picked mine up at Whole Foods, and paid around $30 for it (the bottle is 2 oz.). I've seen it online for cheaper, but not much cheaper. 

**Ingredients**: 

Ran the product through [Skin Deep](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/435263/John_Masters_Organics_Natural_Mineral_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_30/) and [CosDNA](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c41c97475.html), and it looks pretty ok. None of my big red flag ingredients (phenoxyethanol, sneaky parabens, etc.)

*Active ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 7.5%, Zinc Oxide 5.0%*

*Inactive Ingredients: Aqua (water), aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, capric caprylic triglycerides, ethyl hexyl palmitate, glyceryl stearate, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, jojoba oil, shea butter, panthenol, tocopherol acetate, allantoin, sodium pca, green tea extract, magnesium aluminum silicate, hyaluronic acid, calendula extract, ethyl hexyl glycerin, benzyl alcohol*


**Edit**: so it's been two months since I posted, and now it's Infernal Summer in New York. It's still not too heavy for me even though it's REALLY HOT outside (guys, I feel like I'm dying). I'm still using the same bottle (which means I've gotten three months' worth out of it so far--ten bucks a month for sun coverage is pretty OK to me!), and there's still a bit left before I need to get a new bottle.

But that made me wonder if anyone here knew of a natural mixture that could be applied to your hair to help make it more straight and smooth without using heat.

I already use deep conditioners, which help relax my hair. But I still have a bit of wavy frizz. I usually don't mind but on days when I want super straight and smooth hair it's harder to say 'no!' to the flat iron hidden away in my closet.

I have a question about DIY conditioner and I was wondering if anyone on here could give me any advice??

I made my own conditioner using some different recipes I found online. I want a conditioner that is homemade, all natural and great for my hair BUT that I could use just like my normal store-bought conditioner (i.e. -- I can use it AFTER shampooing and then just rinse out.) I've tried doing the conditioner-then-shampoo method but I feel like it leaves my hair dry and frizzy. I've also tried vinegar rinses after using my conditioner and I've started only shampooing thoroughly every other day. But my hair is still oily and greasy after using my homemade conditioner.

The recipe I used contains:
2 parts coconut oil
1 part vegetable glycerin
1 part olive oil
Some essential oils
2 parts rosemary infusion
*(My measurements weren’t exact  - sorry!)

Is it because of the olive oil?? Or is there something I can add to my recipe to make the excess oils rinse out more smoothly??

For reference: I have rather long hair and I rarely have issues with it being naturally oily or naturally dry. So my natural oils shouldn't be having too much of an impact.

Sorry for the long question. Any advice would be welcome!
Thank you in advance!!

I have acne-prone skin, and it definitely is helping more than any chemical product I ever used. I'm currently using a mix of caster, jojoba, and sweet almond.

However, I have no idea how frequently I should do this? A few times a week seems to be what other people are saying. I like to do this at night when I'm taking off makeup, but some days I don't wear makeup at all, and if I take a shower I usually use a face wash or mild exfoliator, which takes off most of the oils. Putting them on as a moisturizer afterwards isn't giving me great results.

I'm also intrigued by toners. I've been using witch hazel, which I like, but of course it would take off any oils and then I need to moisturize. It seems like Apple Cider Vinegar is what people like, at a mix of 25% ACV to 75% water. I'm going to invest in a water filter I think..

Also, face masks sound great. Honey and ground oats with water is what I want to try. Should I use toner afterwards, or before, or not at all in this case?

I've heard about flax seed oil and tamanu oil, but don't know how to use them.

And finally, this moisturizer thing keeps popping up as a problem for me. I'm addicted to lotion, and super sick of using ones full of chemicals, but I absolutely can't stand the feeling of dry skin! Horrible. What do I do??

I've only recently gotten into the habit of taking care of my skin, particularly on my face, and lately it seems like no matter what I try it always stays dry with a rough texture. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the winter weather right now, but like I said, I only started paying attention to my skin recently so i couldn't make an accurate comparison to how it is during warmer seasons.

I keep a humidifier running in my house, and I've been drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated. I've tried several different homemade masks including honey, banana, and oatmeal with milk. For a regular moisturizer, normally I apply either coconut oil or a mixture I put together of aloe gel, vegetable glycerin and several different oils including jojoba and avocado, but it seems like no matter how often I apply them to my face my skin still feels dry and rough almost immediately after as if the oils won't soak in or something.

Does anyone have any idea why my face has been so stubborn against all my attempts at smoothing it out and moisturizing it? Is there anything else I can try? Something I've also noticed is that my face will become VERY smooth and soft after I've rested it against a pillow for even a few minutes. Of course, it only lasts temporarily and doesn't make a lot of sense to do as part of a skin care regime, haha. Just wondering if anyone knows why this happens.

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you so much for all your suggestions, everyone! I decided to give the shea butter another try and applied some with coconut oil on to my face before bed. Woke up and my face felt softer than ever, whoahoahaoaoiwowow!!

Some of you already know this, but it's a common misconception I think is important to clear up.

That's just how soap is made. Companies might try to hide it by listing ingredients as ""saponified oils of..."" or similar, but there is always lye in soap, or else it wouldn't be soap! The shampoo and cleansing bars marketed as lye-free, etc. often contain SLSs instead of lye. You can make shampoo bars with lye that are beneficial for hair too, as long as you know what you're doing. I have curly hair for example, which is notoriously hard to wash with bar (lye-based) shampoo, and my hair has never looked or behaved better now that I've figured out a recipe. I barely need styling products anymore. My hair always looks like the beautiful ""day 2"" hair I used to try to reproduce, and I don't use conditionner, which for someone with curly, dry hair who has always used conditioner, sounded crazy even a few months ago.

So yes, castile, artisan, hand made, gentle, milled, triple-milled, cold process, hot process, it all contains lye.

I was inspired to write this up after a comment I saw today. I think it's important information to know that as long as soap is made properly, it is more than safe, it can be beneficial! I will pick soap over SLSs bars any day.

*Edit: By lye, I mean both Potassium and Sodium Hydroxide. Potassium soaps are usually liquid, whereas Sodium usually means bar soap.

*Type of ingredient*: Humectant; synthetically derived, though naturally occurring in human skin.

*Comedogenic rating* (scale of 0-5, 5 being most pore-clogging): 0

*Safety rating* (scale of 0-10, 10 being most unsafe): 1

It is generally considered to be safe, and is non-comedogenic and non-irritating ([via](http://ijt.sagepub.com/content/18/2_suppl/25.abstract)). It is also considered to be better at hydrating and holding water than are other humectants like glycerin. It has not been shown to be an environmental toxin, making it a good ""green"" chemical.

For many years I have had 1 and then 2 unwanted facial hairs that were isolated to those two hair follicles. When they started to come in they would become ingrown (they would sort of stay stuck under the skin and fester essentially), cause a huge pimple, be very painful and unsightly. They are both next to my mouth on the upper lip, so in worst case scenario they appeared to look like a bad cold sore. 

In the last month or two I now seem to be forming several on my chin on both sides. I'm at a loss. I'm sure hormones are to blame, but what could I do to lesson, or help keep them from becoming problematic, while I wait to see the naturapath. I'm in my early thirties and have two kids, in the process of slowly weaning the youngest if that helps.

Thanks for any tips and or advice.

unfortunately spring hasn't properly arrived where I live, so I haven't been using any sunblock since last summer (it's reported that we've had the darkest winter in 47 years here in Germany. I can't even remember how the sun looks like). But it will be summer eventually and I'm starting to get concerned as how to take care of my skin properly when the sun does decide to show up one day.

I went all natural a year ago and last year I used physical sunblock in the summer. But it is so white! It looks ridiculous on my tan skin. I tried mixing it with carrot oil but that made the sunblock quite oily and didn't wholly cover up the white/lavender hue. So I started adding my liquid concealer but that didn't quite do the trick either. I was also worried that by adding pigments to the physical sunblock it wouldn't work properly anymore. Because neither the carrot oil nor the concealer got rid of the white I had to put on quite a lot of makeup to get back to my normal skin tone, but I don't want to wear makeup everyday, especially not when it's hot.

So is there anything I can mix into physical sunblock to make it darker and warmer toned? My skin is very warm toned, especially when I get darker in the summer and the lavender hue of physical sunblock makes me look ridiculous. Or are there any other natural sunblocks I can use that aren't as white? I heard that some oils have SPF but IIRC they aren't too reliable as proper sunblocks. I'm not concerned about sun burns at all, I never had one. But I don't want my skin to get sun damage or develop cancerous cells. 

Thanks for the help!

Tried many products as well as RetinA but decided that it was time to go back to the basics!

I have normal skin but am acne prone, mostly on my left cheek.  It's always been this way as far as I can remember :( I tried manuka honey and witchhazel for a few weeks but it wasn't giving me results like some others I've seen here. I also used Aztec Clay mask once a week for the few weeks I've tried the honey. This week I decided to switch to OCM instead. I use a mix of EVOO and Jojoba. I sort of just eyeball it every time but it's about a teaspoon of EVOO and like 5-8 drops of Jojoba. I've been doing this every night and using a few drops of jojoba to moisturize after. In the morning I use water, witchhazel and shea butter.

- Should I add castor oil? I've read the debate on this, but decided to skip out since I read it's rather drying.

- Parts of my face gets a little red (mostly the problem areas) after OCM? It goes away very shortly but is this normal? This is the same when using shea butter (at least the problem spots). Is this irritation or just from general application of products? Am I applying too much pressure? @_@

- The shea butter doesn't seem to absorb into my skin and instead it kinda just sits on my face like shiny layer :( Should I switch to jojoba instead like I do after OCM? I wanted the SPF benefit from the shea. I've always read that everyone should moisturize, moisturize... 

- Can I or should I still use the aztec clay mask? I'm scared that it will clash with OCM unlike honey which just feels calming but not like purging.

Around 7-8 years old. My natural hair color is dark copper and of course, I hated it because my mother was naturally black and olive skinned. My two older brothers inherited her genetics but as for me, I mostly obtained everything from my ginger father. I dyed it dirty blonde in secondary school then went black for years but I also dyed every one or two years since I was 14, I would go something really spontaneous and dye pink, blue, purple and etc. My final spontaneous act with my hair color was my ten-year class reunion. [I had highlighted yellow hair](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/223577_10150167535905172_2070017_n.jpg). After that I haven't dyed my hair for almost 3 years. You could say that I've gotten tired of that. [Here's my current natural hair](http://i.imgur.com/D5fMHf6.png).

I snapped some pictures of my hair today after using DIY shampoo and I noticed a sharp white hair on the picture. I asked my SO to check it out and.... well, that didn't go well. He discovered more than ten white hair strands. I am feeling distraught about that. Deal with it or cover it for the rest of my life.

He kept telling me, that is normal and how some women are super hot with white hair in comic books such as [Rogue](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/4400000/Rogue-x-men-4409766-1024-768.jpg) and [Storm](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/31600000/Storm-Ororo-Munroe-wallpapers-x-men-31690269-1024-768.jpg).

I think my issue is that my mother didn't turn gray until she was in her late 40s. My father was already turned white in his early 30s. I am not quite sure if I am ready for that. I'm currently 30. Right now, I don't really want to dye my hair but I am not ready for grey hair.

So I wanted to know what you gals think of this issue.

I'm thinking that the irritation has nothing to do with the washing method itself, but rather the drying out process. Anyone out there have tips or a similar experience they have successfully figured out?

I can't really sing the high praises a lot of folk sing since switching over from commercial products. 

A history of my skin's past:

I have used commercial products with great success, I never really had acne except for a zit or 2 (I consider my skin type as oily). However my frequent use of benzoyl peroxide made my skin look dull and tired so I decided to switch to natural products with very little to no success. I have tried raw honey, jojoba oil, olive oil, tea tree oil, and grape seed oil (not all at once, I used each in a 2-3 month range; I got crazy cystic acne, clogged pores, pustules). I am either detoxing all the crap bp suppressed through out the years or my hormones are out of control and I'm just another adult acne sufferer (I don't know if I can blame it on genes because my brother has perfect skin and eats like crap and my parents have good skin and said they never broke out when they were younger). 

I've switched back to commercial cleansers and bp recently but it just isn't the same now. It just makes my skin red and scaly, and since dealing with what I consider moderately severe acne (I now have dark hyperpigmentation all over my face and getting those shallow red marks/ scars), I'm just over it, I'd rather have healthy looking skin with acne than exacerbated skin with acne. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so do you have any suggestions? I know natural products are trial and error, I just want my skin to be healthier than how it looks/ feels. Has anyone tried shea butter or vegetable glycerin as a moisturizer? Anything that isn't too heavy for my oily skin? 

Thanks for hearing me out.

The product, the solid fat (stearin) and the liquid (olien) is ideal for many uses among others the healing properties. Shea butter is high in non saponifiable fats, making it great for healing many skin conditions. Stigmasterol in shea butter helps relieve muscle tension/aches, arthritis &amp; rheumatism.

*Aroma:* Mild nutty aroma sometimes almost unrecognizable

*Moisturizing Properties:* Extreme moisturizer. Leaves the skin silky, velvety soft.

*Healing Properties:* Recommended for extremely dry skin, sensitive skin, baby skin, eczema, burns, wounds, psoriasis, inflamed skin, cankers, sores, cracked skin.

___

1370237400.0,8,self.NaturalBeauty,1fkcll,Deodorant Roundup - LaVanilla Deodorant - Ooh La La!,10,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1fkcll/deodorant_roundup_lavanilla_deodorant_ooh_la_la/,"I'm sorry for yet another deodorant post, but I thought others could benefit from this. Also, I'm sorry for the terrible title, I could not resist. 

So, I've tried all the natural deodorants that I could find, not a comprehensive list by any means, but here's a short list with my thoughts. I will comment on smell, texture, application, and sweat-proofing.

Crystal - Works okay for sweat, does nothing for smell, kind of a pain in the butt since it kept falling out of its container when I was using it. As we know it's basically just aluminum and that kind of defeats the whole purpose of switching to a natural deodorant. The only good thing is that you don't have to use your fingers to apply it and it didn't cause pit rash. 

Soapwalla - $14/2 oz. Smells fantastic, not boy or girl. Minty with a rosemary kick. Goes on smooth, but becomes mushy in the container if your house is warm (maybe put it in the fridge). Requires your fingers for application, which I don't love since I have to wash my hands afterwards or risk breaking out if I touch my face. Contains Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), which causes my pits to break out into a rash - although less of one than any other baking soda containing natural deodorant I've tried. It worked okay for smell, but only lasted half the day. I woke up smelling poorly and I don't even want to talk about how bad I smelled after my 5 mile daily runs (vomitus maximus). Not to mention that most of it ended up in the pits of my shirts, thankfully it seems to wash right out when I do a load of laundry, but it will make you look like you've been sweating if you wear lighter shirts. This is my Second Favorite deodorant (my first favorite until I discovered LaVanilla). People LOVE this stuff, so if you don't have a baking soda irritation then go for it, if you're prone to baking soda rash then you may want to skip it. 

[Crunchy Chicken's recipe](http://angrychicken.typepad.com/angry_chicken/2008/07/homemade-deodor.html) - This was actually the first one that I ever tried, which I liked for the first couple of days, and then I broke out into a miserable pit rash from the Baking Soda and had to go back to the drawing boards. I poured it into a deodorant container, otherwise it requires fingers to apply. I like that you can make it smell however you want, but it doesn't work for very long. It doesn't work when I'm working out, it makes little deodorant balls in my pits, and I started to smell again just a few hours into my day. I would stink in the morning, and if I didn't take some with me to work then I'd have to scramble to find something to cover up the smell. 

[Probiotic Deodorant Recipe](http://frugallysustainable.com/2011/11/homemade-probiotic-deodorant-that/) - This is where I went after Crunchy Chicken, but before Soapwalla. I got was able to cut back on the Baking Soda because of the Probiotics, but it still didn't stop the pit rash, or the smell. I love that I could DIY and make it smell awesome, and I used this one for the longest overall because I couldn't find a solid replacement. Unfortunately the beeswax made this more difficult to wash out of clothing than the others I tried, but I stuck with it since the pit rash wasn't terrible. It stood up to just over half of my 12-hour work shifts, but I still stunk after work, in the morning, and it still didn't stand up to my runs. The beeswax allowed me to put this into a deodorant tube, so this is a finger-application free product (if you have the tubes) otherwise you're back to finger applications. 

Just Coconut Oil: Some people are lucky enough to be able to just throw some coconut oil on under their armpits and use it for deodorant. If I were one of those people I'm sure that I would be singing the praises, unfortunately coconut oil causes my skin to break out with acne (not pit rash, regular acne). This did nothing for smell, and other than making my skin a little softer I ended up with painful bumps, so I can't recommend it but others have had better luck.  


Which brings me to... 

LaVanilla (Blackberry Vanilla): $14 for 2oz, which is the same price point as the Soapwalla. This is my current, and by far my favorite of all the natural deodorants I've tried. It smells fantastic, but if you smell it in the tube you'll be a little misled because it smells better on than it does in the tube (I'm guessing because the heat brings out the scent). Reviews indicate that there may be a problem with the plain Vanilla scent becoming sour after a while, which has not been the case with the Blackberry for me. It's nicely solid, which means you wont accidentally overuse it as can be the case with creamy finger-application deodorants. My favorite things about this deodorant is IT DOESN'T GIVE ME A RASH!! Yes, that deserved all caps. It's due to the lack of Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate), and some people don't have a sensitivity to it in the first place. Some reviews also reported that some people broke out in a red rash under their arms that was not painful, itchy, or bumpy. This has so far not been the case with me, but of course YMMV. Also, this deodorant stands up to my 5 mile runs and keeps on kicking, through my 12 hour shifts, and through the night into the morning (not all of those things in a row, obviously I shower between running and working).

Edit: Per No More Dirty Looks there is some question to whether LaVanilla contains a petro chemically derived ingredient, despite the label stating that it is a corn made ingredient. If this is a concern you may want to research or read their review/info post about the deodorant.

Is there anything out there I can use to help minimize the appearance of my pores? I know that pore size can't exactly be changed, but I feel like the older I get the larger my pores get. I could be overreacting. 

Currently I use only witch hazel on my face for a toner, as my skin is slightly oily and it doesn't seem to dry it out or cause tightness. 

Also, I've heard that the key to healthy skin is all about moisturizing. I can't use coconut oil on my face and have yet to find something that isn't super heavy and/or causes me to break out. 

I'm fair skinned as well, so I worry about broken capillaries from harsh products.

*Other names*: Pantothenic acid, Vitamin B5, Provitamin B5, D-Panthenol, Butanamide, Dexpanthenol

*Type of ingredient*: Humectant; hair and skin conditioner

*Comedogenic rating* (scale of 0-5, 5 being most pore-clogging): 0

*Safety rating* (scale of 0-10, 10 being most unsafe): 1

*What it's used for*: Panthenol is a form of vitamin B5, used as a moisturizer and lubricating compound. 

Once a product containing panthenol has been applied to the skin, the skin will absorb this additive thoroughly. As soon as the skin has completely absorbed this derivative, it is then turned into Vitamin B5. ([via](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-panthenol.htm)) Vitamin B5 is crucial to skin health, and is present in all living cells. When used on the skin, it can help prevent transepidermal water loss, and can improve chronically dry skin.

Remember Pantene Pro-V? ""Pantene"" like Panthenol, ""pro-v"" like Provitamin B! Panthenol is a strong humectant and as such can moisturize and give ""body"" to hair. It also tends to coat hair in a mostly uniform layer, so it can help add consistent shine to hair. Panthenol is capable of penetrating the cuticle and entering the hair shaft as well, where it aids in moisture retention and provides volume ([via](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/science-behind-using-panthenol-in-hair.html)).

Panthenol is soluble in multiple substances, including water, meaning it should rinse cleanly without harsh cleansing/foaming agents. 

May be of synthetic, animal, or plant origin. It is naturally occurring in the body. Panthenol is not considered to be ecotoxic/damaging to the environment or ecosystems. It is not bioaccumulative in the body (doesn't ""build up"" in the body with multiple, repeated exposures).

Thank you guys for the ongoing suggestions!

Azelaic acid has made a HUGE difference so far. I have basically had no spots for a week, and only just one cystic one appeared after I picked at my face (I actually have a problem with picking at my skin, which I'm fighting an ongoing battle). Apart from that, the comedones that I usually have under my skin seem to have reduced in number. Basically, I could go every day and find some little nugget of sebum to squeeze out of my skin, but recently I haven't found so many. This might mean that the keratolytic element of the AA is doing its job, so sebum is no longer trapped into my skin. I don't expect all comedones to dissapear in one month, this process can take several months to a year, and I'm applying the AA at a low dosage, but so far very promising. 

 The important test is what happens in the next 2 weeks, when I usually have the hormonal flare. Honestly, if it ends up with 1-2 spots only every week or two I would be perfectly happy. I will take a picture in a week and compare it with day 1 and 30 and see if there is any improvement visibly. But fingers crossed.


**UPDATE Day 35**


Upon suggestions I gave up on Aleppo soap (sad, it had some nice reviews online). I did some more research into the basic causes of acne, and I think I'm on to something. Basically, with the very mild calming ingredients I use (aloe, clay, jojoba, several essential oils) I see an improvement because one type of acne is inflammatory. And yet it's not enough. Another big type of acne is comedogenic (which I have) which is caused by either overproduction of sebum (not in my case, my skin is relatively dry), or faulty skin structure which traps sebum and creates comedones, often by too much keratin in the skin. Common causes are excess of androgen hormones (ex: that's why a man's hands are so rough, because their skin is basking in testosterone) or increased sensitivity to the hormones. As it is, I actually tested my hormone levels in the past, and tested myself for PCOS,and I don't have anything wrong there. Another big cause of hormonal fuck up is stress and well, crap, I am under tremendous pressure at this moment in life, and I routinely work long hours. 

So assuming the remaining cause of my skin problems in caused by excess keratin, I'm going to go ahead and incorporate a keratinolytic. Most of them are rather harsh (retinoids, benzoyl peroxide) and even toxic/ teratogenic (WTF isotretinoin and BP) and cannot be used for long periods of time. I refuse to put anything on my skin which hurts it in one way to fix another problem. So the only remaining stuff is aspirin, glycolic acid and azelaic acid. 

I opted for **azelaic acid** because: it's a natural plant extract (you probably eat it every day without realising :D ), it has reported the least side effects and no toxicity, it also has anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial effect and most of all, it anti-hyperpigmentation and pro-healing.

I decided to use it sparingly (once every 2 days). I used it twice now, with absolutely no side effects (no itching/burning, no sensitivity) and my skin has had no new spots at all. I'm not ringing any bells yet, because I'm in my calm period of the month, but when I touch my skin I don't feel so many comedones as before. I have pictures taken on day 30, so I'll update in another 30 days after comparing the hard evidence only.

New regime:
* Aloe+TTO as toner
* Jojoba oil based cream as moisturiser (contains lots of nice antibacterial essential oils)
* Mineral make-up
Evening:

* Wash - honey+clay
* Aloe + TTO
* Same moisturiser
* Topical: zinc oxide TTO salve
* Once every 2 days: azelaic acid on affected areas


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



**Day 29**
I will be updating this as it happens. Feel free to critique, make suggestions, etc.

Acne and skin type: Mild to moderate. Inflammatory+comedonal acne, plus hormonal element. Location on skin changes every 4-5 months. Last autumn it was predominantly on one cheek and chin with a few under my jaw. Then it stopped there, and my cheeks are pretty clear, and now, for the first time in my life, I am getting it on my forehead, which I've always had it completely clear. I dunno WTF. FYI I do not have bangs, or any hair change.

Regime: 
Morning:

* Aloe+TTO as toner
* Jojoba oil based cream as moisturiser (contains lots of nice antibacterial essential oils)
* Mineral make-up
Evening:

* Wash - Aleppo soap (traditional soap used for acne)
* Aloe + TTO
* Same moisturiser
* Topical: zinc oxide TTO salve

* Occasional - Rhassoul clay masks, caolin mask, honey masks

Results: 

* (+) inflammation is waaay down with aloe. Aloe is the SHIT. A big problem for my skin was any sort of scratch/itch would generate a spot on the...spot. With aloe, it's like I can feel my skin calm down.
* (+) zinc oxide + TTO is awesome at healing down, or at least surfacing little asshole cystic spots. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.
* (-) my skin is still full of clogged pores. While the aloe helps with the pores not getting so inflammed, they do eventually get inflammed.
* (-) I don't have so many active spots, but it's enough having 3-4 a week and they post inflammatory hyperpigmentation lingers for EVER. My skin looks a lot worse than it is actually.
* (-) I still had my usual hormonal flare up. Not surprising as external stuff won't affect the internal stuff.

I've lurked this subreddit for about 3 months now, and you all have really inspired me to change my lifestyle to more natural products. So far, I have ""given up"" toothpaste (sub for baking soda + coconut oil), shampoo (baking soda), conditioner (ACV &amp; Aloe Vera), face moisturiser (coconut oil), face exfoliant (baking soda), bronzer (cocoa and cornstarch) and I am really interested in going even more natural by making my own perfume, eyeliner, eye shadow, etc.

My question to you is this: when you made the switch, what did you do with all your unnatural products? I know this sounds like a dumb question, and if it is, feel free to remove this post. I have LOTS of product left. Lotions galore, toothpaste bottles, shampoos, conditioners, makeup...Stuff that really now, I see almost no use for.

If I just throw it all out, it feels like a waste that I spent so much money on all of these products that now I just want to get rid of, even though they are perfectly fine. Sure, I will have lots of empty (pretty) bottles that I could reuse. Have you guys ever re-purposed the bottles?

I could also give them away, but I don't know of anyone who would actually put them to good use. My local homeless shelters do not accept open product.

Another option would be to just keep it unused. Although I wouldn't mind keeping small quantities when others come over, I don't need the quantities that I have currently.

Lastly, I could just use them up very slowly. Things like lotions, however, could take years to finish, meaning it would take years until I benefit from going natural.

How did you all do it? Something just seems morally wrong with all of these options.

So, after something i read in one of the discussions here i started using baking soda also as face soap - it took some time to figure out how to make it work for me, but i did so i feel so happy to be able to say goodbye to my pharmacy-bought face soap! Now the next product i'm ready to kick off my pharmacy list is face cream moisturizer.  
So the question is - what would be the best solution for a 1 or 2 ingredient moisturizer? I apply only after showers, which usually happen before i go to sleep at night.

* Daily: Dr Bronner's Almond Organic Liquid Soap, witchhazel again, and for a moisturiser I'm tossing up between almond oil, apricot kernel oil, or shea butter (all unrefined).

They all have low comedogenic ratings so theoretically they should be fine, but does anyone have a preference out of the three? Or maybe something better?

I have a couple questions though, and r/frugal suggested I try asking here instead

1) I've always read to use castile soap. From what I understand, castille is pretty much just any natural soap without any added in artificial cleaners/detergents. I came across this[1] bar of soap for free (I got one free from the store, and really liked the smell of it), and was wondering if it would be fine. It doesn't say castile anywhere, but appears to be all-natural, and the ingredients list is pretty Coconut oil, Canola Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Olive Oil, Blue Corn, Kernel Meal, Cedarwood Oil, and Fir Leaf Oil.

2) I've read to grate it, then dissolve it into boiling water, and I've read to grate it, then leave it sit in room temperature water overnight to dissolve it. Does either way make a difference? And what is the optimal ratio of volume of water to weight (or volume) of soap to get a shampoo that isn't too runny to use

3) Lastly, it seems that essential oils are what is added to make it into a conditioning shampoo. Any suggestions on one that would either have a smell that goes well with Cedar, or no smell, or would I be better of just leaving the oil out, especially since it's my first time making it",,False,self,t5_2s4dv,False,,,True,t3_16rqzj,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/16rqzj/couple_questions_about_homemade_shampoo_xpost/,

So I was prescription creams for a while and my skin was better, but now that I am in college, I cant afford them anymore. Since stopping the creams, my skin is freaking out and i feel hopeless and ugly. 
I had switched to using natural oils on my hair and it made a huge difference. So i thought hey why not do a natural method with my skin? I did some research and i found that using manuka honey as a face wash, and doing jojaba oi rinse after is supposed to work pretty well. So here are my questions:
1) Does anyone have any experience with methods like this? Is it effective?

Illipe butter is renowned for its moisturizing properties and its ability to restore elasticity to the skin.  It has a mild characteristic odor (**anyone know what the odor is like??**). It lends rigidity to balms, stick formulations and soaps.

They are terribly uncomfortable. I've tried letting them be and it resulted in a huge pimple as tall as a centimeter. I finally gave up and broke it open to pull the hair and the hair itself was a half an inch. 

I hate that I'm doing this to myself. I'm concerned that I caused a small scar. I need a better strategy. They are so bothersome and look terrible. The two on my upper lip are close enough to the lipline that they look like massive cold sores when it happens. It seems to correlate with my cycle.

I plan on whipping it with rice bran oil and would like some essential oil recommendations to help tame the smell.

I am a lifelong nail biter that has recently worked toward kicking the habit. My nails are finally getting some length, thanks to a combination of really, really terrible tasting stuff and a hardening nail polish, but I have a couple issues.
- The under part of my nail (the front of the nail bed?) is pushed pretty far back because I've always bitten my nails so short, and I don't really know where it should extend to. In trying to keep myself from biting, I've probably cleaned under the nail excessively, which I'm sure is contributing to the nail bed problem. Where should the pink/flesh color end on the fiber, and the lunelle/white nail to begin?
- I have NO clue how to properly shape my nails. I feel like, as they are growing out, they are flattening and sort of spreading. (Not sure if that even makes sense.) How tapered should the nail be compared to the sides of the finger?
- My middle fingers naturally have a huge curve, and as a result, the nail tip doesn't parallel the rest of my nail tips. Should I treat that individually, or try to mirror the rest of my nails (which may result in that finger looking lopsided on its own)?

I saw about using henna as a hair dye on here (Thank you, /r/NaturalBeauty!). 

We got the Nupur Mehendi Henna with the 9 herb blend that will color the hair brown, which it specifically says brown on the package. We know the hibiscus powder or even hibiscus tea can add that red tint that she wants.

The questions for those of you who are familiar with the products and with process:

1. Since we are most likely getting the hibiscus tea, will it work to steep the tea, then mix the tea with henna, and let it set, even with the Brown coloring? Or what is the best way to add the leaves in taking the type of henna we have into consideration? 

2. Since she does have black hair with the salt and pepper grey, will the red come out if we do it this way? 

3. On the manufacturer's packaging it mentions that the henna should set for a minimum of 2-3. Is it okay, even with the hibiscus to follow those instructions or should we let it set longer? Such as overnight or even a day to a day and a half? If so, will hibiscus provide a stronger red color? The more red, the better. 


Because I'm new to this whole process and even my boyfriend's mom, any little bit of information helps. I've been doing a lot of research on it (its really hard to find information for Indian hair). So anything is appreciated!

So I just thought I'd put the name of this company out there because I have been lusting after one of them for ages, and finally found somewhere I could buy it a couple weeks ago.

Seriously, I am in love with the black cherry tinted lip balm. It has the same problem with other wind up balms where it stops winding after a while (boo!), and they are kind of pricey just for a balm (although I think it's probably worth paying a bit more for something that is of a good quality), but apart from that, my newest addiction.

It smells amazing and has a good consistency. I apply it regularly even when I don't need to haha.

They contain only premium organic, vegan, and raw ingredients, and there are a great range of different flavours.

- I shave daily; not against the grain, because I get terrible irritation from it, so it's not the absolute smoothest skin

- My facial hair is unusually coarse, so if there's a way to soften it up that would be great. I moisturize at least twice daily though, so I'm not sure what else would help

- She uses a hydrocortisone cream (0.05%) and that seems to somewhat help, but we really need something that will be 100% effective at this point. Her work involves the occasional photo shoot for events, and her bosses hate me (not really) for giving her beard burn on a daily basis

Anyways, I'm really hoping /r/naturalbeauty can be of some help! I've always felt like a bit of a jerk because I don't shave against the grain to prevent irritation, whereas if I did shave against the grain she wouldn't get irritation. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Someone mentioned growing my beard out in another thread I started (/r/skincareaddiction), but I because of my work I can't grow my facial hair out.

I used to use my clarisonic everyday, but since I started OCM, I don't use that anymore (just a washcloth).

Tried ACV rinsing. Did the mixture I found online (1 part ACV 3 parts water). No noticeable improvement. Maybe a teeny tiny bit more shine, but it was gone the next day.

I have no scale for fine measurements like that and I was hoping I could find a recipe that would tell me the cup measurements instead of the weight measurements.

I have olive oil and coconut oil to work with (plus the lye and water obviously) and I was hoping to just use those for a soap.

I found [this recipe](http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/responsible-living/stories/easy-homemade-soap) but it also calls for grapeseed oil, which is a little expensive for my first time.

Is there anyway I can substitute the grapeseed oil with olive oil? 

According to my calculations, 2.42 (rounding up to 2.5 to be safe) cups of olive oil would be about the same weight as 2 cups of grapeseed oil...

Would that work or am I not calculating this right?? :/ Can I do that and be safe??

Also... does the measurement for coconut oil refer to it in its hardened form? Or the liquid form?

Here's the major crunch of Tammy Fender's Quintessential serum for less.

I wasn't able to find any turnip mustard oil online but apparently it is a popular cooking oil in Indian cuisine and some E-articles said that it is actually canola oil. Maybe it is but maybe it is not. I didn't include here because the information on turnip mustard oil is very limited.

[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65 

[Sunflower Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778998.htm) - 1 oz / $4.10

[Avocado Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777612.htm) - 2 oz / $4.35

[Evening Primrose Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/7037279.htm) - 1 oz / $4.45

TOTAL: $76.55

With these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.

As for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html).

Also! I have very sensitive skin and need to use a moisturizer during the day to protect my skin from UV rays. Can I do this without using a harsh chemical-laden cleanser and toner first? Could I combine this with a coconut oil cleansing method?

And lastly (I have a lot of skin concerns today apparently) I tend to get a pinkish-brownish hue around my nose and it feels rather sensitive. It's been there for years and I'm not sure how to fade it back to my natural colour. Since I'm cutting back on the makeup I use (only mineral powder and blush on my skin now) it isn't covered up.

Plus it contains an ingredient that causes some people to break out, so that might have been my problem with it since my Acne never really cleared up using it.

 Having recently become ""crunchy"" and tossing all of my dirty products I decided to give mineral makeup another go and picked up some Larenim foundation from my local health foods store, and sort of hated it. My skin loved it enough that I decided to stick with mineral makeups in general, but the Larenim for some reason has pretty crummy adhesion and I had some real trouble getting it to stick to my nose and random other spots. I would have to load up on argan oil then quickly apply the makeup to get it to stick. Once I ran out, I decided to DIY and ordered a mineral foundation kit from Brambleberry. 

I know brambleberry is loved, but I hated it. The makeup came out all the wrong colors, even using their base formulas. In one case it came out purple. PURPLE. In all other instances it came out an unnatural shade of beige, which made me look like a zombie. The adhesion was Terrible, it found wrinkles I didn't even know existed, and overall never went on evenly. And the smell! Oh the awful smell!!

I moved onto Laura Mercier mineral makeup, which is from my understanding completely clean. I have a love hate relationship with this makeup. It's expensive, but a little goes a long way. It covers everything, but it also sinks into the lines around my eyes in an unflattering way. 

So, does anyone have any thoughts on mineral makeup? Something you love? Something you hate? Am I doing it wrong? Is it just me or are Kabuki brushes really crap?",,False,self,t5_2s4dv,False,,n8,True,t3_13p21v,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/13p21v/mineral_makeup_questions/,

My first review will be about coconut oil. [I bought this coconut oil in the Vitamin Shoppe](http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B003B3OOPA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344182271&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=coconut+oil) it's very good for lowering cholesterol levels, to substitute sugar and for cooking, but it's also excellent for hair and skin. I recommend everyone to give it a try, it leaves my hair shinning and VERY smooth and it gives my body moisture. Another oil which I highly recommend is Argan oil, [I bought this oil on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/ELMA-SANA-Pressed-Organic-Certified/dp/B00397XUIK/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344135043&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=argan+oil) this oil is much better for skin than coconut oil, but I only use it on my face because is much more expensive than coconut oil. My skin is very dry but ironically I also breakout a lot and badly, it's been two weeks and my skin looks flawless and beautiful. Also, it's a very good hand moisturizer. With one drop you have enough. I also use it to moisturize my elbows. As I said before it's quite pricy but a little goes a long way. 



So for my beauty routine I use argan oil for my face, elbows and hands (if it wasn't pricy I would use it for my whole body) and for my hair I use coconut oil, I also use it for the rest of my body since it's very good and much cheaper than argan oil, also sometimes I use olive oil for my hair but olive oil is best for salad and for eating it (don't fry with it because it has a low temperature tolerance). Omega 3 (also for health), and avocado oil for cooking as well, it's also good for the hair but what makes it stand out is its high tolerance to high temperatures which is good for frying, but please avoid frying food.



Top recommended

Coconut oil- best for consuming and hair, good for skin.

Argan oil- best for skin, good for hair. 

Olive oil- best for consuming, good for hair and skin.




Other Oils

Grapeseed oil- best for cooking.

Tea tree oil- best for skin.

Avocado oil- best for frying and cooking, good for hair.

Sesame oil- best for cooking, is very tasty.





VERY IMPORTANT: Tips for buying oils.
You got to be extra careful there are many fraudulent companies that claimed to have organic or extra virgin oils when they're not, it can look like a nice deal but you don't know what's in there and it can be fatal for your health. Always buy from well known companies even if it's more expensive and check for all the certifications. It always helps to go on amazon and check the reviews, buy oils with the highest stars AND with the most reviews.


You got to be EXTREMELY careful with omega 3 and olive oil, there are many fraudulent companies, for olive oil I recommend Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive cold pressed, for omega 3 I recommend Triple Strength Omega-3 Fish Oil 1360 mg of Vitamin World, and if you have money this omega-3 is better http://www.dr-ricoperez.com/servlet/the-296/EPA--dsh--Fish-Oil/Detail 


If you have any questions feel free to ask me, I'm not a professional, but both of my parents are doctors and they have many years consuming natural products.

So now that my acne is (almost) gone, I'm pretty happy. However, my chin is just freaking the f%#@ out right now and I feel like covering it lightly with mineral foundation. 

But my problem is - I don't want to use regular cleansers to remove my makeup because every time I do I now feel really... icky. I'd like to remove it naturally. I've checked out Crunchy Betty's post on her honey/baking soda wash which sounded great a while ago but now that I've been hearing conflicting opinions about whether or not baking soda is ok for your face, I'm starting to become anxious of trying that method out.

Is there ANY way to remove it naturally?

Thought skin was clear with natural regime, now having trouble again.",5,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1cpogb/help_thought_skin_was_clear_with_natural_regime/,"Hello everyone! I've lurked here for quite some time, and you all seem so friendly and knowledgeable about dabbling in natural products, so I'd like to ask for a bit of advice on skincare. 

I've been desperate for years to clear up my acne/acne scarring (I'll be turning 20 years old in just a couple of weeks, and I am growing more and more nervous that this is a problem that will plague me further into adulthood), and decided to try an all natural regime early last year. Lo and behold, it worked! By the fall, I would go months without a single blemish.

Early this year, though, I began to learn more about natural skincare, and as such began to incorporate more products into my routine. The long and short of it is, I began to break out again... not as badly as I had last year, but certainly more than just a few months ago, and I am growing discouraged. On top of that, my skin has grown much more rough/irritated than usual. I hadn't believed it to be the new products (I would always patch test, and nothing broke me out immediately), but I don't know what else could be wrong. There have been no significant alterations in my diet, lifestyle, stress levels, or water intake (which is high).

Here is my routine now (natural products all raw and organic). Products marked with a * have been added in the last five months, since I began having problems again:

Morning:
1. Wash with honey
2. 50/50 ACV and water as toner
3. Aloe vera as moisturizer
4. Argan oil *
5. Sunscreen (not natural) * (I've used sunscreen for years, but recently changed brands/SPF level)


Afternoon: 
1. Wash with honey * (to remove sunscreen/grime from being outside)
2. Tamanu oil *


Night:
1. OCM (1/3 olive oil, 2/3 castor oil)
2. Honey mask
3. Retin-A gel (not natural)
4. Tamanu oil * + olive oil


As needed:
1. Tea tree oil *
2. Greek yogurt/turmeric mask * 
3. Calcium Bentonite clay mask * 
4. Baking soda exfoliator (2x/week)


Medications:
1. Cyclafem 1/35 (birth control)
2. I also recently got off a dermatologist-prescribed antibiotic after being on it (and one in general) for years.


As you can see, plenty of new additions lately. What confuses me is that none of these new products irritated my skin when I initially incorporated them--in fact, each one individually seemed to do good rather than harm. Am I simply overloading my skin? Potential irritants that I am unaware of?

Sorry if that was a lot of information, but any help would be very much appreciated!

Lately, though, it's been unjustifiable to spend so much money at, say, Bath and Body Works on what really amounts to frivolous purchases.  So, I've started to experiment with different homemade, natural body scrubs and face masks and the like within the past week.  The first body scrub I attempted (a sugar+extra virgin olive oil+lemon concoction), someone in the comments on the blog post where I found the recipe said that if you didn't have olive oil, vegetable oil would work just fine.  This was an outright lie - my skin felt extremely greasy, even after I'd washed up with my regular (Avon) body wash twice after applying the scrub.  After wising up and buying some EVOO, I tried the same scrub again, but I halved the amount of oil.  I still felt greasy after washing with my body wash afterwards (only once this time, though).

Every scrub recipe I've seen calls for EVOO - even the face scrubs and masks.  The skin on my face can get oily and I have mild breakouts, so I want to avoid oil on my face.  The skin on my body, however, in the cold dry winter air, gets scaly patches on it that lotion helps the itching for a few hours, but the ""scales"" don't go away until the weather warms up.  I also recently (after browsing NaturalBeauty and seeing people extol its benefits) bought a bottle of tea tree oil (http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/hollywood-beauty-tea-tree-oil-skin-%26-scalp-treatment/ID=prod368209-product), and I really liked the way my scalp didn't itch much in the two days since I last washed my hair (my scalp tends to itch year-round and no amount of dandruff shampoo seems to help).

It seems to me like if you reduce the amount of EVOO in a scrub recipe, all you're doing is reducing the amount of scrub you make (or messing with the consistency too much).  Are there any scrub recipes that you guys like that use small amounts of oil?  Conversely, are there any oils that I can use that leave your skin feeling less...oily (and maybe that smell better - EVOO tends to overpower the other ingredients in the scrubs I've made)?

**TL;DR:** EVOO leaves my skin feeling way too greasy, would appreciate some less oily oils to use in body scrubs.",,False,self,t5_2s4dv,False,,,True,t3_18zk20,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/18zk20/experimenting_with_body_scrubs_vegetable_oil_and/,

I currently use [It's a 10 Miracle Leave in Product Lite](http://www.amazon.com/Its-10-Miracle-Leave-Ounce/dp/B007L5H7XK) on my hair. It really works well and doesn't cause me any problems, but I'm looking to replace my hygiene type stuff with all natural products. I use this product essentially as an adult detangler (and it works extremely well with only two or three sprays, I have very thick, fine, wavy/straight hair). To a lesser extent, it also helps me control frizz and add shine.

My hair frizzes after it dries, but then calms down the second day after I shower. To keep it from frizzing I spray [It's a 10 Finishing Spray](http://www.amazon.com/Its-10-Miracle-Finishing-Spray/dp/B004ZF04PW) on my hair. This is really mostly for frizz control, and I need a replacement for this as well. 

As far as the finishing spray goes, I've looked into styling waxes but I'm not entirely sure how well that will work with my hair? I've actually stopped using conditioner because it gets stuck in my hair, so I'm a little afraid of using a wax and how that would turn out. I guess I could just apply it while my hair is still damp, and then not apply it until after my next shower? I.e. don't use it every day (I only wash my hair every other day or every two days.. Sometimes longer, just when it starts looking crappy) and only use a little so it doesn't build up and get in the way?

Thanks!
