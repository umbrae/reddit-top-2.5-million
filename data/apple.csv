You ate Cheerios. You ran wide-eyed through the streets playing football. You watched Power Rangers. You were excited without limits to get the new Game Boy Color because, damnit, *this one is available in green*.

Now look at you. A brooding, balding, twenty/thirty something absolutely in *shambles* because the new iOS is a wee bit too fun for your tastes. It's a bit too colorful. Uh-oh! Someone might catch you having a passing moment of unadulterated glee, now. Damnit Apple. And... oh, *shit*, look at that! The Safari icon doesn't look *precisely* the way you would have designed it with your two semesters of design experience! Apple has really screwed the pooch this time, haven't they!

Really, you know how I know iOS 7 is a huge success? Because you're all complaining about the Safari icon - Right before offering up your own version that looks *precisely* the same. As cynical, unappreciative; and absolutely, intolerably insatiable you people typically are, it's truly a miracle that the most complained about issue I read about is that you don't like the Safari icon. Albeit with a tone of disappointment so thick with sincerity that it would normally imply that your father skipped another one of your little-league games, or something.

**A.S.S.:** ""We don't really do that here on the spot like that, that's an overnight thing.""

**Me:** ""Oh, I know, I don't need help, I can do it myself. I just don't have a Thunderbolt cable on me.

**A.S.S.:** ""Oh, sure, but, you shouldn't try to do that here, it will take WAY too long. Like, hours at least.""

**Me:** ""Okay, but, really, I promise, it'll take ten minutes.""

**A.S.S.** ""Not a chance.""

**Me:** ""Okay, no problem. Thanks for your help.""


**Me:** Buys a Thunderbolt cable.

**Me:** Goes to the food court, boots in target disk mode, transfers files. Eats a chicken burrito.


10 minutes and 37 seconds later:


**Me:** ""Hi, I'd like to return this Thunderbolt cable, please.""

EDITED: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for all the interesting perspectives. I had intended this post to be funny and come across as, 'Woah, Thunderbolt is so fast, is shocked even me and an AppleStore Specialist.' She was cool and nice to me and I hope I didn't come off as a dick to her either.

As a former Apple employee, i totally knew where her reluctance was coming from, but if it was against store policy, I'd have just said that and been done with it. if it WASN'T against store policy, I'd have been just as curious, and let the customer try, with the warning that if it was closing time, I'd pull the plug.

But once she started arguing with me and told me I was wrong, the gauntlet was thrown, and I had to find out. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.",,False,,t5_2qh1f,1373658928.0,,,True,t3_1i5jqp,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1i5jqp/thunderbolt_is_fast/,

We had a burglar break in through a window and grab my Macbook Pro. 

I had encrypted it with FileVault 2, and had the latest Lion updates. I also had connected it to icloud so I can find it with the Find My iPhone app. At login you have to give an admin password or log in as guest. 

Of course I checked day by day to see if my MBP would show up, but it didn't. I thought it was lost for good. 

Then today, it shows up. In the same city where I live. I have a pretty good pinpoint on the map, although it's a multi-story apartment building. 

Here's the good part. The guy has renamed my MBP from Raumschiff's Macbook Pro to [Firstname]'s Macbook Pro!

That narrows it down a whole lot. 

I look up all the names of the tenants in the building, and there's only one person registered with that first name.

Now, since the company I work for owns the MBP, I call my boss and give him all this info, and he gives it to the cops.

Updates will follow. OP will deliver. 

---

First things first. **FRONT PAGE WOOHOO**

Now down to business. The police are trying to get in touch with the guy as we speak. When I hear more, I'll update this post. Also there are apparently two more guy there living relatively close by with the same first name. I hope this doesn't mess things up.

UPDATE. The name of my computer changed to some other dude's name. It's not active now though, but icloud is going to notify me automatically via email as soon as it's up again.

Edit 01: These are all apps that maximise my personal work flow/improve my personal OS X experience, there are of course many alternatives, feel free to list them too.

Edit 02: Descriptions added.

Edit 03: Ok, so it seems like some people take this stuff super seriously so I have edited the format and also added a couple of things that have been mentioned by y'all. Some things aren't worth mentioning as I assume most people would already have them (ie. [VLC Media Player](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2Fvlc%2Findex.html&amp;ei=EQ2MUFKF-a0HycWAsAU&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBhuuzYHOSa3E8AKS6WdxI_OOjYQ&amp;sig2=qpH4RlgMxdH8NfgCXWjjyw), [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com), [uTorrent](http://utorrent.com/), [DropBox](http://dropbox.com/), etc.), and some things I have left out because they have very specialised uses that only certain people require (ie. [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/), [Transmit](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpanic.com%2Ftransmit%2F&amp;ei=2A6MUIyPLpGqrAelmYDACw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVE0Hy-HUbateLIVvcexT1PNaNdQ&amp;sig2=rm-K64AoIsQjH8sY-JEA7A), [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com), [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com), etc.).

Also, I find 'Utilities' to be things that mainly run in the background/from the Menu Bar and 'Apps' to be standalone programs - sorry if this isn't 100% accurate.

I will add more as I test them, thanks for all your input so far!

Edit 04: May I suggest a quick Command+F before suggesting anymore Apps/Utilities as we are now getting a lot of duplicates.

Also, many questions and alternatives have already been mentioned.",,False,,t5_2qh1f,1351395255.0,,,True,t3_125wwn,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/125wwn/apps_i_think_everyone_should_have_for_os_x_w_links/,

Im going to be 23 in 2 weeks, and Im about to graduate college in December. I still live with my parents, who are both in their late 50s. My mother has arthritis, and its becoming harder and harder for her to move around, see, and she's also deaf in one ear. My mom has been a stay at home mom since I was born (Im the middle child) and all she really does is crossword puzzles and brain teasers. We're the only family that lives here, the rest live two to three hours away and we rarely see them. So my parents really only have each other. No friends, just each other and us kids.

This past December, for Christmas, my father asked me what he should get my mom. I told him he should get her an iPad. The screen would be big enough for her to see, she could read her books and play her games, and finally be able to search the web. My dad bought her an HP laptop the Christmas before that...and she opened it twice. She doesnt even know how to turn it on. We've tried showing her, but it just seemed too daunting.

After about a week with her iPad, my mother is now reading the news every day, watching YouTube videos, sending emails, playing Angry Birds, finding old songs (even ""their"" song) and actually using technology for the first time in her life.

Two days ago, I told my mom to add Words with Friends. Then at school today, I get a popup notification saying that she would like to play a game. It made me happier than anything Ive felt in a while. That my mother, who was so scared of using a computer at one point, is now connected to me no matter where I go.

Thanks Apple. And thanks for reading Reddit.

**Edit:** I just wanted to thank everyone for the outpouring of positive feedback this got. I went and hugged her and whispered ""I love you"" (in her good ear) and she looked at me and smiled...and said ""I love you too...but I just spelt flowers and passed you up.""

I snapped [this](http://i.imgur.com/V9id8.jpg) while she wasn't looking. She's playing Bookworm while waiting for me to hop back on Words With Friends.

**Edit #2:** I just had a long discussion with her and told her how awesome the people of Reddit are and read some of your comments...so if you're up for a game, her Words with Friends User Name is **Charlene73152**! She wont respond to chats (trust me). So feel free to play her if you want, and she says hello!

**Edit #3:** You all just got this guy HUGE brownie points for my bday :) I want to thank **plutoprime** and **DotheDew** for gifting my mom two amazing apps, and now she has access to Reddit! I also want to thank all **40+** people who are currently playing her! I had to turn off her notifications because she was getting them so frequently! You've all brought a lot of joy to my family, so I hope to do the same for this community in the future.

My brother gives me the cash and asks me to go to our local apple store and get my nephew the new iPod touch. He also asks me to get everything set up, test it out, and make sure it's ready to go. My nephews birthday is so close to Christmas and the plan was to give the iPod to him so he could be using it during the holiday season to take pictures, record HD videos and what not. 

So I'm at the house, I've been trying it out for a few days. It's a great device. Since not many cases are available, I used a small ankle sock to keep it in. I decided to sync it one last time and then put it back in the package. This time I didn't leave the sock on... it fell off the desk and put a large dent/scratch on it. Needless to say I was shitting a brick. 

I called apple, they said they didn't know what to tell me because they couldn't see it over the phone of course and that I needed to set up a genius appointment. So I did and went in to see what could be done. I was scared to death that I was gonna have to put it on Craigslist at a reduced price and then pay the difference for a new one.

One of the employees greets me and I tell her the situation. I apologize because the problem sounds so petty. But I can't give a damaged gift to someone. She says she completely understands ""Let me go talk to my manager."". I'm sitting there expecting the worst when she returns and says ""We're going to replace it for you free of charge."". I was dumbfounded and extremely relieved at the same time. It was my screw up and they totally bailed me out.

People can complain about Apple all day long about the price of their products and that it's all fad but I say this. I don't know any other company with the kind of customer service they have and I truly appreciate the employees and what they do.


Edit: After reading some of the comments, let me clarify a few things. I only had the device for two days when it happened and only at my home. I didn't carry it around everywhere. I put it in a sock to keep it safe while out of the box. The reason I was asked to set it up is because my brother currently does't have a home PC or Internet connection. He won't until at least December. I'd hate for him to turn it on and only be able to sit and stare at the activation screen until he could get to a wifi connection.


Edit2: Some people have asked why I'm messing with a gift for someone else. Like I said above, no internet at his home, therefore no way to download apps. He's 10 years old and this is probably the most expensive gift he's ever gotten. I love my nephew and when he opens his present and see's the ipod I want him to be able to enjoy it. I've put a lot of my own apps on it like iMovie, Garage band, and many games. By doing this it gives him a chance to see what he likes. My brother will make a list and when they finally get their pc and internet going, I can help him set up an apple ID and he can download his own apps.",,False,,t5_2qh1f,1351553232.0,,,True,t3_1294xp,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1294xp/apple_just_earned_a_ton_of_my_respect/,

1333610292.0,861,self.apple,rubzn,How my Apple hate quite literally burned me,1327,466,452,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/rubzn/how_my_apple_hate_quite_literally_burned_me/,"Sooo... I’m  a fucking idiot. This is the medium length story as to why, and it’s a bit of an effort post, but I think it’s a cautionary tale as to why fanboyism is incredibly stupid and potentially physically harmful.

Maybe saying that I hate Apple is going a bit far, but post-iPhone they’ve annoyed me. I hate the commercials, I hate the culture of rumors and speculation, I hate the lining up for new devices and I really didn’t appreciate the canonisation of Steve Jobs.

OSX isn’t for me and iOS isn’t my favourite mobile OS, but one thing I’ve always been able to admit is that Apple is the best hardware manufacturer out there. Hands down, out of everything I’ve used, Apple products are seemingly the only ones to get all of the intangibles right. After hemming and hawing for months, in my search for a thin-and-light laptop I settled on a Macbook Air. It didn’t particularly feel great buying an Apple product, but it was the best machine out at the time for me. 

I ran Windows through boot camp as my primary OS and it ran incredibly well. 6 and a half hours battery life, full driver support, brilliant screen, and (my favourite part about the Macbook Air), it was dead silent. I *fucking hate* fan noise, and the Macbook Air kept the system cool with the faintest puff of air if I put my ear to the exhaust port. 

But still, it was an Apple computer, and despite the fact that it did everything I wanted it to do – HD movies, web browsing for hours, flawless document and image creation, movie editing, all of this without sounding like a jet taking off – I was still uncomfortable with the fact that I’d “bought in” and drank that particular Kool Aid. 

So, with the rise of “Ultrabooks”, I saw my way out. Again, let me emphasise, I am stupid. I thought I’d pick up a Macbook Air competitor for less money and stop feeling like a dick for having an Apple computer. This is the first key mistake.

The second mistake was the fact that you can’t actually buy a comparable setup to the Macbook Air without paying hundreds of dollars more. I bought the Samsung Series 9 900X3A-B06US, supposedly with a much faster processor (I had a 2010 MBA), supposedly with better battery life, supposedly a lot of things. I sold my Macbook Air, got the Series 9 and was happy with it for about ten minutes. Until the system heated up for the first time, the fan kicked in and I was treated to the sound of a thousand mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on methamphetimes. 

It just wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I work in a quiet office, I live in a quiet neighbourhood, it drove me mental. That wasn’t the only thing – despite it being more expensive, the battery life was 2 hours shorter (on a machine that natively runs Windows), the SSD had a quarter of the space taken up by a useless recovery partition that requires the installation of three programs and 5 hours to remove, the screen is muddy due to a lower resolution and a matte screen that lacks clarity, it picks up fingerprints like my brother picks up ladyboys in Thailand, and it sounds like thousands of mosquitos fucking each other after being up all night on cocaine (I changed it up to keep you interested). 

I called Samsung and asked if there was anything I could do about the aforementioned fan noise. They directed me to a system option named “Silent Mode”, which raises the fan temperature thresholds and downclocks the CPU to keep the laptop quiet. Cool. My savior. Despite the fact that it was now essentially a netbook with an 800MHZ processor, it was quiet. 

What they didn’t tell me was that part of the system’s cooling mechanism involves disappating heat through the bottom panel of the laptop, made of a flimsy sheet of powder coated aluminium. This, combined with sitting down to write a long report on my couch, meant pain. 

After a few hours of word processing in “Silent Mode”, I stood up for a stretch, and hoooly fuck did it hurt. The undertray of the Series 9 had scorched the tops of my knees through my jeans, and for the next few days it felt like bad sunburn. I’d checked the CPU temperature and it never got past 52C, but I started reading around – as one review put it, “""the underside sees temperatures that are best reserved for hot asphalt rather than a notebook. We can’t put this more delicately: when its processor is pushed, the Series 9 can become a dangerously hot nut roaster. "" 

I don’t know how hot it got , but it was hot enough to burn my fucking legs, all while I was word processing. 

So I called Samsung and said, hey guys, I tried out this “Silent Mode” thing, and it burned my fucking legs. “Ah,” they said. “There’s your problem. You’re not supposed to use your notebook on your legs.” I know that the manuals of all notebooks say that, but I’ve never encountered one hot enough to make that warning a threat. I used to perch my Macbook Air on top of me for up to eight hours on days off, watching HD video, and the only effect would be slight warmth from the heatsink in the top left. 

**The Lesson, Dear Reader:** Thanks for sticking with me through that. I guess what writing this is my analysis of how fucking retarded being beholden to a particular product truly is, especially when it comes down to something like advertising and marketing ethos. The Macbook Air is, quite seriously, the best computer I’ve ever used. Maybe it’ll be eclipsed, maybe we’ll end up in a post-PC world, but for now there’s nothing that does what it does as effortlessly and (quite literally) painlessly. 

Apple haven’t just crammed in hardware without giving a fuck, they’ve carefully considered the thermal dynamics and cooling solutions to such an extent that I actually began to take how cool and quiet it was for granted. You can buy similarly specced Windows notebooks for less, but I can now see why they cost less – they’re bigger, hotter, louder, but it’s more than that. It’s about the intangible things – Apple’s begun to make computers so good you needn’t worry about anything other than the task at hand. 

Maybe some of the millions of people who profess to love Apple products do so because they’re slavishly devoted to savvy marketing and a trendy brand image. Maybe the people commenting on Engadget about how shit everything else is actually exist. But I’ve learned through painful experience that the reason most people love Apple is because they make rock solid products that don’t burn your motherfucking legs.

Instead, since it was a fairly serious issue and the warranty expired only two months ago, they authorized the $800+ repair for free.

Fast forward two weeks. The repair is going horribly. They not only couldn't get the issue fixed, they actually broke a few other things in the process. God dammit, Apple.

Fast forward one more week, Apple calls us up and tells her she can come in and just exchange it. She says ok, and they do a data transfer. We go in the next day and they start ringing everything up. I noticed they matched the original price, not the original product.

My mom's 24"" iMac goes out 2 months after warranty and they give her a 27"" for free. The new machine is bigger in every respect: screen size, hard drive capacity, video card capacity, processor speed.

Original post ----

This sucks.

I'm two weeks into my first real career-type job. A Digital Media Specialist. I get to take photos and shoot video all day long. It's what I always wanted. After working in cubicles for 17 years...

The company bought me A/V equipment off a list I made myself. My dream gear. 

Included is a MacBook Pro w/ Retina, 16gb RAM, FCPx, the works. I shot all day today. 100 miles away from homebase in the country. It was a long day, far from home.

My last task was to take the company car home, stopping by the Apple store to drop off the MacBook for the weekend. It had a scratch on the screen that was going to be replaced As a one-time courtesy. 

I didn't like the idea of opening the trunk in the mall parking lot  (with my rig and all my equipment for all to see). So I took the laptop out of my rig backpack and set it on the front seat next to me - so when I got to the mall I could hop out, quickly run in and drop off the Mac and be on my way home.

It's a big weekend you see. I just moved from out-of-state to take this job and I move into my uptown apartment tomorrow!

Only I didn't put the laptop on the seat next to me; I set it on the roof of the car, closed the trunk, got in and drove away.  

Somewhere on that gravelly road / ditch next to the road my Mac flew off. It was in a case. Trela, Teva, Travart??? It's black and medium-duty. I couldn't have been going more than 20-30mph...

I realized my mistake 20 miles later and flew back to search, with the sun going down, my iPhone dead, and no clue how to get home (I'm in a new State remember?). Couldn't find anything. 

Headed back at sunrise. Boss comes in at 9:30am. I figure one of 3 things will happen. 

1. Ill find the laptop unharmed in a pile of cow dung = best case scenario
2. Someone has already found the laptop and will open it to see my frantic email, contact me / iCloud will notify me. Midwest-nice shall prevail and it will be promptly returned.
3. I or someone will find the laptop totally smashed and inoperable. 

I think I'm getting fired tomorrow unless maybe my boss will buy a new MacBook and take it, slowly, out of my paycheck... Or a rich uncle will suddenly sworp down and buy a new MacBook for me... Fuck. I'm getting fired in 12hrs....",,False,,t5_2qh1f,1375464023.0,,,True,t3_1jjm2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1jjm2d/left_a_3000_macbook_on_the_roof_of_a_car_on_a/,

Unfortunately, PC mentality was still well and truly in my head, and attempting to follow the iFixit documentation to try and install an SSD ended up in me left with a computer that merely made a funny smell when it was switched back on. Completely destroyed it. Was kinda pissed! Especially considering it was a month old...

So, after a couple futile attempts to put it back together again (in case it was a wrong wire or something), I just gave up, and the majority of the components now resided within the box. A mate egged me on, three months later, to take it to apple to see if they could do anything.

Thus, the walk of shame into Apple with most of an iMac in a box began.

Wasn't exactly holding out for much. Took it to them and didn't B.S. them - told them exactly what I did, and that I couldn't even find some of the components any more. I told them that I'd just buy the other components and pay for the damages, but they couldn't even do that, as I'd completely buggered up the machine, it wasn't even complete and they didn't keep the components in the shop to fix it with. Basically, I was completely out of luck.

The guy just couldn't believe that I had the thing a month. Trying his hardest to help, he suggested that I take it to an authorised Apple reseller, who would be able to help me out. 

I just basically gave up. Apathy was the adopted policy, especially considering the fact that I was a student and had spent a ridiculously large sum buying the thing already - just decided to cut my losses and asked the guy just to take what was left of it in for recycling. This shocked the guy a bit, I think he could really tell that I was pretty much done with, well Apple in general. He told me that he'd have to get the documentation to declare that I had given them the iMac.

10-15 minutes of waiting at the Genius Bar, and he came out with the manager, who repeated some of the statements of skepticism/disbelief of the other guy when I voiced my apathy. The manager said that he literally couldn't believe that I'd spent so much money on the machine just to miss out on ""the mac experience"" and told me that they were going to give me a brand new one.

Enough bricks to build twelve schools in Africa, let me tell you!

This completely unexpected act of generosity apparently had me looking like I was about to burst out in tears - I mean, it was my own stupid fault that I had broken the thing, so to replace a £1000 computer for me was very humbling to say the least. I know full well I'm going to wake up tomorrow in even more disbelief!

Anyway, I know Apple have been given a lot of flack recently, but I really couldn't let them do this for me without letting you guys know - it wouldn't sit well on my conscience if had just kept this to myself!",,False,,t5_2qh1f,False,,,True,t3_kkxvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/kkxvu/so_apple_went_completely_and_utterly_beyond_the/,

**Edit:** Instead of AppZapper, get AppCleaner; same thing for free. Thanks to everyone for notifying me on that.

**Edit2:** Turns out that one does not simply teach reddit new tricks. After reading the article, read below for contributed set of tricks I'm adding below.

Some of these will find its way into the article, but at that point it will no longer be on there so I'm posting a quick hashing of new knowledge I got from this thread.


**Totalfinder** - tabbed Finder.


**Unarchiver** - obvious for rar files, so used to it that I forgot to add it to the article.

**BetterTouchTool** - Saner touch controls for Lion (alternative: Jitouch, $7, better UI)

**MplayerX** - VLC alternative.

**Xslimmer** - Strips out unnecessary languages and binaries (powerpc binaries etc) from apps and OS. I would argue the need for this has receded, but nevertheless it's nice. Beware though, some apps don't take modification too kindly.

**Launchbar, Quicksilver** - Alfred alternatives. Alfred is simply my choice of the three, these are good.

**Moom, Cinch** - Alternatives to Divvy, somewhat less control, but everyone to their own.

**Trick:** If you want to have a modern filesystem without having to use NTFS trick, check out exFAT. ~~Available only on Lion+ though.~~ Also works on SL. Potential backwards compatibility issues with older OSes.

**Trick:** Dragging the small folder icon at the top of the Finder window while pressing Command + Option makes a shortcut of that folder in the location you drop the icon.

I've been receiving quite a few requests to develop a native Mac OS application for Reddit.  For those interested, I wanted to let you know that Alien Blue for the Mac is in development.

Although it is impossible to capture the charm of the website, Alien Blue for the Mac will give you a different way to experience Reddit.  It will be tightly integrated with your OS, and this allows me to deliver some really exciting features.

The application is a significant departure from the website, and is all about bringing convenience wrapped in a native Cocoa interface.  Design and universal accessibility will be a key focus.

The Mac client will be a complete rewrite and shares almost no common code with Alien Blue (iPhone) or Alien Blue HD, so this is taking a bit of time to put together.

The iOS clients are undergoing a UI revamp at the moment, and I'm very lucky to carry this experience over to the Mac version.  My goal will be to deliver an intuitive, responsive and attractive interface as early as possible.

In the past, I have said that the website can't be beat.  Although I stand by this statement, I am excited at the prospect of moving the redditing experience outside the browser sandbox and make it work natively with the rest of your Mac.

I will keep you posted with screenshots and videos along the way.

Thanks everyone for your support and ongoing encouragement. :)

It's my favorite company and I admire them in multiple ways. Their products are fantastic, their support is the best I've seen of any company, and the quality of everything they do surpasses that of the competition 99% of the time (in my opinion). But Apple has its faults, and one its big faults right now is its absolute rejection of competition.

You may have heard about [Apple's recent injunction on the Galaxy Nexus](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3126934/apple-samsung-judge-bans-galaxy-nexus). This is only the most recent legal crusade Apple has launched against Android. There have been countless other lawsuits by Apple of its competitors. You may have also heard Steve Jobs' comment on wanting to go ""thermonuclear"" on Android, calling it a ""stolen product"". Apple's behavior towards its competition is inexcusable, in my opinion.

Only a very ignorant person would deny that Apple and Google take features from each other. That's the majority of innovation right there: building upon your competitors. Apple takes features from Android just as Google takes features from iOS. It's how the industry works, but Apple seems to want things to only work one way, where it can take features and sue everyone else.

Apple for some reason has been very hostile to Google lately. Just watch the [WWDC 2012 keynote](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2012/). It's full of subtle jabs at Google. Now take a look at the [Google I/O keynote](http://youtu.be/VuC0i4xTyrI). Google, in spite of Apple's attitude, is continually supporting iOS and in some cases bringing products and features to iOS that Android doesn't even have. The position of both companies is vastly different.

**TL;DR: They make great products, but Apple seems to be needlessly hostile to its competitors, and is taking a worryingly anti-competitive stance.**",,False,,t5_2qh1f,False,,4,True,t3_vv6i5,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vv6i5/on_the_current_state_of_apple_vs_google/,

1344433871.0,653,self.apple,xvpl7,"Just how good is Apple's Customer Service?  Well, let me tell you...",893,240,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/xvpl7/just_how_good_is_apples_customer_service_well_let/,"I debated about posting here but I feel it something people need to hear, especially those who are on the fence about buying an Apple product for the first time.  

When Apple announced the release of the new Retina MacBook Pro, I was first in line to put in my custom order.  In fact I had been talking to my local apple store about such a purchase since before Apple announce the laptop.  So I put my order in and then I waited…and waited, 4 weeks it took.  Finally the day had arrived and my package was ""out for delivery"" OMG!  So FedEX showed up and left the computer at my front door since I had a signed waver for the package and incidentally I was unable to get to the door when they showed up (restroom).  

I open my front door to see that wonderful slim rectangular box leaned up against my door, excitement builds as I reach down to pick it up and inspect this most handsome geometrical shape.  Thats when I noticed it, a fist sized hole punished into the side of my box which I could peak in and see the white Apple packaging inside.  Upon further teardown I find that whatever punctured the outer shipment box had gone so far to also put a sizable dent in the Apple packaging.  

Now if you have ever opened an Apple product, you would notice, they are not liberal on space.  So I whip out my phone and start documenting the damage.  I then unwrap the apple package and inspect the laptop itself and just as I suspected, there was a pinky sized dent in the aluminum case.  

Now let me back up here, I've owned both Macs and PC's my whole life as I do a lot of software development for both platforms.  I prefer the Apple hardware/software as I am inherently a designer and they appeal to me more, but a fan boy, eeeehhh I doubt I qualify.  I have seen some pretty crazy PC case damage that when I contacted the manufacturer they would make me jump leaps and bounds to get it fixed/replaced and for the most part they would leave me without a new computer for the weeks/months it would take for them to write a wrong.  

So here I was, brand new mac, excitement has been squashed as I am now looking for signs of abuse since this computer had an obvious rough trip from Shanghai to my front door.  I call Applecare and explain my problem and what I received.  I told the guy on the phone I had documented the damage via my phone and could send pics which he asked me to do and I did.  He gave me several options on how to deal with this but the option I chose (since the macbook did in fact work seemingly fine) was for Apple to send me a new macbook and when I received that one I could use the packaging to send back the damaged one, awesome!  

Well to make this story even sweeter, I received a call from the Apple store where I made my order and them asking how I was liking the new machine, I explained what happened and they said hold on…  when they came back on the line they told me they had the exact retina MacBook Pro sitting at their store and they would swap it out for mine right then and there also allowing me to do a recovery via thunderbolt!  Awesome.  I head in and do the swap.  All is well and I am enjoying my new retina MacBook Pro just fine….until a week later, when the video card goes apeshit crazy!

I call up Applecare and they take note and setup an appointment for me with the genius bar at my local Apple store.  I head into the Apple store and although my mac stopped showing the video issue, I had documented it via video off my phone and showed the genius that.  He heads to the back and comes out with a brand new retina MacBook Pro plops it down on the table, pulls out a thunderbolt cable, transfers my data (only took 10 minutes for 300 gigs btw, holly crap!) and hands me ANOTHER brand new machine!  

So in the end, I am sitting here writing this on my THIRD retina MacBook Pro that Apple has given me in the span of two weeks.  Apple never made me sign anything, fill out anything, jump through countless hoops, I just called them up and within minutes they had a new machine on it's way to my hands.  Phenomenal customer service and even though they didn't need to, they gained a customer for life, again.

Screencasts using Quicktime, animation using Motion.  Audio using Garage Band for beginners and Logic Studio for pros.

Rather than being an exhaustive ""For Dummies"" style manual, we include real world examples of how OS X and OS X native applications can ease workflow and increase productivity.

What is the one third-party freeware app the graphic artists and professional photographers amongst us couldn't live without?  

In short, what could beginners who've never used a Mac before learn from you?  What should people who have owned a Mac for a while, but never had the time to sit down and really learn how to get the most from it, spend an hour each night learning how to do, and how can you help them learn it?

What area in particular would /r/Apple users who would be interested in reading such a book like those of us who will be working on the project to cover first?  Leave your suggestions and feedback below.

After we've decided on a topic for the first ebook, we'll set up a Google Docs account which contributors can share resources and documents.  

Is there a way we can use iCloud to share iBooks, TextEdit and Pages documents with one another?  Should we use DropBox?  What Mac friendly collaboration tools are out there, which would best suite our needs?

At the end of the project, we will publish to the Apple Book Store.

Within the last few weeks, it's had inconsistent issues with the login screen not immediately coming up when I wake it from sleep, and the right USB port wasn't always detecting thumb drives.

I took it into the Apple Store last Thursday, when they tried to run their diagnostics, it kept locking at the same point.  They were almost certain it was a logic board issue, so they scheduled me to bring it back this afternoon (I wanted an evening to take a TM snapshot and blow it away to remove my files).  I come into the store after work, talked to a different tech, who tries the diagnostics again.

He also says it's probably the logic board, but since I'm past my initial 60-day window, it will most likely have to be checked in and fixed versus just swapping it out.  As he's doing his thing, he comes across my purchase history and his eyes widen.  *A half-dozen iPhones, 2 Mac Minis, a PowerBook G4, 2 MacBook Pros, a PowerMacG5, the MacBook Air in question, 1 Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Expresses.*

He goes in the back, and brings out a brand new, sealed MBA.  Sure, I was a few weeks past the 60-day point, but this guy went above and beyond.  Oh, and my warranty started over.

Further, the process by which one obtains the program is poorly documented, ambiguous in detail, and overly baroque - taking days to a week to finalize. Finally, I have since learned that the authors are using GPL'd code while demanding a ""donation"" and yet not offering source per the GPL licensing requirements. 

Here are some details on the process: 

- Go to the Mac The Ripper forum and email the developer asking for instructions on how to obtain the program. 

- He emails you a paypal address to ""donate"" $40. 

- After receiving the paypal confirmation email, he will then email a copy of the binary. 

- When launching the binary it will then automatically launch mail.app and email an activation code back to the developers. The instructions say that after this point they will email back a license key to launch the app. 

I ran into a problem whereby the developer wasn't convinced that I had paid, even though I had just sent the money only days before. This led to an escalating flame war where he started by saying that I was too stupid to follow ""basic"" directions, while I replied that a ""basic"" process involved dealing with a legitimate firm that handled credit card transactions like any other normal business. From that point onward, the flamewar only got worse. I wound up giving the asshole $40 and getting basically nothing in return. 

There are many commercial DVD rippers on the market now. They run like normal businesses. I could list a few, but then readers might think I'm pimping a product instead of warning the userbase. A simple google search will show many products all of which cost less than the suggested ""donation"" for Mac The Ripper, and even a free software based solution if you're comfortable with a command line shell.

Given the horrible abuse meted out by this individual, I simply can't recommend Mac The Ripper to anyone. That guy is nuts.

I've spent the last few months working on my reddit client, Karma.  I love it.  It supports most of the features of reddit including comment browsing, replying to stories and comments, posting links, saving and hiding stories, and managing your subreddit subscriptions.

I tried to craft Karma to be easy to use and to present as minimal an interface as possible with the most shallow navigation hierarchy possible.  The navigation bar takes cues from TweetBot, an application that I personally love.  The controls for actions on stories and comments hide until you need them (tap and hold a story or tap a comment to activate them) as to visually clutter everything.

I have a lot of plans for the future of this application.  If you'd like to be a part of Karma, visit /r/KarmaApp to submit suggestions and bug reports.

Thanks!

Yes, they are cool, but i never really thought it was something you needed (such as an ipod or laptop). Then, my dad bought my mom one for Christmas. My mom was paralyzed in a car accident 10 years ago from the neck down with very little shoulder and arm movement. She told me last night that it has been 10 years since she has been able to be excited about reading a new book because it was really difficult to turn the pages and things like that, but with her new ipad she has just enough function to slide her finger across the ipad screen, turning pages. This brought tears to my eyes, and i am so thankful my mom has found yet another way in which to obtain more independence. I was so happy and i thought this was something my fellow redditors would appreciate :) Thank you Apple!

edit: thank you for all the great comments :) i'm driving home from school tonight and can't wait to show her how great the community of reddit is!

edit 2: from the comments i guess you turn pages on the ipad by just tapping the screen, which is what she does i'm sure. Also she can't use a kindle, not enough arm/hand/finger movement

edit 3: she doesn't primarily use it for reading, that was just one of the main things she loves about it! she also uses it as basically her laptop because she can't use an actual laptop unless it's on a table so this way she can use it in bed and while watching tv!

1325622900.0,575,self.apple,o1i5b,I used Find My iPhone to track and apprehend the thief who stole my bag...,760,185,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/o1i5b/i_used_find_my_iphone_to_track_and_apprehend_the/,"This is a story of an asshole who stole the wrong guy's bag.

On the final day of possibly the greatest weekend on record, we were about to leave Whistler, British Columbia to catch our flight home. We were here for a location wedding with close friends and had an amazing time.  My girlfriend, a friend and I said our long goodbyes and headed down to our rental vehicle and noticed the passenger window had been smashed and my messenger bag was gone....fuck.

Contents of bag included:

* Passport
* Car, house and office keys
* iPad
* Jambox
* Various important papers


Enter Batman mode.

Open Find My iPhone app and cross fingers this idiot doesn't know about it's traceable nature.

Remote lock: activated. 

Thank god....i located my iPad on the move in a hotel across the street.  I head the the courtyard in the radius of the signal; looking around trying to identify my bag on the dozens of people surrounding me.

I've dreamt about using this feature if someone ever stole my gear, but in reality, it's difficult in a busy street. I call the RCMP as I'll need some assistance in case this guy (or girl) is nefarious thug.

They arrive quickly as I'm constantly refreshing the location.  I show him my app and brief him on the situation.  It seems to be moving through one of the hotels but I can't pinpoint it exactly. With no real accurate location we start lapping the area, staying within the radius.

It's not really moving. Seems to be in a hotel. The cop explains that we can't be going around knocking on all the rooms...I agree and after a few laps and 30 minutes, decide that it's starting to look like a lost cause. I wasn't getting an accurate enough reading.

I send a message to my iPad: ""Fuck you"", it said.

When you send a message through the app, you have the option of playing an annoying radar like sound for 2 minutes. I didn't do this initially as I thought it would scare him off.

I head back to the parkade and show the officer the scene of the theft. He takes some pics and I answer some questions and my girlfriend starts the process of rescheduling our flight. My dream of using this app to catch a bad guy seems to be fading and I prepare myself to replace all the items that were stolen...not the end of the world but a raging pain.

The RCMP leave me a card with a file number and explain that if I find this guy, follow him and call them immediately.

Soon after they leave and we start the process of patching up the window with cardboard and garbage bags as its pouring rain. I take one last look at my iPads location and shit...it's on the move and the location seems accurate. 

Never give up!  Never surrendaaaaar. 

I run towards its location. It's moving down the pedestrian main street in Whistler called ""Village Stroll"". As I'm moving I'm sending him messages and playing the annoying sound:

&gt;If you try and use this iPad, the RCMP will track you

&gt;Drop the bag. Keep the iPad. I just want my fucking keys

The movement stops in a square and there's not many people around. I play the sound remotely without sending a message this time and seconds after I send...I hear it!

A somewhat normal looking dude walks past me in the opposite direction. As the sound goes off, he looks at his Quicksilver bag and veers into a clothing shop. I call the RCMP back and as my mind is racing I'm trying to explain to dispatch that I've found the guy I called about earlier....she has no idea what I'm talking about so I have to reexplain the situation as I watch this guy pretending to shop.

In what seemed like an eternity, I waited on the line describing the individual and watched him casually blend in as a shopper. 

Finally, I see one of the RCMP that were helping me initially. I hang up and point him out. He heads out of the store and up the sidewalk away from us, he knows the RCMP are around. The officer I'm with radios ahead of us and tells another officer to cut him off.

The thief sees this and ducks into a coffee shop...

I'm told to stay put and the two officers head in the shop and grab the guy, put him in cuffs and start looking through his bag. My iPad and Jambox are there along with a huge amount of stolen merchandise but none of my ID or keys...fuck.  Apparently this guy has been kicked out of the town a few times and is well known. 

I stay away from the scene and listen to them talk. The guy explains he found the bag and was trying to find the owner...pfffff. Eventually he admits his guilt and in exchange for me not charging him, he tells the officers the location of my bag.

We head back to the initial radius I had tracked him to earlier and into a public washroom. Apparently he ditched it in the garbage.  My new found RCMP friend throws on some gloves and roots through the garbage...DING DING DING!  My bag was there but my travel wallet was not. Another radio conversation happens and we head to a different hotel public washroom to find my travel wallet buried amongst the filth.

""It *NEVER* works out like this"" the RCMP explain to me.

I express a huge amount of gratitude for the help and I get some in return for locating the bad guy. It was a fun little game.

**TL;DR** Bad guy smashes window and takes my bag containing my iPad. Use Find My iPhone to track him down and coordinate his arrest and get all my stuff back...I am batman.

Backstory. I was an Evo 4G user, it was the first ""4G"" phone running on the WiMAX network. It packed superior specs and was Engadget's second place phone last year, behind the iPhone 4. I used it stock for several months before rooting the device. I spent many months with Cyanogenmod and other various Roms including MIUI and sense 3.0. 

I switched because I have a Mac Mini, iPad and Apple TV and want to stay in the ecosystem (shuffle too but does that count? PS. Is there any competition for the shuffle yet? $50 bucks with shipping and engraving?!). Impressions:

- holy Christmas the *KEYBOARD on the 4S is amazing. I've used about five different android keyboards (stock HTC, stock gingerbread, smart keyboard, swiftkey X, and swype) and never had one even close to this good

- *SMOOTH as silk speed throughout, android always had inconsistencies depending on the app (and other issues like when 4G was on my phone would run much slower. What is up with that??)

- my iPhone is on AT&amp;amp;T and I am frequently pulling down 4mbs in downtown Boston. Compared to sprint 3G CDMA that's at least four times faster. Versus 4G, that's about even with WiMAX occasionally reaching higher. However, it's not really a competition because with WiMAX on, my Evo could not get more than 6 hours of battery life  regardless of use. This is due to how poor the WiMAX radio functions in the phone. *It made using 4G a rare moment as I rarely had it on*

- love how uniform the iOS experience is.  *Different apps all function similarly.* Settings make sense and are grouped together (not sure why mail doesn't have the pull down refresh like most other apps though...) EDIT: apparently it was a third party who created the down swipe and Apple has yet to embrace it. I personally hope they do, it feels natural to me for an app like mail. 

- hardware quality is out of this world. Goes without saying I suppose


Lastly, support. My first 4S had an over sensitive accelerometer causing the phone to switch to landscape wayyy to soon, I.e. when being set on a flat surface. Made a genius appointment, got a new device and restored all my early settings and data. No problem. 

And you can't really put a price on that kind of customer service. ",,False,,t5_2qh1f,True,,,True,t3_lf1yc,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/lf1yc/two_year_android_fan_just_got_the_4s/,

What amazed me most of all, however, was just how simple Apple made it for this to happen. I've done lots of PC upgrades, and I've NEVER had any upgrade go this easily!

Like I said in the title; I highly recommend you do this. The prices for RAM and SDD's are so low now, that if you want the ultimate performance, it's an easy way to get it.

1348182704.0,538,self.apple,107w8y,What Passbook is and isn't,630,92,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/107w8y/what_passbook_is_and_isnt/,"
I'm seeing a lot of confusion and complaints about Passbook. Some of this is Apple's fault, because I don't think they have clearly communicated to the public about it (their explanations to developers have been pretty clear — I am a developer — but we've been under NDA about it until, oh, about 24h ago). But also, there's been some really bad reporting by ""journalists"" on the subject. (In quotes, because I was always taught *real* journalists do research on things they don't understand before they write an article about it.)

So, I'm going to clear up some stuff real quick: What Passbook is and how it works.

The best way to think of Passbook is like the Photo Library. It stores a bunch of stuff for you, which you can flip through, and that's pretty much it. And similar to the Photo Library, you can save stuff into Passbook from Safari, from emails you receive, and more. If you have a Mac running Mountain Lion, you can send them wirelessly to your iPhone from there.

When you open up Passbook and there's nothing in it, there's a link to the App Store. This is just Apple trying to be helpful, but I think it has instead confused people into thinking that they must install apps for passes to appear in their passbook. **This is not true.**

So, a common complaint I've seen is ""I don't want to install (company)'s shitty app in order to get their storecard on my phone"". **You don't have to!**

(Unless the company decides it absolutely wants it that way. It's their call, not Apple's.)

Apps *can* save passes to your Passbook (just like they can save photos to your Photo Library), but that's just one option. You can attach them to emails so that, say, when you book a ticket for an event, and Eventbrite or whoever email you a receipt, and a .PDF ticket (for people without iPhones to print out and take to the venue) they could also send you a .pkpass that installs into your Passbook. Or you might install it direct from the website when your order is confirmed. You might scan a QR code in a coffee-shop (using any 3rd-party scanner) and it could offer to install a loyalty card for you.

(Note: no matter how a Pass is sent to you, it won't add to your Passbook automatically — it's just offered to you by iOS, and only added if you accept it. So people can't spam you via the Passbook. This is important, as we'll see in a moment.)

What is a pass, anyway? Well, just a .zip file with a some data and graphics inside it, that's all. That's why you don't need an app to make one; Apple provide source code for web servers to produce them.

Passbook then renders it into something pretty. Since it ends up just being a pretty graphic on your screen, why is it better than just saving a picture of the same thing to the Photo Library?

There are two main reasons:

* Passes can be tied to geographical locations. They'll pop up on your lock screen when you arrive at those locations. This means that when you arrive at the event, or the store, or the departure gate, the ticket is there on your screen ready to scan.

* The information on a Pass can be auto-updated over-the-air. You'll receive an alert about the changed info too — so if your flight is departing from a different gate, or you've run out of credit, you'll know right away.

This doesn't require an app on your system either. It's all web based: if you run a web server, you can provide this service to iPhone users. You make HTTP requests to Apple servers to send over-the-air push notifications to users (they must have accepted a Pass from you first, of course — told you that would become important) and you'll get status updates back.

Long term, this could be a real game-changer for small, local businesses which could then compete with the chains in offering loyalty-card schemes, store credit, special offer coupons, seamless ticketing, gift cards and more — all without needing specialist equipment, printing, laminating, app development, or anything more than a web site with a little bit of scripting on it.

Why have Passbook support in apps at all? Convenience. There's nothing a Passbook-enabled app can do that a website can't, but as we all know, it's often more convenient to use native apps than web apps. So, if your airline wants to let you change your preferred seat from window to aisle, or you want to top up your travel card with extra credit, you could do that via an app, or via their website — it's up to them what they want to provide. And then the updated credit/seat allocation/whatever will be pushed to your phone.

I had no issues with my system so I used Carbon Copy Cloner to make a clone of my HDD onto my SSD. I put the SSD in my MBP and booted up. 

Immediately, the MBP got hot. Uncomfortably hot. Too hot to touch. So I powered down my machine and researched it. Eventually, I discovered that swapping a drive can sometimes confuse the System Management Controller. 

There is a guide to [reset the settings here.](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US)

In short:

* Plug your laptop into the wall. 
* Press and hold SHIFT+CRTL+OPTION+POWER and release all buttons at the same time. 
* Count to 10
* Power ON your laptop. 

This fixed my heat issue instantly. 

Thought I would pass along the advice as many people are going to SSD's now and the temps after I swapped would have eventually fried my board.

1362084011.0,524,self.apple,19f12j,New Mac? Lesson attack!,658,134,247,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/19f12j/new_mac_lesson_attack/,"**TL;DR** *A friend is finally making the switch from Windows to Mac. I wrote her this guide to get up and running quickly and solve some common annoyances with the OS.*

Ok, so here's a semi-organized assortment of things you will want to do to make your user experience a lot nicer.

First, get used to the new keyboard shortcuts. Command (CMD) pretty much replaces Control from Windows. That's confusing because there's also a Control key - but you'll hardly ever use it. Option is your new Alt key. Holding Option and clicking things tends to give you extra choices to use - things a typical user wouldn't want to bother with.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

* CMD+Space opens the Spotlight window, which VERY quickly lets you search for files and applications to launch. It's how I open everything.
* CMD+Q quits the application
* CMD+W closes the current window
* CMD+Shift+3 takes a whole-screen screenshot and saves it to the desktop
* CMD+Shift+4 lets you drag the mouse to save a screenshot of a portion of your screen
* Option+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will let you Force Quit frozen applications
* CMD+Option+Shift+Right-Clicking an icon in the Dock will REALLY let you Force Quit a frozen application pretty immediately.
* CMD+I Opens the Inspector, which shows you a file's properties.
* Holding CMD and clicking lets you reposition items in the menubar. You can even drag them out to remove them entirely.

**Applications to get (free unless otherwise noted)**


* [Xtrafinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) - Brings tabs to Finder and lets you cut/paste files. (By default, you can only copy/paste. It's dumb)
* [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/) (free trial) - Lets you resize windows by dragging to the edges of your screen, just like Windows 7 introduced.
* [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) - Really good FTP app, if you're into that sort of thing.
* [Dragoman](http://dragoman.en.softonic.com/mac) - Bulk convert file types very easily. Something that only comes in handy every so often, but when it does - wow!
* [GrandPerspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/) - Lets you visually see where disk space is being most used. Don't be alarmed by the SleepImage file's size. That's a copy of what's in RAM, and protects your work during accidents.
* [MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org/) - Use this for movie watching. VLC has become kind of bloated since the 2.0 release, and MPlayerX has more support for different codecs anyway.
* [TinkerTool](http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) - Allows you to easily change hidden system preferences.
* [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) - Incredible lightweight torrent client.
* [CheatSheet](http://www.grandtotal.biz/CheatSheet/) - Lets you hold Command for a few seconds to pull up a list of all the keyboard shortcuts supported by the application you're currently in. VERY useful.
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) (free trial) - Incredible menu bar calendar app. Great gmail integration!
* [Sparrow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417250177?mt=12) (paid) - Badass gmail app. If you're looking for something outside of the browser to do emails, skip the native Mail app and try this out.
* [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - duh. do it.

**Default settings to change**


* In System Preferences under Language and Text you should disable ""Correct spelling automatically"" because it's super annoying.
* In System Preferences under Security and Privacy, click the Lock in the bottom left to make changes and Allow Applications downloaded from Anywhere to run on your Mac. It's YOUR Mac!
* Right-click the Dock (easiest by the big open space near Trash) and turn on hiding. You have a 13"" monitor - reclaim some space!
* Launch Terminal, then paste this in and hit enter. It kills the DashBoard, which is awful.
* defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
* Launch Terminal, then paste this in and hit enter. It reveals your hidden ~/Library/ folder, which is like the windows equivalent of… something good. You'll wind up messing with these files eventually for some reason or other, so it's a good idea to unhide it.
* chflags nohidden ~/Library/
* Using Tinkertool:
* Under Applications, check the thing for Downloads not showing the quarantine warning. It's annoooooooying.
* Under Dock Options, try out disabling the 3D effect and see how you like it. I definitely prefer the 2D dock.

**Random Stuff**

* Scrolling works on background windows now. This is a nice change from Windows, where you had to click and change the main window focus to be able to interact with a program or folder.
* Dragging files in/out of windows and applications now works extremely well. When in doubt, if you don't see an import button, just find the file/picture/text and drag it in.
* In System Preferences under Language and Text you can add keyboard shortcuts, like in iOS. I have it set to replace ""eml"" with my email address.
* In System Preferences under Users and Groups you can add/remove applications that launch at login.
* Activity Monitor is the name of OSX's version of Task Manager (what you'd open during a CTRL+ALT+DEL to view system processes)
* Finder works most like Windows Explorer in List view.
* If you ever find that the default application that launches for a certain filetype isn't what you'd prefer, launch the Inspector (CMD+I) and go down to ""Open with."" There, you can select the right application, then Change All to apply that update across the operating system.
* Don't just randomly paste things you find on the internet into Terminal. You can screw things up - especially if Sudo is in front of it! Make sure you understand exactly what it's doing first. Obviously, since I'm your pal, the things I recommend will not break your shit.

I got into design after using Photoshop and Illustrator while still in high school which got me into university studying design in 1995 and ""stuck"" on Macs for the rest of my life. Nearly 17 years later, in two weeks I'll be moving half way across the country to start a new career at Apple. A dream come true.

I'm nervous, excited and more than anything happy. Never give up on your dreams, kids. No matter how long it takes. Cheers.

So many questions at /r/applehelp get ZERO comments. That's not fair, and that's not how reddit is supposed to work.

I was going to ask a question, but after being being advised by the stuff in this subreddit to post to /r/applehelp, I don't see the point.

I hope the mods allow this post to stand not as a rip on you all, but rather as a reminder that there are legitimate reasons why questions would (and in my opinion SHOULD) be posted here.

Having said that, I understand why you WOULDN'T want questions here... but I think that people helping people is more important than being inconvenienced by posts you can hide with the click of a button. And that's all it takes.

tldr; utility from support from 30x times the readers trumps the inconvenienced caused by hiding posts you don't want to see.

P.S. I posted to /r/mac and got the responses I needed, and nobody gave me shit about it.

**EDIT:** Why not create a tag that the css of the subreddit can filter? This is a really goddamn good idea from [lawe2](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/kwtrm/61k_vs_2k_users_thats_why_people_want_to_post/c2nw2rj). Imagine titles like this:

    [ask] What MBP is right for a Mac newb?

And people can choose to see or not see [ask] posts!

**EDIT 2**

Alright mods, the people have spoken. Look at the votes. Look at the comments. We're asking for questions to formally be a part of the subreddit once again. We trust that majority rules, as the foundation of liberal democracy (and of reddit), will be respected. Please, at least give us a response. 

Better yet, take the votes and comments as assurance that this is what the community wants and grant it to us. It's not about mods. It's about reddit and its users. Respectully, thank you.

I didn’t really appreciate this until I began selling computers to average consumers. Most people (and when I say most, I mean like 80%), come in looking for something they can use to surf the web, email, occasionally write a paper, be able to open office docs, listen to some music, look at pictures, and maybe watch a movie when they travel. That’s it. And there is a huge amount of interest in Apple these days. Those willing to spend $1k almost always get a mac, even if it is overkill for their needs. **Yesterday Apple dropped the price of entry to portable Macs by 50% with a device that does those things specifically, and a few thousand others (the app store), really well.** The people who’ve actually touched the iPad, ie.. not you/me, are all impressed by how well it does these basic things. Imagine how impressed regular folks, think your parents/non-techie friends, will be. All the items people mention that the iPad doesn’t have? Virtually no one comes in asking for that stuff. It is so far down on the list of requested specs, if on the list at all, that it just doesn’t matter. Apple knows this. And they built a very good first gen. device to meet these needs better than existing solutions.

As far as I can tell, people enjoy hating on apple because apple is revered as a very smart company. Finding fault in their products makes people think they are as smart, if not smart than the mighty apple. Well, we’ll see how smart you feel when the iPad sells like crazy.

Apple just had another record in Q4 ’09 (what recession?). I predict, conservatively that Q4 ’10 is 20% higher.
Also... you heard it here first... the iPad will be the christmas gift of 2010.

This is, quite frankly, silly.  /r/AppleMeta has 25 subscribers and 9 total posts.  Ever.  There is no point to having a separate subreddit for that purpose.  Things at /r/AppleHelp are a bit better, just over 5,000 subscribers and a total of 10,000 submissions over time, but the rate of submissions is still not very high.

The result is that we're wasting moderator time and community goodwill on subdividing the information while not making an appreciable difference in how many posts people see.  I've not understood the point since I found these subreddits and the recent thread admonishing folks for not being in the right one simply brought the issue to the front of my mind again.

What do the rest of you think?  Do you believe the division is working out well, or is a silly distraction?  Would you prefer separate groups, or one big happy ""Everything Apple"" subreddit?

**EDIT 2012-08-02:** Almost one full day of comments, and this thread has generated a lot of useful posts.  In my time on /r/Apple I've seen a few of the mod threads like the one that inspired my post, and have gotten the impression that the mods and /r/Apple subscribers weren't 100% in sync.  I posted this straw man proposal in attempt to spark a useful discussion and generate some non-flame feedback for the mods and the community and the response has be amazing.  Even if you don't have a strong opinion on the proposal at hand, it is useful to post here why **you** come to /r/Apple, or /r/AppleHelp so the mods know their audience.  I have some personal thoughts which I'll probably share tomorrow in a regular comment, I'd prefer to not use the bully pulpit of being the thread starter give my comments extra weight, I'm just another subscriber here.

**EDIT 2012-08-03:** I added my comment to the discussion.  Ultimately the path forward here is dependent on the moderators of not only this reddit, but the other Apple reddits.  I think the reddit Apple community has a chance to become much stronger, but it's going to take cooperation and a common vision.  That's difficult in any online community.

I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to give the moderators some constructive and useful feedback.",,False,,t5_2qh1f,1343997924.0,,,True,t3_xikom,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/xikom/proposal_to_merge_rapple_rapplehelp_rapplemeta/,

Going through my old photos from when I worked in Apple retail years ago and came across this gem, the kid's table piss ball.  I had almost forgotten that little tidbit of knowledge I had learned from the job.  Apparently when kids are really into a game they will often choose to just pee in their seat without stopping what they're doing.  The result?  Squishy black ball seats.  I had never really believed that kids would do this until I walked by while they were retiring one of the balls one night.

Just one of the nasty little ""ewwws"" lurking in arguable the coolest retail environments around.

A bunch of us employees (I was at ATG at the time) were in Town Hall in Building 4 at Infinite Loop to hear him, and he was fired up. Talked a lot about how Apple was going to completely turn things around and become great.

It was a tough time at Apple — we were trading below book value on the market — our enterprise value was actually less than our cash on hand. And the rumors were everywhere that we were going to be acquired by Sun. Someone in the audience asked him about Michael Dell’s suggestion in the press a few days previous that Apple should just shut down and return the cash to shareholders, and as I recall, Steve’s response was: “Fuck Michael Dell.”

1374221880.0,431,self.apple,1imc1f,This is why Apple will always have my custom,677,246,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1imc1f/this_is_why_apple_will_always_have_my_custom/,"Well for the last few weeks, my iPhone 5s battery has been somewhat sporadic. I got it the day it was launched in NZ, even camped out at my carriers HQ until midnight, I was the 15th person in the country to get the thing. So I was somewhat surprised when the phone would shut off at 16% without warning, regardless of what I was doing. I didn't want to send my phone back and deal with waiting and stuff because it was annoying because without a phone for a few weeks, but it was starting to get really irritating. So, I bit the bullet and called Apples helpdesk. 

The first lady I spoke to was more than helpful, I think she was new and was learning her way around the system because she seemed to fumble around a few things and get lost and ask for information many times, but I know what being a CSR is like so I was kind to her. She said I had 2 options: 
* Send my iPhone to Apple and they send me a new one for free.
* Have Apple send me a new one now, and me send my old one back when it arrives, for a fee. 

So I said I'd call them back after arranging finances, because to have them send me a new phone first, I'd have to have a $1049NZD hold put on my credit card (The retail price of a brand new iPhone 5, ridiculous, I know.) as well as $55 for shipping and service. I don't have this kind of money just lying around so I had to arrange with the bank for a temporary extension on my limit, which they were nice enough to do :)

A couple of hours later, I called Apple back and discussed it with a different CSR with a Canadian accent, we were chatting away and talking about what we both do, found out we were both students. Thats when he said 
&gt; So since you're a student, its probably tough to do express replacement right? But you've called us a couple of times about this already, give me a couple of minutes 'tardtasticx', I'm just going to check something. 

After a few minutes passed, the elevator music stopped, and the CSR came back, he told me
&gt; Hi 'tardtasticx', I've just double checked something with a supervisor, and I'm going to quickly transfer you to another agent to finish the call, sorry about the inconvenience but I think it'll be in your best interest.
Then I heard him sort of snicker down the line, I was pretty confused though, but went along with it. 

I was then transferred to another agent, Andrew, but he had an Australian accent and was in an obviously good mood. So when I got the chance to speak, I asked 
&gt; How come I was transferred to someone else? Did I get through to the wrong department or something? haha
Andrew:
&gt; Oh well the CSR you spoke with before wasn't authorised to do a few things we're going to do today. He mentioned to me your a student, is that right?
Me:
&gt; Yeah, I study IT full time. 
Andrew:
&gt; Well, we know money is tight for students, so we thought we'd make you have a great experience more than anything, and decided we would waive the shipping and service fees for the express replacement, how does that sound?
Me: 
&gt; Oh wow, thats... Thank you!
Andrew:
&gt; Not a problem mate, just one little thing however, you've gotta brag about how nice we are here at Apple. Hahaha.
Me: 
&gt; You can count on it!

And thats why I thought I'd post this here :D

He talked a lot about how he'd rather I have a good experience with Apple than a bad one and make them lose custom with other people. 

It shows that even though Apple are such a big company, they do still have a heart in there. :P

I feel pretty confident now that I've spent my money wisely. I don't have to find the time to go to a store and get my phone sent off for repair, wait without a phone and stuff, they deliver it straight to me, and pay for the courier to come pick my old one up a few days later. 

Hope this perhaps persuades someone to buy Apple, because I see a lot of people unsure why Apple charges so much for products, well put simply, they make quality products, and if they fail, they stand by them still and go out of the way to fix it. 

Thats my story for today :D

**TL;DR: iPhone's battery has issues, Apple replaces it for free by sending a new one to my door, and picking my old one up later. **

After hanging around for a half an hour or so I went to grab my iPhone and, where the hell is it? I grasp pockets, tear apart the car, nothing. I go back up to my ubuntu laptop, (yes i'm currently running ubuntu on a HP laptop), log into iCloud and launch the Find My iPhone app. It doesn't immediately find my phone. my desktop at home, my ipad that I have with me those get located with no problem.

I set it to alert me when it's available. about 10 minutes later my iPad lights up. I look and activate lost mode. I see it starting to move around. I tell my dad, hey it's moving and he says let's go and see if we can find it. So I grab my iPad, hop in the car and navigate as he's driving. The hunt ends at a recycling center and I start hitting the button to make the phone sound off. Nothing, but I do notice that the phone is moving again, this time back the way we just came.

My dad wheels around and about 200 yards away we see a homeless gentleman walking with his head bowed looking at what he has in his hands. I point at him, and say ""Him"". Dad pulls up and sure enough the guy has an iPhone in his hand.

""Hey man, can I have my phone back?"", he looks up obviously shocked and starts stammering about how he was trying to figure out how to call me. Of course, when he hands it to me the the lock code is half filled in. We gave him $20 and said thanks. Win, win. I got my phone back and he got $20 to spend on whatever he needed that day.

What we figure is he found it after my dumbass dropped it and he tried to sell it to the recycling center. When they said no, he started wondering off and that's when we found him.

Any rate, I was impressed with how accurate the tracking in Lost Mode was.
