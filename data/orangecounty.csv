Lots of candidates seem to be doing AMA's these days so I figured I'd
try one too!

I am running against Ed Royce as the Democratic candidate for District
39 which includes: Brea, Buena Park, Chino Hills, Diamond Bar,
Fullerton, Hacienda Heights, La Habra, La Habra Heights, Placentia,
Rowland Heights, Walnut, Yorba Linda.

A little bit about myself:
I grew up in the Hacienda Heights public schools and earned a
scholarship to attend Harvard University. After graduating from
Harvard with honors, I started my own small business, investing and
managing commercial properties. While running my business, I became an
intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Additionally, I am a
member of the Hacienda-La Puente School Board and was elected
President of the school board.

I'll start to answer everyone's questions around 9:30, but feel free
to get the ball rolling!

She went missing between last night (May12th) and this morning (May 13th).  We usually bring her inside, but last night we forgot to.  Even when she accidentally gets locked out, she usually hangs out in the front garden or in front of our door, and she immediately starts meowing and scratching the front door when one of us wakes up (usually around 6am).  We're afraid that coyote's may have gotten her, but we heard no signs of a cat screaming or struggling.  We have heard cats being attacked by coyotes around our house before, and it's usually extremely loud and wakes up someone in the house.

She was last seen [here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.645796,-117.96021&amp;ll=33.645957,-117.958912&amp;spn=0.002577,0.005284&amp;num=1&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=A).  

Here is a [picture of her](http://imgur.com/NaucFv9).

If you have seen her, please PM me or comment in this thread.  My mother is devastated and my family would love to be able to see her one last time.

Thank you for your time for reading this.

edit: This is a self post, and I get no Karma for this post.  So please please please upvote for visibility and help find my cat!  Thank you!

edit2: I have been regularly checking [ocpetinfo](http://www.ocpetinfo.com) regularly to see if she has been turned in.  If you have ever lost a pet, I recommend you go that webpage to see if anyone has ever turned in your pet.

She stole a box from our front porch.,89,10,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/19g6nh/anyone_recognize_this_woman_she_stole_a_box_from/,"We've been having an issue with Amazon boxes missing off our front porch (and people breaking into our cars) over the past few months, so we set up a couple of security cameras, and got a hit a couple of days ago. We're in Santa Ana, on the Tustin border.

Video Angle 1: [1] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65038500/thief1.mp4

Video Angle 2: [2] http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65038500/thief2.mp4

In the first video, you can clearly see her and her partner in crime walk by, and she indicates to him that our house has a package. She comes back a few minutes later, takes her sweater off, wraps the box up in it, and leaves. I'm a little weirded out by the fact that doing so took her at least 30 seconds; I have the feeling she was trying our door and trying to peer through the blinds.

I find it especially funny that the box she stole contained a 13 lb bag of baking soda (for our pool). I picture her and her friend opening it, and being like ""What the fuck?"" Not as good a haul as the vacuum cleaner that someone stole a couple of months ago.

Anyway, anyone recognize her? I know the footage isn't that great, but I figured it was worth a shot. I'll be sending the videos to the police tomorrow -- I know they will do absolutely nothing, but I feel I gotta at least do my part.

Also, if any of you have any decent video editing software and can get a couple clear screenshots of her face, that would be awesome. I've got an extra giftcard for Trader Joes for $15 for whoever can get me a couple of good shots. I know, I know, it doesn't work like it does on CSI; a pixelated video means a pixelated photo, but hopefully you can do better than I can.

At great risk to their own careers, these doctors (who are not political) spoke out publicly against Hoag's decision.[ Click here](http://articles.dailypilot.com/2013-06-11/opinion/tn-dpt-me-0612-mailbag-20130610_1_hoag-hospital-hoag-ceo-abortion-ban) to read the letter. That was an incredibly brave action on their part.

It's NOW time for women across Orange County - and the men who support them - to tell Hoag that we will not settle for anything less than comprehensive medical services for ALL patients. Telling women they have to go to somewhere else for a medical procedure is ridiculous!


Here are the Details:

LOCATION: Hoag (351 Hospital Road in Newport)
DATE: Thursday, June 20th
TIME: 5:00 PM
PARKING: There is FREE parking at 307 Hospital Road. If that fills up, there are two parking structures at 351 &amp; 361 where you can park for a nominal fee.

Press will be in attendance so we need a HUGE turnout.

I'm asking you to join me this Thursday if you really do believe what you keep telling me privately - that this is an important issue to you!

We'll have signs on hand but if you want to create your own, here are some ideas:

I trust my doctor....why doesn't Hoag?
Protect Women's Health
Hoag: Don't Outsource My Healthcare
Hoag: Hands Off the Doctor-Patient Relationship

Together, let's show Hoag and the media that Orange County women - and men - won't back down on this issue.

###Reddit Disneyland Meetup with your host, [BelieveInTheMagic](http://www.reddit.com/user/BelieveInTheMagic)!

**A little introduction:** If you haven't heard, Disneyland will be open 24 hours on the 29th. http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2012/01/leap-year-2012-brings-one-more-disney-day-to-disney-parks/

&gt; an extra day of magic for you called “One More Disney Day.” For the first time ever, both Magic Kingdom Park and Disneyland park will stay open for 24 hours straight. That’s right, from 6 a.m., February 29 to 6 a.m., March 1, 2012, local time, you can fill the extra day of leap year with a marathon of Disney Parks fun.

So we decided, as theme park enthusiasts, that it would be fun to meetup on this day!

Now, you don't have to spend the whole night at Disneyland, but it would be great to at least have a chance to meet our fellow Redditors. Besides, wouldn't you like to go on [Splash Mountain while playing Chess](http://xkcd.com/chesscoaster/)?

We will meet together from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM, and I figure from there we can break up and everyone can do what they like with your fellow redditors who have the same interests. Plus, if you are daring, you could spend the whole night there!

I forgot to mention, **No blackout days for annual passholders. You can come to the event!**

**The Details**:

_Flagpole_**&amp;#8253;** _Where is the freakin' Flagpole_**&amp;#8253;**

It is the first thing you see when you enter from the Disneyland front entrance on Main Street. In fact, it can be seen from space on Google Maps: http://g.co/maps/txbeb

[This is what the flagpole looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/YKdwm.jpg)

There are plenty of benches and stuff, if you arrive early. [There might even be something](http://www.reddit.com/r/finddit/comments/o20rv/request_hide_something_in_disneyland_before_the/) from [/r/finddit](/r/finddit) there. 

Via [BelieveInTheMagic](http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/o1rt0/reddit_disneyland_meetup_wednesday_february_29th/c3dowkm)

&gt; The flagpole is in the center of Town Square, which is right in front of the Main Street train station, between City Hall and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. As Ted mentioned, it's the first place you come to when you enter the park.

&gt; People are free to come to the park earlier, of course, and stay much later too, but we scheduled the meet at the flagpole at 7:00 pm so people with dayjobs could make it.

&gt; I'll be there by 6:45 and wearing a very bright orange shirt and maybe a Reddit button. Feel free to message me if you need more info as we get closer to the big day!

&gt; Looking forward to seeing everyone (or at least everyone who is not at WDW in Florida) there!

The ideal situation would be to get all of Southern California together in one big meetup location. We happen to be in the middle of LA and SD so we would be a good middle ground, but I don't know of a venue that would accommodate a large group.

Speaking of large groups, we now have over 1000 subscribers to the subreddit and almost 500 members in the facebook group. How many of you are actually planning on attending a global meetup day so we can be prepared for event planning? We've had an average of about 20-30 people show up at our meetups, and while I'm expecting a larger turnout for global meetup day, how much larger of a turnout should I expect?

The following ideas have been tossed around for global meetup day:

* Beach Bonfire
* Park
* Dave &amp;amp; Busters in Irvine

Neither the beach bonfire nor the park would allow for alcohol on the premises and while D&amp;amp;B would be a great central location to include LA/SD, I don't know if they would be prepared for a large mob of redditors attending, if we should rent out a room (and thus chrage people to be there), etc etc.

Sound off in the comments please. If anybody has a venue they could provide, I would also love to hear from you.

**Edit: it looks like a beach bonfire in Corona del Mar is best. I will type up a separate post detailing what to do for global meetup day :)**",Announcement,False,self,t5_2rd9x,True,best,,True,t3_h9bnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/h9bnt/global_meetup_day_in_orange_county_ca/,moderator

If you, or anyone you know, is down on their luck, and would like a frozen turkey for their family... PLEASE let me know as SOON as possible.  

I will deliver it to *anywhere in Orange County* ~~tomorrow~~ in the morning.

Thanks!

EDIT: I just confirmed with my cousin that the turkey is a leftover from Thanksgiving that wasn't used for Christmas either.  The USDA says: [Turkeys can be kept frozen in the freezer indefinitely; however, cook within 1 year for best quality.](http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Lets_Talk_Turkey/index.asp) I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but I thought I'd let everyone know.  

EDIT2: I'm going to give Reddit some time, so the turkey will be available until it's taken (I'm pretty much free all day tomorrow).

The run was a disaster: due to a motorcycle event taking place at the same time it took over an hour to drive 3 miles on the main road to the event and when you got there it was 2 miles to WALK to the main entrance. No first aid station, water stations ran out of water (not to mention how ridiculously HOT it was this weekend...), the color powder was in cardboard boxes...so where did the money go exactly?

Little did I know, but found out after researching, the ""Charity Bomb"" was founded by a high-level scientologist with two of three ""charities"" being Scientology front-groups: The Way To Happiness Foundation and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, the latter being a rabid anti-psychiatry front group.

The Charity Bomb claims to be a for-profit social enterprise, duping hundreds of participants into funding a Scientology-sponsored event. 

I tried reaching out to their Facebook and Twitter multiple times, not only no response but also myself and many others were censored from their Facebook page when trying to call them out on their disorganization and Scientology ties...sounds about right though, don't you think?

It gets worse if you read the link below about it's founder and his recent troubles at his Narconon business:

To sum it up:

I was selling some American Silver Eagle coins


Guy contacted me using an @gmail.com account. Claimed to live within walking distance of the In-n-Out on UCI campus. (I am very familiar/comfortable with that area)


It was already 9pm when he contacted me, so we agreed to meet @ 11:30pm in the parking lot. He rescheduled to 12:30pm last minute. I was okay with that.


We meet. (he walked). He asks to see the coins. I say, ""ya, no prob. I lets go inside so you can check them out &amp; weigh them.""


Seemed like before I could finish he was lunging at me with a taser.


I back-stepped and managed to avoid him. He awkwardly fell on all fours, got up &amp; took off running.



Here's what he looked like:

Asian Man

5'6-5'7  150-165lbs

Stocky Build

Email - buynsell333@gmail.com



I didn't bother contacting the police, cuz I didn't have anything to give them other than that vague description of an Asian man in Irvine. LOL


So here I am...


My advice. Always get a piece of personal info from the people you buy/sell to. If they seem like they have something to hide, you probably don't wana do business with them!

Learn from my mistakes.

A few things to note:

* This is not meant to be a comprehensive list. It's supposed to be a good starting point for people who are new to the area, have friends/family visiting, or who just want to explore.
* Most of the places listed I got from seeing what was popular on Yelp. I've been to a lot of them, but I tried to stick to what was rated highly *and* had a lot of reviews. Your favorite hole-in-the-wall pho place might not be on here, but it's really meant to get people thinking about the *kinds of stuff* in Orange County, and then maybe explore what's in their community.
* I tried to get some representation between north, central, and south Orange County where possible.
* Aside from my semi-arbitrary selection of places to represent the categories here, I tried to keep my editorializing to a minimum. But in some cases I threw in a word or two about the place.
* I kept out most chains, especially ones that are common outside of Orange County. Veggie Grill or Native Foods might be a go-to place for vegetarians/vegans, but I tried to stick to places that are either exclusively or primarily Orange County-based.

Having said all this, I do **welcome your suggestions** for stuff to add to this list. I've only lived here for a couple years, but I have spent most of that trying to figure out what's interesting around here. If there's a glaring oversight, let me know (and upvote/comment on suggestions that you agree with!).

BUT HERE IS THE THING...

They poured green tea and sat down to talk to customers. The tea was CHEAP. It did not seem like they made all that much in tips either. Now clearly, these girls, if willing to work in lingerie/topless, could make WAY more working at a bikini bar/strip club. Me and my bud spent like 20 bucks on a decent tea specialty and some tips.

I don't get karma. I'm just trying to help out OC redditors. 

EDIT2: I was just talking to the Purchasing Director and I guess they filled the Purchasing assistant job today. Sorry.

I recently posted a comment about my company having several job openings and got a few PMs about it so I want to start a thread to up the exposure. 

I'm not going to advertise the company name, but we're relatively small - you'd work alongside the Company President occasionally - and located in Central OC. We do gadget-type stuff so you should appreciate technology and electronics. 

Among others, we're looking for: Graphic Designer, Technical Writer, Upper Marketing Management, ~~Purchasing Assitant~~, Excel Badass with Mechanical Aptitude, Upper Engineering Management. All are normal business hours jobs.

Many are entry-level (the real kind not the requires 3 yrs exp kind). If you're interested, you can PM me. If you have questions that everyone should see, comment. 


If you know the company name, please don't post it. Kthx. ",,False,self,t5_2rd9x,True,,,True,t3_ofvvp,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/ofvvp/multiple_job_openings_in_central_oc_across_many/,

1) Hat game- put in 3 restaurants in a hat and let the lady pull from the hat.  Then 3 desert ideas and let the lady pull again.  Finally 3 locations like beach, park or cool lounge for a drink.  Makes the night random and fun.   
2) Beachcomber- great location but kinda pricey, even if you go for drinks, then go take a walk on the beach and watch the sunset.

This might have started as a protest against excessive use of force by police, but its true colors quickly shone through. 

I personally witnessed rocks, glass bottles, apparent  gang members flashing hand signs, individuals throwing street cones at passing cars and women and men attacking media cameras reporting at the event.

I'm now watching further coverage on the news and hoodlums have now destroyed the front glass of a Starbucks, with elderly women and men inside.

Whether or not the police used excess force on these recent shootings is still up in the air. Multiple sources have stated that the last individual stole a car, ran from police and shot at them. If this is the case, then there is more than enough cause to shoot back - but again, we don't know, and it's not our place to encourage vigilante justice. Let the courts and jury decide - we can't continue to encourage hoodlums from being our jury, justice and executioner. 

I've been noticing recently that the trend in this sub has blind hatred for the police. As citizens, we allot a certain level of authority to law enforcement. Whatever your feeling towards law enforcement is, you still must agree that is NOTHING ok with throwing glass, rocks, cones, or vandalism toward them. 

I truly challenge any one feeling that this sort of vigilante protest is accomplishing any constructive action to reconsider their perspective. This act of opportunism at its worst isn't helping any sort of change.

Are you a broke or budget-wise young gun? Let's create places to check out, Add-on please:

COSTA MESA

* La Cave | 1695 Irvine Ave, Costa Mesa, CA
&gt;Really cool basement steak(?) house by day, slick place to check out free indie/dj shows or themed dance parties (No cover ~10:30 on weeknights). Usually older young-adult crowd, rarely empty. $$ Drinks.

* Detroit Bar | 843 W 19th St, Costa Mesa, CA
&gt;Basic bigger indie/electro acts scene. Tickets are usually very reasonable at $7-15 depending on who/what's showing. Younger 20's crowd, can get packed. $$ Drinks.

Other places in CM to check out: The Commissary $$, MESA $$$&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


ALL DIVE BARS IN DOWNTOWN TUSTIN

&gt;Take your pick, the crowds pretty much similar (mixed bag, older, pool playing, chill) and so are the prices.  Strong pours, super-cheap drinks. I &lt;3 you DT Tustin.

* Swinging Door | 355 El Camino Real Tustin, CA
&gt;CHEAP drinks, even cheaper daily specials (not crap wells shots), great food (the days the chef is there), bartenders dressed risque, and cheap pool make this a favorite. Older/Mixed age crowd. Also great &amp; fast service. Please treat the ladies with respect. $.

DOWNTOWN SANTA ANA

* Santa Ana Art Walk | between Broadway Ave. &amp; Spurgeon St.
&gt;Cool stuff to see here every first saturday of the month. Free wine at shows...sometimez.

* Santora Building | 207 N. Broadway, Santa Ana, CA

&gt;Usually has something going on in all three levels. Things/rooms seem to always be changing hands here. Free comedy open mic upstairs last time I checked by some older couple, galleries splattered around, great food in any of the locations. If you're lucky you'll see someone performing near the entrance or galleries handing out free box wine. Just keeping it classy.

* Lola Gaspar | 211 W 2nd St., Santa Ana, CA
&gt;Cozy little eatery &amp; bar. Think classy young drunk siesta. Very cool patio/walkway seating, great food &amp; sauces, some rare drinks. $$.

* Chapter One | 227 North Broadway  Santa Ana, CA 
&gt;Same qualities as Lola Gaspar's but bigger &amp; more fiesta, they host a few live music performances, and do some interesting things to make cocktails. If you can, try to get an Agwa shot. Great discounts daily &amp; free/cheap tastings. $$.

* Gypsy Den | 125 N. Broadway Ave. Santa Ana, CA
&gt;A pretty good branch of the original Gypsy Den. Beer only. Great bakery &amp; coffee shop. Try to eat two of any desert (cheese cake is amazing), become diabetes. Free shows running occasionally. $$.

* Copper Door | 225 North Broadway  Santa Ana, CA 
&gt;Basement Beer Hall with pool. Has this modern german/spanish/morroccan feel to it, great place to get some fine imports. Love the Belgium selection. They tend to have free tastings once in a while and weekends always tend to require a cover because of some random act or two playing. $$

* The Crosby | 400 North Broadway  Santa Ana, CA
&gt;A DJ stage, classy name &amp; unique menu. Foodwise I prefer the setup at Lola G's or Chap1; but this place is no joke either. Packed like sardines on some nights. A DJ usually spinning whenever I go. Been too drunk to remember what day of the week that could be. $$

I just wanted to follow up on global meetup day.

It will be located at:
Irvine Regional Park
GROUP AREA 4
1 Irvine Park Road
Orange, CA 92869

One of our members has kindly outlined our group area in [this map](http://i.imgur.com/AY583.jpg)

Per park rules, **alcohol and drugs are NOT permitted on park grounds**

Parking costs $5, so please find a carpool buddy! We have plenty of people offering to carpool on our [Global Meetup Day spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmhmouDDcl62dFhPdC03UE9heWtxM1FtcnRpdmh0cFE#gid=0). I will also leave a comment below as an official carpooling thread.

There is a grill on site for those who want to cook - but we do
suggest that you bring grilling equipment if you have some just
because there are at least 5 Redditors who are planning to bring to
cook on site.


If you're still undecided on what to bring, we took a look at our sign
up sheet and found that we could still use more of the following:

* Coolers
* Ice
* Water (we'll probably need more than we think because it's going to
be a hot day and soda's going to dehydrate everyone)
* Disposable plates, utensils, napkins/rolls of paper towels
* Probably more disposable utensils
* Picnic blankets
* Umbrellas or something to provide shade
* Charcoal
* Propane
* Lighter
* Extra grilling equipment (just in case since there seems to be a lot
of people who are intending to cook on site)

If you have any more questions, please ask! We have some good dialogue happening at the [redditgifts meetup page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/orange-county-global-meetup-day/) as well as the [facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/377849685606156/) (you have to be a member of the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ocreddit/) to join the fb event).

There is a pizza challenge at Big Mama's &amp; Papa's Pizza where if a team of seven people can eat a 54 x 54 inch pizza in two hours, you win up to $1000 which you split up amongst the team. I think you only win $1000 if you eat it with only 5 people, which is crazy. You probably win less with 7 people. The team will pitch in money to buy the pizza which is $200. If we do this we'd probably have to practice. The amount of pizza you'd have to eat is 416 square inches or 2.7 large pizzas from Little Ceasars. A good strategy would be maybe drinking or blazing to get some munchies going on. But that has a risk of backfiring. We should probably get the least toppings as we can.

Sorry that it took so long to get this post typed up, as I've been a bit busy in the last couple of weeks.

Anyway, for those unfamiliar with global meetup day, hueypriest wrote a nice post about it here: http://blog.reddit.com/2011/05/june-25th-global-reddit-meetup-day.html

It looks like the general consensus for global meetup day is a beach bonfire at Corona del Mar. A few of us will arrive earlier in the day to stake out a fire pit for redditors' use. Everyone is welcome to join us for this part if you enjoy the beach during the day! 

The beach does close at 10pm so those interested in bar hopping can do so at that time. 

With that said, any help in putting this together is appreciated. Do you have beach chairs, canopies, or giant beach umbrellas that we could use? Could you fashion a giant reddit alien so we can all find each other? Can you offer to carpool? Anything to make a beach day and bonfire more fun for everyone! :)

Please RSVP on either the [redditgifts event](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-meetup-day-orange-county-ca/) and [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=203864656321551) to help gauge a headcount. We're also around on IRC if you just wanna chat.

See you guys on June 25th!

1360612421.0,44,self.orangecounty,18brwy,Electronic Music lovers: My SoCal calendar for shows in LA/OC/SD (x-post from r/LosAngeles),50,6,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/18brwy/electronic_music_lovers_my_socal_calendar_for/,"Hey! I know there are a a few of you out there who love electronic music as much as I do. I'm based in Aliso Viejo, which makes me nearly equidistant (time-wise) from both LA and SD, so I've put together a list of shows to help me keep all the stuff going on straight. This is something I ultimately maintain for myself, while constructive criticism is welcome. So before you click on the link below, please note the following about the calendar.

* Events are listed first by artist then by venue. I didn't bother putting in the event name (e.g. ""Havoc Thursdays"" or ""Low End Theory"") as I just wanted to put the basics of who &amp; where in the title. Also note that in most cases I just have the headliner in the event name.
* Where available, the event description has a link to buy tickets. In some cases the event was listed on FB so the link to the event page is there.
* I know there are a handful of event listings out there that kind of do the same thing as I've done. This format works for me because it's 1. calendar view, 2. shows events extending in the future. I have visited socal-raves.org and socaledm.org but if there's another listing I should know about, let's hear it!
* This captures MANY, but by no means ALL events happening in SoCal. I tend to stick to major venues like Exchange, Avalon, Yost, Sutra, Voyeur, and Fluxx although I know there's a healthy underground scene that socal-raves.org captures. To include every single event would make this far more crowded than it is.

I've been OC for a minute and have had an okay time in orange county as far as checking out clubs and bars. Anyone have some good ones that are hidden and have some amazing music. Most of the places I like to go to I judge by how good the music, how well priced the drinks are(i'm not in LA or looking for LA prices) and the kind of crowd that goes. I like to talk to people so I find it good for networking.

Some great places I've encountered with links:

Commissary Bar - Costa Mesa: [Commissary Bar](http://commissarystores.com/)
Great drinks and they play hip hop and funk for the most part but once or twice a week throw a club night...nice loungy feel. **It's pretty good on most nights, really good spot for local networking if you are an artist.**

Detroit Bar - Costa Mesa: [Detroit](http://detroitbar.com/) Right next to the bar below, great for going back and fourth since they are both small and different in vibes. This lounge has some really amazing shows sometimes and brings in some HUUUUUUGE names for the size of the venue. Modest Mouse, Diplo, and Talib Kwali just to name a few. **Check the schedule, this place can be a dud for sure!**

Avalon Bar - Costa Mesa: [Avalon Bar Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/avalon-bar-costa-mesa) Nice spot for casual drinks and a bit intimate...tons of hipsters (4 Dollar brown bag is right price for getting drunk) and every once in awhile they will pull a DJ or producer with some good music, usually just bands though. **Wednesdays...mostly a dive bar...bit of a rock and roll bar**

The Crosby - Santa Ana: [Crosby](http://thisisthecrosby.com/) Great spot to drink and they have some really legendary people roll by sometimes. Tons of great electronica and future beats (My Hollow Drum, Brainfeeder, Stones Throw, OBEY) **CHeck their calendar but usually wednesday - Saturday are sure fire shows! Good networking opportunities!**

Commonwealth Lounge - Fullerton: [Commonwealth Lounge](http://www.commonwealthlounge.com/) This place has some great music and acts, a very dead crowd on most nights though( I think all the hipster chic scares people ). I come here for the music, usually don't stay for the drinks or service though. Have made a complaint every time I go but like I said they get some real cool talent. **Thursdays and Saturdays great funk and house!
**

Envy Ultra Lounge - Fullerton: [Envy](http://www.envyultralounge.com/) Awesome spot, tons of great looking girls and a great crowd. Usually better around 11-2AM but they have some great drink prices. I definitely think this place needs more recognition they have 2 rooms and an upstairs VIP which is a nice change from all the OC Barness going on. **Wednesdays and Sundays are the best for electronica! House! Dub!**

XO Lounge - Westminister: [XO](http://www.yelp.com/biz/xo-lounge-westminster) Not the biggest, prettiest location - but they are trying to bring in the people and make it happen. And I have to support that. **Tuesday nights** is dubstep night and every other night its hot house night with a bit too many locals haha!

Kitsch Bar - Costa Mesa: [Kitsch](http://www.kitschbar.com/) I dig this bar because its loungy, small, a bit too dark BUT its got a dope happy hour from 8-10 that's like 2-3 dollar imports and 3 dollar wells. Dope right? They have a DJ but don't be too excited 'cause they don't pay their talent so its usually....not very talented. On sundays though you learn to DJ they have a dude teaching. Usually they play a lot of electronic/indie jams so you have that whole Postal Service thing going on. Great place to go before you hit up a good club or show.

MESA - Costa Mesa: [Mesa](http://juniper.nowsprouting.com/mesa/) This is a cool bar if you are looking to vibe and listen to some great electronic music and have that really nice L.A. vibe without all the BS. The music is good they have some really good DJs here that do some good mash ups and djing. Occasionally they bring in the punk/indie Japanese artists or other random out-of-country artists. Definitely check it out the deco is stylish. Fires burn between booths, waterfalls cascade near the bar and restrooms, and tons of lush greenery and wood table tops and bar chairs that finish the package. 



And then you have your clubs like Heat, Yost Theater, and Sharks Club but meh...never seen anyone that good there. Although YOST is pretty BOSS most of the time...it doesn't need my hype. I'll keep adding them as I remember... great places to meet people who know some really big underground parties (rooftops, warehouses, beach houses etc)

Lemme know what you guys have!!!

When we got him he was malnourished, had a heavy chain stuck to his neck and had open wounds. Over the past few months we have helped him reach a healthy weight, his wounds are healed, and he has turned into a lovable, happy dog.  

However, we are college students and as much as we would love to keep him, we knew that keeping him could never be a long term situation.  We cannot afford to keep a dog and we work too much to be able to give him the home he deserves. 

If anyone is willing to give him a permanent home or knows someone who would be able to give him a home, please let me know.   The time we are able to keep him is running short (we are moving into a strict no-dogs apartment complex within the month) and it would break my heart if we would be forced to surrender him to a shelter after all he has been through. 

He is a medium size dog, though I am not sure of his breed.  He knows basic commands and is great with people.  As long as we have had him, he hasn't played with other dogs, but on walks when he interacts with them, he seems to get along with them. I am not sure of his exact age, but from what we know he is around two years old. He has a fantastic temperament, is very very lovable, loves to cuddle, and is just an overall wonderful companion.  

EDIT: Hello everyone. I promised to update, and I am happy to say I can update with some great news. A really amazing person came to visit Oliver today, and Oliver is currently on his way to his permanent home. Oliver seemed to really like his new owner and I am so happy to know that Oliver will get a home that he deserves. It was actually a lot tougher than I thought it would be to see him go, but it brightens my whole day knowing that he will be well-taken care of and loved.

[SANDY; the dog I found in a Sand Trap](http://imgur.com/a/0JmJ0#0)

[UPDATED PICS OF SANDY](http://imgur.com/a/G4bXB)

I was out golfing with my wife on Saturday at a little municipal course in Santa Ana, California (Orange County area), and we came across a malnourished, stray pitbull/boxer mix?  

She was walking up and down the driving range, and people continued to hit as if they didn’t see her; she eventually laid down in a sand trap on the 10th hole...

I knew I had to help...

My initial plan was to just take her to a no-kill animal shelter… However, in trying to “capture” her, after 4 hotdogs, 1 bag of chips, and 3 hours, she would only get close enough that if I reached out as far as I could and she leaned in as far as she could, she could grab the little bit of food from my hand!

Anyway, I had already resigned myself to giving up as she finished up the little bits of the 4th hotdog; however, with nothing but a tied work tie in my hands, I walked up to her (as I had done time and time again) and for some reason this time, instead of running away, she just sat there and let me put the tie around her neck) 

I couldn’t take her to a no-kill shelter after that, especially how malnourished she was, because I was afraid she might not make it or might regret “trusting” me. 

Since bringing her home, she has only proved to be even more of a sweetheart!  I’ve looked for any reason or justification to take her to a shelter, but she’s been too good…

She asks to be pet, tries to cuddle up close to us, and follows my wife and I around like she’s known us forever; further, she plays well with my two other dogs, she’s housetrained, etc.  She’s also super mellow!

We took her to the vet on Sunday, and she’s not microchipped, and the vet thinks she was likely abandoned (after having puppies) and has been fending for herself for at least a month.  We looked in the area, posted pics on the internet, etc. and it doesn’t seem like anyone is looking for her.

We can foster her for a little bit, but unfortunately, we can’t keep her or offer any long term solution for her.

I was hoping Reddit might 1) know of some specific forums or communities that might be able to assist us, 2) know someone looking to get a dog and/or 3) be willing to share/ask your facebook friends, etc. 

Thanks so much, and any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. a bit more information, in case you were wondering or it helps you determine if anyone you know might be interested, pros and cons:

* Sweetest dog I have ever met (all she wants in the world is to be pet (and food)).
*  Loves my other dogs and plays well with them... They've even switched bowls mid-eating without so much as a growl!
*  She's really mellow, even though she seems very young... She can run and jump etc. but she mostly just likes to follow me around the house or lay in her doggy bed.  
*  House-broken... She whines when she needs to go outside... right now she likes me to wait outside with her, but she does her business on the grass.
* House-trained... Initially, she wouldn't even try to get on any furniture, beds, etc.  However, my dogs have no boundaries in the house, so she now will put her paws on the couch etc., but will drop down if you say no.  It's been hard not letting her sleep on the couch/beds, but we figure it will help her find a home. 
* Is smart... we've been calling her Sandy, and without training her, she's beginning to pick up her name... She's food-motivated and savvy, so I imagine she could be trained to do anything.
* Sleeps while riding in cars (the two times that we've had her in a car).
* I'm working on crate-training her, but she is a little cautious about going in still.
* She LOVES dry dog food; not that big of a fan of dental type bones...
* She's a pretty malnourished, but we're getting her healthier.  The vet gave her ointment for her ears (she had some scrapes on them) and anti-biotics to help her food transition.
* She lived on the streets, so while she's good, if you leave food, etc. on the edge of stuff, her survival reaction is to grab it... she's done this exactly once... I told her no.  She stopped chewing the chicken breast and let me remove it from her mouth!
* She is not spayed (but several agencies I’ve talked to said that if I find her a home, they will help with this cost; if not I am willing to pay for this procedure for her).
* She doesn't seem to know basic commands, but again, she seems very trainable.
* She pulls on a regular collar/leash.

Resumé and cry for help within...,46,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/hg3cc/if_i_dont_get_a_job_within_the_next_10_days_ill/,"This post is a plea for help with finding a job.  I feel really shitty that this is my first non-comment post on Reddit, but at this point I'm panicking.  If you or anybody you know might be interested in hiring me--a soon to be 25 year old guy living in Trabuco Canyon--please pass along my resumé.

I've been looking for a job for the last three months now and thus far haven't been able to get anybody to call me back.  I know my resumé isn't great but there's not much I can do about that unless I have another job to put on it.  I've had one interview at Sears (it was automatically scheduled at the end of the application process) and it didn't go well because the interviewer didn't seem to have a personality at all.  Anything I'd say was met with indifferent or completely disinterested stares.  

I quit my last job (the Yogurtland in RSM) on the first of January because my manager was making me work 8-11 hour shifts meant for two people all by myself without warning and with no extra compensation.  He would also not pay for overtime that I worked.  It got to the point where I was angry all the time and couldn't relax so I quit.  I felt much better for the first week or two but after that I've regretted it.  Since then I've been surviving off the last of my savings bonds and doing my Mom's yard work for 25 bucks a week.  Right now the deal is that if I can get a job before the end of the month my Mom will give me enough money for next month's rent as my birthday present. (June 9th)

EDIT: The resume looks much better now mostly thanks to gehzumteufel but google docs is screwing with the formatting when I upload it.  Job preferences are anything somebody will pay me for besides sex or hurting myself.  I can't take much pain and I doubt I'm very good at sex.

I realize that this is a pretty pathetic thing to do and I apologize if it bothers you, but at this point I'd rather take a boat load of negative internet points than not give this a try.

I have to make a trip to Florida this weekend. I'm leaving at 4pm this afternoon and my friend who was going to help me drive back backed out last night. There are 3 people going across the country(4 if someone from here joins us) and only me coming back. I need company and help driving back across the country from Tallahassee, FL to San Clemente(But I can pick you up/drop you off anywhere in the OC). I'm covering all gas and food for the entire trip and will throw $50 towards any one person who can go with me. 

Crazy I know asking a stranger to drive across the country with me, but I don't want to make the trip alone, nor do I think I could do it in the time frame that I have. I'm leaving today at 4pm and returning Tuesday the 5th in the AM.

So get a free cross country road trip.

Get $50.00

Possibly make a new friend

It will be at Corona del Mar beach and will be an all day event, at least until the beach closes at 10PM.

People keep asking where exactly at the beach we're going to be meeting, but the truth is, there's no way to tell until that morning until we've staked out a fire pit. We will try to have a reddit alien sign so that people can find each other. Otherwise, look for the pasty nerds hanging awkwardly standing around each other (I kid, I kid).

 I will post another update that morning once we found one, and will message those marked ""attending"" on Facebook with my phone number so you guys have a contact number. If you don't have a Facebook and need my number, feel free to message me here on reddit.

Regarding things we need, we still need people to bring more food and firewood. Any other beach-type gear would be great too (like water guns, sand buckets, etc.,) so we have various things to do. The spreadsheet is here: http://bit.ly/mmbOfV Also, **don't forget to bring sunscreen!!**

Other miscellaneous items we could use include a portable music player (radio reddit just released an iPhone app and we could use that as background music at the beach) and someone to take pictures! I will be bringing a camera but I kinda suck at taking pictures. I'm sure everyone else will be taking pictures, but if anybody wants to bring a high powered camera to take nice pictures, that would be great!

The spreadsheet mentions carpooling, but I think the best way to figure out carpooling would be in this thread so everyone can exchange phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc.

A useful tip someone posted about parking: 
&gt;I always head down Marguerite (off of highway 1) and park on Ocean. If you turn left onto Ocean from Margeurite, there is a ramp that will take you down to the far side of the beach (wrong side!). If you turn right, then you can park and walk down to the side of the beach with the bonfire pits. If you drive down the ramp, you will notice there is paid parking ($15) down there. If you're willing to pony up the cash, this is obviously the best. Street parking is my preference 9/10 times. Make sure you go right onto Ocean! Park after you see the road leading down to the beach. 

About alcohol: Unfortunately, the beach does not allow alcohol on property. If you guys are going to bring alcohol and sneak it while in your cars  or something, I am going to pretend like I didn't see you do that ;) We could also hit up the bars when the beach closes if people are still willing.

Included with this story from [OCWEEKLY](http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2013/02/todd_spitzer_dui_task_force.php?print=true) is and [INFOGRAPHIC](http://www.cmcdefense.com/images/drunk-driving-usa-data.jpg) with a lot of statistsics and ends with suggestions, but no mention of developing alternative transportion methods. Most DUI fatalities occur at night, so why does OC have little to nothing in terms on night time options? Many of the bus lines stop service by midnight and dont begin until 4 or 5 am. Sadly, none of these groups actually seem interested in deterring DUI's but more focused on the revenue that punishments bring in. 

Is Public Transportation even a viable option in Orange County? There's always talk of a light rail system but it never moves forward and the county continually cuts back on bus service. Metrolink is a joke but I use it as much as I can. Yes you can use a taxi but the rates are ridiculous, and thats if you can even get a taxi. Are residents even interested in this? I see two problems. 1. The county has no motivation to develop proper public transportation. 2. Using public transportation has a stigma to it and car culture is just too strong here.

**TL;DR:** If OC is really interested in stopping drunk drivers, why is public transportation so horrible?

Maybe I'm used to more laid back people, but I've had some bad encounters the few months I was here.  



For example, when I moved into my apartment, one of the neighbors downstairs came up at 9pm in his underwear and wifebeater brandishing a hammer.  He threatened to use it on me if I didn't keep the noise down.  Keep in mind, it was just me and I was just watching a little TV.



Second incident was when I was trying to find parking in an Albertsons parking lot last week.  Maybe I drove a little fast, but when I actually got in the store, some middle aged guy gets in my face about driving too fast in the parking lot.  He follows me around the store yelling at me and threatining to call the police on me.



Third incident was at the community pool.  There was a group of women with their children using the pool.  As I attempt to enter the pool, these women give me the dirtiest looks ever.  One of them even asked me if I lived in the complex.



Now I'm a nice guy.  I have a respectable job and have respect for other people.  But please tell me there is more to Irvine than this.  Is the whole county like this?  I understand the school district is the best in the county, but it doesn't give the right for the residents to act like self-entitled brats.  I'd rather stay in a city with a decent school system where the residents are more down to earth.  I'm not sure if raising my kids in his type of environment would be healthy for me or my kids.

Here's an album of the cats: [http://imgur.com/a/Tqde7](http://imgur.com/a/Tqde7)



A brief descriptions of the cats:


- Mickey, male, about 5 months old.


- Minnie, female, about 5 months old.


- Cupie, male, about 5 months old. 


- Delilah, female, about one year old and the mother of the kittens



All the cats are adorable, sweet, loving, playful, and affectionate. They love to cuddle and sit in your lap. We wish we could keep them, but apartments usually don’t allow that many cats and our living situation is about to change.



They are all spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and healthy.



Please contact us if you or someone you know are interested. If you know any rescues that would be open to having them at their adoption events or posting them on their website, that would be greatly appreciated.

I had posted earlier about how terribly hard it gets in OC to make new friends (maybe this isn't OC-specific, and more about being out of college, I don't know!) and got plenty of replies from awesome redditors who're willing to come along for a hike or a frisbee game or such. 

So can we have a hike some time? People of all ages, married or single, with or without babies, welcome! I really hope we all get to talk to each other and make atleast a couple of new friends.

In the best of OC in the sidebar, I saw plenty of great hike suggestions. So please throw in your suggestions if interested, and we can decide on a date/time. 

Also, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to post here or in the meetup website (I don't if I even can post there, since I'm not a moderator there)

Basically, anytime we can't decide what to eat, we pull out the list and start reading through it until something catches our appetites. Over the past couple years, I've compiled a list of places we like to eat. I posted it and found out there are a LOT of OC redditors around. People suggested that I share my list (that I have updated with suggestions from other redditors) to this subreddit.

The ones in red are my personal favorites. I thought some of you could use it, if anything to try new local places :)

Anyone up for food new food buddies?

[The list!](http://i.imgur.com/IkXAB.jpg)

**EDIT** Hey guys, Thanks for all your suggestions! I've added most of them to my list, some of them are a little too far to drive, but I'll definitely keep them in mind for when we have more time to go.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Cali during the late fall/early winter and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

She asked me to post a letter online and let people know.

Mother's letter:


I wanted to let everyone know about the experience I had with Janet Greene.  She was recommended to me by a relative, and as such I didn't do the proper background check on her.  My mistake.  I signed (a rather vague) contract with her for the estate sale of my mother in February 2012.

She was very attentive and knowledgeable while looking over the items from the estate.  She answered the phone when I called and she never was late for an appointment.  I had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong.  Janet called me at the end of March to tell me that she had sold off all of the items from the estate and that I would be receiving a check and information about the sale within 5 business days.  This all seemed fine because the contract stated that ""accounting shall be available within 5 business days of the completion of the sale"".  Janet had told me that the sum was approximately $3,000.  She didn't specify if that was the total sum of the sale, or if that was my cut of the sale after her fees.

That was when everything went wrong.  I waited patiently for the check to arrive.  I gave the post office time in case they were delayed.  After several weeks I realized something was wrong.  I called her many times in April to check she never answered her phone and she never returned a single voicemail I had left for her.  

At the end of April I contacted the police and they told me that they had no recourse.  They suggested that I sue in civil court.  I contacted my lawyer and was informed that the legal fees would likely total to a sum greater than the value of the estate  I decided that suing was an additional waste of my money and came to the conclusion that I just had a learning experience.

I do, however, want to make sure others out there know to avoid her at all costs.  She appeared to be legit but it was simply a bait and switch.  No matter who you use, make sure you take a full itemized inventory of everything being sold as well.  I failed to do that and cannot remember every single knick-knack that was sold.  Don't let yourself fall victim to this woman like I did.

They’re all sweet and affectionate and will cuddle up in your lap. The baby kittens are all up-to-date with their vaccinations, but none of them have been spayed/neutered yet. The mother has not been vaccinated, but she has been spayed and is in recovery.

We are asking for rehoming fees for each of them to cover the costs of food, litter, and the vaccines they have received so far. We can give you the name of an inexpensive vet that you can go to take care of the spay (about $57.50) or neuter (about $37.00).

Please PM me if you or someone you know is interested. Thanks!

Every year, the Roosters Foundation [runs a food drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLg-KwquBiA) that feeds underprivileged children and their families.  This year the food drive has grown so large, that we need help over two days in order to not only pack all the boxes of food, but prepare all the food so that the packing of the boxes goes smoothly.  **We need your help to pack food boxes** on Saturday, December 15th for prep of the food to be placed in boxes.  If you can't help in person, Roosters is a 501(c)(3) and we would love it if you could donate money to the cause by visiting our website. Donate $20, and you actually get to purchase one whole food box and put your name inside!  Any donation is tax deductible and Every little bit counts!  EDIT: There is no need to RSVP or Register beforehand.  If you have the time, feel free to just show up on either day. Here are the details:

Website for food drive/donation: *http://roostersfoundation.org/food/*

Number of boxes to be packed this year: *4000*

Number of people these boxes will feed: *32,000*, all of which are in Orange County

Date we need the most help:  Saturday December 15th 9 AM  (Not listed on website, but trust me, we need you here most!  This date isn't the best for families, for that volunteer Sunday!)

Date perfect for families/the actual food packing: *Sunday, December 16th, 8 AM*

Location: 
The Roosters Food Drive will be held at the Second Harvest Food Bank in Irvine

**Our trail:**

* Day: Sunday, September 25th 2011.
* Time: 9:00AM
* Trail: [El Moro Canyon/Crystal Cove](http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=BGS146-034)

**Information about the trail (Thanks to dekkerbasser!!!)**

$15 for daily parking per car (carpool cannot be stressed enough) Open from 6am - Sunset year round No dogs anywhere Bring some water (duh) Comfortable shoes
Okay, onto the trails themselves:
* The Rangers provide printouts of 3 different routes (easy, moderate, hard) 

* Easy: ~2 hours, gain 100-400' elevation, 3.5 miles Moderate climb for first 1/2 of mile or so (~30 minutes). Then you go downhill for the majority of the way down the hill. At the end, you have to climb just a bit.

* Moderate: ~2.25 hours, elevation 872', 5.5 miles Go downhill from the station, hit up a moderate hill for about 2.7 miles, youre then at 872'. Go down a moderate hill then back to the easy trail.

* Hard: ~5 hours, elevation &amp;gt;900', 11 miles Start like the easy, but continue going up to the top of the canyon. There will be a campsite where you can take a break and eat some food. Continue around the rim of the park, then descend. There is another campsite where you can eat.

Of course, those are not the only trails; there are a total of 16 different trails at Moro and many of them meet up at post-sites which also have maps which is quite convenient.

I wanted to update you on the status of our mission to KEEP the fire pits in Newport Beach. The city of Newport Beach has sent their permit request to the California Coastal Commission and there will be a meeting taking place to give a FINAL verdict on the matter on March 6th, 2013. I urge you, if at all possible, to be present at this meeting and let your voice be heard.

I have already been notified that NUMEROUS individuals from the opposition will be there to speak and the more time they get to plead there case the less of chance we will have to prevail.

If you can make it, or know of anyone that can be in attendance please show up. The meeting will take place:

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 6, 2013 at 8:30 AM PST

THE BAHIA RESORT HOTEL
998 WEST MISSION BAY DRIVE
SAN DIEGO, CA 92109 (415) 407-3211
*Phone number will only be in service when the meeting is in session*

Directions:
From Orange County Take the I-5 S 
Take exit 21 to merge onto Sea World Dr/Tecolote Rd
Continue to follow Sea World Dr
Merge onto W Mission Bay Dr via the ramp to Ingraham St/Mission Beach 
Take the ramp onto W Mission Bay Dr
Destination will be on the right

This will be your LAST CHANCE to be heard and to save the fire pits from permanent removal.

The Coastal Commissions' staff have put together the preliminary findings and their recommendation to the Commission is that the permit be DENIED to The City Of Newport Beach which is GREAT NEWS you can read the full report, which includes all 5,000+ signatures : 

http://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2013/3/W18b-3-2013.pdf

Some of you may remember us from the trainwreck of a thread we proudly created here on the subreddit last week. 

We'd like to thank r/OrangeCounty for all of the constructive feedback and trolling we received. Without you we'd probably still be floundering around trying to figure out which one of many reasons we weren't getting bookings. Now thanks to your input on more reasonable prices and more we've actually scheduled appointments. 

We've been working on this project for about two months now and were following a lot of advice around Reddit on how to approach things but not specifically within Orange County. Your responses to our site the day we debuted completely hammered into our brains plenty of useful information and edits we felt necessary to make immediately. 

Primarily, our prices needed to be adjusted quite drastically and we did so immediately, as seen here:

http://fastfriendlyspotless.com/what-we-do/

We originally were charging $119 for a 1 bedroom to give you an idea of how much we dropped the price.

Most of our other changes were design type issues such as drawing a little more attention to our booking button and other little things. 

In other news, after long discussion and quite the argument, we have decided not to re-debut our site as Fast Friendly Topless but we'd like to thank SquashBelly of Orange for the idea. 

On a final note we'd again like to offer Redditors a discount if they're interested in our services. You guys can use the code ""ThanksOC"" to save 10% on any cleanings you need.

If you have any more feedback, especially on local marketing channels, we'd very much appreciate it.

Thank you again,

Amar &amp; Darren

And realized that there are a lot of younger redditors and non alcoholic drinkers who would like to hang out, so let's get started

Purpose of this thread is to:
-Find places to meet up
-Create a good date/time to hang out
-coordinate carpools if some of you do not have a car.

So I'd like each of you to recommend a place, say which date is good for, and say if you need or can provide a carpool!

Thanks!

1369426237.0,29,self.orangecounty,1ezp30,"I hate to be ""that guy"" because I knows it been asked before, but me and my partner are moving to Orange County and I'm a little worried",40,11,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1ezp30/i_hate_to_be_that_guy_because_i_knows_it_been/,"So here's the deal, we're from Albuquerque, NM and my partner got a job transfer out to Irvine. I know absolutely nothing about the area and everything I've been reading and researching has me more than a little stressed out. 

I'm 27 and he's 28, we're not really club people or party goers. In fact we usually just like to chill at home. We're very mellow but do like to get out once in a while, which is something we struggle to do in Albuquerque.

He is in the process of interviewing for the transfer that seems most likely he'll get. I, on the other hand have no job lined up, though I'll be frantically looking once we get word he's accepted, because we'll have to be out there within a month or two.

**Housing** 

* I've been doing some digging and found that most people seem to be recommending Costa Mesa, especially for people working in Irvine and looking for cheaper rent.

* What's the average rent I can expect living out there for a 2 BR apartment? We don't need anything big or fancy, and somewhere where we won't get shot or stabbed would be nice, though we are from Albuquerque and guarantee most of our neighborhoods are way worse than anything out there. A laundry facility connected to the property would be ideal for me. 

* Anywhere else people would recommend? Anywhere I should avoid with concerns as to rent being too high, crime, or commute?

* Money is a slightly big factor, especially figuring cost of car travel.


**Jobs**

* Though my partner has a job waiting for him, I do not. I'll be applying for jobs like crazy but I know nothing about the job market. It seems the economy is a lot more stable out there than it is here, and there's way more jobs in the creative industries. 

* Would it be hard to find a job fairly quickly out there, and whats a ballpark I should expect to make a passable living wage?

* I have a Bachelor's Degree in Advertising and Art Studio (double major) and an Associates Degree in Graphic Design, plus about three years Graphic Design and Marketing experience. If anyone is interested, please PM me and I'll send my portfolio and resume.

**Travel**
I know there's going to be a lot traveling, but whats the realistic commute for most people? We both have cars, though mine is a bit older and I'm worried about all the driving.

**Stuff to do**
Like I said before, we're definite couch potatoes but it is nice to get out every once in a while. We like dive bars and occasionally gay bars. We love to eat (we're both big boys lol) so we'll be in dire need of good food, even though it looks like the first few months we'll be out there we'll be on a ramen diet. We love Vietnamese, Middle Eastern, BBQ, my bf could live off sandwiches, and I'd love to find somewhere Paleo friendly. 

Also what about the beaches? I hear they're very close, but are they recreational places or are they kind of nasty/dangerous. The only water we have out here is the Rio Grande which is pretty nasty, so that'll be a very welcome change for me.

**Etc.** I have a ton of other questions like good (inexpensive) gyms, amazing tattoo artists, where to get good coffee, tea, and beer, what the gay scene is like, is everything really that much more expensive out there or is it just rent, or anything else I should know.


Thank you OC redditors, I'm a bit overwhelmed with such a major life change, especially since I'll be at such a disadvantage with no job and no knowledge of the area.

**TL;DR** Strong possibility me and partner moving to OC in the next month or two. Know absolutely nothing about the area. In desperate need of places to live and work. What should I expect in rent and whats a decent living wage to expect? Having minor freak out.

1299226708.0,26,self.orangecounty,fx5k4,In response to the terrible bigotry in OC video: Let's do something about it. (A call for an organized counter-protest.),33,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/fx5k4/in_response_to_the_terrible_bigotry_in_oc_video/,"(Cross-post from reddit.com)

This is a call for action. This is a call for help.

I live in Irvine, a city in Orange County, California. This is 19.5 miles from Yorba Linda, where the awful sounds of confused souls spouted bigotry at innocent citizens on February 13th. Those voices will be heard again. I’m in a position to help speak louder, so damn it to hell, I am going to try.

People who follow the mass media will hear the louder voice. The louder voice, when repeated loudly and often enough, eventually becomes the popular consensus. The anti-Muslim rhetoric in this country is gaining momentum, becoming increasingly louder, and is repeated far too often for comfort. The Yorba Linda video isn’t a singular case or the beginning of something, it is simply one example.
Protests around the nation are organizing against the construction of houses of worship and community centers. There has been at least one case of vandalization in one’s construction. The citizens of Oklahoma recently found it necessary to pass an amendment banning the establishment of Sharlia law. This illustrates perfectly the terror many of the citizens of this country feel against a political boogeyman, the terrifying consequences and potential future consequences of that fear, and the millions of Americans suffering as a result.

Something needs to be done.

So this is a call for action. This is a call for a return to reason, a call for a more aggressive return to sanity, a call to make a difference by making your voice heard. If you truly believe in equality, and actually want to make a change, an anonymous upvote on the internet isn’t enough. Life isn’t virtual. Life is actually happening. And we need to actually do something if we want to make a change in the national voice.

I am not going to say, “First they came for the Muslims, and I did not speak out because I was not Muslim,” because that does not apply to me. I am mostly white, I was baptized Presbyterian when I was 11, and I am male. I am not going to be persecuted in this country in my lifetime. What I will say is, they are coming for the Muslims, and I choose to speak out because everyone has the right to follow his or her own path of self actualization. So please understand where I am coming from when I ask for your help. Perhaps you will be affected. Perhaps not. But this doesn’t matter. I feel solidarity with these poor souls for one reason and one reason alone: they are human, and so am I.

Let us make the first steps of a long commitment to ending hatred. Use this thread. Help organize here. Help organize beyond here. Let’s not let this be solely a Reddit thing, out of a sense of arbitrary pride. Let’s let this be something Reddit helped start. Tell your friends. Inform your school, inform your church, inform your synogogue or mosque or whatever atheist community you belong to, or anything in-between. It’s all the same when you believe in equality.

Let’s not let laziness or apathy stop us. It’s easy to “tsk tsk” something and go about on your daily routine. But if you actually believe you would have marched with Martin Luther King given the chance, if you actually believe you would have protested for women’s right to vote or for the abolition of slavery, this is your chance.
Let’s march in bigger numbers. Let’s let the rational voice snowball larger than that of hate.

Frightened people do terrifying things, often without knowing it. Let’s speak louder, and longer, words of encouragement. Words of comfort. Words of equality.

Help. Because it’s the right thing to do.

 fellow redditors of Orange County!

A group of friends and I are heading out to Huntington Beach on Wednesday 8-22 for some fun in the sun. Nothing big, just a handful of cars going right now, but if you guys want to come along, we can get a good group going on. We'll stay all day: swim, have a few drinks, relax, whatever we want to do, then have bonfire at night. I'm already taking friends/redditors from my school, so you would have to find your own ride or maybe carpool with another redditor. I live in the I.E. and that's mainly where our group is coming from, but I figure, ""Why not invite some Orange County redditors too?""

***This is not an OFFICIAL reddit meet-up (meaning not everyone going, reddits), but anyone is free to come along, as long as you want to have some fun, relax, and meet new people.

**So, who wants to have some fun???**

Or do I just say this is a cross post? But anyways,

There is this challenge at Big Mama and Papa's pizza in Burbank where if your team of 8 eats a 54 x 54 inch pizza in two hours, your team will win 1000. If the team splits the cost of the pizza and winnings, each team member will take home $93.75. Not bad, considering you're getting paid TO EAT PIZZA. The amount of area in a 54 x 54 inch pizza is 2916 square inches. A large Little Ceasar's pizza is 153.938 square inches. That means each of us we would have to eat 2.36784 large Little Ceasar's pizzas in two hours to win. This is possible guys. Not to mention I'm down to get extremely high and even a little drunk before doing this.

Here is a video of a team of six completing the challenge in less than an hour. Never mind the fact that they are competitive eaters.

It has now been over 24 hours since our event ended, and I'm still super happy about how everything turned out. I'm sunburnt, exhausted, and I'm still finding sand everywhere, but it was all so worth it for such a great event. Thank you for showing up and having a great time. Thank you for bringing food, sustenance, and ""apple juice."" Thank you for those who brought board games (apples to apples!) and other beach activities. Thank you for being patient and waiting with us despite our initial lack of firepit. 

To those who showed up to their first meetup ever: Thank you for tearing yourselves away from the computer for a day and forcing yourself to see the California sun. To those who have regularly showed up to previous meetups: thank you for not being sick of us yet and showing up again :) I met so many wonderful, amazing people yesterday and it's impossible to keep track of who was who. Again: thank you thank you thank you.

I have a feeling I'm starting to sound absolutely redundant and like a bimbo pageant queen winner, but I truly am grateful for everything and everyone yesterday. It was an amazing day.

**For those wondering about our next meetup:**

Please, if you are interested in any meetup whatsoever, **just organize one!** It's relatively simple. Just tell people to show up at a place and time, and people will show up. Advertise on our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_108884965846148), subreddit, and tell our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-oc).

Speaking of IRC, we do have our own channel on freenode under #reddit-oc. If you need do not have a chat client or have no idea how IRC works, your best bet is to [use the web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-oc). Otherwise, feel free to ask how. It's a great way to chat, keep in touch, and get to know your fellow OC Redditors.

Can't wait to see you all again at our next event!! :D

They took video in May of 2012 and saved it for the night before booth sales opened across southern California to make sure they had the most negative impact. Why would anyone want to hurt our scouts? And they way they told the story, it was just so bad with all the incorrect implications.

First, an fyi to put it into perspective... 1,100 cases of GS cookies were destroyed after the sale last year in San Gregonio. Our troops in two small cities alone sell more than 5000 cases in a sale. In Orange County, we sell more than 225,000. So though it sounds like a lot, it's small compared to the totals.

At the end of the sale, the Council is allowed to return a small percentage that remains unsold. So they did. If they kept them, they would have to pay for them and that's money away from the girls. So they turned them into the bakers, who disposed of them. NOT the Girl Scouts (like the news story implied), the bakers.

Well because of food laws and sue crazy people and the cookies changing hands, those cookies were destroyed and not donated. I agree it would be better to have donated them. But to imply that GS just trashes cookies for no reason is so very wrong. In Orange County we donate thousands of cases each year. And this wasn't even in Orange County! You should know that all the money from Cookies stays in our county.

From information that Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio has shared, their council returned 1,100 cases to a warehouse in Riverside at the end of last year’s cookie program. Once those cookies were accepted by the warehouse, they belonged to ABC Bakers, which has a contract with that facility to store, distribute and dispose of cookies designated for Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio. ABC Bakers directed the warehouse to destroy the cookies as once cookies had left their control they could not be donated due to food safety concerns.

This television coverage is unfortunate given the thousands of cases of Girl Scout cookies donated each year to food banks and the military through our Cookie Share community service project. Girl Scouts of Orange County has not returned cookies to ABC Bakers which have later been destroyed. We work closely with our volunteers, our girls and ABC Bakers to put into action the very skills girls learn through the cookie program, like goal setting and inventory management. The small quantity of unsold cookies we had at the end of last year’s cookie season were donated by our council to the Second Harvest Food Bank.

TLDR: CBS tells a sensationalized and skewed story to hurt Girl Scouts!",,False,self,t5_2rd9x,False,,,True,t3_18mr31,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/18mr31/girl_scouts_getting_wrongly_slammed/,

Global meetup day was amazing and I just wanted to do another round of thank yous to everyone who contributed in making the event a successful one. 

Thank you so much to peppermintoreo, who picked up where I left off in terms of organizing when I got too busy at work and too sick to pull it together. Thank you to all the barbecue grill masters who made the amazing food. Thank you to everyone who brought food for sharing, and those who pitched in what they could to help cover the cost of the park fees. 

I hope you all had a great time and got to meet some amazing people in this wonderful community that we have. 

I also wanted to thank laaabaseball for all the work he does keeping up this subreddit! He may not reside in orange county at the moment, but without him, we wouldn't have such a smooth running subreddit! He is the one responsible for the CSS and has done a great job of keeping all of the spam out of r/orangecounty. 

Lastly, redditgifts has mentioned user trophies for those who are in pictures for global meetup day.

I find it very interesting that a lot of people, not everyone, have a really strong negative opinion about Santa Ana. Some people don't even step foot in it because they say you will get shot!? People call it a war zone? Seriously? I just don't get where the hate comes from.

I *would* understand the hate if this was the 80's and 90's when Santa Ana had 80 homicides a year, but the City only has an average of 11-13 homicides now! It was even ranked 4th safest big city according to Forbes! There is a ton of redevelopment going on, downtown is looking fantastic, and is one of the only cities in the county that has any character! What the heck dude!?

Looking through a few websites, these are some of the things I have found:

1) Probably the biggest and most important is the dramatic decrease in crime. According to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/egim45edhe/4-santa-ana-calif/), Santa Ana is the fourth safest (large city &gt;250k) in America.

2) Its revitalized downtown. Cleaned up. Artist Village with an amazing [Art Walk](http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/OCfountain_Evan%20Senn.JPG). New bars, restaurants, stores. New housing! And it will soon feature Orange Counties tallest building. A 497ft tower called [One Broadway Plaza](http://silostudios.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/one-broadway-plaza-196x270.jpg) . And don't forget the new [light rail](http://santaanatransitvision.com/index.html) that is being planned.

3) [Complete Streets](http://www.santa-ana.org/santaanainmotion/completestreets.asp) movement initiated by the city. Pretty much emphasizes bikes, pedestrians, and mass transit. Any city that is gentrifying today has hipsters on bikes, hehehe.

4) The [Bristol Street Widening](http://www.harris-assoc.com/nu_upload/Image/Bristol.jpg) . A project that started in the mid 1990's and is about 70% done. A MASSIVE undertaking.

5) Projects that prove gentrification: [MacArthur Skyline](http://www.execustay.com/furnished-apartments/santa-ana/skyline-at-macarthur-place/property-photos/SantaAnaFurnishedApartmentExterior-433x500.jpg) .

Even if you’re ridiculously busy, ANYONE can get in touch with their Members of Congress and have their opinions heard. I’ll start with the easiest. In general, you want to get in touch with the Washington, DC offices of your Members as that is there legislative issues are generally handled.



**PHONE CALLS**


Phone calls normally take just a few minutes, even if you have to wait a while to get a human being on the phone due to high call volumes (fairly typical of Senate offices or anyone high profile).


When you call, have the name of the proposed legislation and bill number ready. House bill numbers start with “H.R.” or “H.Res.” Senate bill numbers start with “S.” When someone answers the phone, just say “I’m calling to oppose/support [insert legislation here] [insert bill number here].”


 If you want to give a specific reason why, give it, but keep it short. The first person who answers the phone is typically a staff assistant (lowest paid person the totem pole) or an intern, and unless they’re a supreme idiot or have been authorized to speak on the issue (highly unlikely), they will not be able to engage you very much.


The most information they will ask of you is your zip code - this is to find out if you’re a constituent living in their district. You are welcome to provide more information if you would like to get a letter or email in response to your opinions or concerns.


So what happens to this information? Well, it gets tallied up and is given either to the Chief of Staff, press person, or whoever is in charge of knowing what people are calling in about. Easy-peasy. Admittedly, offices that have very safe districts (little to no competition come election time) don’t really bother with doing this.


I also cannot emphasize it enough: BE POLITE TO WHOEVER ANSWERS THE PHONE, NO MATTER HOW STUPID YOU THINK THEIR BOSS IS. Most Congressional staff are overworked, underpaid, and normal labor laws do not apply to them. Be kind.


I saw a Reddit post that encouraged talking to the Legislative Correspondent (LCs) or Legislative Assistant (LAs) who work in the issue area. If you're living in a district with a small constituency, you could probably do it. Senate office or anyone high profile, it will probably be very difficult. LAs and LCs typically do legislative research all day long on top of meeting with lobbying groups, organizations or other government officials. If you want to take this route, prepare to be patient.



**WRITING YOUR CONGRESSMAN**


Writing your Congressman will not only engage him or her on an issue but solidly puts on you on record on where you stand. 


RESIST THE URGE OF USING EXISTING TALKING POINTS OR A FORM LETTER. If you send a form letter, you’ll most likely get a form letter back. You get more or less what you receive.


Keep your letters concise, specific, and under a page. Please note that all sealed, paper mail sent to Congress is irradiated and delays receipt by two weeks. If you insist on sending something on paper, drop it off at your local Congressional office. If you want to put it in an envelope, KEEP IT UNSEALED. Trust me, they take biological threats sent in the mail very, very seriously.


Here’s the secret if you REALLY want someone in an office to look at your letter: address multiple issues. Seems counterintuitive, but let me explain how Congress works...


Each Legislative Assistant (LA) in a Congressional office specializes on a limited of issues. For example, one might specialize in Education &amp; Labor and Judiciary issues, and another will do Environmental and Armed Services issues. They will take a look at all correspondence that relates to their issue areas because they need to know what constituents care about.

So if you write a letter with concerns in multiple issue areas, you're likely to get more than one person who's going to look at your letter and they will customize it to answer all of your questions. Custom, multiple-issue letters like these also almost never go out unless they're reviewed by the Chief of Staff or a press person.

Our biggest problem right now is that we do not have enough people signed up to bring food, drinks, and to carpool! As much as I like the idea of a party with nothing but desserts, cookies, and cakes, we should probably get some actual entrees in and probably some booze to facilitate socializing. 

Carpooling would be great too, because we will most likely have to pay for a guest parking pass at UCI. Anybody who has ever parked at UCI ever knows that their security has nothing better to do than to issue parking tickets, so we really want to avoid that this time.

The sign up sheet [can be found here](http://gkurl.us/ocssanta). Please [RSVP](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/reddit-chrismakwanzhukaavus-white-party/) and sign up!

I was thinking we could do this end of this month, or beginning of May, so that I give everyone some time to make the necessary arrangements. It would be on a Saturday though, that way no one is fighting major traffic.

Would anyone be interested in having a meetup at a local bowling alley? Lake Forest lanes has pretty good deals for midnight bowling. Saddleback Lanes are alright and I've never been to Irvine Lanes. Suggestions are welcome.

~~EDIT: It seems like Linbrook is the way to go. Later tonight I'll look into it more thoroughly and try to set a date. I'm thinking on a Saturday in the next couple of weeks. ~~

EDIT: Lets go for Saturday October 15th at Linbrook Bowling Center in Anaheim. Rates for evening bowling (6pm-2am) are $5 per person per game and $26 per hour. Shoe rental is $3.75. The lanes are first come first serve, so if any of you Fullerton redditors want to get there earlier and get a few lanes, that would be great. Lets shoot to get there around 8. I'm driving up from the Mission Viejo area and willing to rideshare. Lets do this! XD

I live in Irvine, and if I get enough people interested perhaps we can meet in a startbucks or coffee shop. If enough people are interested, I'll create a document that explains how to use all 3 pieces of software: ubuntu, tor and truecrypt.

Ubuntu: linux operating system with a very nice graphical user interface.
Tor: Lets you browse anonymously over the internet. Uses others' volunteered connections as relays to pass data so your identity is not found.
Truecrypt: Lets you encrypt files in your computer with very strong encryption. It also allows for 2 passwords in case you are compromised and you need to give away one that opens dummy data you add or an empty directory.

I work for Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County - a member of Feeding America. We are currently engaged in a voting contest, of which the top 40 participants will receive $45,000. We are a food bank that provides food to those in need in Orange County, California. The money would be used to expand our Mobile Pantry program, specifically to work with more schools in Orange County. Our Mobile Pantry program sends a huge truck filled with food (a lot of fresh produce and other good items) to a location where the community can line up and walk through to receive bags of food for free. Many people think of Orange County as being an affluent area that doesn't deal with food insecurity, but I'm here to tell you that this is not the case. With your help, we can reach more people that are in need.

The contest is being hosted on facebook and if you click on this link: https://apps.facebook.com/walmartlocal/?applet=hunger&amp;organization=64

It will take you directly to the page where you can vote for us. If you end up poking around on there, or our vote page doesn't show up for some reason, you can search for us on there by zip code: 92618, or by name: Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County. The Orange County part is important, as there are other Second Harvest Food Banks.

Finally, people can vote every day in April, so I hope that you'll return to the site and vote for us again and again as April continues. If you live in the Orange County area and are interested in volunteering please check out our website: www.feedoc.org

Thank you all, it is through the efforts of people like yourselves that we can change things for the better.

[Link to Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/19eijj/i_know_this_is_crazy_but_anyone_want_a_free_trip/)

So I never did find anyone who wanted to jump in the car with 3 strangers and embark on a crazed 5 day adventure across the grand old' US of A. Below will be the timeline of crazy shit and adventures that have happened on the way. Check back for future updates.

First off there are three people who are in this adventure, me, a Co-Worker and my Father. I'll refer to myself as Toxi,  My Father as RasT, and my co-worker as Ash.

I'll do my best to update this when I stop while driving back across the country but I'm not positive how often I can. I'm sure I will be dead tired.

Thursday 2/28/2013
 
14:30 RasT left from Oceanside heading north up the 5

14:45 Someone drives off the onramp on the Ortega causing CHP to have to shut down the on and off ramps for Highway 74. I'm waiting at my girlfriend’s house in SJC so the only way for him to get to me is to go through Dana Point.

15:45 Traffic was hell he finally arrives, I throw my shit in the car and we leave

16:00 - 18:00 we make our way north up the 5 drudging through the horrible rush hour traffic heading north to Diamond Bar to retrieve Ash.

18:20 Ash loads in and we set off.

18:25 the start of the troubles. RasT puts his headphones on as Ash passes out. I figure I should put mine on and reach behind me to grab them. I grab them pull them out of the floorboard then I notice the cable to be stuck. I give it a small tug and the cable comes free. But in my horror there is only one plug left on the end of the cable. Oh God... being a headset there are two plugs one for the Headphones one for the Microphone. Guess which one is left...yup you guessed right him one for the Microphone. So to start the trip off my $100.00 pair of headphones that I bought the week before is gone.

18:30-19:00 Find the closest Best Buy which is in Victorville, run in side grab a pair of Sennheiser HD280's and run out.

19:00-20:40 Drive till I see we need gas, pull off and see a Costco. Pull in start pumping while RasT checks the oil on the truck. Note all the pumps were taken so I pulled up with the filler on the side away from the pump so I have to stretch the hose over the roof. But since we are in an Isuzu Rodeo the tailgate opens in two steps, one is the glass rises and two which isn't important. So anyway the hose slips down under the glass so that it can't close but RasT does not notice this.  As I'm pumping gas he finishes with the oil and hurries back around to close the gate and get back in the warm car. He reaches up pulls the glass down just as I look up and see the hose. I yell and the glass pinches the hose which causes the rear window on our only transportation across the country to shatter into thousands of tiny little pieces..... We haven't even made it to Barstow yet....

21:00 we decide to continue on regardless and just find a store to buy a tarp. So we rush over to the nearest bigots, I run in and grab a tarp, duck tape, and bungiecords. Meanwhile RasT is outside on the phone with the insurance seeing if there is a place along the way where we can get the window replaced. I get back out side wake Ash who was asleep through this whole thing up and get him to help me attach the 15'x40' tarp to the back of our little SUV. Just as we unfold this huge thing all the way RasT informs us that there is a place here in Barstow that is open 24 hours and can replace our window. Sweet, so I run back inside 5 minutes before closing with a huge tarp unfolded in my hands and returns it.

You should have seen the look this cashier gave me.

21:20 we arrive at said glass place deep in Barstow, just to find out that the insurance company lied and they actually do not have the window in stock nor can they get it in for over a week.

Well Shit, we said fuck it and just head out.

Friday 3/1/2013

00:00-18:00 - We drove and drove and drove. Got from Flagstaff, AZ to Ft. Smith, AR. Not much happened at all during this time. We ate some food, pissed some piss, froze our ass off and decided to buy a Tarp to duck tape on over the hole where the back window should be. I can't even tell you how many fucking times I pulled off to fix that fucking tarp. 

Worst. 

Idea.  

Ever. 

Ended up taking it off and just packing the luggage up in the back enough to keep most of the wind out. But it really is freaking beautiful driving down the 40 though the north of all of the desert states. It's amazing how beautiful snow in desert/plains is. I wish I didn't do all the daytime driving so I could have taken more pictures.

18:00-00:00 I power down and sleep in the back of the car.

01:00 we pull over to get gas I wake up and get out of the car to notice that I seem to have lost my left shoe. I get out it's snowing my feet stick to the ground. Feelssobad.jpg 

01:00-06:00 I sleep more since when I get to Florida I have to hop in another car and drive right back across the freaking country. 

07:00 I decide to start typing this.

09:00 Got to my Great Aunts house to see my grandfather who I haven't seen in a few months. I knew he wasn't doing well but after getting there he stood up and fell down hurting himself. EMS was called and he is now in the hospital. God damn this trip has been fucking crazy!!!! 

10:00 now we are heading to our end destination of Tallahassee, FL. The shit capitol of Florida. Have a huge list of things to get done today. But I will update again when leave Tallahassee and start heading towards the other side of the world.

12:00 Arive in Tallahassee and it’s fucking coooooooooold. Head over to pick up my car afraid that it may be looted, stolen, tagged, or whatever.(I left the car in a bad neighborhood where my friend lives.) but amazingly I pull around the corner and see it sitting there looking classy as always, a good bit dirtier that when I left it last year. Hop in the car stick the key in and it starts right up! Been sitting a year no need to jump it off or anything, man I love Volvo’s!!!

14:00 Go get the rest of my shit done and get ready to leave

16:00-21:00 Arrive at my favorite aunt’s house and sit down and start talking. Before I know it the night is upon me and I must stay over. I didn’t want to do this but it will help me last longer the next day.

03:50 Shit. I overslept 3 hours than I wanted to. Get all my shit together, make a cup of tea and head the fuck out of Tallahassee. 

06:00 Picked up my best friend to hang out with him for a while, and ran over to wal-mart to get the oil on the car changed. Droped the car off at the tire lube express place thing, handed my keys over, and went inside to pick up some food for the trip and a SD card for my camera.
 They quoted me 20 minutes to change my oil.

06:35 Show back up at the TLE and ask if my car is done, they say it will take just a minute more and ask me to sit down. I do and start chatting it up with my buddy.

07:20 Finally the guy pulls my car out and brings me the keys. I go to the counter and the lady can’t find the paper work. She calls the guy in and asks him where it is, this is exactly what he said “We ain’t go no filta for that weird car can’t doet jus sen him on his way.” I’m frustrated at this point wasting nearly a hour and a half just for nothing to happen. They should have told me this before I even dropped my car off with them, or paged me so I knew that I could leave. I went outside and hopped in the car when I thought I should check the oil. Guess what. NO FUCKING OIL IN MY GOD DAMNED CAR. I went right the fuck back in there and asked them why the fuck they drained my oil out of my car then drove it around the building…….They said that the car had no oil in it when I brought it in. But yet I just drove it over 200 miles with out it making a single noise. I demanded to talk to a CSR who gave me a free jug of oil to put in my car. I got the mechanics name and information from the CSR incase they caused any damage pulling my car around with out oil in it. Fuck the south, Fuck wal-mart.

07:50 Dropped my friend off and headed out on the road to California.

**UPDATE 03/03/13 04:41**

12:08 Arrive in Alabama pull off, gas, food, update this.

15:06 Pull off in Shreveport, MS to try and get a oil filter for my car. Checked 5 different parts stores none of them have one……how is it that it is impossible to get a oil filter for a 1984 Volvo 244?!?!?!?!?!

15:30 I left you a present you fucking Volvo hating state!

16:30 See sign saying 45 miles to New Orleans, face palms and realized that he could have Creole food instead of a stupid burger :/

20:00 Finished crossing Louisiana, stopped at truck stop to take a nap in the car.

[My hotel for the night]( http://i.imgur.com/BeYYpPL.jpg)

20:00-03:30 Slept like a baby.

04:35 After drinking my first cup of tea I decide to pull off and get gas/breakfast. It’s amazing how strong the wireless transmitter at the Holiday Inn across the interstate is! I’m about half a mile away and I get 4 bars while sitting inside of a waffle house. As a network engineer I want to know what transmitter they have!

04:45 Heading out across Texas, all 12 hours and 880 miles of it.

**UPDATE 03/05/13 20:07**

04:45-13:00 Bored bored bored, driving, driving, driving. Man do I fucking hate texas

13:00 Hit my muffler on something and it rips off my entire exhaust system. So. Fucking. Loud.

13:45 I purchase a new muffler from Autozone and put it on with one of those crappy U-Clamp things. 

18:15 New muffler falls off :|

21:00 Now deaf and extraordinarily tired I pull off for some sleep at a Loves rest stop again. But only sleep for about an hour.

22:00 I wake up again and start driving. Just to realized how tired I really was. I drive from where I was to the end of Texas. I stop at the New Mexico welcome area and pass back out for another 6 hours.

Tuesday 3/5/13

04:00 Wake back up and hit the road. 

06:00 Eat food at the awesome TtT truck stop. Gotta love Omar's Hi-Way Chef.

06:30 - 12:30 Drive, drive, drive.

12:30 Eat more foooooood

14:00 Reach my destination and man what a fucking crazy annoying wild trip it was.

Please, Reddit I really need this community's help.",27,6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/s8a4i/600_reward_and_eternal_brotherhood_if_you_snap_a/,"Some details are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/s4xc8/can_anyone_recommend_a_private_investigatorbounty/) in an earlier post but here's the short version:

I leased a 2011 Volkswagen CC. Never used it. Decided to loan it to someone for 4 months until I was ready to move away from Los Angeles to make a little extra cash. The guy stopped paying when I asked for its return. Blocked my calls. I went through the materials he provided me, i.e license scan, insurance card scan, old credit report—all useless. Expired. Old addresses, etc.

Our agreement was all over email and texts. Police say they can't report it stolen, and I get the sense that he wants me to try to report it stolen so he can ""sue me for damages."" My lawyer tells me there's grounds for this. (I can go in to more detail here, but it's really moot, I've been up and down the police road with this)—they, both the police and my lawyer, advised me to find a PI/repoman/bounty hunter to track the guy down with the limited information I have and to just take the car back since I have a spare key and it's registered in MY name.

So I started looking for PIs and bounty hunters until someone suggested that maybe I use the many eyes of reddit to also be on the look out for the car. Using Spokeo I have several possible addresses, and I'm going to post in all relevant sub-reddits in East Los Angeles, Orange County (somewhere he he made reference to in the past), San Francisco, San Ramon (where a 2-year old address and address on his checks is), Alhambra and Las Vegas.

The car has no license plates. But he's driving it around. I'm going to post pictures of it, but you can also google what the car looks like. In place of license plates it has VOLKSWAGEN OF VAN NUYS plates on it. **The car has scratches/scuff marks on the left front bumper where I accidentally hit my garage turning in.**

If you see this car somewhere, please take note of the address. Snap a photo of the car. And get back to me. 

Reddit, not only will I make good on this reward, I will be personally indebted to you for life. I can't eat right. I can't sleep right. I wake up in the middle of the night with a tight, buzzing ball of stress in my stomach and I sit there, heart pounding in my chest till I can fall asleep again. This is a nightmare. I'm responsible for anything this guy does with the car. I've already paid 2 parking tickets. And god forbid he hit someone, or kill someone. Please help me.

Additionally I have all supporting documents for anyone who is suspicious of me. My lease. My license. I can screen grab my account page with volkswagen with my name on the lease. And if we do find my car, I'm happy to make the first stop after picking it up, the police station so they can verify that it is indeed my car. I'll leave you with this, the words this bastard texted me when I told him it was clear to me he was stealing my car and I was going to the police: Good luck.

**TL;DR:** 9/10 of law. I loaned my car to a con-man. He disappeared. Police can't report it stolen. Lawyer can't serve a man with no confirmed address that we can't find. My only hope is to find my car in the wild. Take it back with my spare key. The guy has taunted me and wants me to report it stolen so he can sue me for damages, since the law is on his side with respect to it not being legally classified as theft. Help. I'll give you money, admiration, heaps of love and eternal gratitude and become your lifelong brother like Dae Han in Best of the Best.

While you're there, have a look around and download an app or two! I do realize that the link for photos of my cats is broken; I let my pro Flickr account lapse and the link to get to that set is no longer available. If there's enough demand, I'll put them up on Imgur instead and maybe tell some stories about Pascal. Also, I'm going to dig out more comics later so if you've only donated but something I put up catches your eye, it's yours. 

Fair warning right now -- sad pet story coming up. 

Hello! 

I'm cleaning house and finally getting rid of some of the comic books I've amassed over the years as we need the room. I don't think I can sell them for anywhere near what I had paid for them so I'm going to try an experiment and offer them up to my fellow OC Redditors using a ""pay (almost) what you want"" model for them. This is what I managed to dig up so far: 

* Fables 1 - 23, 30 - 56, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_(comics)
* Panku Ponk! 1 - 6, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panku_Ponk
* Neil Gaiman's Eternals 1 - 5, http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/25/the-reread-reviews-eternals-neil-gaiman-john-romita-jr/
* Elektra: Root of Evil 1 - 4, http://www.comicvine.com/elektra-root-of-evil/49-9541/
* Legends From Darkwood 1 - 4, http://www.antarctic-press.com/html/version_01/store.php?id=Legends+From+Darkwood
* Battle Angel Alita: Last Order 1 - 6, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Angel_Alita:_Last_Order
* Bite Club 1 - 6, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite_Club
* 1602 2 - 8, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_1602
* 1602 New World 1 - 3, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1602:_New_World

Regarding the Fables collection, I'm pretty sure I have 24 - 29 somewhere but they might be buried in a different part of my closet so if you get that collection and I find the missing issues (or any others), I'll mail them to you at my expense. 

Now, the conditions for getting your hands on these comics: 

* $1 minimum for any set except for the 1602 titles which I would consider as one set. 
* No picking and choosing of individual issues; you have to take the whole set. 
* Keep in mind that any money I get from this will help out with vet costs (see below). 

Now, the sad pet story part: 

[Meet Pascal](http://imgur.com/fqJtMnyh)

She was my cat for a good 8 years and absolutely loved me. She would often greet me when I came home by flopping on to her side and rolling around so that I would rub her belly and whenever I went to bed, she'd hop up onto my chest and rub my face with hers before plopping over on her side and settling for the night. She was also a huge brat and would do things like drag out her favorite toy and meow pitifully at us with it in her mouth until we paid attention to her, at which point she would promptly lose interest in playing. Oh, and if I caught her doing something bad, she would immediately run to the bedroom, lay down on the bed, and then pretend she had been there the entire time. [Here](http://imgur.com/ZOlIkbxh) is her ""Oh crap"" face as she tries to nonchalantly pass off the fact that I just caught her counter-surfing. 

A couple years ago, we found a lump on her side which was eventually diagnosed as [vaccine-associated Sarcoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine-associated_sarcoma). My wife and I spent $4-5k on vet bills to try and save her but ultimately decided to let her go. 

* [First night after her surgery where we had to lock her up in the bathroom because instead of being listless and have little to no appetite, she was ravenous and running around like a lunatic](http://imgur.com/RIj2Hrx)
* [Pathetic meowing woke my wife up at 6am. Note the position of the left leg](http://imgur.com/oOMZ23D)
* [Enjoying the day despite being stuck in the Cone of Shame](http://imgur.com/ePOI4eB)

Unfortunately, we're not the only one that misses her as Pascal also had a brother. [This](http://imgur.com/OZR2EM9) is Darwin. He misses his sister terribly too:

* http://imgur.com/5mXnk2Y
* http://imgur.com/d6WYN0z
* http://imgur.com/nDywXgZ
* http://imgur.com/lSE6QUt

He's also been rather lonely as of late, walking around the house meowing and trying to find Pascal so any money you give me for these comic books will go to helping me financially recover from trying to save my cat from cancer and/or go towards getting a new companion for Darwin. Every little bit does help and while there's not much in the list right now, I have at least a couple decades worth of issues in my closet so if this goes well, I'll dig more of them out. Off the top of my head, there's Lucifer (Vertigo), Oh! My Goddess (Dark Horse), Blade of the Immortal (Dark Horse), and more!  

If you're interested, PM me and we'll work something out. I live in Irvine near Irvine Valley College. 

To close off my wall of text, I give you a couple of my favorite pictures of Pascal:

My friend's brother brought home a dog that his boss apparently didn't want anymore.  Fast forward a year later - the wife is nagging him to give the dog away due to a new baby and paranoia of allergies.  This dog is very sweet, well mannered, behaved, and potty trained.  I told my friend to get him updated on his shots this past weekend and he's neutered.
 
My friend is not really a dog person but is trying his best to foster this dog until we can find a permanent home.  I have 3 dogs of my own, otherwise I would definitely take him in.  I know everyone wants to condemn the brother and/or boss for doing such a reckless thing - but if I don't find him a home, the dog is the one being punished.  I can also provide a bed and a crate along with the adoption!
 
[Here are some photos of him!](http://imgur.com/a/LcPF2#0)

If you find that your situation changes or you change your mind, please contact me because I will gladly take him back and search for a new home.


**EDIT:**  Thank you everyone for your interest.  I am determined to find Lawry (you can feel free to change his name) the right home.  I just got his medical paperwork from my friend so I wanted to update everyone.  He just received his DHPP (distemper, hepatitis, parvo, parainfluenza), bordetella, corona, &amp; rabies shots on the 29th.  He won't be due for his rabies until 2013 and everything else is annual.  He was also dewormed at the same time.  He is not microchipped so that is something that you would have to get done, so please keep that in mind.  

He is a pomeranian mix so he will require grooming when his is long and haircuts during the summer.  Please feel free to ask me anymore questions.  We can schedule meetups for you to meet Lawry or I can take him over to your place if there are kids and other pets that you would like to see a trial run for.

**2nd EDIT:** Sorry for the delay everyone.  The dog has been adopted by the first person that contacted me.  We had our first meet &amp; greet this Sunday and it seems like a good fit.

I found out who the number belongs to, and its a theater cleanup guy that pretended to help me look for the phone. i talked to him and he said its a mistake and it must be because i used his phone to call and look for mine... but i think this is proof enough no? he sounded really innocent on the phone, but how can something like this be a mistake?""

**UPDATE 5/21/2012:**

&gt;""Thanx for all the help guys... i've given him (Armando) chance after chance to just give me my phone back without consequence... he's still lying... so i made sure he was fired... and he was.. I also filed a police report. the cops called him when i was there, and he lied to them too... but they say i pretty much gave them all the evidence they need, and its an easy arrest...

&gt;on the other hand we have the theater management that refuses to take ANY responsibility for their employee... I found out they fired him but they didn't tell me. instead, their official position is ""we don't give compensation for lost items""... I'm really not looking for much, just justice... They didn't even offer to refund my movie ticket... not even an apology! So i'm not left with much choice but to (legally, non-violently) DESTROY THEM (in court)!""

**UPDATE 5/21/2012 b:**

&gt;""FINALLY got a CONFESSION and have it recorded! He didn't admit to actually stealing the phone, and made up a bunch of lies about his friend stealing it. The most important part is that he admitted that he KNOWS more then he's saying, and he's a part of it...""

**UPDATE 5/22/2012:**

&gt;""JUSTICE!!! got my phone back from Armando Richardson- the phone thief... he's so dumb he left incriminating txt msgs on my phone, AND left his facebook logged on. im still logged on.... This could be fun... any ideas?""

My girlfriend and I went hiking through Whiting Ranch yesterday and loved it (it's down the street from our apartment). I did a search on here and saw a thread about places to hike and there seems to be a lot of trails here in OC! 

It gave me an idea; what if we set up bi-weekly or monthly hikes as a meetup in different trails around OC? I think it would be a great way for all of us to get together and enjoy our beautiful weather.

What do you guys think?

**EDIT: Seems like we should be able to get a good group going. I encourage you all to recommend places each month :)**

**EDIT 2: WOW! A lot of people are down to hike. Well, I'm only available on weekends since I work Monday-Friday 10AM-6:30PM (A little tired after work) and it seems a lot of you are good for weekends. **

**What day should we schedule the hikes? Every last Saturday or Sunday of the month maybe?**

Placing them in a safe, comfortable, and caring home is my main priority; $150 adoption fee for redditors. 



(craigslist link flagged and removed -_-  reposted below) 

http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/i51eu/chinchilla_dusting_that_is_all/




As sad as it makes me, I will be moving soon and can't bring my friends along for the journey.
Felix is a very outgoing 3 year old standard grey male and his best friend Sneak is an inquisitive 2.5 year old violet male chin. (I will not separate them or part-out their cage/toys!)

They were both purchased by me from the same breeder (http://www.pets4love.com) soon after they were weaned. I had Felix for about six months before adding Sneak to the cage, I really felt that I was doing him a disservice by keeping him isolated from other members of his species and havent had any regrets. (caring for two bonded chinchillas is about the same amount of work as caring for a single chin) Although I purchased them at different times, I introduced them slowly and properly; they never fight and cuddle in their tubes all day long. They are extremely healthy and have been well cared for since birth.


They come with EVERYTHING one needs to keep them healthy and happy, including but not limited to:

* Quality Cage Co.'s ""Chinchilla Mansion""
* 14 inch exercise wheel
* corner litter pan
* glass water bottle/ceramic dish
* timothy hay box
* fleece hammock &amp; tube
* wooden tube/ledges
* marble tile
* dusting bowl (featured in video's below)
* tons of hanging toys

food/supplies:

* Mazuri chinchilla diet
* Kaytee timothy hay
* all natural aspen bedding
* Blue Cloud chin dust
* treats!
* window air conditioner (+$20 if needed)
* small animal moving crate



Because I want them to go to the right home I will only re-home them to someone who:

* is above the age of 21
* understands how to properly care for a chinchilla
* can give them a safe, comfortable, and stable home
* will keep them together in their current arrangement
* keep them cool w/ AC throughout the summer months
* let them out every other day/night and provide them with treats/toys/stimulation
* love them

price is negotiable if i feel that you will give them the love, care, and attention they need/deserve.

They're both $16.99 for all you can eat, and each has their own set of advantages. 

Cham Sut Gol is more popular (so it would have a longer wait time for our group) and has AYCE ice cream on top of AYCE kbbq. 

[Go Goo Ryeo](http://gogooryeo.com/) allows reservations and has private rooms for large grops. They also have vents conveniently placed near their grill so you don't come out smelling like kbbq. 

This is happening on Saturday, April 16 at around 7:30. The final place will be determined based on feedback on this post :)

Sheraton Park Hotel  
1855 South Harbor Blvd

Last time I went I did a one day tour which was awesome, but left me wanting something more. The purpose of this second trip would be to do a two-day tour, staying in a hotel in the restricted zone overnight. 

Why am I posting this in OC? Because the two-day tour is crazy expensive if I do it myself, and because I figure if I'm going to find people to go with, I might as well do it with people nearby and can meet beforehand. 

I went with Lupine Travel previously and am organizing this trip with them again. Info about the trip is [available here](http://lupinetravel.co.uk/chernobyl-tours-and-holidays.html). You'll see my trip for October 13th and 14th listed. 

Some caveats:

* I'll already be in Paris the month before, so we can either meetup in Kiev or meet in Paris and travel together to Kiev. 

* Access to the insides of buildings was suspended in April after a minor incident with some tourists who were lightly injured. Contacts tell me that this may be reversed after the massive Euro football tournament is over this summer, but it's still up in the air. 

Why do I mention the second item? Simply because I may decide not to go if the buildings aren't reopened. For someone who has never been there, the experience will still be incredible. Because of my interests in photographing the interior of some of the more interesting buildings though, I'm on the fence about it. 

If the buildings aren't reopened, I'll probably visit Berlin instead, shooting ruins in the eastern part of the city if possible. 

If you're interested, post here or message me and we can talk more about the caveats, expense, experience, etc. 

TL;DR Who wants to glow in the dark?


-----------------------


**Edit**: some info on approximate costs is below (it's not cheap, unfortunately, and is based on current exchange rates). 

Approximate airfare from LAX to Kiev: $1,200

2-day private tour with English language guide, driver, and hotel: $521.90 (based on group of 5)

Additional lodging in Kiev:

* Hostels are as cheap as $15/night.
* A private apartment in Kiev is about $55/night per person (this is what I did, and was quite comfortable). 
* Hotels are whatever price you want, basically. 

Let's assume you fly out of LAX on 10/10 and return a week later, staying in a cheap hotel split by two people, the costs per person are:
 
* Flight: $1,200 (plus lame taxes)
* Hotel for 10/11: $25
* Hotel for 10/12: $25
* Time in Chernobyl: $521.90
* Hotel for 10/14: $25
* Hotel for 10/15: $25
* Hotel for 10/16: $25

Grand total is approximately $1,846.90.

That price includes meals inside the restricted zone, but not in Kiev. I'd have to check with Lupine, but the airport transfers might also be included. 

If you wanted to meetup in Paris before Kiev, you'd probably add about another $300 for airfare.",,False,self,t5_2rd9x,1338868959.0,,,True,t3_ukyav,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/ukyav/anyone_up_for_a_trip_to_chernobyl/,

1327468244.0,21,self.orangecounty,ovnnr,"OC redditors, I'm requesting help, super desperate - please hear me out at the least",29,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/ovnnr/oc_redditors_im_requesting_help_super_desperate/,"Dear OC redditors,

I really didn't want to do this, but I'd really appreciate it if you at least read my story. My name is randomKo_Orean, and I am requesting help, as I am at a situation where I am super desperate. Why?

About myself/situation/request:

I'm a recent college grad, and after college I moved to orange county sometime in October 2011 to take care of my father, even though I was from San Diego originally. I've been actively looking for employment for awhile to a no avail. Now, here's the dilemma I'm facing currently:

- my father and I am getting evicted from our home on January 31st. he and I will be be separating ways for now, so that it's easier for both of us. (room)
- As of today, I have $0.00 in my BoA checking account and $.92 in my Chase checking account.
- missed all my bill payment this months, including credit cards and electricity bills
- matter of a fact, electricity bill has been postponed twice to avoid power being cut, and I bought a month's time on all my credit cards (five in total). also no internet, so I steal Starbuck's free wifi now w/o buying drinks.
- student loans are in process of deference application

Before you guys accuse me of being ""irresponsible with monies as college student,"" and what not, it's important to note that I used that money to support my father and my brother after 1) family business fell apart completely (housing market crash) &amp; 2) my mother passed away in Feb. 2010. Combined with these 2 factors, our family faced immensely difficult financial hardship compounded by the fact that we didn't have health insurance. If you are wondering how much I have in just credit card debt, I have accumulated over 10 grand over last 2.5 years. I am genuinely surprised to this day it isn't more because I was supporting my family financially while attending a university.

But as a student, I did what I thought what I was supposed to do, and figured it'd be okay. I worked part-time in school, full-time during vacations, did extremely odds jobs for supplement income, and took out student loans, which were used primarily supporting my family. For the last 3 years of my college years, I slept on the living room floor of my friends' house (bless them) for an extremely small fee to cut almost every single living expenses to a minimum.

However, comes January 2012 and I am at end of my rope; I'm really desperate at this point. Job market is immensely stupid at this point, and when March and April rolls around, it will be even HARDER to get a job (brutal tax season). I'm hoping for best, as I have been submitting my resumes and applying for odd gigs furiously, but in case it does not happen, I do not wish to just borrow money, because I do not know how soon I can pay you back.

So this is what I am requesting to you, oh kind redditors:

Please give me a job. Any job. Anything. Part-time, full-time, odd jobs, labor jobs, creative jobs, ANYTHING. I can do construction work, as I have done before. I can do cashier/manual/physical labor, as I have done before. I can do tutoring, as I have done before. Essays? Analysis? Math? Marketing? Financial Modeling? Excel usage? Engineering? Carpentry? Data Entry? Marketing? Sales? Other stuff? I repeat, tell me what you need done, and most likely I can get it done. (Or die trying.) You need something done, and you are willing to spend money? Why not me? (upon inquiry, I will tell you whether or not if what you request out of my skill set) To assure quality and my ability, here's a short story: last July, after burning out completely from stress, I took 4 weeks off to go off on a hitchhiking trip, with no cash, credit card, debit cards, etc. etc. and got to New York and back from California. And when I flew back, I came back home with 1200$ in cash (which I used to pay the next month's bills).

Of course, full time position with a sustainable salary so that I can support my father financially and start paying off my debts, but for now, I am willing to do ANYTHING for money, and I will be forever grateful, and I will love you forever.

If you have any questions/comments/remarks/advice/suggestions/offer/condolences/hate speech/apathy/wedding proposals/etc/etc, feel free to post on this thread or PM me. Also, if you'd like to see my resume, please PM me so I can either link you or email you.

Thanks for reading!

tldr: i need money. getting evicted and i have no money. give me any kind of job, i can do it, and i will love you. &lt;3. also, i rather not borrow money since i can't pay you back for at least a month or two.

__EDIT__ I am NOT willing to do anything ILLEGAL, however, or highly morally questionable acts.

I was recently offered a job in Irvine that requires me to relocate, and I'll be in sunny California ready to begin my new life and new career starting this Monday.

I'm a 24 year old male, and since graduating from college in Fall '09, I've been busting my ass working 2 jobs and various internships working toward my career and this marks the culmination.  I'm excited, but also extremely nervous.

So I ask of you, reddit, would you please help me by telling me a bit about the area?  For example:

* Where and how should I approach finding a place?  Ideally I'm looking for a decent room for rent for a couple months while I stabilize and find a more permanent one-bedroom arrangement.
* Where are some of the nicer, trendier spots in the area for food, drink and just general socializing?  I'm not going to know anyone, really, so I want to be active and acclimate myself to the social scene as seamlessly as possible.
* What are some general tips and tidbits of advice you have for an out-of-towner?  

Thanks in advance for all of your input.  I look forward to hearing some of your thoughts!

EDIT:

Thank you so much everyone for the overwhelming show of support. I'll be sure to try to get myself added to that fb group. It would be great to have a jumping off point with some cool people around the area.

I'd be willing to organize a shindig for us all since we had an awesome turn out at our last meet up. but I want to see how many of you all are interested. 



**Update Uno**- If you are ""down"" for this, please let me know what date works best for you

**Update Dos**-  If this is your first meetup or you think you're new on reddit this is a perfect time to meet some new folks and have a few laughs. Don't worry everyone gets a bit nervous meeting strangers from the internet

**Update tres** so as of now everyone is looking at 12/18 as possible date. As far as location, we COULD have it proof bar (santa ana) but it would be better if we had a house.

Last chance to wear your costumes this year! Show them off and possibly win a prize!


We will have a COSTUME CONTEST, as well as a TEAM TRIVIA COMPETITION. These contests will have trophies and prizes so you will forever live in infamy as the best of the best of OC reddit. Prizes will range from alcohol to geek toys and tasty things, so come prepared to win! Trivia will start around 8:30. RAFFLE tickets are first come first serve.


We will be able to bring snacks to the bar before it gets more crowded (own
er says around 9)...so if you want to bring some, feel free, but know they may need to be put away around then. I suggest showing up on time with food, or no later than 8.


Our venue is a super awesome bar/lounge called Kitsch in Costa Mesa that we as redditors have been regularly attending for nearly 2 years. We know the owner and he loved it when we came there last year for halloween. It is 21+ ... so... I'm sorry people who aren't yet 21, but I just couldn't find a reasonable place to fit us all for the night.


This will not be an exclusive reddit-only night, unfortunately. The bar is still open to the general public. We will do our thing, but others could potentially participate in trivia, etc. I would like to fill it with as many redditors as possible though, so please come EARLY (like right at 7pm if you can) take a seat and fill up the place so that if the bar gets too full, only non-redditors are turned away. It worked out pretty well last year either way. As incentive, I will have glow sticks and raffle tickets for the first people to come. Yes, there will be a RAFFLE as well.


I have many decorations, but anyone who wants to help out or bring more is welcome to volunteer. I will be there at 6:30 decorating. I will also accept monetary donations for the prize fund. I'm buying the prizes myself, but I can't really afford to without a job. Any help is appreciated!

Address: 	
Kitsch Bar
891 Baker St.
Costa Mesa, CA

Time: 6PM to 2AM

Text from the event: 
	
We've been getting together a reddit team (or 2 or 3) for Trivia night at our favorite bar in Costa mesa weekly for months. When looking for a venue for our global Halloween meetup, it was one of the first places that came to mind. So we asked the owner, and it's official, our good friends at Kitsch bar in Costa Mesa, agreed they would help us host our official Reddit Halloween meetup. Huzzah!

They will open their doors at 6pm on Saturday the 22nd for Redditors only, but after that it's fair game for their normal Saturday crowd. Yes... I know that is quite early... but please be there then if you possibly can. Our goal: Fill up Kitsch bar to max capacity (75 or so) before normal people get the chance to show up :) The owner tells me that people usually don't start coming in much until 8:30 or 9 but.... but better not to chance things. Try to come as early as possible to get to the many comfy lounge chairs and get your fill of happy hour priced drinks. I would hate to max out the capacity before many redditors show up.

Unfortunately being a bar, it's 21 and over. Their happy hour will start at 6 and continue until 9pm. Half off all well drinks for that time, making them $3 a piece. I promise the awesome bartendress Maria will treat you well :)

And if you're thinking Trivia sounds awesome, but sadly you've never been able to attend our normal Tuesday Trivia meets, rejoice, for Trivia-master Rob said he would host a bit of Trivia that night as a favor to us. Yay!

There will also be a costume contest, so show up dressed in your Halloween best for success. 

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we know how many people to expect. Thanks!

Stay tuned for further details to come. Hope to see you all there!

She's very outgoing, curious, and playful.  She can be very affectionate at times too, which leads me to believe that one day she'll make a fine lap kitteh, but for now, she prefers play.  Also worth mentioning is that she is probably the best groomers I've met.  Very clean kitteh.  She's also 100% healthy, fed high-quality food, current on her vaccinations, and she's been spayed.

The reason why we are starting to search for a home for her is because we already had two cats when we adopted her.  We never really intended to have three cats, but when we heard of the kitten's predicament, we couldn't say no.  So now here we are with three cats in a one bedroom apartment and in the next few months we'll be moving to an even smaller studio apartment.  It's just too many cats.  One of the two cats we had before we adopted Nimbus bullies and harasses her, and he hasn't really been the same since she's been around.  He's been randomly peeing/pooing in places where he shouldn't, and it's starting to get out of control.  The other cat plays with her a bit, but she's a little older and on the husky side, so she has a hard time keeping up.  Maybe if I had a bigger home, or the option of letting my cats go indoor/outdoor, then things would be ok, but unfortunately I don't.  

It's going to be very hard for us to part with her, so we want to make sure she'll be going to a good home.  Ideally she'd be best off in a bigger living space in the company of younger cats or at least more playful cats.

Please message me if you're interested or if you know anybody who might be.  Thanks.

One park we went to quite often was a park that had this giant concrete structure that is difficult to describe.  I would say that it was a bridge, but it wasn't over anything and in certain areas it was tiered, in others it was a solid structure.  Another attempt at describing it would be to say it was sort of like the Great Wall of China, but that makes people think I'm describing something ornate, which is not the case.  It was just concrete.   I remember as a kid thinking it would be fun to skateboard on, but I don't think it was specifically designed for that.

We basically just walked across it and had various adventures There were a few things to interact with, but it was mostly novel because we were running around on this giant structure.  I got lots of cuts and bruises playing on the thing and I wouldn't be shocked if it was knocked down after a lawsuit or something (I would have visited in the late 80s or early 90s).

Which might be why nobody else seems to have heard of it.  Every time I join some internet community and I find that there is an Orange County local section I ask, but nobody else seems to know.  Even my mom, who took me to the park several times, doesn't seem to know what I am talking about.  I'm starting to wonder if I hallucinated the whole thing.  

Along with the concrete structure it was a very large park with lots of things to do and some other fairly unique playground apparatuses.  It also had some playground equipment that seemed to have been converted from old planes.  

Unfortunately I can't remember the exact city.  We were in Santa Ana but traveled all around Orange County.    It's not Atlantis Park (first thing everyone suggests) and I'm pretty sure it's not Boysen Park (although the plane playground equipment I mentioned was similar, and I'm absolutely sure I've been to Boysen, however I distinctly remember there being multiple parks with plane playground equipment, and one being much better than the other, and Boysen exactly matches my memory of the lame one), although we went to both of those places.

I'm just wondering if this rings a bell with anyone else?  If not it's cool.  I just think of this place once in a while and wonder if it's still there.  Or if it was ever there at all.",,False,self,t5_2rd9x,False,,,True,t3_1gyhdp,http://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1gyhdp/help_locating_a_certain_park/,

The dog will nip at the kitten and is all around aggressive towards her.

They currently keep her in an unused room but because she is by herself, very playful, and alone in there she seems to be sad. They wish to give her to someone who can take care of her the way she should be. I have spent some time with her and while I wish I could take her myself I cannot. She is super playful and loves to climb. Her current favorite place to perch is on top of a step ladder where she can look outside. 

Here is some information about her. Her name is Coral. She has not been spayed or had any shots. She is about 4 months old now. 
Here are a few [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/vhSQd) of her.

A while back I posted asking if anyone had info on accessing the blimp hangars at [MCAS Tustin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Tustin). I've got two updates:

First, the [Tustin Preservation Conservancy](http://www.preservetustin.com/) has a tour scheduled of the north hangar this Saturday, September 17th. I'm not sure of the time yet, but some info is available on their website. To join, it looks like you need to make at least a $25 donation to the conservancy. 

Second, I was able to track down the caretaker for the base and will be working on a private, photographer-oriented tour later. I already talked to him about getting me access, but will approach a group tour soon. If you're a photographer and have interest in better access later, you may want to jump on the tour this weekend and make some mental notes of shot selection for next time. Let's keep our fingers crossed. 

As I understand it, the future of these hangars is uncertain, so this may be your last chance to see them!

**Edit**: The tour time will be at 10 a.m. If you want to gain access, make sure to make your tax-deductible donation to join the Conservancy in advance (you can pay via Paypal). I'm signed up to go, so if you show up come say hello. I'll have my photo gear with me and am an early thirties white guy, so I should be easy enough to spot.

So if you'd like to find other OC redditors, reply to my public post below with confirmation that you are a redditor and add everyone else to a circle.
