Things suck. Not a little, not in my head. Measurably, with charts and graphs and pictures and arrows. Don't tell me it's not that bad, because it is. 

Stop telling me things will get better. Of course things will get better, that's not in question, the question is WHEN. It took a good 1600 years after the roman empire fell for things to ""get better"". Unless you have access to information that I don't, I don't want to hear it.

Stop offering me pop-capitalist regurgitations about starting your own business and being an entrepreneur, that requires resources that most people simply do not command any longer. Like time and money. You try being an entrepreneur with no money, while working 7 days a week just to keep your head above water. Let's see how well you do.

Stop telling me that all it takes is a little bit of creativity and a CAN DO! spirit to move on up and get your piece of the pie. It's tired bullshit, and I'm sick of hearing it. It's demonstrably false at this point.

Stop telling me about the microscopic percentage of my generation that made it to success. I don't care about them. I care about the other 99% who are just trying to live their lives. If it takes being exceptional to attain a lifestyle that's mediocre, there's a problem.

Stop acting like it's just a matter of getting a job, alright? I have a job. I have two, actually. I work 7 days a week at all hours of the day and night. Half the time I can't even remember what day it is. They both pay better than minimum wage. I'm educated, and I work hard, and have minimal debt, and you know what? I can't even afford an apartment on my own. The problem isn't budgeting, it's income.

Stop telling me to compare myself to people in even shittier parts of the world. I don't care what the standard of living is in rural Botswana. Just because other people elsewhere are living in abject filthy poverty, doesn't make my life better. I can count my blessings while damning my curses at the same time.

What you CAN do, is educate yourselves on the issues me, and others of my generation face. There are many great books out there on the subject (I recommend Generation Debt, Strapped, Falling Behind, Nickel and Dimed, and Bait and Switch). 

What you CAN do is start demanding the changes America needs to ensure some kind of future for your children, and by extension your grandchildren. Pay attention to the massive ripoff that a college education has become, pay attention to the corrupt student loan system, to the price of textbooks that have increased in cost to the point of criminality. The declining entry level jobs, the slave labor of ""internships"" that have replaced most entry level jobs. The homes that increased in cost so much that even after a national collapse of the housing market, it's still impossible to get into, the medical care that most of us have no access to, the families that we cannot have because we could never support them, the careers and good jobs that have left and will never return, and the companies that haven't increased their rate of pay in 30 years.

You want to really help? Stop trying to cheer me up and get together with your friends and demand some changes. We're all in this together, and none of us can do this alone. Thank you for your time. Best of luck to all of you.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_feucl,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/feucl/dear_world_stop_trying_to_cheer_me_up/,

You won't know until its too late.

You had me work grave shift for Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Years.  You had me patrol a dangerous area, unarmed, alone.  You appointed an incompetent manager who shows up late every single day.  You cut my hours when I hurt my back to punish me for calling in sick, even though I gave you 2x the required notice.  You make me tell homeless people that they cant sleep where they are because you don't want a smelly poor person making your pretty property look like reality.  You don't pay me enough. 

I've been quietly fomenting dissent among the ranks.  We want better pay, better hours, and a steward to protect us from the arbitrary cruelty of management.  We want benefits for working 24 hours a week because if you work that many hours, you can't realistically work 40 elsewhere.

I'm so very close to securing 50% of the staff for union cards.  Tantalizingly close.

You're going to regret talking down to me.  You're going to regret walking into our meeting, telling us that we work hard and that we should be paid more but, gosh, you just can't ask the client to pay more money.  So instead of making a 40% profit, you could make a 38% profit - but you'd rather insult us with burger coupons and movie tickets.

Movie tickets don't pay rent.  Burger coupons can't get my mom decent health insurance.

You're going to regret every single instance you took advantage of us, every time you talked to us like we should be grateful to lick your boots.  I'm going to call down the thunder.  I'm going to rain chaos upon you.  There will be a reckoning of a power that can only be described in one word:

Union.

You think you've got us.  You think we're nothing.  You have no idea what were capable of when we're united; there is power in a union.

Edit:  

I didn't expect to get such a response... I was just shouting into the dark, a called shot or a confession to no one in particular before I crossed a major threshold.

Graduated from an elite university in accounting &amp; finance.

Applied to grad schemes, entry level positions, tiny insignificant roles barely related to the field in which I hope to have a career.
No interviews

In £30k debt from student loans.

Ancient fucks laugh on a political talk show about how the spiralling national debt problem is now the next generation's issue.

Conversation moves into pension funds and how they're all underfunded. Host suggests 'the youths need to just get jobs and give higher contributions to pension schemes! It's tough times and we're all in it together!'. Fuck you. You're retiring to a nice villa at 65. I'll still be working at 75.

More people are living with their parents than ever before. Our generation can't get on the property ladder. The last feels entitled to buy all the affordable housing meant for us, to then put them up for rent and fuck us over.

Lastly, think tanks across the globe last month declaired that we're rapidly approaching the point of no return with greenhouse emissions. The talks in Rio needed to make hard decisions to combat the problem. Without serious agreements, we could be headed into the abyss. What hapenned? Fuck all. Politics. They won't care, they'll be dead. It'll be our and our children's asses trying to survive climate change.

TL;DR:

Student debt + national debt + insolvent pension funds + unafforable housing prices + climate change inaction = a lifetime of paying for the excess of past generations.

I say we collectively agree not to pay the debts of our ancestors.

Like you, I grew up and got launched into the world at a time when things were not so good. I now have a decade or more of looking back on what I did, but more importantly what my friends did, and what worked out and what didn't.

Here's a brief list of things I'd do:

1. If you're jobless, take any job other than food service. You cannot work your way up in food service at this point. You can however at a book store, at a big box store, etc. Instead of burning out, get your teeth into something.
2. Be very wary of established groups of other people trying to tell you what the ""source"" of your problem is. They're just recruiting you as footsoldiers in their political and social crusades, which means you do the work and they see the money.
3. Do not be afraid to move in with your parents, but formalize some kind of contract. Paying $50 a month for the basement sort of sucks, but it puts limits on them being your parents; now they're your landlord. Your landlord doesn't tell you when to go to bed.
4. Give up any personal habits that do not lead to your furthering your own future. Sadly, this includes going to bars a lot, or smoking dope, and playing a lot of video games. These habits just suck you in and consume you.
5. Find the smartest people you knew in high school and hang out with them. They will be finding companies where you have options to work and do well.
6. Figure out what it is you like doing. Don't think of jobs, or careers, but how you want to spend your time. What you love is what you do well.
7. Fuck the Baby Boomers. I can't stress this enough: they grew up in the biggest population boom in history, made a ton of money, and now they want you to listen to the music they listened to when they were kids, repeat the slogans they shouted when they were kids, live through the same drama that they did. There's something wrong with them. It's illegal for me to tell you to rise up and murder them all with axes, but it's worth considering. They can't arrest all of us.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_uc3uo,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/uc3uo/what_i_learned_from_growing_up_in_a_recession/,

Here are a few things they didn't know:

In 1979, paying tuition at a state university required working a minimum wage job just 5 hours a week. A private school would take 22.25 hours.

In 2009 those numbers were up to 18.5 hours of minimum wage for public school and 64 hours a week for private school.

Internships are now largely non-paying. Not just that, but you have to pay for the privilege of working for free. That is, you still pay for the credits even though it costs the school nothing more than minimal administrative costs. (By the way, you may want to consider getting just 1 credit, even if you qualify for more, to keep costs down.)

Entry level government jobs are increasingly unpaid, because they're not subject to minimum wage laws. Even some private sector jobs are simply calling their junior workers ""interns"" thinking that means they don't have to pay them. This is in fact illegal, but who's going to rat them out when you need the experience and reference?

No more subsidized loans for grad school. If you go to a three year program, it will cost you an extra $5,500 to attend. That's interest accrued during school, plus interest on that amount because it becomes capitalized (6.8% for 15 years). If you work minimum wage, you can either pay off the costs of unsubsidized loans in now, or attend 3 years of state university in 1979.

Employers now care about skills over credentials. It used to be that a college degree was a sign of high level general competence. Now it's a sign of moderate intelligence. Employers want more. *And they should.* I don't blame companies for realizing that a college degree doesn't mean much. I do blame the 30 years of blissful ignorance that told my generation all they needed was a college degree without paying attention to how the world was changing.

The biggest thing though that I realized my parents don't understand about college today is that many of us leave wanting to do intellectual and creative endeavors. Having an upwardly mobile comfortable income is important, but it's taken a back seat to contributing something meaningful to the world. Many of us would gladly take $30k a year and a job we want over $60k in a Dilbertesque cube farm.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_s24i2,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/s24i2/what_my_parents_dont_know_about_college_today/,

(That goes for you too, recruiters.)",94,13,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/hxytp/thought_for_the_day_hr_is_worthless_that_goes_for/,"Seriously, HR may be the most over-inflated, worthless position at any company. After working at several small-to-medium sized companies, I can say (from an anecdotal standpoint, of course) that HR is worthless. 

What do HR people do all day? At my current job (yes, I am fortunate to have one in this economy), the HR person sits in her office and plays on her Droid phone most of the day. Occasionally, she walks around and shoots the shit with employees. That's it. Her busiest days are hiring and firing days -- mainly on account of the paperwork.

Why bring this up? Well, HR is usually the first line in the hiring process. They are who you email your resume to. They claim they're busy (but they're not). In fact, I've noticed in the past year that jobs that required three years experience now require five. The reason? HR people are getting so many resumes, i.e., they're having to -- brace yourself for it -- work, that they found a solution to cut down on their workload: jack up the experience requirements. That pile of resumes that was 200 high is now only 20. Whew ... that was scary. Almost had to do some work.

The same goes for recruiters. Their job is to find people who will bust their ass and work hard. Instead, they'll look for nitpicky bullet points in terms of experience as a way of making sure your resume never gets to the right person.

And, what, you may be asking, are the requirements -- in terms of experience and/or education -- to do either job? Nothing. I've discovered this via LinkedIn. Anytime I apply for a job and can find the name of the HR person or recruiter, I plug it in and look over their profile. Nine times out of 10 they -- at most -- have a B.S. in something very general, like liberal studies, and do not have a varied job history. Yet, with this insanely limited background, they feel qualified to know who should be hired for a multitude of positions, whether they be generalist-oriented or highly technical in nature.

Every job I've ever got, I got because I went around HR or a recruiter and somehow got in touch with who I would directly be working for. But nowadays that is getting harder and harder to do as HR and recruiters act as gatekeepers.

What are your experiences with HR and/or recruiters, fellow redditors?",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_hxytp,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/hxytp/thought_for_the_day_hr_is_worthless_that_goes_for/,

Then my savings ran low, my lease ended, and I moved back in with my parents.  Now I'm mad.

The economy isn't far away anymore; it's here.  I've been home for two weeks and I'm getting bored, fat, lazy, and sad.  Two weeks.  This'll only get worse.  I'm getting anxious.  I'm getting deja vu right now.  I'm probably going to delete this post because I'm sure I'm just coming off like a lunatic.

People keep talking about footing the bill for Boomers, and I could give a shit.  I never wanted to own a mansion or a Rolls.  Or for that matter a ranch or Kia.  I want us to live economically and ecologically sustainable lifestyles.  My dreams were never that materialistically big.

All I want is a fucking job.  No, fuck that, you know what I want?  I want the people in leadership in this world, the goddam Boomers to finally step up and start leading things in a direction of sustainability when we know fully well that we're in the clutches of predatory capitalism that is socially, politically, environmentally treacherous.  I want a WPA to build wind mills and solar panels and high-speed rail and to improve public transit and urban gardening and to tell people about local food.  I want a government that truly believes it would be a better use of its money to pay me to spread the propaganda of renewable energy than to buy gruesome privately contracted THUGS to kill innocent people in Nisour Square with no legal recourse.

You know, as an undergrad, I thought the vast majority of Americans sent a mandate about the direction we wanted our country to take in November of 2008.  I thought we all got together, reviewed or opinion of the previous decade and went ""Pft, enough of that shit!""  I guess I was wrong, America.  I guess I was a fucking child.

Ironic, since we'll be the last generation that pays into pensions and social security, and the first generation not to receive them. We're entitled to less than our accusers.

What's amazing is nobody has noticed that the burden for anything has shifted so dramatically. We're called the 'entitlement generation', while meeting standards set ridiculously high by the previous generation. They feel entitled to workers of such quality that previous generations would pay huge sums for them.

A generation ago, you didn't need grade school to get a reasonable job and build a life for yourself. Today, you need a high school diploma just to flip burgers(And no, you won't build a life for yourself flipping burgers). A generation ago, college was only required for the highest level jobs. Today, even aspiring tradesmen(People who are supposed to be trained on the job!) are told they should try to get college in their chosen trade to even get in.

Let's not even talk about tuition costs. A generation ago, college tuition cost about as much as a few months rent. Today, tuition will cost as much as a small house for what many are finding is dubious benefit. We're sending kids right from high school into a mortgage worth of debt, but they don't even have a house.

Then, after spending decades in school, and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on college, the previous generation has the gall to hate us for thinking we should have jobs -- or worse, for thinking we should be able to keep a job for more than a few years. Today we're all transient, we all work for an hour here, an hour there. It's very romantic hearing ""He works four jobs"", but nobody remembers to mention that the four jobs only work 8 hours a week each.

This is the natural result of the progress away from actually doing anything. Today, the desk you sit at, the computer you're reading this on, the chair you're sitting in, the clothes on your body, the product in your hair, the glasses on your face, are all manufactured in the second or third world. The only work left in our dying society tends to be moving piles of money from one pile to another, or acting as middle-men between the people who actually create something to the people who consume it.

Even these jobs days are numbered. With the Internet, it's getting easier and easier to order direct from a factory, to have only one middle-man. I bought an 8GB class 6 microSD card for 15 bucks from Hong Kong, with free shipping right to my house. Buying it from Wal-mart would cost 4 times as much. How long until everything but perishable items are just shipped right to our homes, and millions find themselves out of work -- just as when the mines closed, just as when the factories closed, just as when the computer and engineering jobs left?

A generation ago, you could buy a car and drive it into the ground. Today, the burden of owning a vehicle is greater than ever. In many cities, poor people(and guess what -- people without jobs and with six figures of student debt are poor!) have their cars taken away from them because they're just a bit too old to pass the ridiculous tests set up by the government (and you know the tests are ridiculous when you need to cheat to pass -- even new vehicles need to cheat). Ironically, today many jobs demand you own a vehicle, whether it's relevant or not. 

Even societies institutions are falling apart. The previous generation got married like their parents, only to divorce in greater numbers than ever before. It's no wonder today this lost generation is trying to figure out the meaning of love, and slowly un-learning the propoganda of our youth to figure out the opposite gender.

Where does that leave us? Even though things are worse today, I say we're better off than the previous generation. Every generation before us has been lost, but we're the first to realise the map we've been given won't take us to where we want to go. While we meet the highest standards in history(by an order of magnitude), we're also forging our own path, writing a new map. 

We may be considered the lost generation, but we're the first in a long time to have a chance to find what we're looking for. For the first time in a long time, it's not because we're entitled to that future, but because we're making it ourselves, against the wishes of those who came before us.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,True,,,True,t3_9992c,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/9992c/the_entitlement_generationwhich_one_was_it_again/,

In two or three months time, I'll be out of money. I can't even afford to go see someone about my mental issues because it--guess what!?--costs money to do so. 

I can't afford my own car. I share it with my mom. My mom can't afford me living with her, but it's not like I can go anywhere else. I'm not sure she can afford living by herself, so it's not like I can just pack my bags and leave and abandon her. 

I can't get a job. I've only done retail and fast food jobs for all of my professional career, and they're not even calling me anymore for interviews. And for the record, yes, I put in applications. I've put in at least a hundred this month. Still no interviews. 

Not to mention, the environmental, governmental, and economic prospects of this country and world as a whole put a damper on the whole staying positive thing.

It's not like my friends understand. They all have rich fucking parents and can afford to be lazy.

I can't get motivated and it feels like all the advice people give me isn't doing anything. I'm starting to doubt the whole book thing because who knows where in the hell the publishing industry is going to be in the next few years.

So, how in the hell am I supposed to live like this? ",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_vl1i1,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/vl1i1/how_in_the_hell_am_i_supposed_to_live_like_this/,

I had no idea how expensive and prohibitive this process has become since my previous move, and am now deeply concerned at how this affects our generation.

My primary concern lies with setting up utilities. Every utility that services my house has demanded my credit report. If you do not have good credit, then you must pay a hefty security deposit in order to receive service.

My gas company is the absolute worst of the bunch. In addition to my credit report, they wanted my age and information about my employer. But the really galling part is that they demanded information on every single adult living in the household. According to the pre-recorded message on their customer service hotline, they need this information because they can deny you service if they don't approve of the people living in your household. Now just to put this bullshit into perspective, even *the big bank that is giving me a mortgage didn't ask about my age or house occupants*. That's right—my gas company is more restrictive than my mortgage lender. This is insane.

When I last moved in 2004, things were never this bad. I never had to submit a credit report. I never had to give a detailed record of my house occupants. The only information that was needed was my address and billing info. What the hell happened? Why has moving become so restrictive?

So to the people who tell the unemployed to go move to where the jobs are: FUCK YOU. Moving costs, rental security deposits, and hefty utility deposits will set you back at least $1000 (and that's a very conservative estimate). Where is this money supposed to come from if you're broke and unemployed? What are you supposed to do if the gas company doesn't like your equally broke roommates?

Last fall I was at Yale doing a useless Masters degree in Religion and hating it so I moved back to Georgia, went back to my undergraduate alma mater for a Master of Ars in Teaching (history education). 

I'm in $45,000 debt to the federal government, my wife is in ~20,000, though she has an undergraduate in mathematics. By the end of our masters degrees we will be in a minimum of $90,000 in student loan debt. We drive a 20 year old car, I work two jobs for a total of 60 hours a week, 6 days a week. She has a graduate assistantship that pays $150 a week and covers 9 credit hours for her. We are with each passing day getting poorer and further in debt. 

Hell, as my wife is going to be student teaching in the fall and I need to still get to work my mom has talked to us about co-signing a car loan to get her a newer and more reliable car. So we'd be taking $2000 in student loans to pay the car note now, another $5000 in the fall and a further $5000 in the spring. I'd have to work more hours than I am now just to pay the insurance. 

Today I broke down and cried; I'm still crying. I don't know what to do anymore. I work in Walmart for $7.45; I have a BA, I got a 4.0, and I keep thinking about killing myself to get away from this shit storm my life has turned into. 

EDIT:
I can't believe I'm having to justify my finances here but a few assholes, mainly Commisar, are shitting a brick about my looking at spending money on a computer and a scooter. Welp I sold my computer back in May to pay the rent and as suck I'm without a computer at home and am borrowing a housemates netbook right now. He does want it back though, soonish. So when I got my big ass refund check (refund because I got another scholarship based on my grades but the loans had already been processed), I went HEY now I can get a computer! Then, a little over a week ago my wife and I were trying to figure out how she would be getting to her student teaching in bum fuck nowhere and I would get to work the best solution we could come up with was that she should take the truck and I should get something small, cheap and cheap to insure. Hence buying a scooter. It's not like I went FUCK YEAH FREE MONEY WHOOOH, and then spent it all on whores and coke. Jesus fuck people. Real people who live somewhere beyond their mom's basements have expenses, and occasionally need to make large purchases. Doing so doesn't make them not in a fucked position financially. 

Note I haven't bought a scooter or a computer because I'm not running into anything right now. As for the ""how could you not realize how large your loans are"" crowd: It's easy. Borrowing 5 grand a semester at a place that costs... I don't actually know but the expected cost of attendance is ~$56,000 never seemed like that much but fuck did it add up.  As for the ""you should have studied something useful DUMBASS!"" group, well my wife did and that didn't make much difference. I guess we all can't be awesome engineers now can we, because if we were then wages would probably go down. 

I freaked out looking at the total loan figure because the enormity of how fucked I am finally hit. That's why it's called an epiphany!

We as a country have said that it's ok to torture people. We elected officials and then *re-elected* them to make the same decisions. We've hidden behind the idea that ""this is the lesser of the two evils"" for so long, that we've culturally forgotten what evil looks like. 

An evil country is one that engages in torture; one that tries children as adults and has *life* sentences for minors; one where money is considered ""speech"" so those who have the most, get the loudest voice, unequivocally. A country that's lost its conscience looks like one that claims ""national security"" at every turn. A country whose highest ideal is gone looks like the offices of the Associated Press, whose offices and files were just raided by the DHS this week.

Our sense of humanity left us a decade ago. We left it in Kuwait when we sent our brothers and sisters on a convoy into Baghdad on a pre-meditated and pre-emptive war (the pretext to which I bought into hook-line-and-sinker), where we were lied to by an administration held completely unaccountable for its actions. We left our humanity in guantanamo bay, when we decided that men should be tortured and their inalienable human rights to due process not only unrecognized, but those who would advocate for them would be looked askance, as though *they* were the enemy for wanted decent treatment for POWs. We left it in our prisons, where 34% of black men in Louisiana have lost the right to vote due to incarceration, and the majority of convicts are minorities in for non-violent, victimless crimes- locked away in for-profit prisons. Where is our sense of humanity? We left it in these places, and it's from these places that our country will regain it's identity; they'll take it, nurse it, and shape it. The only people with any sense of it left are right now burning like white-hot stars, raging inside and readying themselves to explode into supernovae and send shock-waves throughout the galaxy, destroying what exists, and spreading the seeds for new national identity- where the ideals we all cherished are renewed.

Or tell them they have a long hard fight ahead of them if they want some semblance of a quality standard of living?,61,7,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/pef04/should_we_be_telling_our_kids_they_could_grow_up/,"TL;DR: Example-**[1]** An excerpt I like-**[2]**

I was about to post something like this on my FB, but then decided it would not be very beneficial. I'm getting back in the dating scene and want to develop business relations, and anything that makes me look like a hopeless, begrudged nobody does not help. I see facebook as simply a local PR and correspondence tool, despite the reoccurring urge to cry out for help once in a while.

I'm a mid 20's male in a small collage town and only in the last year started covering all my own expenses and managing my life all on my own. The process has been hell, this past year was the most bewildering and tumultuous in my life thus far. I've coped with being angry at the world, placing blame on society and systems. And also considered how these are the cards I was dealt, and it is up to me to make of them what I will.

My original point came from feeling like the people who raised me and I was brought up around always talked about every ones potential. How we could become movie stars, astronauts, scientists, world travelers, etc. But never really let on to the fact that there was a LOT of hard work ahead of me, hard work and trying episodes that I still face and see no end to yet.

I don't have any kids myself, but I hope to some day. A lot of my friends are having kids already. At an alarming rate in some cases. **[1** What does one tell kids these days? That they can be anything, do anything. To choose a path and go for it? Or tell them there is a whole world of complicated and tedious challenges and responsibilities to face ahead of them, often fraught with unexpected problems? **]**

edit: Also I just wanted to post in here to rant a little bit, get things off my chest. I accepted my moms assistance for a very long time, living at home, having her drive me to important things, providing food/shelter, because I saw the local opportunities so abysmally tedious, inefficient even hopless that I hesitated for a long time to jump in and start providing for myself fully. Though I'm glad I began that process in the past year, it was a major shock, and the lengths I had to go through to begin supporting myself have spanned many years and taken a toll on my health. Today I work small time jobs to perpetuate a lifestyle I wouldn't wish upon most people. Single, broke, sciatic nerve and stomach issues, very small and moldy rented basement room with shoddy internet, car with blown head-gasket, debt that has averaged between five and ten times what I have in the bank, or in assets, and have for perhaps a decade now. This situation reflects similarly the demographic of people I grew up with and know today. Sometimes I'm impressed with the level of progress I've accomplished. I used to be a lush, vagabond daydreamer who was confident I would make things happen quickly once I decided to start. I had no idea that my worst case scenario for making a living was exactly what I would have to face, and worse. **[2** I thought I'd be stuck in a crummy dead end job for years never going any where. Little did I know I would have to train for a year to get certified to be accepted into a job/jobs that worked me like a mule untill my health began to wane before I would even find one of those dead end jobs that I currently work.**]**

Hopes and dreams.

All that this has taught me is that it really does take initiative and effort to provide for ones self. And even more so to work towards an accptable quality of life (what I would find acceptable, it's pretty basic). From here on out I wan't to start making things happen for myself to lift me out of this oppressively unhealthy living situation. I've opened a paypal and Ebay to begin selling all the crap I've collected over the years. All my old original video game systems and game collection that I thought I would keep when I was older, that my kids and guests could play, they all got to go. I'm plan to experiment with art and craft to see if any profit can be made from sales. Learn and practice new skills and services to offer. Continue learning about math and science in hopes of one day doing something with the knowledge. Learn programming and web development free online, etc. I can't tell what the future will bring. I just hope I can make things happen for me and find a comfortable way of life. And then have the resources and availability to better help others whom I care about.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,True,,,True,t3_pef04,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/pef04/should_we_be_telling_our_kids_they_could_grow_up/,

As many of my cohorts are unable to establish themselves in the grown up world, I see many of them immersing themselves in many forms of escapism and nihilistic lifestyles (Drugs, alcohol, excessive partying, pursuing modeling careers, thug life, etc).

As you might have guessed, like most of the readers of this subreddit I recently graduated from college and ended up in a situation where I am living in the same home as my parents (sorry if I am vague, I don't really want to delve into details beyond the obvious).  I've been with them for about 4 months now, and I've pretty luckily found ways to keep busy (therefore avoiding absolute stircraziness).  My problem is that I feel that, in coming home to live in the same place I lived during high school, my parents have suddenly returned to a mindset where I am a high school student again, and are trying to coddle me (buying food for me, preparing meals for me, etc) as though I am absolutely helpless.  When I was in college I absolutely did learn how to clean for myself, and while my cooking skills weren't ideal, they were still decent enough that I could still make some really interesting meals.

I guess the crux of the matter is that I really want to have more control over my life, and not to be infantilized. I wish that I could have my own apartment and do things on my own, but until I'm in a better situation financially I more or less have to stay where I am (the alternative, moving out, which I know some people would tout as a solution would probably be financial ruin for me).  My parents are pretty stubborn, and past attempts at trying to get them to respect my boundaries and not act as though I were a teenager have pretty much failed (mostly because of the fact that they just can't get over their perception of me as younger than I am).

All I have enough for is rent, food, transportation, a little savings, and two mochas a week (my one indulgence).

I've bought into it. i bought into an attack on another demographic just because I was told they were saying and doing bad things through the media. I was talking about the 5 or 6 companies that completely fucked their workers retirement plans on this very sub. Those were just the 5 or 6 companies large enough to make national news. Think about how many times that model was replicated throughout the country.  

Yes, I understand that the primary demographic of the people who really really piss us off are part of that generation. But I am positive there is a vast swathe of people who have been fucked over as hard or harder than people in our generation. This isn't about our generation vs their generation. They can be our allies in a greater movement if we don't kick them like they were kicked by their peers. 

Think about people being denied medical care at an older age. Think about companies that fired people before they hit the mandatory minimum to retire. Think about all the companies that restructured benefits packages in bankruptcies but still pay one man the equivalent of what it would cost to properly fund the retirement package. Think about the companies so focused on next quarters gains that they completely ran a profitable business into the ground destroying the retirement plan.

I'm turning 23 in a month and I'm going to cut my hair the way I've always wanted to (even though it's an ""emo"" style and is much more fitting for a teen than an adult), and I'm going to color it - scarlet or bright pink or bright blue, I don't care at this point. But I'm going to do it.

I am going to give up my guilt about not being good enough. It doesn't matter that most of my friends are about to graduate with their Bachelors - if not their *Masters*! - and I'm not even close to done with my Associates. It doesn't matter if I never get my Associates.

I'm giving up the self-doubt and self-hate that have always been a central part of my person. I am going to learn how to be comfortable in my own skin, whatever that takes.

I'm giving up feeling lost in an uncaring world. I am going to surround myself with friends and chosen family (like my husband) and god*dammit* I am going to be happy. Because my life does *not* suck. I have depression, yes. I'm lazy and kind of an underachiever, sure. I don't look like how I want to look, okay. But I just realized - I can choose if I want to be those or not.

I am going to begin talk therapy. I am going to continue taking my medications. I am going to eventually return to school and get a degree for whatever I choose I want to do.

LostGen, I give up being lost.

Context: I ask this since I'm currently working with a group of high school seniors concerning college/career advisement. I've supplemented statistical resources (i.e. bls.gov) to the career adviser whose running the after school class. However, I'd like to hear from you guys here since I feel most of you have great personal experiences to share that would have a positive impact on upcoming freshmen. 

Update: Thank you all for the responses. I forwarded this post to the career adviser a few days ago. She ended up implementing it in one of her lesson plans.

I ended up working as a bike mechanic after a few months of searching for work. I have been at the place since August. Sales are great, December was about $20k in sales at each store and we were already down to only one guy working per day. Of that about half is profit.

So today my boss sends me a message over Google chat that the owner called him in and said I'm going to get laid off. Sales were up 15% over last year and out profit margins are great. So for all that hard work the last five months I get the axe.

What sucks is I don't know if Ill qualify for unemployment since I only worked there 5 months. California's documents on qualifying aren't the best. I'm just angry over all this. Work hard, do a good job, and lose your job. The owner says that the next few months will be slow but looking historically they are not.

I understand if I took my own money and put it into a business I would want to reep the benefits and profit from taking all that risk yet at the same time I don't think I could drive around in a $50,000 car while paying my workers so little or laying them off while business was still good. Maybe thats a difference between the ""lost generation"" and the ""Me"" generation.

Now I'm looking into unemployment benefits, selling some stock so I have a buffer, looking into getting my one student loan delayed for hardship, and looking at other cities to move to.

However I work in the telecommunications/IT/sales industry. Not having one or all of these devices can eliminate your viability for a position due to not possessing the accessibility/technological capacity to work for them. I spent 4 months unemployed this summer with my iphone. I traveled for my previous employer with my iphone due to their reluctance/inability to provide me with a laptop to do my job. And I was still contracted to keep my iphone even when the company closed their doors in my community and I found myself looking for a job. 

As I visited a food bank after 3 months of unemployment, I realized that I had better leave my phone out of sight as I would be inviting judgement and scorn. Lo and behold, it was my familiarity with Apple devices that ended up giving me a leg up on my new position at a new job. (Where I took the 35% pay cut because I was offered the job, as the unemployment law in my state would have me do.)

Is there any real way the masses can be educated on the fact that technology is really not a luxury in this day &amp; age if you plan on being ""employable""?

I'll admit that its pretty fucking scary and unethical that they're handing them out in fields like anesthesiology. But god damn it if its not tempting to pay $190 for a bachelors in business or marketing just to see what kinds of opportunities that would open up for me to have on my resume. And from what I've researched, they hold up pretty well. Especially since most employers don't dig much further into it unless you're shooting for some really high ranking position. What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone ever bought one? If so, what came of it? Aside from potentially losing your job if ever being found out, would there be any legal ramifications if you were to be found in possession of one of these degrees?

""A note to readers: This was written for a special centennial issue of the NYT magazine. The instructions were to write it as if it were in an issue 100 years in the future, looking back at the past century.

...

*The devaluation of higher education*. In the 1990s everyone believed that education was the key to economic success, for both individuals and nations. A college degree, maybe even a postgraduate degree, was essential for anyone who wanted a good job as one of those ""symbolic analysts"".

But computers are very good at analyzing symbols; it's the messiness of the real world they have trouble with. Furthermore, symbols can be quite easily transmitted to Asmara or La Paz and analyzed there for a fraction of the cost of doing it in Boston. So over the course of this century many of the jobs that used to require a college degree have been eliminated, while many of the rest can, it turns out, be done quite well by an intelligent person whether or not she has studied world literature.

This trend should have been obvious even in 1996. After all, even then America's richest man was Bill Gates, a college dropout who didn't seem to need a lot of formal education to build the world's most powerful information technology company.

Or consider the panic over ""downsizing"" that gripped America in 1996. As economists quickly pointed out, the rate at which Americans were losing jobs in the 90s was not especially high by historical standards. Why, then, did downsizing suddenly become news? Because for the first time white-collar, college-educated workers were being fired in large numbers, even while skilled machinists and other blue-collar workers were in high demand. This should have been a clear signal that the days of ever-rising wage premia for people with higher education were over, but somehow nobody noticed.

Eventually, of course, the eroding payoff to higher education created a crisis in the education industry itself. Why should a student put herself through four years of college and several years of postgraduate work in order to acquire academic credentials with hardly any monetary value? These days jobs that require only six or twelve months of vocational training -- paranursing, carpentry, household maintenance (a profession that has taken over much of the housework that used to be done by unpaid spouses), and so on -- pay nearly as much as one can expect to earn with a master's degree, and more than one can expect to earn with a Ph.D.. And so enrollment in colleges and universities has dropped almost two-thirds since its turn-of-the-century peak. Many institutions of higher education could not survive this harsher environment. The famous universities mostly did manage to cope, but only by changing their character and reverting to an older role. Today a place like Harvard is, as it was in the 19th century, more of a social institution than a scholarly one -- a place for the children of the wealthy to refine their social graces and make friends with others of the same class.""

Don't get screwed by the cost of living!,44,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/jctmi/considering_moving_for_a_job_dont_get_screwed_by/,"[Kiplinger's City Price Index](http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/bestcities_sort/index.php?sortby=cost&amp;sortorder=ASC)

I just wanted to post this as a fellow lostgeneration wanderer, since I found it useful. If you're considering moving to accept a job, make sure you look at how much it costs to live in the city before you go.

It would really, really suck if you accepted a job for a modest increase from your current salary, only to find that the cost of living in the target city meant you lost money overall.

To use this tool: 

1. Take your current salary, multiply by cost-of-living-index of the city you want to go to. 
2. Divide that number by the cost-of-living-index of the city you're in. 

The end result is approximately the amount your salary needs to be in order for you to ""break even"", should you move to the new city.

Elizabethan England had an unprecedented level of education, and the problem we face today, no idea of where to put these minds to work. An educated middle class was unheard of, there wasn't an economic model built for them.

Fortunately, England was experiencing a boom in interest in the theater. On any given night, 2% of the population of London was at a show, and 30% went to the theater at least once a month. These middle class college graduates went to work in literature.

We have similar opportunities in the arts today, just look at how much literature and music is consumed by the average person. Kindle and iTunes let you cut out a lot of the middle men and take home a large portion of the revenue, and more importantly, there's no real gatekeepers to publishing. It's still a tough business, and you have to hustle just to reach the poverty level, but I think represents some real opportunities for a lot of us. There's demand for more webdesign and graphic arts, and DIY movies are realistic with production costs plummeting.

Today we'd call Elizabethan writers ""entitled"" for sticking with the arts instead of returning to the manual trades of their fathers. But, if they had settled for McJobs, William Shakespeare would have been making gloves, Christopher Marlowe would have been making shoes, Edmund Spencer spinning cloth, and John Donne would have been smelting iron. (Those are the actual jobs their fathers worked.)

Share your tips on how you're one-up on our crappy society and its BS and assist your peers.

I'll go first:
1) Stop blaming boomers for your situation instead of trying to better yourself -- you can always seethe with hatred later when they can't pay for retirement and are working at McD.
2) Write your cover letters and resumes in a unique manner, omitting all the formal BS. Standing out from the other 100 resumes is worth more than you think.
3) Network effectively. Shoot off 5 emails a day to people you'd actually like to work for while stressing your strengths and that you'd like to work for them. (I actually got my job this way). Apparently 80% of job vacancies are not publicly posted -- I believe it.
4) Freelance, start a business, or just hire yourself in general. It's much easier than you think. Not having to rely on a boss for work = awesome.
5) Tune out negativity. Surround yourself with ambitious smart people -- smarter than yourself if they'll tolerate you. Don't let people talk you out of what you want.
6) Don't subscribe to the college &gt; job &gt; marriage &gt; kids &gt; retire &gt; die plan if you don't want to. There are infinite possibilities. Frankly, that one sucks.

Last thing I've realized, if you're doing what everyone else is doing its either

Become a Customs broker.

[What is a Customs broker?](http://www.boskage.com/whatisabroker/)

**What are the requirements?**

* Be a U.S. Citizen
* Be at least 21 years old
* Not be a current U.S. government employee
* Be of good moral character
* Pass the Customs Broker License Examination
* Submit a broker license application with appropriate fees
* Investigation and approval of application by CBP

The test itself is offered twice a year by Customs (Oct. and Apr.) and costs $200 to take, if I recall correctly. There are courses online and near most major port cities, but you could study by yourself by taking past exams and researching the answers online.

You'll need the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) and Customs regulations (Chapter 19) to take the test - both available online for studying, but you'll need hard copies for the test since it's open book.

**Why am I recommending this?**

* Imports are huge business right now, just look at everything that we buy/use that's made abroad.
* It seems like most people don't even know what Customs brokerage is. This is good for someone wanting to get into the business, especially because... (next point)
* Many people in this business are old. And they're going to retire in the next 10-15 years. It's a big opportunity for people our age.

A little bit about me - 29, went abroad to teach English after graduating from college in 2005, came back in 2008 after things went to shit, and found myself unemployed for about 6 months not knowing what to do. My degree is in Film so it's just another ""worthless"" liberal arts degree, but I knew I didn't want to end up in the retail or service industries (NTTAWWT).

A family friend in shipping recommended taking the Customs Broker exam and since I had nothing else going on, I did. With only a month of studying, I got almost a passing score (missed by 3 or 4 questions I think) and that was with no experience at all. Soon after, I landed a job at a Customs brokerage/freight forwarder doing Customs entry writing (the data entry work required for imports).

Started at $14/hour and three years later I'm making $40,000/year + health insurance, 15 sick/vacation days, and a yearly bonus (not great, but I don't have my license yet, either). I'll be taking the exam again in October and with all my experience I feel pretty confident about passing.

**Payscale.com average Customs broker salary** - (http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customs_Broker/Salary)[http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customs_Broker/Salary] - Somewhere between $35k-75k/year depending on experience and location.

**TL;DR** - Start studying for the October Customs Broker exam now. Look for a job as a Customs entry writer and make sure you let them know you'll be taking the Customs broker exam. It should be a good way to get your foot in the door.

The best thing is that once you have your license, you can become self employed and pretty easily work from a home office as long as you have access to emails, fax, and a phone. But it would be best to get some office experience first, learn how to handle shipments, and then maybe 5-10 years down the line think about the self employment route.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_w53dr,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/w53dr/career_ideaopportunity_for_those_in_the_lost/,
1329551872.0,35,self.lostgeneration,pv1pa,Medical bills have killed any chance of me ever having a good job in the US. ,41,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/pv1pa/medical_bills_have_killed_any_chance_of_me_ever/,"I got sick about a year ago. I got a bill for around 60,000 dollars in the mail to fix the problem. I currently have $30,000 in student loans and I am at least 1 year away from graduation because i started in culinary and it took that for me to realize that i could actually do well in college. Plus two credit cards i defaulted on trying to keep up with the payments for the massive Hospital bill. In total $96,000. 

I have almost been hired for two really good jobs and then been declined for the position due to the poor credit score i receive. I just got the 2nd rejection today. I know the student loan debt is high but what else can you do when you make just barely enough to get by and have to buy $1,000 worth of books and pay a $4,000 tuition after the scholarship you have received. 

I don't go to some super amazing school it just the state college i live in. I barely make enough to have the occasional meal that isn't pre-packaged crap. 

It is depressing to know that i will never make enough to be able to stay in the United States once my degree is completed. The payment the hospital is asking for is $600 a month which is the interest per month plus about 50 bucks. It will take me around 100 years to pay it back at those rates. The payment my student loans will be asking for is $350. I'm sure i can work something out to make the minimum payments on the credit cards for around 100 bucks. So when I'm out of school i will have to make at least $1050 in payments every month. that is $12,600 I will owe every year for at least the next 10 years after i am out of college. If i made $40,000 a year I will possibly have $33,000 after taxes. Minus the $12,600 you come to $20,400. $1,000 a month for expenses like bills, rent, and car insurance I will have $8,400. I like to do this thing called eating about once a day so there goes another $3,600 and bam my savings for the year is $4,800.

$5k a year and no fun for the rest of my life. Sounds amazing huh.

Tl;DR: If i stay in the US for the rest of my life I will undoubtedly be working poor for the rest of my life. I've never felt more hopeless in my life and I am only 26. Never committed a crime and can't get jobs the same as if i was a felon.

### What makes a lost generation?

While a society is in the process of collapsing, every generation is lost. Why? Their education was a political approval process and is now worthless. Their society is overrun by corruption. Their fellow citizens oblivious. And everyone's in denial.

### How do you fix this situation?

(1) Acknowledge that your society/civilization is dying.

http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Fail-Succeed/dp/0143036556/

(2) Rebuild along practical lines.

* Forget the politics
* Focus on what works
* Find something to unite yourselves

Those are all good goals!  I just wanted to say that your job and your life are not the same thing.  If you forget whatever vision you have of a ""dream job"" where you feel fulfilled and validated every day by your unique and vital contribution to society and get paid for it you'll realize that such a scenario isn't necessarily what you'd want anyway.  Don't let your job options determine what you do and what you care about.  Your energy is yours, use it for what you want.  You'll need a job to pay the rent, live around the people and places you want and to get the things you need.  As long as that job doesn't come with screaming bosses and people all up in your shit all day long it's a GREAT JOB!  Take the check, don't work very hard, go home and get back to your real life.

You can (and will have to) change jobs regularly.  As you gain exposure to the business world and learn about whatever field you find work in you'll realize that most of what you thought about ""work"" was entirely wrong in the first place.  Work should be avoided.  If you can do something in your spare time that can be profitable then find a way to make that work for you.  Don't make that your only goal in life. 

tl;dr: separate your real life goals from your work life and you'll be much happier.    ",,False,self,t5_2r40j,False,,,True,t3_avkus,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/avkus/your_job_is_not_your_life/,

But in the ""Don't default"" tips it has lots of horrible consequences if you default such as ""Your wages could be garnished"" ""You might not be able to get a mortgage, rent an apartment,etc"" and ""You might not find employment if those employers do credit checks."" 

Those are very scary consequences, and the booklet even has the gall to suggest that student loans are right for most people? What is this nonsense!? It's almost like they are trying to get students to get the loans, and break hell loose on them even if they miss just one payment. What is this madness, for real?

The booklet is called ""Your federal student loans: learn the basics and manage your debt."" 

What do you think of this tactic people, have you been suckered in to getting student loans because people have told you it's a smart thing to do? What are your experiences? (I do not have any student loans now because I decided not to go to a four year, I am in a community college now.)

They can also call you in for emergencies on weeknights and weekends so I couldn't even get a second job.

[Acedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia) is a bit of a forgotten concept, but it's basically a sort of ennui brought about by the repetitive nature of daily life. It's often characterized by discontent, difficulty in appreciating the present situation (no matter how good), inability to move forward, desire to runaway from your current situation and start afresh, etc.  I think the description reads like a typical Lost Gen subreddit post.

The radio program talks a bit about it's history, and how certain situations (e.g. idealism running into capitalist culture) can lead to increased experience of acedia.  Even though the program doesn't offer any panaceas, I found it comforting to hear that this has been a recognized problem in different cultures and at many different times throughout humanity.  It isn't some modern malaise.

One of the main points of /r/lostgeneration is to help and support one another. Hell this is probably the main point. So I figure that we should all start a goal list for the next year and post it. Then find someone with similar goals and support them. Help keep them motivated, give them advice, etc. This will not only help them, but help keep you motivated as well. Everyone wins.

A couple notes, it is probably best to keep your lists short. Choose big things (or little ones), but no more than 5 or 10 I'd say.

They can help us in our understanding. So what is it? First we'd be wise to look at what preceded it, that being Modernism and Post-Modernism.

A really simplified way of thinking about it would be...

*Modernism:* Everything was absolute, empirically defined and discoverable. Science is king, everything is part of a big picture.

*Post-Modernism:* can be thought of as a reaction to Modernism. Things became relative, context driven and inventable. Culture is king, there was a de-construction of a big picture.

What's happening now is a growing awareness (particularly in the art world) that [""Postmodernism is dead.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/PostPoMo/comments/ysf41/postmodernism_is_dead_prospect_magazine/) - and we're beginning to see the glimpses of a new era emerging. It goes by various names depending on who you talk to and it's context - but can be broadly thought of as

*Post-Postmodernism:* which seems to a return (or atleast striving for) a big picture, a new sincerity that uses modernist notions, post-modernist sensibilities but exists beyond those two and creates something new.

I saw no virtue down that road but *there is* an undeniable pressure to follow it and I don't think I have any fight left in me. For the sake of my sanity, I'm going to succumb to it. Is this what is called growing up? I'm twenty three and I'm still trying to figure that one out.

I'm fucking sick of feeling sorry for myself, feeling disillusioned and feeling at odds with the world around me. I'm done acting like a spoiled child because at the end of the day, I have it so much easier than majority of people alive. I think I inherently resist too much and that has brought me no happiness so far, time to try something else. 

In this world, at least in western society, you need money to survive. It's a necessary commodity and I'm pretty certain your involvement in society revolves around it. I think part of the reason why I was so resistant is because I was afraid of the hard work, the challenge and the competition that I need to overcome in order to succeed. It's tough, why should life be this tough? Many times I have thought about living a lesser existence (whatever that means) by moving to a different country and making just enough to provide me with sustenance while doing things I want to (making music, outdoor sports, exploring, learning and acquiring knowledge etc.). 

Maybe that's just the cowardly way out. 

I don't think there is a job out there that I feel passionate enough to dedicate to, or at least I haven't found out what it is yet, even after 23 years. *I was reassured that I would eventually find it.* But I've wasted enough time searching so I'm just going to sell out. Finish my degree, find a job - that's what's on my immediate to-do list. Whatever job it is, I'll do it. I really don't like how our lives revolve around money but it's a necessary evil to live in this society. 

No, I'm not happy about all this but as I mentioned, I'm all out of ideas.

It's not like most of us really had a choice in going to college, the constant refrain was go to college or flip burgers our whole lives. Our parents and grandparents didn't start their adult lives with this burden, so if it is *essential* to the nation that we be educated why should we?

Maxed out all the loans I qualify for and I'm still coming up short. Don't qualify for third party loans, no help from family... If my life gets completely derailed by this I don't really see any other options for me in the long run.

PS: The supreme ""FUCK YOU"" here is that if I can't find a way to fund my education for this last year the legislation change will have effectively screwed me in such a way that I acquired 5 figures in student loans but I won't have an actual degree via a technicality.

Taken in that light it would have been better to simply never have received PELL money, so that I wouldn't have even attempted school again. This change was both heartless and clumsy.

I just heard this on NPR Monday. They barely gave the author anytime to stress his case. but what he says in the segment hit home pretty hard. So I bought his book and it turned out to be a nice read. The book is cheap and a nice short read. I don't know who the book is specifically written for, or how this is going to help but I enjoyed it. It's nice to see that people are starting to recognize the issues that are plaguing this generation. The book breaks down with evidence how the problem with people not finding work is really a systematic problem exacerbated by modern technology.

Let me first say, I am probably a lot like you. I remember being a kid in the 90s, when gas was under a dollar, Bill Clinton was president, and college tuition cost a few grand a year.

Yes, the future looked bright back then. Then after 9/11 it seems like this country started going downhill fast. Terrorism, George W. Bush, gas prices, two wars, environmental disasters, student loan debt. 

I'm not mentioning those things to make you depressed. The default would be to think that we got cheated, that our generation got shafted by the old and the rich. But let me go M. Night Shyamalan on your asses for a second. We are actually the rich ones. 

They might have the money, but even the richest old person couldn't buy another second of youth. Our eyes still work, we don't have wrinkles, we still have hair on our head. If we want, we can stay up all night and still feel great the next day. And our boners are rock solid. 

So let's think very closely about what we want to do with our energy and youth. Let's not succumb to the conditioning that we are still just ""powerless"" children. We don't have to take their shitty jobs or trade our true riches for their paper riches. We can do whatever the fuck we want. 

Let's make a list. What products or services could you provide RIGHT NOW to help bring more happiness and success to others of your generation, your community, your society? 

We're gonna be poor too one day, so let's make our lives count, so that when we are old we don't just have paper money but wisdom as well.",,False,self,t5_2r40j,True,,,True,t3_d51ww,http://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/d51ww/a_message_to_you_the_young_generation_of_the_usa/,

Since September 1, 2001, I have woken up every day to be kicked in the balls.  I've seen every dream, hope, goal, and long term plan fail right before my eyes.  I tried to get into grad school, but two of the three people who agreed to write letters of recommendation for me did not do so.  Most companies to whom I send resumes don't even read the cover letter before sending me a form letter saying that I'm not a good fit for their position or deleting it entirely.  And career fairs are a waste of my time and dry cleaning bills.  I have been told that I am a selfish and overly demanding person to expect to get a job that I can afford to take (meaning that I can afford to commute to and from work, much less pay any of my bills or eat), and I probably am.

Within a year, I expect to be dead by my own hand, the victim of one too many misfortunes.  I expect to leave my parents' credit ruined.  I expect to have my memory cursed by my immediate family and forgotten by everyone else I've ever met (most of whom already have forgotten about me).  If I should survive, I expect to be unemployable for the rest of my life.

Within 20 years, I expect the civilization I have always known to collapse under its own excesses.  I expect that everything my ancestors fought for will be gone.  I expect that my nieces and nephews (I do not expect to have children, even if I should manage to survive until then--doing so would require finding one person who gives a shit about me personally) will be coming into a ruined world with no room for their parents, much less them.  I expect that we will no longer even have computers, as we've been catapulted back to medieval society.  I expect that everyone alive will starve to death.

I expect to be downvoted into oblivion and recommended to SW, even though I do not want that.  I expect meaningless posts of sympathy, telling me to hold on as it will get better, even though the typist doesn't believe that him or herself.

Volunteer work is said to be a way to prove that you're mature and responsible enough to get even a minimum-wage job. In many high schools, volunteering is a requirement for graduation. Unpaid internships are even difficult to get into, due to the abundance of applicants simply looking to get experience and references. It looks to me like society views young people as a source of free labor.

In previous decades, I think lots of teenagers would get jobs in the summer when they were off school, and those jobs would pay them well enough that they could afford luxuries like going to the movies and eating at restaurants and they could buy cars and pay for higher education themselves without going too deeply into debt. That seems to be almost a thing of the past. Does anyone else think that this expectation of volunteer work from teenagers might drive down wages? Why pay someone to do an unskilled job when you could get a teenager to do it for free just by telling them it'll help them get jobs eventually?

&gt;P: God damn shitboomers!

&gt;Q: Hey now, I know some Boomers who are perfectly nice and suffering just like us.

I think what's getting lost is the distinction between a generation and the dominant culture of that generation. When someone criticizes Boomers, they're not talking about just anyone born between 1946 and 1964, but rather people born in that time *and who subscribe to the dominant culture of their generation.*

It's like when we say that Congress is screwing shit up. Do we mean each and every member of both houses is a twit and ruining our country? (Wait... maybe a bad example?) What we mean is that the group dominating Congress is screwing shit up. We say ""Congress"" as a shorthand because giving the more detailed meaning just takes too long, and besides we kinda figure that the other person understands what we mean so it'd be redundant to explain it.

And by the way, I don't think this is commission of the No True Scotsman fallacy. NTS requires that there be no guiding principle to the classification.

Situation is this job is terrible, the respect is awful, they still owe me about 8 pay checks (including the last 3 weeks, and we get paid weekly), and the schedule is ALL over the place (I'm available 5:30a-9:30p everyday with the weekly schedule running Sun-Sat being issued late Friday night).  The instability of my schedule makes it impossible for me to do anything, and even when I sacrifice (I worked Thanksgiving, for example) the attitudes of management are very predatory and pissy.  It's not a great job, just an inbetweener.  

I do have another occasional job hosting karaoke at bars that, if I can work 2 gigs a week, pays more than this one.  But I constantly have to turn down gigs because of my unpredictable schedule.  (but those gigs aren't guaranteed either).  Also, I hate the manager and assistant manager and the only management I like just stepped down today.

I just wanted to share what may be the stupidest decision or a very liberating one with my fellow lost gens.  I mean I'm staying at the job for the money, but they aren't even paying me really.  It reminds me of when my grandparents told me about the depression and how my grandfather worked construction and they would wait to cash the check/pay bills because his paychecks often bounced (the construction companies would pay for the equipment rental before paying the workers.).

Perhaps we can all learn from it and benefit.

As a 26 year old Millennial, I sometimes feel out of touch with my peers, particularly the recent graduates that I work with.  Most of them come into a professional environment with minimal training.  They've done minimal work over the past year.  Now they expect a nice raise, bonus, and more responsibility (without the skills to execute on that responsibility).

Besides the generally poor attitude, I think the worst trait that I see in them is that they feel that the repetitive, boring, and unsexy tasks that they are given are beneath them.  For example, if I were to ask someone to take 1,000 identical files with a standard information form in them and enter them into an excel spreadsheet, they would do it carelessly and complain the whole time because they didnt feel it was important enough for them to be doing.  Despite the fact that such an exercise is critical to completeing a project.

It's very frustrating.

Obviously the risks for doing so would be great, but if a genuine coordinated effort were to be made and all/most free labor was eliminated simultaneously, we might just be able to send a message that the young people of the world are no longer going to be pushed around and extorted. That we have food to buy, bills to pay, and basic needs to be fulfilled, and that something needs to be done about this pitiful job market.
