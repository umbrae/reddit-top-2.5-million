We must get together and organise against Ed Vaizey's attack on Net Neutrality NOW before it is too late,217,16,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/e7u01/british_reddit_users_we_must_get_together_and/,"We've seen what our American friends can do when they put their minds to it, using this thing we call social networking.  

/r/UnitedKingdom has 6,805 readers and there are 4,442 readers in /r/ukpolitics.  We need to get the message out there to as many people as possible that the US style attack on Net Neutrality has come to our shores and we're not going to take it lying down.

The ConDem coalition think they are going to give Rupert Murdoch everything he wants and none of us are going to notice or care.  They are wrong.  If you care about independent journalism, informed opinion, democratic debate and fair funding for the arts, sciences, media and sports, write to every newspaper editor and local radio station you can, in your area and speak out NOW, before it's too late.

[Here is a copy of the letter I sent to my MP](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/e7l69/uk_government_minister_backs_an_end_to_net/c15ylky).  Use it as a template or Google Net Neutrality and read up on what it means to you and your freedom of speech.

You don't have to take to the streets throwing fire extinguishers at the police to air your views.  You can take 10 minuets during your lunch break to write a quick email, or have a conversation with a friend or family member about it.  Be involved.  Because if we let these people get away with this, they won't stop there.

Remember in the 80s when Satellite TV first came along and you could watch hundreds of different channels from across Europe?  RTL, ZDF, MTV (when it still played actual music) Eurosport, ScreenSport and so on?  Then one day Uncle Murdoch decided you had to pay twice as much to watch half as many channels?  That's what he's trying to do to the internet—and if we don't stop him now, that's exactly what Cameron and Clegg will let him get away with.

Some MPs and religious groups are mounting a campaign to push 'default on' network level blocking on the UK Internet.[1] [2] There is now a public consultation considering this idea.

[Email the consultation team now!](http://www.e-activist.com/ea-campaign/broadcast.response.do?ea.url.id=102592&amp;ea.campaigner.email=zmVuLnFlpOPDOLYFbD1IgGpyJGO3btBB&amp;ea_broadcast_target_id=0)

However well meaning, we know from our own research [3] what happens when ISPs put blocks on the Internet. Through accident or abuse, censorship leads to lots more content being blocked than originally intended.[4][5]

Sites will get blocked if they casually mention sex. Sexual health sites will get caught.[6] The websites of clubs and bars, personal blogs and community sites get filtered. Chat sites may be banned – because they might not be sufficiently “policed”. In short, if you’re small and independent, you will suffer.

Innovation and free speech are threatened by this clumsy website blocking. And the government is considering turning this on by default.[7] You may be presented with a list of ticked “filtered” categories, and have to untick them if you want to avoid the filtering.

And if this happens at the network, then future governments can easily extend what gets filtered without having to ask you. Mass censorship would be couple of clicks away.

We need you to help fight back: email the consultation team now!

**Here's what I submitted:**

A copy of this email is going to my MP. I am raising my concerns about the proposal for network
filtering of adult content and default blocking.

I would like to submit the following evidence:

Blocking of pornography via blanket filtering of the UK networks will never work. There is no
possible way you can implement a technology that will perfectly capture unwanted material without
blocking access to extremely important websites regarding sexual health, night clubs, even
teaching resources, articles and papers on human biology and studies. As an IT engineer I can
assure you anyone who states otherwise is simply a salesman for whichever unsuitable product
you plan to implement.

The simple fact is that PARENTS should be doing the filtering, NOT the government.

If you do not take the time to understand what your children are being exposed to, then get all up
in arms on religious and moral grounds when the fact is you simply couldn't have cared less when
you didn't know what they were viewing as long as they were quiet then you are quite simply an
UNFIT parent as it's on your head to govern what your child is exposed to.

Forcing this kind of blatant Orwellian censorship on the whole country is so far above your station
that you probably can't see your station from up there in the stratosphere without a telescope.

Pornography is NEVER pushed, it MUST be looked for. If your concerns are surrounding children
viewing objectionable material, perhaps a child that looks for those things is not as much of a child
as you think. Another thing to take note of is that blocking software ALREADY EXISTS for home
users. If you are concerned about what your children or family view online, install a copy and leave
everyone else out of it.

If you find something objectionable online, perhaps you shouldn't have been looking at sites that
affiliate with that material.

WE DO NOT SHARE YOUR VIEWS. FOR YOU TO TELL US WHAT IS MORALLY
OBJECTIONABLE IS IMPERTINENT, WRONG AND IT WILL NOT BE STOOD FOR. I DO NOT
WISH TO BE CENSORED.

Yours sincerely,

Me.",,False,,t5_2qhcv,False,,,True,t3_z4olf,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/z4olf/cross_post_from_runitedkingdom_mps_and_religious/,

Key points about the recent issues:
• Spain abandon the tripartite forum (dialogue forum with Gib, UK and Spain). Duely abandoning the [Cordoba agreement](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordoba_Agreement,_2006)
• Gibraltar government (elected in dec 2011) comit manifesto commitment of banning an illegal agreement by the previous administration that allowed fishing with nets in BGTW (British Gibraltar Territorial Waters).
• Spain's PP government who took office in dec 2011 also, had in their manifesto a commitment to rekindle the Gibraltar sovereignty issues.
• Spain impose lengthy queues of 6+ hours to try and make the Gib government to overturn the fishing laws.
• Gibraltar government commission a full environmental review of our marine environment and install artificial reefs to sustain the marine environment.
• Spain are hellbent on imposing a toll to either enter or leave Gibraltar. A toll of €50 (~£45) which they claim is to compensate the fishermans losses.

Points to note. One fishing vessel fished where the artificial reef has been layed. Dozens of artificial reefs have been laid in Andalucia, Spain. A neighbouring mayor and regional PP rep is supposedly renting the boat from the fisherman to create this very conflict.

We gotta vote for a Police and Crime Commissioner (presumably they will commission both police and crime, weird kinda job but what the hell). To save you the trouble I have had a quick squint at the candidates.


Robert Evans (Labour) - out of work wannabe politician has no fekkin idea what the job entails but is pretty sure that his previous experience as a teacher will help him spend the entire budget in 3 months.


Kevin Hurley (Saloon Bar Zero Tolerance Independent) - Semi-mental Captain Mainwaring type who was a Police bureaucrat. His first act will be to order himself a uniform more befitting a 1960's African dictator and a Hummer. His second will be to carpet bomb Croydon.


Julie Iles (Tories) - Identikit Tory mother-hen type who will tell everyone to pull their socks up and then come round our houses and clean our faces with 'spit-on-a-hankey'.


Nick O'Shea (LibDems) - a desperate tosser thrashing around for a job before the next electoral bloodbath overtakes his party. Laughably promises more integration into Europe for the Surrey Police. Typical LibDem bedwetter that can't understand why his party is lower in the polls than Jimmy Saville .


Robert Shatwell (UKIP) - Great name, was a constable for 18 years which I am sure will help him deal with the high-ranking 'real' police officers he'll have to work with. Get the impression he doesn't really want the job but was pushed into it by UKIP central: ""Go on Shatters, you was a copper weren't ya?..."".

 
Peter Williams (Independent Professional Trougher) - currently chairman of the Police Authority been feeding at the public trough all of his life. Was too lazy to write his own candidate statement. Comes across as a big-headed fekker who thinks he is 'entitled' to the job. Probably sees the other candidates as nicking one of his public wage packets.


Pretty much an uninspiring bunch of sad gits who all fancy the £100k salary, some of them because its the only salary they are likely to get in the near future and the rest because they could do with some more pin money.

https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/stop-and-search

I'm sure most of you have seen this movie plastered all over reddit. If not check it out.

http://www.actofterrordocumentary.com/
 
**Only 9% of the 1.2 million stop-and-search incidents that took place every year led to an arrest.** The search-to-arrest ratio varied from 3% in Cumbria, to 7% the West Midlands, and 8% in Manchester and in London, where most stop-and-searches take place.

Under current laws, **police need to have reasonable grounds to suspect** that the subject is **guilty of some form of criminal behaviour before they can conduct a search. Officers must be accountable for the decisions they make as part of their commitment to policing by consent.**

It takes **16 minutes** for an officer **to conduct a stop and search** and complete the paperwork. ""dreadful waste of police time"", Theresa May added.

**Last year this took up 312,000 hours - equal to 145 full-time officers doing nothing else**, Mrs May told the House.

When the tactic was misused it wasted police time and undermined public confidence. **No-one should be stopped just on the basis of their appearance.**

Home secretary tells MPs **black people are seven times more likely to be searched** on the street than white people

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that five forces, including the Metropolitan **Police, had reduced their use without compromising crime reduction.**

*""It can be embarrassing, it can be upsetting and it has a ripple effect through that person and their family and friends,""*

**This consultation is not just a paper exercise!**

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18567855

On the other, successive governments have driven up house prices by restricting supply:

http://puu.sh/3SCcM.png

Those very taxpayers who are funding others' housing bills are exactly those who bought their houses in cheaper times, and are now sitting on massive gains from their housing.

Indeed, one of my coworker's acquaintances bought a house five years ago, and its price appreciation is about equal to everything he earned from working over the same period.

In London most people wouldn't even dream of buying a property until their mid-late 30s, and then only if they were buying as a couple with a double income.  What else can you do when £250k will only buy you a tiny flat in a grotty area?

The government is further attempting to prop up the UK housing market through the help-to-buy scheme, rather than do the sensible thing and let house prices come back to earth.

So in fact what the Conservatives are proposing is to take away support from those people who have been most hurt by housing price inflation (the young), in order to be 'fair' on those who have been fattened by the government's encouragement of rising house prices.  

Since when was it 'fairness' to help middle-aged people sitting on hundreds of thousands of pounds of gains by taking away the support without which young people would find it impossible to live in the cities? 

NB - mainly talking about London here, but the same is true to a reduced extent elsewhere too.

NB#2 - This isn't even about redistribution or socialism or anything like that - it's just crazy to want to stack things against the young and then blame them when you're paying a lot to house them.",,False,,t5_2qhcv,1375548727.0,,,True,t3_1jmbdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1jmbdi/the_housing_benefit_contradiction/,

I don't necessarily support any side of the whole HoL reform debate, because I feel as if I don't know enough of the details. But, from what I can ascertain, it seems as if people only support an elected HoL because they assume democratic = good.

- Most importantly, sovereignty would be disputed. We would get the deadlock as seen the in USA. If they're both elected, then why should House of Commons supersede the Lords?

- Currently, the House of Commons supersedes the House of Lords on matters if they so wish. I honestly don't know where people get this idea that the House of Lords have significant power. The House of Lords improves legislation and does not change core principles of it - in doing so would have to seek permission of the Commons.

- It's not as 'undemocratic' as people believe. Only 92 hereditary peers remain, a far cry from the amount there were before the reforms under Blair. Most are appointed, and subsequently only those whom have completed their (often Bushiness related) careers - thus (in theory) bringing a high degree of intelligence and experience.

- Any reform occurring under this coalition would most likely lead to 80% elected, 20% appointed (or whatever ratio it is) - not democracy in it's purest sense. Being elected brings a whole host of drawbacks - mainly, Lords will be forced to take actions while always considering accountability and popularity, something that prevents honest and frank discussions. Elected peers are not likely to have the diverse range of experience that would be found within the House of Lords today - instead being younger people from a more narrow background (most likely would only have worked in Politics).

- Also, I suppose the generic argument of 'Conservative Pragmatism' whereby 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' could be applied here. We also have not had major revolutions, coups or upheavals for centuries - perhaps showing the effectiveness of our system as It's adapted to our needs, despite looking convoluted and out of date on paper.

Again, I'm not sure any of these arguments are valid, so if someone whom either is for or against reforms could provide some insight as to how they reached their opinions, or could scrutinise mine would be really helpful!

1374590172.0,78,self.ukpolitics,1ivwka,[X-Post /r/United Kingdom] Concerned about Privacy? Net Filtering? GCHQ's Involvement in PRISM &amp; Tempora? So are we: Introducing The UK's Reinst8 Movement.,102,24,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1ivwka/xpost_runited_kingdom_concerned_about_privacy_net/,"**(If you're already interested, feel free to skip the text wall: /r/ReinstateArticle8)**

 

As you may already know, we've been pushing hard over the last few weeks to get something, anything started that even vaguely resembles a movement towards raising awareness as to the dire straits in which privacy has found itself (or rather, in which we've found *it*) over the past few months.

 

The product of all this discussion, voting, more discussion and, yes, more voting is this: /r/ReinstateArticle8, the now-home of the (#)Reinst8 Movement.

 

I'd like to keep this description relatively brief, as there's a tonne of information on the Sub already (and you can catch a number of us on IRC for more details) but you can think of Reinst8 as analogous to the US's RestoreThe4th campaign. Essentially, we exist to promote the restoration of privacy in the digital age and to *reinstate* (hello) those civil liberties which are being stolen from under our feet. Nebulous, you say? Perhaps, but the ideology has to govern the action. With the focus on a clear-cut message (of the kind 'Don't invade our privacy; don't encroach on our liberty' - slogan is in the works, so don't worry if you hate my wording) rather than on specific actions (PORN FILTERS BAD, TWO LEGS GOOD), we ought to be able to inspire a far more broad, far more lasting change, if only in providing people with the facts of the matter in all their terrible glory.

 

We are very much in the setting-up phase, at present, and have been fortunate to happen upon a rather excellent team comprised of an extremely valuable skill-set (some very experienced Reddit mods, some web-devs, some people with legal and political experience). **However, we [almost certainly need you](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReinstateArticle8/comments/1iujx1/reinst8_needs_you/)**.

 

If you've even a fleeting interest in digital privacy, in the atrocity of an opt-out filtering system as announced recently, in promoting a fair and considered approach to censorship in the modern age, then I strongly urge you to get involved. You don't need any particular skills, just an interest. Our primary goal is to get people talking, to raise the debate to a national level and, ultimately, to inspire action where once ill-informed apathy was found.

[I didn’t vote Lib Dem to get a Tory government...](http://www.liberal-vision.org/2010/05/10/i-didn’t-vote-lib-dem-to-get-a-tory-government/)

&gt; IF I am to believe some posts, thousands, indeed “hundreds of thousands” are about to walk away from the Lib Dems because “they didn’t vote Lib Dem to get a Tory government”.

&gt;I found it a bit annoying when I first heard it - but as this sentiment seems to be spreading - I am getting increasingly irritated by it. In part it’s because I hate that sort of post-event whinging ( “I didn’t get what I wanted so I will throw my toys out of the pram”) but there are more specific reasons why it’s getting under my skin…..

&gt;1.     No one voted to get a Tory government. People voted to elect their constituency  MP (or indeed to stop a constituency MP) and hoped that others across the country would vote similarly (the only way to “stop” a Tory (or indeed Labour) government). That worked in some area’s - which is why there are fewer Tory MP’s than anyone expected. Even if “voting Lib Dem” in one area did stop a Tory, clearly not enough people in enough areas did the same - hence the situation we are in. The idea that one vote for one local MP would somehow stop a whole government is laughable.

 

&gt;2.    This seems to throw the blame onto the Lib Dems when the blame (if that is the right word - which it probably isn’t) sits with the voters. If this nation really cared about stopping the Tories (or indeed Labour) more people would have voted Lib Dem. That would have given Nick a much stronger negotiating position to choose who to talk to and on what terms. Just because Mrs Miggins voted Lib Dem to stop the local Tory, does not mean that Mrs Miggins view out trumps the nations view. And whilst she and those like her might whinge now, they have to look at themselves frankly and ask whether, if they cared that much, they could have done more. Goodness knows I think Nick did his bit.

 

&gt;3.    Actually the Lib Dems HAVE STOPPED a Tory government - or at least stopped such a strong Tory government that they can ride rough-shod over everyone. Had the Tories taken the Lib Dem seats they targeted we would already have Mr Cameron at No 10. As we stand here now, it is likely/possible that the Lib Dems have the ability to be a balancing item on Tory legislation. And even if a coalition doesn’t happen the Tory party will have to listen to its own backbenchers much more than the previous regime - and indeed listen to the Lib Dems- that’s in part a result of people voting Lib Dem.

 

&gt;4.    Perhaps most importantly it’s annoying because Nick Clegg could not have been clearer, throughout the general election, that the Lib Dems would not decide who to talk to in the event of a hung parliament - he would NOT be kingmaker. It would be the people who would dictate it by virtue of which party  had the largest mandate. It is demonstrably clear that the Tories have the most seats and the largest vote share. In these circumstances, had Nick decided to ignore the Tories, I think the country would have rightly been outraged that Nick had gone back on his word. Where were these people-  who are now complaining that they did not vote Lib Dem to get a Tory government - during the last 4 weeks? Integrity matters - and like the outcome we find ourselves in or not (mainly “not”)- Nick has shown to be a man of integrity - and that counts for a lot these days

Generally speaking the public either agrees with it, is apathetic, or at the very least tolerates those who use cannabis. The likelihood is every Briton reading this knows at least a few people who do smoke weed. The government has placed the drug in class-B (placing it amongst amphetamine), yet remains very lenient in the punishments granted to non-dealing users. Illustrating that even our government, the most complex network of idiots on the island, acknowledges that it is commonly used and its users are effectively harmless.

I'm just confused why there doesn't seem to be any kind of visible campaigning or talk of a referendum. Especially with some US states having legalised recreational marijuana use recently.

",80,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/h4chb/av_and_where_applicable_councilregional_assembly/,"It's almost midnight, so a serious note in the form of a self post...  The biggest issue in elections is apathy, the reason we see piss poor MP's and Councillors is because people don't bother to vote, don't know who is standing and don't therefore exercise any influence in the political system.  

In the 2010 GE there was a 65% turnout, 35% of voters simply didn't bother.  In council elections turn out is ofter far, far lower, down below 30% in some areas.  

So find out, if you don't already know, who your candidates are and vote.  On AV, look at the question and answer it as you see fit, it's something you potentially won't be asked again for a long time.

If you haven't voted before take a look at [this](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/how_do_i_vote.aspx), it is really, it's easy, you don't get a lolly or anything, but you do get a say in your future.  Especially at the moment with local service cuts and spending decisions.  

Remember that your local council's election services people will be able to tell you where your polling stations are and you can use any of them.  Assuming you are registered (if you are not, it's too late for this round, but register whilst it's on your mind!) you should have received a card telling you where your local polling station is, so that should make it a little easier too.

If you can't vote in person for whatever reason, an emergency proxy vote 
might still be available to you, for medical reasons you should be able to get one up until 5pm on polling day.

I can't emphasise this enough, if you don't vote then you don't matter, it means that the blocks of people who do vote (they are also the people at your NPT meetings, council meetings and other community stuff - seriously, go to those if you can, there is a lot going on locally that has a real impact) will vote the way they normally do and you will be swept along. 

That 60 year old woman at the end of your road who calls the police when there are kids playing in the road, she votes, so do all her friends... Don't let anyone else set the agenda, or at least don't make it easy for them...


IIRC Polls open at 0700 and close at 2200, so there is lots of time, but don't leave it too late either.

Anyway, thanks and...

However the day will come, probably within the next 10 years when she leaves office and we will have the not so liked (probably hated by over 50% of the population) Prince Charles as our King.

Elizabeth was always liked as monarch particularly because she was nothing more than a predominant figure head, even in the financial crisis she issued little if no personal opinion, she is a symbol of the UK beyond all else, an old granny figure of which people feel inclined to like.

The same however cant be said for Charles who gets personally involved in political situations and has been involved in numerous scandals. If given a choice, the majority of the British public would prefer to have his son William King and he abstain from the position, it is unlikely he would do so unless he is in his late 70's by the time the Queen eventually leaves the throne.

We are now in the 21st century, our next King apparent is not liked, by the time the queen leaves it could be 2021, is it time to let go and become a republic, Australia and Canada are already committed to this opinion that when the time comes and the Queen leaves they will determine probably by referendum if they should remove the monarchy.

Many options are open for our Republic of Great Britain, we could keep the current system without a Monarch (just a prime minister as head of state and government) or install a semi presidential system like Ireland where we elect the figurehead of the nation to represent us. A third option could be one where we have an elective monarch, every 15 years we could elect a figurehead to become King/Queen of the UK and become head of state like the current system or purely ceremonial (like the Japanese Emperor).

Overall I feel we should in any case be given a referendum when the Queen leaves office, perhaps two referendums, one to clarify if we want to keep the monarchy and another system if people want to become a Republic what system to use.

This is a chance to get the House of Commons to have a debate regarding the merits of ending the prohibition on cannabis, with the aim to classify cannabis in line with drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.

Consider this: 

###Alcohol 

8,790 Deaths in 2010

Over 1 million hospital admissions each year.

[Office of national statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk:80/ons/rel/subnational-health4/alcohol-related-deaths-in-the-united-kingdom/2010/stb-alcohol-related-deaths.html)

###Tobacco
The primary cause of preventable illness and premature death, accounting for 81,400 deaths in England in 2009

[ASH](http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_107.pdf)

###Cannabis

0% chance of overdose

But it goes way beyond these simple statistics, the health and economic benefits are significant also:



##Health

There is now overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in hundreds of peer reviewed, published scientific papers.

Extraordinary results are being achieved in the treatment of MS, Crohn’s, cancer, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, spinal injury, pain, PTSD, depression… The list goes on and on. [Recent Scientific Literature on Emerging Clinical Applications For Cannabis &amp; Cannabinoids.](http://norml.org/component/zoo/category/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana)

While the brain is still developing, any psychoactive substance has the potential to cause harm, so we should protect our children from Cannabis in the same way we do from Tobacco and Alcohol.

##Economy

Cannabis production, a market worth over £6 billion per annum, has been given to criminals by our government. In a properly regulated system, thousands of new jobs would be created on licensed cannabis farms and individuals would be able to grow their own in the privacy of their home. Never has there been a clearer example of how a policy intended to protect actually causes harm.  We must bring the  production of cannabis under legal regulation and control.

I will be voting green for the first time in my local council elections today. Today you will gain at the Lib-dems expense, not just from me but from many others like me.

Unfortunately, this may also be the last time I vote green. I agree with the majority of your policies, but have serious concerns about your policies on science. You have come a long way and I applaud that, but you have a long way yet to come.

Your ideological aversion to nuclear energy is naive and dangerous. We desperately need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and relying solely on renewables will prolong that struggle and lead to the release of far more CO2 into the atmosphere than we can afford. Nuclear energy may not be a long term solution, but it is a stepping stone in the right direction.

I find your objection to GM crops disheartening, but I applaud the fact that you no longer oppose GM research. Having said that, I feel you should do more to speak out against groups such as http://taketheflourback.org/ (http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/may/01/anti-gm-activists-wheat-rothamsted?CMP=twt_gu) whose actions are an embarrassment to most other worthwhile green causes.

Please take these concerns into serious consideration. Our country desperately needs a strong party that will stand up for liberal and green causes, but we also need a government that takes our scientists seriously and uses their informed opinions to construct policy.

I wish you the best of luck with today's election.

* http://www.ukip.org/media/policies/UKIPcrimjustice.pdf

&gt; UKIP takes a tough line on **terrorist sympathisers**. Any foreign national resident in the UK who is demonstrably a supporter of terrorism would be deported, subject to a single appeal. For British nationals who support terrorism, UKIP cannot tolerate British nationals assisting enemies to kill other British citizens or to attack British soldiers. UKIP will therefore enforce the rarely used existing Treason Act to prosecute British nationals for treasonous activity or assisting the enemy. UKIP would make serious physical or verbal attacks on serving British service personnel a treasonable offence. UKIP believes that loyalty to the Crown is owed by all British subjects, and all those granted the right to stay in the UK.

*WobbleWagon seems to think this was out of context, so I've updated the full passage. I find it actually to be more alarming. You don't just have to be a terrorist but ""terrorist sympathisers"". Have you donated to a musilm charity or ever written a supportive blog post for, say, Palestinian statehood?**

*Also in the manifesto**:

&gt; ***UKIP would also require inmates to do physical work,*** *as happens in other parts of the world. UKIP believes that physical work and austere living conditions, combined with job skills training, would make prisons much more effective.**

1301875946.0,66,self.ukpolitics,ghxrw,"Why I am voting 'Yes' to AV, and the minimum I feel one should know before going to the booth.",74,8,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ghxrw/why_i_am_voting_yes_to_av_and_the_minimum_i_feel/,"AV is not perfect but is in theory democratically preferable to the system we currently have. The wiki article has a fairly easy-to-understand explanation here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#Election_procedure . The problems with First Past the Post is that you end up with the Commons being pretty savagely unrepresentative of how people actually voted because of 'wasted votes'.

Essentially, this is when people vote for a party in the election but because the candidate didn't have the biggest share of votes in the constituency they aren't counted at all towards how the Commons is made up. If in West Dulwich 40% voted for greens but 43% voted for Conservative, 7% for other parties (giving Tories the seat) the Green party would have almost 50,000 people in support but not a single representative to show for it. Countrywide this adds up to massive numbers but no MPs. This tends to favour larger parties and punish the smaller ones, making Parliament a very Labour-Conservative affair. It also means the winning MP hardly ever has over 50% of the vote.

For example, as shown here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010#Results in the 2010 elections with 36.1% of the popular vote the Tories bagged 47.1% of the seats. Labour for 29% of the vote but 39% of the seats. In other words, it favours the major parties and means the smaller ones lose out; with 23% of the vote Lib Dems only got 8.8% of the seats. With 650 seats in total each percentage is 6.5 seats; thats a 91 seat discrepancy! And to be honest, the 2010 elections were some the least unfair I've had the chance to have a look at, in the past the Green party has never won a seat despite 'deserving' on average about 6-7. In 2005 Labour won 35% of the votes can but got 55% of the seats - which tipped the balance, meaning that because of the system in place they had a majority in Parliament!

AV will mean the candidates with the least first preference votes are struck off and their second preferences are counted, until one candidate has over 50% of the votes. This reduces the 'wasted votes' factor and means the MP has a form of majority support. Yes, parties like the BNP and UKIP might increase their share of seats (probably still unlikely for the BNP to get any - can you imagine an over 50% share?) but so will Green and Lib Dem, and to vote against the AV system based on what the prevailing political opinion of the UK is essentially makes you against democracy. If the populace are idiots, they get idiot leaders, that's how it works. If you don't like that, scrap democracy.

One thing that the FPTP system does well is constituency-based politics; people have a local representative who sits in the Commons. They can go speak to them and voice their concerns to someone local who has to listen and can then in theory relay the message to Parliament. However, the AV system proposed will retain constituencys (it simply decides HOW those MPs are chosen) and at the end of the day isn't really that massive a step toward Proportional Representation.

If you ask me (getting my Politics degree hat on here), I think multi-seat constituencies with proportional voting systems are the answer for the UK. Basically, you get massive constituencies (five times the size, for example) with five seats up for grabs in each. People vote in order of preference. It means that smaller parties get MUCH better (i.e. fairer) representation whilst retaining the constituency system, and voters can actually choose which MP suits their political persuasion best when choosing who to go and talk to. F'rinstance, if I was a Green voter wanting to voice environmental concerns I probably wouldn't want to go speak to a true-blue Tory MP. I would be much better off if there was more than one MP, giving me a choice as to who I think will represent my concerns in Parliament most effectively.

Please feel free to disagree with any of this, I shall gladly debate or be proved wrong.

TL;DR - various reasons why FPTP is a bit unfair on smaller parties and leads to unrepresentative parliament. AV is not perfect but should produce a slightly fairer result.",,False,,t5_2qhcv,False,,,True,t3_ghxrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/ghxrw/why_i_am_voting_yes_to_av_and_the_minimum_i_feel/,

As a Muslim myself, I'm in a better position than most to say that what he did was unislamic. If you want me to explain why, I can, but that's not my point just now.

""I apologise that women have had to witness this today, but in our land our women have to see the same."" Once you get past the shock of this statement (and please, do) you will see that he's actually raising a valid point. In Africa, or the Middle East (We don't know the heritage of the guy yet, but he speaks with a London Accent so is clearly raised here) this kind of atrocity happens on a daily basis, and the human rights abuses perpetrated by the West are well-documented. There are legitimate political grievances against the UK armed forces for all the wrong they have done in the world.

Now I'm educated enough to know that this is not the fault of the soldiers. To take a soldier's life because you don't agree with what the army is doing is really bloody stupid, because the soldier isn't responsible for his orders. I believe it to be the fault of the policymakers.

But the uncomfortable truth is that as the man said ""your [our] people will never be safe"", at least until everyone with a legitimate political grievance is dead, so that no one resorts to violence to do something about it, or until UK foreign policy stops creating would-terrorists.

Sorry, this is going to be a long-winded post.

**So, lets get started.**

We've all heard about the plans to monitor our Internet messages and communications in the UK! 

Today, I'm going to tell you methods how to bypass this. 

Why am I telling you this? To show the public just how ridiculous this law is, how easy it is to bypass and why this huge invasion will not be worth it for the police. Hopefully if parliament is educated about these methods, they won't pass it. 

Firstly, I'm going to explain my opinions on what and how they will implement this plan to monitor your communications. 

A quote from - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17576745

""The Home Office says the move is key to tackling crime and terrorism""

""Tackling"" this leads me to believe that home office will actively monitor data passing through your Internet service provider, looking for terrorists with the data they collect.

Fair enough you say, but think of it like this.

UK isps go through ***terabytes*** of data every *second*

*This is where it gets scary.*
There is no way, at all, that this data will be monitored by humans. It will be an automated process. Probably a bot sifting through every message you type looking for ""key words"" ""key phrases"" which link you to terrorist organizations. 
(This is just my speculation of how the system will work, seems to be most logical as current government is making huge cut backs)

Do you want your details being sifted through? This is almost as *insane* as someone coming to your house and looking through every thing you have written. Ever. 

________________________________________________________

One way you can protect yourself is with this add on for chrome and firefox released by the EFF (A company fighting for your freedom)

https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

This add on will make all your popular sites send data in an encrypted form between you and the sites servers. Your Internet service provider will be able to see where the data is going (Example, facebook, email document sent to google servers) but they will not be able to read it. *That's the important bit.* 

If you can see ""https://"" and not ""http://"" in the URL, then you know you're secure. (This is the method used for online banking, it is very hard to decrypt)

And, as the UK government continuously refuse to invest in the UKs Internet structure. *Very few, if any* of the sites you visit will be hosted in the UK. Even ebay.co.uk has its servers in North America. 

________________________________________________________


Another way to protect yourself is when you set up your email and news client (Mozilla Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook are some popular ones) 

Use your email providers SSL ports. 
For example, gmail uses port 993 for SSL. This will encrypt your data from A to B making monitoring difficult.

________________________________________________________

The final method I will describe is purchasing a VPN (Virtual private network). 
VPNs are servers hosted abroad which ""bounce"" your data from another country to their destination. 

You press send on an email? With a VPN The data gets sent through an encrypted tunnel from your Home to the server abroad where it is then sent to its destination. 

Again, bypassing any monitoring. 
________________________________________________________

In my opinion, The UK government is slowly destroying our internet industry by implementing these laws.

I'd like to open this post up as a political forum. Any questions, feel free to ask. 

EDIT: removed TOR browser.


EDIT EDIT: TOR browser would work just fine to prevent your ISP from reading messages you send over the Internet. I removed it because of the increasing number of TOR exit nodes run by governments and authorities around the world.

1367328066.0,56,self.ukpolitics,1depvb,Why is nobody talking about the MOJ's consultation paper?,64,8,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1depvb/why_is_nobody_talking_about_the_mojs_consultation/,"This is my first real post on Reddit so apologies in advance.

*Declaration of interest: I am lawyer and I work on Legally Aided criminal and prison law cases.*

I have noticed that nobody outside criminal law seems to be in the least bit concerned about the MOJ's consultation paper regarding Legal Aid and Price Competetive Tendering. I have seen nothing in the main stream press apart from a couple of letters to newspapers, and comment pieces in the Times and Guardian. None of my friends outside criminal law (and indeed a number of fellow lawyers working in other areas who I have talked to about this) were even aware that there were any proposed changes at all.

This would not to me seem in any way remarkable until you sit down and consider what the proposals mean. Some people are dimly aware that Legal Aid is being 'cut' and that this will probably mean that lawyers will be paid a little less. Leaving aside the fact that Legally Aided lawyers are paid on a fixed fee basis and many earn very little indeed, the biggest change that the paper proposes is Price Competetive Tendering. Allow me to explain.

At present, if you are going to be tried for a criminal offence and are eligible for **Legal Aid** you have a choice over which solicitor you get to represent you. It may be that you have used the same Firm before and found that they are able to cater for your needs, or perhaps they have an office near to your house, it may be that your solicitor will agree to visit you in custody, or is always there on the end of a telephone if you have a problem. This solicitor then advises you and helps you prepare for court for a fixed fee. Normally, but not invariably, this solicitor will instruct a barrister to represent you at court, and you can rest assured that you will have professionals ensuring that your instructions are followed and the best that can be done, is done. As a result, the United Kingdom has an criminal justice system (in respect of Legal Aid) which delivers justice to a high standard.

Under Price Competetive Tendering, the number of providers of Legal Aid services will be cut to (at most) 400 Nationwide, with the country divided into geographic areas. In each area, all the Legally Aided criminal work will be equally allocated between the providers, *regardless of quality* and without the client have any choice. You will no longer chose a solicitor, one will be assigned to you based on the first letter of your surname. Since these providers are guaranteed an equal share of the work, there is nothing to be gained by the provider if they offer a better level of service than the bare minimum. Rather gallingly the consultation explicityly states that they anticipate that providers will not provide a level of service higher than an 'acceptable' one.

but wait. It gets better... 

In order for these providers to bid on the work, they must logically be large enough to take on this level of work, and in order to win the tender must bid considerably lower than the minimum 17% reduction on present fees. The only people likely to be able to tender at all are companies that are used to bidding on large public contracts, such as Serco, G4S, Capita etc. Even Eddie Stobart have been mooted as a potential supplier of criminal defence advocacy. It should be noted that G4S and Serco run prisons and have contracts with the police. Nobody at the MOJ seems to have considered that this might result in a conflict of interest.

My lunchbreak has just ended and I haven't even touched on the scale of the proposals. Instead I will link a good piece which cover the changes and if anyone has questions I will do my best to expand.

1. Daily Telegraph get your facts straight. This has nothing to do with sueing anyone, you are just trying to attach this story to 'compensation culture' mythology. Tribunals are there for employees to access their legal rights as employees, eg unfair dismissal claims, etc.

2. Osborne get your facts straight. Connecting this to civil and family courts is both specious and deliberately misleading. The tribunal system is a separate branch that is intended to be  less formal, less legalistic and considerably more accessible than the court system. Employment tribunals are part of the same system as benefits tribunals or parking appeal tribunals where people can obtain legal redress without needing lawyers. Should a disabled person have to put up £1000 to challenge a decision throwing them off benefit? Should a driver have to pay £1000 to challenge a £60 parking ticket?

Please be courteous to everyone, regardless of whether you agree with them, and upvote good points and downvote only disruptive comments.

It's a commonly observed sentiment that guardian.co.uk content features heavily on the /r/ukpolitics frontpage, but I was curious as to just how much it is favoured. So, I wrote a Perl script that scrapes www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics once an hour and records how many articles appear from each domain.

The data can be analysed in different ways, but for my purposes, I decided to calculate the average proportion of the front page that links to each domain. There are some manually-curated synonymous domains, such as guardian.co.uk including *.guardian.co.uk.

The results:

anyone else agree? perhaps if we get enough people we could start a petition and write to a few media outlets to try and start some debate on the topic? right now is the time while its being reformed and discussed.

if we suggested it to a couple of science magazines for example i'm sure some would be interested in printing an article about the idea.

edit: my main intention is not to design the perfect sytem but to get discussion on the topic started, that said i'll expand my initial post as the idea has developed through the discussions below (which i've enjoyed a lot).

- it wouldnt be unions representing teachers, retailers, transport workers. the house would be made from specialists in the academic theory of the field like, experts in education sciences, medical sciences and experts in the theory of trade and social sciences.
- the idea is not to replace politics with experts but to have a house made up from peer elected specialists balancing the house of commons to ensure that their advice and opinions cannot be ignored by policians.
- probably yearly elections, elected by peers. perhaps all those with a masters in a related subject (as they will be the ones who actually follow the works of the top people in their field).
- i'm not really sure how seating would be allocated fairly.. maybe the public could vote on this. it would be good to interest the public in which fields are most beneficial to their society.
- i dont think this is the best political change we could hope for, i just think its entirely unrealistic to expect the current system to organise any larger a change - whereas changing the house of lords is something that is being debated now, and public dissatifaction with government is pretty damn high due to the economy and the banking issues. this is a step forwards that i could see having a chance to catching on if we could bring attention to it.
- also any form of campaigning could be made illegal. the idea being to get people chosen on merit, not to let them tell eveyone else why they deserve to be chosen.

as the experts of a field are generally focused on the cutting edge developments in each area, bringing in a more progressively minded elected house is something that could lead to larger future changes as sociologists, political scientists (rather than politicans) and computer science experts discuss how their area's latest developments could improve our current govenance system.

&gt;There is a more interesting way to divide opinion: vertically. There is a huge difference between how the old and young view voting reform. According to a recent survey, seven out of 10 baby - boomers are in favour of the present system while six out of 10 under-35s want to see it modernised.
&gt;
&gt;Since the old vote far more readily than the young, the ""No"" camp is likely to prevail - and then the opportunity will be lost for the foreseeable future. Isn't it rather galling that the future is in the hands of people who won't be around to see it? All the more reason to get out and vote, kids.",,False,,t5_2qhcv,False,,,True,t3_h44u7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/h44u7/dont_let_the_baby_boomers_steal_the_vote/,

1375127901.0,47,self.ukpolitics,1jaquh,Seeing as you want some diversity in opinion: does anyone else feel pedophiles have it unfair?,87,40,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1jaquh/seeing_as_you_want_some_diversity_in_opinion_does/,"While I don't condone any adult having sex with minors, I really think pedophiles have the whole of our country stacked up against them unfairly. 

Firstly, although the act of pedophilia is whats illegal, why isn't the desire for that action classified as a mental illness more commonly? A pedophile by definition must be attracted to children - this is far from normal for anyone. While of course the act of pedophilia should be a crime, I have yet to see counselling for 'adults who are attracted to children' advertised anywhere. With this in mind from a quick google search there are plenty of people referring to pedophiles as 'pedo' if I heard 'a schizo' in the news instead 'a man suffering from schizophrenia' I would be damn offended. Theres even movements calling for capital punishment to return specifically for 'pedophiles'. 

Secondly, there must be plenty of scenarios where pedophilia has taken place, but both parties consent to it. I for example had sex when I was 15, and my girlfriend was also 15 (which sounds bonkers looking back). In theory, has she gone to the police would I not be under arrest for having sex with a minor? Even though she was older than me by 7 months?

In a similar vein of thought Id like to talk about child porn. Of course it is disgusting, and again I am completely against it. But if you are found to have a child pornography on your computer you are considered a pedophile and just think how easy it would be to download an image to someone else's computer - or how easy it could be to download the same image through an album/film you've tormented without realising.

While I do not condone making sex with children legal, I do think the law is very unfair when it comes to pedophiles/those with child porn on their PC's. As I do think the general opinion on pedophiles is uncalled for.",,False,,t5_2qhcv,False,,,True,t3_1jaquh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1jaquh/seeing_as_you_want_some_diversity_in_opinion_does/,
