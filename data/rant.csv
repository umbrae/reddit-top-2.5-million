Now I could go into depth about all the shit situations life has thrown at me and why I choose to ignore the pain by eating but I will spare you all from that drama.  Besides, it's not really relevant to my WTF post.  

For the past 3 months, I have been eating healthy and walking a mile every day (which is a huge step for me since I was unable to even walk two or three blocks before).  To date, I have lost 25 pounds so far (yay me?)  

If any of you are overweight (which I'm assuming is not out of the realm of possibility since this is the internet) I'm sure you have had your share of assholes that say the cruelest things.  

Two incidents come to mind for me-
One night I had just finished putting the groceries we bought in the trunk and continued to help my daughter get buckled in her car seat and for whatever reason, (maybe these guys just found out their parents are brother and sister, I don't know) but these guys find it necessary to scream out at me across the parking lot (and in front of my toddler), that they will give me a candy bar if I suck their dick.  I politely tell them to fuck off when they offer me two candy bars.
Humanity at its finest?

A more recent incident was while I was outside of the craft store waiting for my friend to get off work.  Again, for whatever reason, (maybe they just found out genital warts can't be treated with Compound W wart remover) a group of guys decide it would be fucking hilarious to turn on their loud speaker (by the way, who the hell needs a loud speaker on the outside of their truck) and in front of the entire strip mall of people feel the need to yell at me 'hey fat ass, why don't you eat another cream puff'.   For the record, I have no idea what a cream puff is, but I am sure it's delicious!  But I digress...

Now to the WTF part of the post (assuming anyone is still reading).
As I walked the lake last night, a group of guys in a piece of shit truck decide to ""Moooo"" at me.   And not only once mind you, they felt it prudent to drove around the lake, get in front of me, and ""Moooo"" yet again.  Naturally, I politely respond for them to suck my ass.
Now honestly, I ask you all- What The Fuck?!  What kind of piece of shit douchebag makes fun of someone who is clearly trying to better themselves and become healthier by exercising?  I mean, really?!  

So yes, I am fat.  But that is not all I am.  I am a successful jewelry designer.  I am a Mixed Media artist.  Loving mother. Loyal friend.  Comic book nerd. And about a hundred other things.  

So for any of you who feel the need to hurt someone for no other reason than to make yourself feel better, please remember this-
Life is hard enough without people hurting other people.   And while I may be fat, I can lose weight while you will always be a loser.

Thank you for listening to a rant from a fat chick :)",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_10shvx,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/10shvx/rant_from_a_fat_chick/,
1362763916.0,76,self.rant,19x6sc,"No kids? Rarely if ever actually get to leave work near quitting time. Have kids? Better leave 10 minutes early every day to make daycare in time, and I'll need Wednesday off to volunteer at school!",92,16,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/19x6sc/no_kids_rarely_if_ever_actually_get_to_leave_work/,"**TL;DR, complaining about working longer hours than coworkers with kids.**

I'm sure this has been ranted about a million times, but I can't find a similar thread and this issue really burns me up.

I am a bachelor and have no kids. I work about 50-60 hours per week and it's frowned upon if I leave promptly at 5 pm, especially if I have any projects pending. Usually I don't get out of the office until closer to 7 pm. God forbid I am ever 15 minutes late showing up, regardless of how many extra hours I've been putting in. If I want a day off I have to declare it at least 6 weeks in advance and it's still a crap shoot whether I'll be able to take it. Then if anything goes down on the weekends, it always comes down on me to step in and fix things.

Most of my coworkers with kids, however, all leave about 10 minutes early every day. They have to make it to daycare or they have to pay extra, you see. Also, they get unlimited time off for dentist appointments, staying home if a kid has sniffles, early baseball practice, etc. It's no big deal if they have to skip a day of work with a week's notice or less to volunteer for whatever. Whether it's all PTO, I don't know, and I doubt it, but it's still annoying.

To people with kids, this probably sounds petty, but fuck them. My coworkers and I all chose to be professionals in the same field, but since they also chose to have kids they are relieved of the same burdens. And it's not like I can be rewarded especially for taking up their slack or they complain that they're being penalized for having kids. It really frustrates me that they don't see the extra 10-20 hours and extra weekend work I put in every week to cover their asses as a penalty to me.

As far as I'm concerned, if someone can't put in the same hours and make the same sacrifices as their coworkers whose performance per hour is comparable, then they SHOULD be penalized and taken out of consideration for promotions to positions with higher responsibility. I'm damned well entitled to advantages over people who don't put their careers first.

I feel better now.

EDIT: Spellings.

EDIT 2: Thank you to everyone who commented on this. After thinking about it since I posted this yesterday I've come to the determination that while my coworkers have chosen to have kids and work the same job as me, I have chosen to work with them. Consequently I chose to work with their inconveniences as well. I was aware that they would probably have more time off as necessary and did not think about it much at the time. Now I'm aware of it, and it's my choice to be angry about it or to get over it. I'm getting over it.",,False,,t5_2qn2b,1362845146.0,,,True,t3_19x6sc,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/19x6sc/no_kids_rarely_if_ever_actually_get_to_leave_work/,

That i'm vegan is irrelevant, and frankly, it shouldn't matter to you *in any fucking way, shape or form*, whether or not I feel like eating meat, or anything else. It just so happens that I've researched for myself, and have come to an educated conclusion, of what i want to consume, and what i want to contribute to.
Furthermore, i also think that pushy and controlling, mean and demanding vegans are a pain in the ass. 

Where i really have my pet peeve, is when some one asks me: ""Why are you vegan"", and even though i tell them ""Oh, you don't want to hear that"", or,""it really doesn't matter"", they insist that i tell them, and I don't think I've ever had any other response than ""OH MY GOD BUT BACON IS GOOD, AND ADHEHSRJHSJSH"" JUST.

She was trying to angle her body away from the crowd, perhaps in a futile attempt to cover up the fact that she was crying. She did her best to stifle herself, but it was plainly obvious from the way her body would occasionally heave with a sob, and the breath would catch in her throat with a soft whimper, the poor girl's world was in turmoil.

I looked at the people sitting near her - all of them were pretending very hard that they didn't notice her - some were looking studiously out the window at nothing in particular, others were busying themselves with their phone, one was simply looking down at the floor, all steadfastly refusing to acknowledge the situation. No one would look at this girl, no one was offering her any comfort. It made me angry. I wanted to yell at them. ""What's wrong with you people!"", I yelled in my head, ""Can't you see this girl is in misery? Won't any of you ask her what's wrong, or if she wants to talk about it? Won't any of you try to help her?"" But no one did. I fumed silently, angry at the sheer apathy of the crowd around her. Angry at them for being so cold, so uncaring, that they can't lend a shoulder to cry on to someone who so obviously, desperately needed one. I felt contempt for them.

Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was part of that crowd - I wasn't merely an onlooker watching this happen from far away, I was standing right there, not six feet away from the poor girl. Maybe I should... but no, what would I say? What comfort could I possibly offer a hysterical woman? What if she thought I was hitting on her, trying to take advantage of her vulnerability? What if she was genuinely mentally unstable, off her meds and ready to lash out at the first person to approach her? What if she made a horrible scene and I had no way to extricate myself from it? What if this was some kind of ruse, an attention whore perhaps, or a prelude to an attempt to scam money out of an unsuspecting good samaritan? No, no, clearly, the best thing to do is just stay out of it, it's none of my business anyway.

And so, I took my place among my fellow apathetic, uncaring assholes, and turned my back on a sobbing human being. I'm sorry, whoever you are. I hope you're okay.

They had three different pools: a shallow kiddie pool, a normal pool that went from shallow to deep with various pool toys, and a long rectangular deep pool with a sign specifically stating that it was for swimming laps.

So I'm just swimming laps in the lap pool, when this lady and her two children get in it and the kids just start swimming around in it and blocking my way, and splashing all over the place.  Their mom is just sitting there with her feet in the water reading a magazine.  She can see that her kids are preventing me from being able to swim, but doesn't do anything.

Eventually I stop trying to swim around her loud obnoxious kids and swim up to her and ask if she could take her kids to one of the other pools, gesturing to the sign and explaining I was trying to exercise and her kids would have more room in the bigger pool anyway.

She flips the fuck out and starts loudly saying how rude I am and that her kids can go play wherever they want and that maybe if they were bothering me so much I should be the one to move pools.

1.) So brave! (What a useless piece of condescending tripe. Yet it seems to upvoted all over the place despite the fact that it adds nothing to a conversation.)

2.) Complaining about reposts. You know what I see fifty times more than reposts themselves? Compliants about reposts. Just downvote and move on. It's in the goddamn Reddiquette.

3.) Calling things a 'circlejerk.' People throw this stupid word around anytime there is a group of people that agree on a topic. I'm sorry, I'll disagree with everyone ever so I don't fall into some sort of 'circlejerk.'

4.) Insulting reddit users as a whole. I am so tired of the assumption that everyone on reddit is a single, overweight 'neckbeard.' There are a lot of fucking cool people on reddit. Plenty of them are attractive and in relationships. Dissing 'neckbeards' just isn't funny.

5.) Attacking easy targets. Right, let's make fun of fat people, annoying teenage girls, and guys that wear fedoras. This kind of bullshit really grinds my gears.

6.) Le gem le gem le gem le gem... (This irritating trend has risen as a counter to people who use the word 'gem' or say 'le' once. Now, people have decided respond to this kind of thing with paragraphs composed entirely of 'le gem' or similar phrases.)

7.) Grammar Nazis. I understand that it sucks trying to read 'text speak' or decipher someone's comment that has no punctuation or capitalization. But nitpicking every misspelling is just annoying. This is a casual site, not a fucking english paper.

Simply put, I'm tired of seeing stuff that takes zero thought constantly get the most upvotes, and thus be most visible. I know the internet as a whole does some of these things; I just happen to see it a lot on reddit.

Several reasons. Let's start with an explanation. He was convicted of attempted rape. Of an under age girl. Lots of details but I will try and keep it short. They say he digitally penetrated her. Meaning with his finger. They did cotton swabs but never sent them to the state for testing. So there's no DNA evidence confirming he did. There was also no irritation. He works construction. His fingers are wide and calloused. There would have been irritation. There was also an issue of time. He wasn't alone in the house. So with all of this, he was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Really? No doubt whatsoever? Okay...fine. Minimum is 15 years. The max is life. My issue with this? A guy got drunk, drove and killed someone in our state recently and he was sentenced to a whopping 1 1/2 years. That's right. A year and a half for MANSLAUGHTER. It's a fucking joke. We currently are trying to appeal and fight. I believe with every fiber of my being that he's innocent...and because of a lie his life and my nieces life are in ruins because somewhere along the way, someone fucked up. 

Edit: He was convicted of actual rape. I was mistaken. Initially it was attempted rape I had thought. A little more info on the situation: The girl was 10. My niece was having a sleepover for her birthday. The girls were downstairs watching movies and this girl fell asleep, woke up and went upstairs to my nieces room. The room is right across the hall from my moms room. My brother and my niece went to check on her. He covered her with a robe since all the blankets were downstairs. Then he went to the bathroom and my niece went to the kitchen. You can see the bathroom door from the kitchen. He came out of the bathroom and that's when he heard her in the room calling out. He walked to the room, my niece followed behind him. She saw him round the corner into the room and she was literally seconds behind him. He was shaking her awake when my niece got in there. The girl was upset, talking about ghosts shaking her. (They had been telling ghost stories earlier) He offered to take her home. Two hours later the cops were at the door accusing him. They called the parents of the other girls at the party, told them what was going on. So word got around fast to my nieces school. 

There are several things wrong in the investigation. Starting with the med exam, she had no irritation showing. They swabbed for DNA but never sent it in. When she spoke with a child advocate she made a remark that at her house the last one out of the bed makes the bed. THey never asked her to clarify who else slept in her bed. Her parents said she slept alone, they left it at that. The girl was on a vaginal cream that her parents or older brother applied. They never followed up with questions there. I don't doubt that something happened to the girl but I do doubt that it happened in my brothers home, by him. When the girl described my brothers hand she said it was soft and hairy. My brother builds log homes. His hands are scarred and calloused and he has the beginnings of arthritis in the joints so they're inflamed. Edit* He also has no hair on his hands. Not even the knuckles.  His lawyer was a joke, never bothered to point out that her description was incorrect, never asked my brother to show the jury his hands. It took them two months to get the warrant to even arrest him for it. 

The other great thing about South Dakota is that in rape cases, for a warrant the prosecution presents their evidence. THey say ""This is why this man needs to be arrested.""...the defense? Gets no say. They cannot provide a defense against it. THis is the only type of case that it occurs. For a grand jury when it pertains to murder? The defense is allowed to provide evidence. Burglary? Yep. They can too.

THe sickening thing to me is that without proof...with just the word of a 10 year old girl he was convicted. A 10 year old girl who's testimony changed 3 times before the trial began. The system failed. Big time.

No you will not get a free upgrade, people who wanted them more paid for them ahead of time.

speaking to a manager is not the answer, most times an agent is more flexible and they all have the power to take care of any issue.

plenty of hotels/resorts charge for wifi, and we dont give a fuck if howard johnson is free.  If you want to stay there, go ahead.

if your rude or walk up and demand a suite, your not going to get one. 

if you are nice, and we have availability, I will HOOK YOU UP.  
holiday weekends are excluded see above.

Most all other times, I have the capabilities to give you enormous suites, champagne, food, bottles of booze, room discounts or comped rooms.  Talk to the front desk, be nice, genuine, and let them know if you are celebrating something special.  TIP THEM.  20-40 bucks and a nice conversation can set you up in thousand dollar a night suites and who knows what else, we will remember you, and you will be taken care of.

Some agents are new, can be clueless, and are just getting used to the hotel/rooms/industry as a whole and might not be as saavy.  It happens.

Take care of your bellmen, $1-2 a bag, more if its huge or there are tons of it.  I have gotten 20-40-50-100 bucks and those guests I will remember, add extra hussle, get the desk to send up amenities or get them into a nicer room.

If you have an issue, be patient! we want to fix the issue.  It won't be instantanious, but we want to resolve it ASAP.

plenty of agents work and go to school, they can be stretched thin.  treat them like you would want your kid treated, screaming and making a scene(happens all the time) is ridiculous, and you look ridiculous. we have seen a thousand guests that day and you can be just another one we forget if you like.

if your a regular, on business or pleasure, build a relationship with the front desk and you will be set up for like at that property.

we are in this business because most of us like to work with people, make them comfortable and happy.  if your rude, we can be rude, not to your face but we have little ways to make your stay be bland and boring, we just won't care.

We both make a decent living, and come from good backgrounds.  We recently moved into our first home together, and have been talking about rescuing a puppy from the pound since before I can remember, and since we lived in an apartment that didn't allow dogs before, we thought this was the perfect opportunity to actually go out and finally do it.  What pisses me off the most, though, is that these dogs are on what they call 'death row,' and on every single one of their cages they have a date of when they were brought in, and a number next to their name saying 'Orange County Laws permit the holding of any animal for x number of days,' meaning once those days are up, they're up for euthanasia.

Notice I said 'asshole' cyclists, not just cyclists in general. I own a bicycle and ride it to class every day because I live 2 miles from campus, and gas costs an arm and a leg these days. It went from 2.89 to 3.67 in 3 weeks! Seriously, fuck the gasoline tax, but I'll save that for another rant. 

What I'm mad about is these fellow asshole bikers who think they own the road. In a college town like mine, pretty much everyone owns a bike, and people ride them on the road, which to me is just fine. Most streets around here have bike lanes. But I swear to Reddit, every time I hit a stop sign, some fucking biker flies right past me, not even looking for cars, causing everyone driving, biking or even fucking walking have a minor panic attack. There is no law here that says cyclists automatically have the right of way. None. These bikers even get to go to the front of the line due to the bike lane, but don't have the decency to wait like 3 seconds for the car who was in the intersection first to get on with their day.

But today was the worst. I was biking home from class on a fucking cold 17 degree day and encountered the same stoplight I do everyday. Like any good, decently smart individual, I stopped, because I didn't feel like getting killed. But then this privileged fuckwad with her 2012 Diamondback bike, which probably cost her daddy 3 grand flew past me in the bike lane (which is meant for one fucking vehicle like any lane on a road), and through the fucking red light with 4 cars coming at like 50mph, causing them all to stop, and causing one to run into another. This bitch didn't even look after hearing all the destruction, because apparently getting back to her apartment daddy paid for was more important than the 4 or more lives she just put at risk. This is the last straw. I'm not even a huge fan of government road laws, but this is ridiculous. If you don't know how to ride a bike on a road, you shouldn't be able to. Period.

There are dozens of others who ask for ''the usual"", so until you're my only customer, tell me the name of the drink you want.

* Also, please do not wait until I have already made your steaming hot latte to ask me to remove the paper band that is meant to keep you - and *me* - from the discomfort of the heat coming off the cup to *remove it* and use the ill-fitting canvas one you bought from a hippie. Some days you bring it, some days you don't, so I never know when to expect it, but I'd rather know before I fill the cup with steaming hot milk.

* Learn to tip. It isn't hard. I know you've been calculating the many ways you can give me *exact* change for your drink. Don't smile when you are short a nickel, lean in, and say ""I will be back! I have a nickel in my car!"" Break a fucking $5 bill, and toss a quarter in the jar for once. Maybe a tip would encourage me to learn and remember your ''usual''.

* This isn't McDonalds. There are no frappuchinos on the menu. Don't correct me when I ring up your order and the screen says ''espresso shake.'' That's what you ordered: an espresso milkshake.

* No, idiot, this isn't a self serve station. Please do not help yourself to a coffee cup. The fact that you had to struggle to reach behind the counter should have, *should have*, indicated to you that perhaps you weren't meant to grab at the cups that were on the other side. Please do not stare at me, insulted, for telling you to put it back. Reach behind the counter anywhere else - like a gas station - and you get shot. Get over it and wait in line, and then ask for a cup.

* No, it is not free if it is on the counter. The biscotti is not free. The brewed coffee is not free. Do not argue with me about how it should be free because it is on the counter. That's absurd. There is no coffee house where one can just walk in with their travel mug, fill up for free, and leave. Do not glare at me for having the audacity to ask you to either pay for the coffee you are attempting to get (but can't, because you don't have the level of competency required to operate the device), or to leave it alone. Welcome to society. Things cost money, unless they are *your* things. I don't care what you do with your things, but leave my things alone.

* You just ordered a freaking mocha shake, and you're upset that I am out of skim milk?! Do you realize how much sugar is in this thing? The milk is the *least* of your worries!!

* Hi. I can hear/see you fine. There is no need to walk behind the counter to talk to me. Please. Stay on your side. You're making me nervous.

I don't know how much more I can take though, after the sound of him eating an apple woke me up this morning.

I understand that when it comes to fruit, a crisp apple may be on the louder to bite side of the spectrum, but I've never in my life heard anything so obnoxious. Every bite was a sonic boom, followed by gnashing of teeth against apple flesh. It was just horrible, even the dog looked bothered by it. 

Even though the sound of this apple being demolished within a gaping human face hole was what woke me, it wasn't the worst part by a long shot. It wasn't that the apple eating process seemed to drag on for an hour, or even the fact that he sucked his teeth between every monstrous bite. The worst part, by far, was the burping. 

I suppose ""burp"" is not an accurate enough word to describe the sound of a man attempting to dislodge and toss his own stomach at his food like some sort of human sea cucumber, because that is the only way I can describe it. Each forced out, terrible burp came moments before chomping into another bite of what I have to assume was a coconut sized apple. 

Perhaps better eating habits would result in less air being trapped in your gut? I've fed apples to horses with better manners.

Ever since that moment I've known there was something wrong with the way you parented us.


The myth of a parent's unconditional love vanished in that moment. Almost every day since then I've seen that in you. I've seen the strings you've attached to your love and support, I've seen the harsh ultimatums you've placed on me, the rest of us, and our extended family. I don't pretend to know how you were raised or how harsh your life was; but I suspect that there's a reason why your side of the family never visits or checks in while mom's side can barely stomach you.


Maybe as a child we did deserve the harsh punishments we got. Maybe they did help sculpt us into the people we are in the way a hammer and chisel sculpts stone. But remembering our mother screaming and threatening to leave every other week starts weaving some doubt into the rationalizing I've done to have that painful history make sense. The worst part is, until I started staying over with friends I thought hearing mothers wail was a normal thing. Can you get that into your head for a second? Hearing our mother being slapped and kicked was normal to me. Watching her cry at the dinner table as you wailed on her was something I expected to be handed to me when I had my own family. Sure, you've gotten better over the years, which is to say the new scars aren't physical; but you'll always be a wife beating cretin.


Do you remember our grandfather? The one who fought Nazis and then the Koreans? Exposed to the worst kind of human brutality the world has to offer? He had one rule that he held above all others, ""Never lay a hand on a woman. If it comes to that, just walk away."" If he knew half the things you did to his daughter he would have broken you.


As for us, the way we bend backwards to try to make you happy, even if only to avoid wrath for another day, never seems to be enough. Even when we do exactly the things you ask us to do, it still isn't enough. You and mom have produced four - FOUR - doctors. DOCTORS. FOUR OF THEM. ANY OTHER FAMILY IN THE WORLD WOULD BE THRILLED to have FOUR FUCKING DOCTORS to their name. But no! Not you! You're still not happy. You tell US to OUR FACES that you're ashamed of us. You tell OTHER PEOPLE that you're disappointed in the way we turned out. I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT!


Embarassed!


Of doctors!


Of medicine and science! HOW?!


I don't know where our mother, your wife, has found the strength to stay with you. I sincerely don't. She's told us plenty of times that if she wasn't Catholic she would have left you the first time you hit her. We've all, ALL OF US, seen how you control her. The way you demean her in front of HER clients, in front of YOUR clients, in public. 


We see it. Your 'friends' see it. The world knows what you are. The only person who doesn't seem to acknowledged or care is you. The only person who doesn't seem to want you to change -- is you.


Fuck you.

There's a girl on my facebook that's already pregnant with her third child and she's younger than me! I have friends that have 2 kids together and, while I love them, I despise that they had kids together. And one of my co-workers isn't even 19 yet and she already has two kids by two different men. There was also a girl I knew in high school who had 2 kids before she graduated!

What the hell has society come to!? You want to have kids? Fine. Good for you. But can you please get your shit together before you do!? These people aren't even capable of taking care of themselves and they're bringing in more human beings? Seriously?

I know. I know. It's none of my business. It really isn't. They're lives don't affect me, but it breaks my heart to see girls with so much potential basically throw their lives away at such young ages!

Other than that, these people aren't exactly well off. They're basically the definition of ghetto. I grew up around that and it's definitely NOT something I would ever want to put a child through. The debt, the lack of education, the danger, the lack of proper care/upbringing. And don't forget all those times when you simply have too much month at the end of your money and you're worried about how you're even going to feed yourselves! It's awful and not something you should be bringing a child into.

Having a baby at a young age used to be something bad. Now, everyone just congratulates the expectant mother and is so happy. happy for what? The fact that her life is now 100x harder than it needs to be? The fact that this child is most likely going to grow up to be another leach on society? That's not something to be happy about. It's a disgrace.

Yeah, some of the kids out there may grow up to be damn good human beings, but the kids of the people I know most likely won't unless they get some seriously good influences elsewhere.

I know this might be a bit of a touchy subject but I don't care. it seriously annoys the hell out of me to see people congratulating a 15 year old girl on her pregnancy. She's just a baby! She shouldn't be having babies! You can't even support yourself, what the hell makes you think you can support someone else!?

Every day I see people of all races, genders, and creeds facing one of the most crippling afflictions in modern America: student loan debt. July 1st marks the crowning achievement of Congress' inaction: the student loan rates will **double** from 3.4% to 6.8%. 

How can we just sit here and take it? Every day people are dragged down by the debt they accrue between their rent, utilities, and student loan debts. College graduations mark an occasion which is both one of the most gratifying and soul-crushing moments in the life of any member of higher education in America. Graduation is the day where you are given a diploma which is essentially worthless because of the plethora of degenerates which are allowed to scrape by in college and receive the same diploma. I can be an A student and my diploma is worth the same as the kid over there who got straight C's and bullshitted his way through college. 

Our education system is so flooded with people who can barely pass and we keep letting them in because colleges, especially state-run colleges, are so damn money-hungry. I'm going to end up getting a shit job because the job market is so flooded with all of these asshats with the same fucking degree. It's an embarrassment.

Now could you please stop telling me so.",39,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1f9fuj/i_get_it_im_fat_now_could_you_please_stop_telling/,"I've been here in Korea, half way around the world from all of my friends and my boyfriend. I didn't even want to be here in the first place, and yet, here i am for reasons i couldn't avoid. I have to be stuck here until almost the end of August and time is just crawling.

And every single day, my grandmother will not stop telling me that i'm fat, and that i should lose weight. Every. Single. Day. It didn't matter that i'd actually slimmed down and went down a size in pants, no. It didn't matter that i'd cut out snacks and had been going to the gym regularly. It mattered what the scale told her, and the numbers. The fucking numbers...

It's been 10 days. 10 fucking days and 30 meals that have passed, and every meal i eat, she'll ask if i want more, if i've had enough to eat, if i would like to have seconds. She'll even try to give me more food. I'll decline, of course... And when i tell her i'm full, or i eat a little less than i did the meal before, she'll say something like ""oh, being here with me is making your stomach smaller, your meal sizes are shrinking."" 

I don't think i'm skinny, or fit. I'm out of shape, and i get winded walking up the stairs. I'm no model figure, but it took me so long to finally become comfortable enough with how i look, and within the first 3 days of being here, she made me wish i could cheese grater myself. Every time i look in the mirror now, i start hating every bit of me that i thought was at least acceptable. 

Also, i don't have any friends here. I don't have people to meet up with, go out and about with. I don't have anybody to hang out with, so all i have are my friends overseas. To talk to them, i stay on the computer kind of all day. She's also got problems with that. She doesn't want me to spend time on my computer. She also doesn't want me to go out too often. She's told me i'm her favorite because i never go anywhere. Because i stay home all day...

What really angered me, though, was the fact that she believes that Korean people here are in a diet craze because they want to be healthy. No. That is not true. While i am sure there are the small minority of Korean people who care about their health and decide to lose weight for that purpose, but... the fact of the matter is, most people don't give a shit. That is why you don't see the streets teeming with joggers, you don't see gyms bustling with people working out, and that's why you see people ""losing weight"" anyway. They're not exercising to lose weight. They're starving themselves. How can i look at that, hear about that, see that, and believe that Korean people are losing weight for health purposes? Just because some doctor decided to tell people on public tv that people should be of the healthy weight... 

Being Korean, i know what Korean people are like. Not all, but a great majority. They're shallow. They care little about how healthy they are, and care more about what they look like. If they cared about health more than their looks, they wouldn't be so fucking obsessed with weight loss, because so many korean people are probably underweight. If they actually cared about anything else than what they looked like, makeup, clothes, shoes, and plastic surgery wouldn't be the most advertised everywhere. As well as diet pills and things to help you lose weight quickly. 

I AM overweight. I know that. I realize that i'm too big for korean clothes, shoes, and bras because i've got extra pounds. I get that i like food too much, it's a problem. I get that i'm lazy and don't like exercising, and that's probably adding to it. I GET IT. But really, i wish she'd stop telling me again and again about how i should lose weight and how i should stop being so fat. She tells me stories of people who are morbidly obese and can't get out of bed because they're so fat. She tells me about how ""when you get fat, you are at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure..."" She tells me ""since you're becoming a nurse, you should know the health issues that come from obesity.""

I know, grandma. I DO know. Which is why i DON'T need you to tell me these things like i'm obese. I know i'm overweight. But i also know that i'm not obese. 

This got to be such a wall of text... It's odd, though. Sometimes i think i'm fat, and sometimes i think i'm not. i think i'm fat more often now, and increasingly so...

Why?
Because I'm smarter then the last girl?
Because I'm not a push over like the last girl?
Because I stretch my comfort zone to be outside of the 30 mile radius you call home?

Just because I was born in Michigan doesn't mean my character is meant to stay in Michigan. Your perception of me is all wrong but you've never taken the time to get to know me. You read my surface and  believe you have me figured out like a glass plated stopwatch. And I am so, so much more than that. 

I swear to you that if you sat down with me and you actually listened to my words, maybe you could understand the woman I've developed in to over the course of the four years your son has given me. Maybe you could understand that it is not I who has changed him, for he was untamed long before he met me, but he who has changed me. 

Your son wanted out of your nest long before he met me, I was just a gust of wind that lead him to stumble on to his new path. He has stepped from his comfort zone and in to something so much bigger than himself. And he can't share that with you out of fear that you'll disown him, as you've threatened to do for so many other small things. 

Remember the summer after his freshman year in college, where he took a job 8+ hours away from home and worked 12 - 16 hour days 6 days a week, resting only one day to do laundry and shop for a weeks worth of food. You asked him for money to pay your property taxes - and he gave you that money. 
You told him he didn't care about his family because he left home. Without that money, you'd be without a piece of property to exclude him from. 

Remember when he needed to borrow $200 in rent, because his paycheck was delayed due to holiday, but you huffed because you had spent $3,000 on a new camera lens for your daughter?

Remember when you forced him in to either being homeless or purchased an ex-drug dealers truck? All because your tiny princess had to be one of the girls to go on a 4 day $4,500 Europe vacation. And last minute you had to buy her a converter for her hair straightener?

Your son has ALWAYS had a home with me. He has NEVER been asked to leave, been told he was unworthy, and has always been given support in pursuing his talents - no matter how dim they seemed. He's strong, smart, and more than you'll know.

The last time I was allowed to go to someone else's house was October 21, 2012. And before that was July 11, 2012. Since this is exam week, on the weekend I wanted to go over to a friend's house to study, actually study. My parents wouldn't let me. Yesterday I finished my exams, and my friend asked if I wanted to stay at her house tonight. Again, my parents won't let me. I have tried everything to reason with them, I haven't gotten angry or yelled, I have just tried to have a simple conversation. They won't tell my why I can't go, in fact, every time I try to ask they either change the subject or ignore me as though they can't hear me. 

I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of having no life beyond my home and school. Sometimes I feel like I'll go insane if I don't do something. I don't know what they want from me. My friends have started to distance themselves from me because they've stopped believing me when I am constantly telling them I am not allowed to hang out. Right now, I just really hate my life. 

But then I feel awful because here I am, complaining when there are kids who can't go to school, or don't have enough to eat, or are sitting in a hospital with cancer.

The place was fucking *packed* with Russian tourists. I'm talking like 95-99% of all the people there. No biggie right? I was informed about that. I thought it would be *cool*, I even made the effort to learn a few phrases of Russian to be better able to interact with them and picked some Russian literature as my beach read. Dumb old me actually thought that there was a way for this whole thing to be fun or enriching. Well it wasn't. It was a huge stinking pile of bullshit!

Every. Single. Interaction. I ever had with a Russian person there was super, ultra, mega, incredibly rude on their part:

I went to the store on day one - some Russian bitch casually walks in front of me like I'm a cardboard cut-out and places her goods in front of me. Bitch, wtf! ""Excuse me ma'am, I was first"" The answer? Just a shrug and a shit eating grin

Well fuck you too bitch!

I went to the store on day two as well - just one person in line, I stand behind him. *Two*! Fucking TWO Russian bitches walk in front of me once he walks off with his purchase, one by one and start placing their goods

I'm reasonably insulted, get my shit and place it in front of theirs. Oh my god the death glares! It's like I punched a pregnant woman in the gut by daring to refuse them to walk over me

Day three - at the grocery store (notice a pattern here?) The seller greets me in Russian, I reply in her language. Her reaction? ""Oh thank god you're not one of *them*!"" Judging by her tone I assume she is reffering to Nazi mass murdering zombies or something. ""Who's ""them""?"" I utter in confusion - ""Well the *Russians* of course! They are so *rude* and they touch everything and yada, yada, yada""

By this point I've realized that something is not the way it should fucking be but, oh boy, we haven't even started yet!

Every. Single. Time. some Russian people are walking towards me and the wife they *fucking had* to take the ENTIRE walkway, they FUCKING **HAD** to rudely elbow their way through us and many other people! Fuck you Russian tourists, you rude herd of swine!

And the children! Oh my lord! They *screamed*! They screamed like pigs being flayed alive! (Fun fact - I work at an institution for mentally handicapped children who were *all* better behaved than any little, spoiled shit in that horrible lot)

Back to day one - I'm at the beach - I've had a nice swim, I've read a little and I'm peacefully dozing off under my umbrella... or at least I'm trying to. And I'm failing. Why? Because I hear what can only be described by [Yoko Ono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=HdZ9weP5i68#t=20s) receiving a surprise anal probe. What is happening? Has the alien invasion begun? I *knew* that bringing a hatchet to the beach was not a crazy idea!

Wait. 

False alarm.

It's just a Russian kid screaming bloody murder and throwing *fucking rocks* at other kids while it's parent's nonchalantly sunbathe

And was it an isolated case?

Well fuck me sideways it isn't!!

So many spoiled little shits! So many of them walking over my towel when I'm swimming, so much screaming, it's like I'm in the pits of Gehena! They throw sand, they *puke* from all the screaming, they piss on the beach, they throw garbage everywhere and their horrible parents just stand by and watch!

Some little shit throws a wrapper in my bag. *In my fucking bag!* I go to the blissful mother ""Well HI madam, your child threw this into *my bag*. Have it back"" - I say as I shove it under her umbrella and walk away. Her reaction? Maybe some shame? NOPE! ""It wasn't ours!"" she yells back

OH FUCK ME THEN! I guess that it will be A fucking OK if I found some crappy wrapper and casually tossed it into the space *you* paid for since ""it's not mine"" then?

Fuck me and fuck you, you shitty Russian parents! 

Fuck you for being rude to me and the sellers in the stores 

Fuck you for shoving other tourists out of your way like a pack of migrating wildebeests 

Fuck you for driving like maniacs

Fuck you for allowing your spoiled little shits to make everyone's life miserable and not caring enough to soothe them when they're stressed

Fuck you for making all the staff in restaurants sigh with relief and give me the biggest smiles ever when they realize I'm not Russian

Fuck you for looking at me and my wife like we're imbeciles for only talking English, French and some German and Spanish plus the language of the country *you're* in but not Russian (oh which is by the way like 80-90% similar to the indigenous one but GOD FUCKING FORBID you take 10 minutes out of your time to learn some common phrases! Fuck that! You're entitled to people knowing your language!)

Fuck you for ruining my family vacation

Fuck you for ruining the family vacations of other people who looked at you with horror and disgust

Fuck your sense of entitlement

Fuck your rudeness

Fuck you for screaming like gorillas in the heat all night long

And seriously fuck you for stealing my book! Who fucking steals a book they can't read?! And you were a *mother* you rancid cunt! Didn't you nick enough worthless shit when you were younger???

Jesus fuck! I've seen German tourists, Middle Eastern tourists, Asian tourists, American tourists, European tourists and *all* of them were like sparkling clean drops of fresh water in the desert of your horrible, unprovoked rudeness, entitlement and general horribleness!!

EDIT: And fuck you for allowing your kids to kill so much sealife! What did the little crabs and fish ever do to you to throw them on the sand, far away from the water, for ""fun""??!

i remember before i came to the US he would always send me nice gifts that my family couldn't afford for me and I was immeasurably grateful (this will come up later in the rant) so i had a pretty positive image of him. my parents would pass along to my brothers and I stories of how he's doing well in school and shit and how we should be motivated to work hard like him and his parents so we can live a nice life in the US when we grow up. After meeting him and actually getting to know him personally I realized just how shitty and worthless he really was. 

when we first came to the US you can imagine that we started with literally nothing, an absolute clean slate. we stayed in their house for about a month during the summer and this is when his personality came out. he would refer to us as ""the burden family"" and beg his parents to ""ship them back to the motherland"" in this mocking tone of voice. he would complain about how he gave me all of his stuff which as you can imagine made me feel guilty for enjoying those gifts he had given me, now that i know his attitude about it. 

he humiliates my family, telling his parents to stop ""blowing their money on those losers"" when he refers to their immense generosity for taking care of us while we're settling into America, that i will ALWAYS be grateful for. it's just humiliating. imagine yourself in my position...someone helps you out so much and then their son makes you feel like a burden. it hurts. 

then it got worse. this stupid bitch just can't be satisfied. they have this big gorgeous house in a beautiful neighborhood (which you can imagine is like a million times better than the 1-bedroom apartment my family is living in, which is in a very scary part of my city) but every single day this bitch whines about how much he hates it and how small it is (it's huge) and how much he wants this and wants that blah blah and it makes him seem so unfuckinggrateful that i want to punch him in the throat. i overheard his parents wanting to get him a new BMW and the first thing this asshat does is whine and scream about how ""everyone else has a BMW"" and he would look like a ""fucking commoner"" if he didnt drive something exotic. i was literally appalled. my family didn't have a car for the first 7 months of us living here, i walked to school with my brother and sister and my parents walked to work.  so of course his parents buy him some flashy italian car that i dont even know the name of and he finally seems at ease. this stupid douche will literally scream ""why are we so impoverished!??"" to his parents if they ever refuse to buy him something and it's just appaling to me that he can be so damn ungrateful. impoverished my fucking ass. he is rich as hell and when he calls himself poor it just makes me so FUCKING mad that he's that ignorant and stupid. 

i could barely contain my rage at the car thing though. what sort of insufferable bastard calls a BMW a ""commoner car"" (where i live...seeing a BMW that isn't 20 years old is like a miracle) 

i dont give a shit if all his friends have a BMW and he wants something unique, that sounds like an acceptable reason to ask for something more expensive but this bitch wants a fucking...mazerati or something JUST because he doesn't want to be considered a ""commoner"" wtf....what a shitty attitude to have!? 

he has no respect for anyone or anything. he is condescending and treats EVERYONE like crap. he talks shit about everyone and everything, he treats women like crap, he doesnt value the things he has. he broke the screen in his house's theater by throwing his iphone at it. what the fuck? who the hell does that kind of shit? he was jealous of his dad's new SUV because he wanted one (in addition to his own sports car...what kind of retard thinks he needs 2 cars at the age of 17? he has no grip on reality. he just wants whatever he wants without thinking...maybe this is a stupid thing to want) so he smashed the mirrors off with a baseball bat. his parents were obviously furious but didn't say shit to him...if that were my son he'd get a fucking beating. 

i thought that hoping he'd grow up to be broke and lose the priveledge of having rich parents would make me feel better, and let karma kick his fucking ass for him but the sad fact is, even though he is an insufferable spoiled bastard and a waste of oxygen, he's actually smart in school and is already planning on going to medical school and everything (even tho he screams at his parents that he'll just quit school and give up on life if he doesn't get a new [insert expensive car here] from his mommy and daddy the moment he's accepted into med school)

 it's possible that he's going to die without ever having experienced the struggles of the everyman. that depresses me a LOT because I'm probably going to die without having experienced the luxuries he has. 

anyway im glad to get that out. i'd love to say this to his face but im sure he'd complain to his mommy and daddy like the bitch that he is

Stop celebrating the people that commit suicide and then promoting suicide prevention. 

People who commit suicide are not only hurting themselves but they are hurting their friends and family. Their immediate family should mourn but don't make such a fucking fiasco out of it. I'm sure their parents don't want a R.I.P so and so page of their dead kid on facebook. Stop making fucking statuses about it either, especially if you didn't even fucking know them.

If you want kids to be turned away from suicide then you can't glorify those who chose to take their lives, they are putting their families through a lot of pain and that DOES NOT make them a fucking hero. 

Lastly you have no fucking right to say you ""loved them even though you never talked to them because they seemed like a nice person"" that's bullshit. If this kid was close friends with the 100's of people posting shit about him on facebook he would not have killed himself from depression and fucking loneliness. 

Pay your respects silently and pray if it suits you, but shut the fuck up about it and don't bother their family members about it. Saying your sorry doesn't mean shit. If you want to help give them a hug or show kindness, but empty words mean nothing. I have never lost a family member or friend to suicide and unless you had a lasting relationship with this person neither have you, going to camp with them for a week three years ago doesn't count if you have never talked to them since.

Since he's an indoor dog, she bought a crate to crate train him.  Problem is, she barely ever takes him on walks (maybe once every 2 weeks).  The rest of the time she just takes him out of his crate and puts him directly into her bathroom with a pee-pee pad on the floor.  

First of all, you fucking work 40+ hours a week.  I think it's just sad that you leave him alone in your bathroom and when you finally do come home, you usually feed him and it's back to the bathroom.  If he doesn't poo or pee immediately, you leave him in the fucking crate again.  Let's not even get into those nights where you have happy hours/dates where you don't even come home until late at night. Then, since you need to go to sleep for your job, it's back to the crate again.

If you want to crate train your puppy, you need to take them outside on a regular schedule (every few hours) and give them some sort of positive reinforcement for peeing/pooing outside.  Simply leaving him by him by himself for almost 20 hours a day isn't really beneficial in his training.

I've asked her why she doesn't just leave him in her room to roam around and just keep her bathroom door open so he can pee/poo on the pad as necessary.  her reply is that she doesn't want any accidents in her room. WTF...she lives in a shitty apartment and I know for a fact that she's moving in a few months anyway.

* Has no concept of money. Gets $500 from her parents every two weeks that doesn't cover school expenses, rent, or utilities. They pay all of that seperately. This is just her allowance. She goes and gets a $92 manicure every other week, and yet somehow it takes her *weeks* to pay me her share of the utilites bill. God forbid she use some of her allowance money and let her parents pay her back later, no, no. They have to do it because she ""doesn't handle any of that stuff."" **SHE'S A BUSINESS ACCOUNTING MAJOR**


* She's astoundingly self-centered. One of my scholarships didn't come in like it was supposed to, so for most of last semester I barely had enough money to live on. She goes and buys a grill (she was mad I wouldn't go ""halvsies"" with her even though she knew about my utter lack of money. We've used it exactly once in the 6 months we've had it) and asked me if I could make her some chicken on it for dinner. Sure, so we go to the store together and at this point I've literally only got about $20 to my name and its supposed to last me the foreseeable future. But I buy the chicken and the stuff I need to cook it, plus some rolls and sides and tell her I'll pay- it's the least I can do for not chipping in on the grill. She disappears while I'm in the check out and when she reappears a minute later she *eating fried chicken*. ""Don't worry, Don't worry,"" she says. ""I'll still eat the stuff you're making. I was just starving and I had to eat."" She told me once she actually thinks she is starving to death when she is hungry. Like, could die at any moment. We get home, I keep asking, ""Are you sure you are still hungry, we could do this another night,"" but she insists she's starving. I make ranch chicken and rolls and green beans and twice-baked potatoes. **She didn't eat a fucking bite.** Didn't even touch it.

* She's actually incredibly racist. Her dad grew up in South Carolina where his family used to be big plantation owners. They're still pretty bitter about that whole Emancipation Proclamation thing. It's not just black people though- its pretty much everyone. Around Christmas time we got a card in the mail addressed to the previous tennent. I found it in with the rest of the mail and jokingly said, ""does it make me a terrible person that I kinda want to open this- it feels like there's a gift card."" She calls dibs on half and snatches it out of my hands. I tell her not to open it- stealing, mail fraud, yada yada, but she opens it anyways. It turns out to be a Hanukkah card with one of those $50 american express pre-paid cards in it. I tell her she can't keep it, but she just looks at the dradle on the front and yells ""Ha! I just stole from the Jews!"" I tell her again she can't keep it- look, I say, it's from her grandparents. She just says ""so?"" and walks out. **HER GRANDFATHER HAD JUST FUCKING DIED THAT WEEK**.

* She was engaged to a guy who lived back in our home town about 5 hours away. At one point, she told me she was getting really sad that she couldn't talk to him often enough especially because he had been sick the last couple of weeks and she knew she was being irrational, but she was getting upset with him about this. This was totally and completely understandably in a long distance relationship. But then three days later she's saying she's so mad that she's thinking about just calling it off. She's been giving him the silent treatment. AND HE HAS NO IDEA because that cold he's had? Yeah, it's actually severe mono and he's got a 102 fever and a full body rash. She eventually called him and blew up. I could hear yelling and crying and then yelling. When it was over she comes *skipping* out her room and  ""He cried. I faked it. After we hung up I realized it was probably just because I was on my period anyway."" The next three days in a row he has flowers delivered to our house. The first time they came, she calls him and tells him they're ugly and she can't believe they're going to get married and he doesn't even know what kind of flowers she likes. The next two days in a row, 2 dozen long stem roses. After three days of this, she tells him it doesn't make up for him not coming to apologize in person. So this guy with his fever and his rash, gets in his car, drives 5 hours, stays for dinner, and then has to turn around and drive home because he's going to try and make it back in to work the next day. In the meantime, every time she goes out to bars she takes off her engagement ring so she can hit on guys so that they'll pay for her drinks. 

She's also just a terrible roommate in all the little ways a person can be a terrible roommate. She leaves bloody tampons in the toilet. She throws out my ""old, gross"" food. We're talking a half drank gallon of milk one day past the *sell by* date, even though I've asked her not to. She turns the air down to 65 and then when she gets too cold, she turns the heat on to 80. SHE SITS IN HER FUCKING BEDROOM WITH A HAIRDRYER ON, FOR HOURS AT A TIME, NOT BECAUSE SHE HAS JUST SHOWERED, OR NEEDS TO DO HER HAIR, BUT BECAUSE SHE LIKES THE WARMTH. HOURS.

One weekend in the fall, he does come home and actually stays, but brings her over.

I ended up coming back to my home town to help my dad, because my mom lost her job and my dad (going on 62) was trying to pick up a second job and I was willing to put a hold on my education to help them. 

Ended up landing a sick job for the Fire Department in the Academy. Making good money, working 40 hours a week, no responsibility, I started down a path and picked up a habit I could support; I started smoking marijuana. 

I would talk to the firemen about my degree an they would ask me ""why the heck would you be police instead of fire?"" Conversations later I decided that being a fireman is something I could really enjoy.

So I stopped smoking and signed up for the EMT - Basic course to get my Emergency Medical Technician certification (something you need for the fire department). 2 months later I started the course.. And it was awesome! It was by far one of the most interesting and overall mind tingling classes I've had (and I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the medical field). 

Well I pass with flying colors! I aced my written state final with a 90% and the state physical assessments I passed all of them, passed my national written test that same week. Well, after seeing my girlfriend for the first time after the class and celebrating my victory, I drove home. On my way home I decide I'm going to finish off of what I have left of my marijuana. So I park in a lot and quickly try to load a bowl (it's like 1am and I don't wanna stay out super late). After shoving what's left into the celebratory bowl I fill it a quarter of the way and...

Spot lights hit me from my driver side.. A cop. Well I roll down the window and spill my guts, being as open as possible. The officer proceeds to frisk me and search my car and finds nothing. Now I have a court date in two weeks for marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia.

In the state of Oklahoma a first time offender of possession of any amount is up to 1 year in jail, and paraphernalia is up to a $1000 fine, I'll get my medical license stripped from me, and I'll never be able to apply for the fire department, nor law enforcement. 

It hurts.. But I deserve it.

I live in India, and its very common to hire a maid(s) to do the cooking, cleaning, and other odd jobs. So we have three maids, and they're sisters. I'll name the main one A. 

So maid A is cooking some veggies, and serves them to my dad, who's sitting next to me, watching TV. He takes one bite of said veggies, and tells maid A they're uncooked. Mind you, I ate them too and they were pretty damn tasty, and perfectly cooked. Maid A tells my dad they are cooked, nothing wrong with that. Dad blows up, tells her to shut up and get out of his sight. 

Couple days later, my mom is in a pretty pissed mood and decides to pick a bone with maid A, bringing up the previous incidents. Maid A tells mom the same thing she told dad, that the veggies were properly cooked indeed. Now mom blows up, telling her to shut her damn mouth and not to argue with either her or her husband, and that they're paying her to work and she's easily replaceable. I tell her to relax, she tells me the shut up. I won't take that lying down, so I tell her that she can't be so fucking rude to everyone just because she wants to, and to treat people with respect. I get yelled at and sent to my room. 

This incident has made me pretty fucking mad. My parents are apparently of the belief that just because they've paid someone to work for them, they can treat them however the hell they want. And they can apparently do the same to me, because I'm their bloody son. 

Keep in mind that maid A is a very nice person, and does most of what she's asked without complaint. Maid A and I are pretty friendly. I don't look at her as a servant. 
Also, dad seems to have something against her, and always calls her lazy and useless. That makes me mad. Both my parents are lovely people in general, but not when it comes to this. 

My beliefs are completely different from that of my parents. I don't look down upon someone based on petty things like money or religion or caste. You judge a man by how he treats his inferiors, not his superiors. Naturally I'm pretty fucking mad at my parents, and I won't be talking to either of them for a while. Added to that maid A was reduced to tears, and my parents did not produce a single fuck to give. 

My question here is, is my anger justified, or am I overreacting?

B. and I will be splitting up soon.  We’ve been together for the better part of 18 years.  Since I was like 23.  This comes as a devastating blow to me.  In fact, it feels like the end of the world.   B. will tell you it was for a kinds of reasons, but for me, it came down to his commitment to you.  Yes, I know you were not in a sexual relationship with B. -- and therefore you can justifiably say that you’ve done nothing wrong -- but he has told me that his friendship with you, which is very deep and tender and based on both emotional and romantic attraction (his words, not mine), is not negotiable.  If my ultimatum to him was “it’s either M. or me,” he decided, “OK, then M.  Not you.”   Let me repeat that he has stated openly to me that he is very attracted to you in more ways than one.  I let you know this some months ago.  I am not a controlling spouse.  B. has had many female friends over the years that I have not had any problems with.  But perhaps you can understand why his attachment and commitment to you -- even if it never became sexual now or in the future -- would be overwhelmingly painful for me.   It would have been kind if you had willingly subtracted yourself from our relationship.  But I wanted it to be voluntary.  I did not want to demand it.  I have tried to be good to you in the past.  I just wanted you to do me a good turn as well.  From your heart.

You are perfectly justified in saying “I’ve done nothing wrong.”  Especially since your hang-out time with B. has diminished a lot over the last few months.  But I did let you know about the terrible tension this arrangement was creating in our marriage.  Your having nearly daily contact with him was just the death knell I think. But the absolute final blow was when he secretively paid for your car repairs, without consulting me -- this is AFTER having given you the used car in the first place.  And it just would have been kind if you had thought of me.  B. and my’s bond was one I thought was unbreakable.  It was the ground I built my life on.  And now it is gone.  I don’t know what I’m going to do or where I’m going to go.  I blame, primarily, B.  Not exclusively, but primarily.  It would just have been an act of generosity and kindness if you could have helped us maintain our relationship which has meant a very great deal to B. -- and absolutely everything to me.

I have asked B. that during our separation (before our actual divorce), that if he wants to hang out with you, that he do it at your house and not at mine.  It would just be too painful.  He said, yes.  I hope you will help him to honor this

It does NOT mean I am mad at you and don't say ""You never hang out with me"" because yes, I fucking do. It's not my fault I'm literally your only friend.

Friend #2: I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to losing touch with you when we go off to college. You were a good friend for the first 2 years, but now, after 4 total years, I can't even stand you. Everytime we fucking hang out, you NEED your phone with you. I leave mine in my purse, but no, you have to look at it every 2 minutes to see if someone texted you. That tells me you'd rather hang out with someone other than me. I'll ask you to not text people and you'll say ""sure no problem"" but you don't fucking do it. You never text me to ask how I'm doing or what I'm doing or how something exciting/nerve-wracking went in my life, even thought I do that for YOU all the time. The only time you care what I'm doing is when something good happened to you. Like when you got a new phone, a new car, a new boyfriend, a full ride to college (not an impressive college, someone with a 1.0 GPA could get in), blah blah fucking blah. Your laugh is annoying, you're condescending, you think you need to be better than everyone and think you need special attention because you 'can't read'.

Guess what, bro? You treated me the exact same shitty way your mother treated you. Too bad you refused to see that. 

A big FUCK YOU for all the terrible shit you said to me after we split up. Just because you think that I'm a lazy immature slut doesn't mean I am. You don't know anything about me and you never cared to. You only saw what you didn't like and tried to change me against my will.

You should be thanking your lucky stars that I didn't actually take all of the assets I was LEGALLY ENTITLED TO when we divorced. We didn't have a prenup, motherfucker. How dare you try and make me feel guilty for accepting the settlement we AGREED on, which was significantly less than OUR LAWYER thought I should get.

If I were more vindictive I'd contact Gawker or something and do a big juicy tell all about how you're such an intolerant piece of shit. You've got a reputation in the tech industry to uphold, I don't. And since you think I'm so shitty anyway, who cares?

I'm sure all of our mutual friends and your blog readers loved your sob story about how I left you and you had to give up everything. Boo hoo, poor you. Now you've only got your money to keep you company, what a shame. FYI, our house was on the market BEFORE I left you, so nice try pinning that one on me.

The charge: wreckless driving resulting in a death. The story: about a year and a half ago, this dumb shit was racing his POS car with a girl riding shotgun and a guy in the back. Well the dumb fuck in the back decided not to wear his seatbelt. Well the kicker to this story is that it was raining where this kids were racing. Well the kid driving comes around a turn really fast and the worst happens. He ends up rolling his car. Fortunately, him and the girl were wearing their seatbelts so he was barely hurt, but she got pretty hurt (in the hospital for a couple weeks). And the guy in the back ended up getting thrown from the car and died at the scene. The best part is that this kid takes no blame for what he did. He blames God for the crash saying, ""Its not my fault there was so much water on the road from the rain"". And to this day he shows absolutely no remorse for ending another kids life. Fast forward to earlier this year, he has a court date but his lawyer asks for a continuence so they can be prepared. In the mean time, this fucker has gotten FOUR more tickets, and he STILL fucking races cars. Well like I said his court date was today. What was the ruling you ask? A measly 400 dollar fine and 100 hours of community service. For KILLING a kid and almost killing another.

1361719526.0,26,self.rant,194uqv,I work professionally in Weddings Bands (pay of upwards of $600 a single night) and this is some of the shit that makes me rage,30,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/194uqv/i_work_professionally_in_weddings_bands_pay_of/,"I work through a band agency where people call in requesting a band for a function but more often than not Weddings. I am a 3rd year University Jazz student so music is ALL that I do so I love the work. Getting paid big bucks to play music (in suits too)? It's a DREAM but also A LOT of work. Especially since I practice upwards of 3 hours a day to keep on top of my craft.

People will call into the agency and request a band where they have a database of musicians which are selected, so I will simply get an email saying all the details, location, requested cover songs (or purely Jazz sets) and the pay. After that I can accept or decline if I have something else on and then it will just be passed onto another musician. So here are some things that make me rage.

**Requests during a set:** We prepare our sets in advance since its upwards of 45 covers to remember for a single night and there are NO rehearsals. You find the recordings according to what the lead singers set list is and nail it to the original recording, arrive on the day and PLAY. So it's stressful, I have around 1800 words+ of notes for a wedding that I need to prepare.

It's common for people to request a song mid set, who knows we might have it on our set list already and say ""2nd set and it's a sure thing!"" or maybe bump it forward so they can hear it now but when some drunk bell end yells repeatedly ""PLAY HARLEM SHAKE, JUST PLAY IT"" - (not kidding, wedding I did last night...), it's fucking horse shit. How the hell can a live band of 3 vocals, guitar, keys, bass, drums and sax gonna pull that off on the fly? He yelled this shit out after 3 songs in a row and it makes us look stupid. Fuck that guy and his shit. 3 months ago it was Gangnam Style that was always yelled at us.

**Not getting fed:** Seems like small potatoes but playing music for a total of 3 hours with around 2.5 hours of speeches and toast's in-between is fucking exhausting! Especially if we are set up outside in the sun (because it looks nicer and we want our wedding to look nice so play in the sun.) We aren't an iPod where you plug it in and forget with no maintenance then when it's over turn it off. If thats what you want then just do that!

**Being ignored until the very last song:** We don't expect people to be listening like your at an actual concert, a little applause after each tune would be nice tho. But the thing that really takes the cake is being ignored the whole night until we announce ""This is our last tune guys, have a good night"" where after finishing it and get ready to pack up they go ""ENCORE ENCORE ENCORE!!"".

We have been here 3 for hours and NOW you want us to play music? I'm not kidding when I say one time we got booed because we played our last song (at 11:30pm!!, 7pm start) and was time to leave (had to be in a studio for a midnight session as well, I'm fucking tired!). BOOED! Thats like going to a bakery 30 minutes after closing and booing them for closing when they said they would. If you want us to keep playing then pay up more mother fuckers and the booing was just fucking despicable.

**People wanting to play our instruments:** I'm a drummer, I have a lot of gear! My set with cymbals and hardware is around $6000. Why would I want some drunken piss ant trashing my livelihood? Especially when they go ""OHHH COME ONNN LET ME HAVE A GO!"". Even if you ask nicely I can't trust you with my gear and also its unprofessional to have wedding guests on stage and playing around so please just don't ask!

**No loading zones:** Seriously, some places have NO WHERE for us to park to get our gear in. Again, drummer, alone it takes 3-4 trips. One time I had to walk all of it through OTHER hotel loading zones 250 metres away because the actual venue doesn't have any. THEN I have to try and park my car some where and if thats in the middle of the city then I am fucked. Guests can bus in and out easily but just give the band somewhere to park!! After playing for 3 hours and dealing with drunks the last thing I want to do is walk 1 kilometre to my car, compete with traffic to get back to the OTHER HOTEL LOADING ZONE to load up 250 METRES AWAY and then leave. That, is the worst thing for me. All in a suit too, great.

Again, I love the work but these things can be pretty common. We are entertainers but we are also people (and Redditor's!) who have put in YEARS to get to where we are! So don't be fucking dicks.

* NO ONE can have what you have.  I bought a bong once that was the same style as yours and you threw a fucking fit because I ""copied"" you.  There were so many other things that I liked that you had or did that I wanted to ""copy"" because *SURPRISE* I LIKED THEM FOR MYSELF TOO!  I can't even think of all the examples right now because they were so stupid and so fucking petty.  
* You used to be a vegetarian, and that was all fine and dandy, except despite claiming that you respect others' choices to eat meat, you would talk about meat eaters in such a condescending way: ""I don't know how anyone could say they love animals and eat meat"" and ""Meat literally means rotting flesh which is just gross"".  And then when you met another vegetarian, you always had to fucking one-up him/her, and ask how long they've been veggie and then make condescending remarks like, ""I don't think anyone should call themselves vegetarian if they haven't been for at least a year"".  Newsflash: you're not the only person who is a vegetarian and you're not going to be, so get the fuck over yourself.  I didn't respond to these negative feelings for the most part and just let you feel how you wanted to feel.  
* Then a couple years ago you started eating meat again because your health required it.  Oh and you post pictures of food, too.  I do as well, so that's not really an issue for me.  However, since you have to maintain your image of moral superiority since becoming an omnivore, EVERY time you post a picture of food, you have to describe it with the words ""organic"" and ""humanely-raised"".  I am ALL for organic and humanely-raised meat; I think it's so important, however, when I eat food, I don't talk about how sustainable and humane it is unless it's actually relevant, which it RARELY is.  Oh, and then I mention that I go to a taco truck, and you make some condescending comment about how the meat there ""can't be kosher"".  Seriously, fuck you.  Can I just enjoy my fucking taco?  Even if I weren't aware of our fucked up food system, reminding me that I'm eating meat that came from a tortured animal is still rude and low class.  I fucking know it, I don't need to be told.  But you need to rub it in because you're obviously a much more compassionate person than I am.  The years you were vegetarian were obviously so you could flaunt how morally superior you are to others.  You care more about looking compassionate than you do about the animals themselves, you selfish attention whore.

Lastly, I'll throw this in there too: Fuck the asshole who received my gift. I spent a shit load of time putting together a really nice gift, and you didn't even post a thread or a simple thank you.

Everyday I see these girls who have babies/kids and are 16, 18, or 20 years  get on FB and whine and cry cause they have no time, sleep, money, or fun. All of these people comment on how 'proud' they are of their strength and how sorry they are that they have it so rough. I talk about my stress of going to college full time and being poor cause everyone knows college isn't cheap, and people act as if 'You have no right to complain.' So the girl who failed to have safe sex time and time again and pops out kids when she has stated she is dirt poor and can't afford to even pay the bills, so she lives off of the government while serial dating every Tom, Dick, and Harry, usually having a kid with one or all of them, has a right to complain about how stressed they are? 

I'm in college trying to work towards a career that I know will allow me to live a comfortable life and take care of my future family (I do not have kids nor am I married, I mean when/if I decide to get married and have kids). I get on the Deans List and people act like I'm bragging, but a 20 year old with 4 kids by different dads, been poor before the birth of child number 1, married at 19 to a guy she already knew was worthless, divorced within the year, got with fellow number 2 and had 'casual' unsafe sex even though she knew he was on drugs and a criminal, ends up pregnant with twins, gets with another guy while pregnant, dates guy number 3 for 7 months, has the twins then 2 months later gets pregnant again (NOTE: Neither him nor her have a job.) Decide they love eachother so much they need to get married even though he is only 19...Gets married to guy 3 while pregnant, 6 months later has baby, still poor and living in a shitty apartment. Complains how this guy is a dick and says they're separating then says how much she loves him, then he's a dick, then he's the best husband she could ever ask for; continues to whine cause she is tired and so poor, she slaves taking care of 4 kids all under the age of 4... Her husband doesn't help her so she cannot go anywhere, then complains how bad her kids are but puts up sobby statuses about how much she misses them when they go somewhere, is allowed to get an applause for dealing with the shitty life she chose???  THEN PEOPLE COMMENT ON HOW FUCKING AWESOME SHE IS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS AND HOW BRAVE SHE IS AND HOW SMART SHE IS. Fucking really!? 

Oh look at MidnightOfcourse bragging about how she is in college working her ass off trying to get on the Deans List and get her Bachelors Degree, she doesn't know anything about 'real' life like Annie who is on welfare and is 17 forcing her mom to take care of her kids while she gets her G.E.D. 

Is this honestly where the standards lie now days? You have to get knocked up before the age of 18 to get a ""So proud of you!""??? 
What I do isn't easy, yeah I don't have kids but I actually used common sense and prevented that from happening, yeah I am not married but I am 21 and have been concentrated on more important things then updating my Facebook status to 'Married' And I know people will say 'Well you chose to go to college so why do you have the right to bitch?' I have the right to bitch cause I've tried to do everything right in my life so I can be someone my future kids can look up to, so yes, sometimes when I'm working so hard that I forget the day or month, I become agitated and tell a few people that I'm running out of energy. Also I never get 'OMG You are so strong!' 'So friggin proud omgz!' 'You can do this, youre a strong woman girl!' like these whiney teen/young moms who should be the best mom they can be without a crowd giving them reassurance, but I still keep going to college everyday, keep doing the work, keep studying, and working hard for good grades. 

Being 21 and in college is now a few steps below being 21 with kids and living on welfare. I've been told by a girl who barely got through highschool, lives in a shitty apartment with her uneducated ass of a boyfriend, and borrows money from her mom, that I need to learn how to be an adult... my reaction was ARE YOU FUCKIN KIDDIN ME? 

I just don't know where this shit got fucked up. Any of you fucking people know how this got twisted?

Growing up he used every type of abuse a person could think of to control us but he always focused on me. I was the one who got hit while my mom and brother locked themselves in their bedrooms. I was the one he sexually abused. I was the one he targeted because I was the only on he stood up to.

He controlled all of our money; took all of our paychecks (my mom's as well) and had his name on everyone's accounts. He made a tremendous amount of money each year and he used it as one more form of abuse and control. The man makes ~300,000/year and wouldn't buy me a new coat after I had the same one from 6th-11th grade and it was unraveling. He loved to lord it over our heads and use it to barter for what he wanted from us. My mom and brother are idiot fucking slaves to cash and they did whatever he wanted just so he'd pay. But I am not to be fucking bought like they are.

When I left home several years ago I told him I was done talking to him  unless he could admit, own, apologize, and change the shitty behaviors he had that ruined our family and my childhood and of course I have never once heard an apology. 

I worked full time through college, took out loans, paid my own way for every thing; phone, insurance, food, rent, utilities, clothing everything. Not a dime from my parents. 

My brother has had everything paid in full for him. Twenty four years old and he's never had a job.  No student loans. No debt. A car bought and paid for for him, including gas money and insurance. Because I'm strong enough, and proud enough to not give in to a psychopath just to have him buy me things. 

But today, I just can't hold it the fuck together. I have a cavity that I can't afford to get taken care of. I can barely make rent. I can't afford to take the certificate tests for my next step of my career. And my dad is getting remarried to a woman he met (one of a string) while cheating on my mother. He invited me to his weddings. He had one in our hometown. One in England. One in France. And one in Spain. So that the cities where they worked and had work friends could all attend. He can afford four wedding ceremonies, in four different countries. He flew my brother and his new girlfriend out to Europe and each of those countries, paid their hotel rooms and airfare. 


My mother is a damaged mess who I doubt will ever pull it back together from my dad. I can't blame her but I don't, and never had had a mom. My brother told me that if I just ""let it go"" I too, could have every thing paid for for me. When I try to vent to my mom; vent mind you, not ask for money; she tells me that if I made up with my dad he could help. 

The man who once held me down and cut my foot open with a pair of nail scissors. Who dragged me around by my hair. Who would stand and wait for me to step out of the bathroom after showering and stare as I walked back to my bedroom. The man who called me every nasty name under the sun. The man who cheated on my mother from the time I was eleven years old. The man who refused to cosign my student loans. The man who not once helped me move. The man who has never taken an interest in me or my life, held me, loved me, comforted me. I'm supposed to forgive that and let it go just to have him buy me things.

1370988865.0,23,self.rant,1g5jr2,Dear Idiots in Movie theaters: SHUT UP.,27,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g5jr2/dear_idiots_in_movie_theaters_shut_up/,"Bottom Line: Why are idiot teenagers talking throughout an entire movie, loudly, about nothing, laughing at people who ask them to be quiet. Is this fun for you? SHUT THE FUCK UP.

I’ve been wanting to see Fast and the Furios 6, but decided to wait a little to see what the general response to it was and to let the crowds die down some. This past Saturday, we decided to see it. It was a good day for us and this is the movies 3rd weekend, I felt somewhat confident that the raucous crowds that can sometimes happen on a hotly anticipated new release would be gone.

We arrived at the theater characteristically short on time, 8 o’clock showing and we got there ten minutes early. Lines were long and literally full of young people. I realized… oh, school must be out and there was a concert in downtown. Maybe some parents dropped their kids off at the mall to play while they went to the outdoor concert. But, again, I figured this was Fast 6’s 3rd weekend, no big deal. Got tickets, went into the theater. It was pretty full, but we had no problem getting a seat.

I noticed a large group of teenagers that appeared to be between 15-19 come in, maybe as many as 12 of them. They seemed a little loud just walking in, but thankfully they sat 6 rows behind us or so. Previews start and people react to them vocally. No problem, its to be expected in a crowded theater that previews will generate talking like “that looks good/bad”. BTW, the previews were AWFUL. What the hell were the makers of R.I.P.D. thinking?!

Anyway, the movie starts and right away this group of teens is talking. Like… loud. Not even about the movie. Just talking to themselves, making jokes, laughing loud. I tense up, breathe out, assume it’ll stop after a few minutes. Eight months ago I had a somewhat similar experience seeing the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall, two guys next to me were talking throughout the first 30 minutes of the movie. I’m not even concerned with whispering, whispering in the ear of the person next to you is not a big deal. These two teenaged guys were just flat out talking. Finally, I had enough, I turned to them and yelled “Shut the FUCK up, you’ve been talking throughout the whole movie.” They looked… horrified. And they were quiet for the rest of the movie. I didn’t mean to yell like that, its just what came out.

So anyway, I figured this group would stop talking after a few minutes and plus, they were several rows behind us. But they didn’t. 15 minutes into the movie they are still talking very loudly, not even about the movie, making jokes, laughing at themselves. I looked at them and two guys are standing up in the aisle and leaning on the handrail, with their feet up on their friends’ seats. What the fuck. Someone says to them “hey, can you be quiet please?” Their response, laughter, making jokes at the person, hand slapping. They don’t stop.

Twenty five minutes in a lady behind me looks at them and says “Really guys… really? C’mon” They laugh more. This just keeps going. For a few minutes here and there they do stop and I think “whew.. finally.” But they always started back up. The pleas for them to shut up continue, they keep ignoring them. I start looking at the exit, and our row and wonder how many people I’d disturb by leaving and going to find an employee. I halfway expect whole sections of the theater to stand up and start yelling at them. When they get really loud I can see people all over the theater shaking their heads and putting their head in their hands (we’re about 2/3 of the way back in the middle).

Why are they doing this?! What the fuck do they get out of this? If you want to talk to your friends, go sit at the food court. Go sit outside in the park like area thats in the center of the mall. Go home and watch a movie. What do you get out of yelling during a movie so people routinely ask you to be silent. SHUT THE FUCK UP. I know its not a serious movie, but people are trying to have a good time for crying out loud. People all over the theater could hear them.

I glance at them a few times when they are being particularly loud, they’re on their cell phones, texting, calling, showing each other things. What the fuck. Stop it. Just leave the movie, god damn.

Finally, about 3/4 of the way through, they left, or at least the loud ones did. Not sure what did it. I think maybe one of the women in their group was getting embarrassed or perhaps someone made them think they’d call the cops. Man, was it nice when they left.

We left the theater and I see this same group of kids sitting right outside in the hall and thats when it occurs to me. These kids probably didn’t even pay for this movie. They paid to get in, but the way this theater is set up, it would be very easy to theater hop if you wanted to. So, I surmised that they paid to get into a showing maybe much earlier when their parents’ outdoor music festival started, and have just been theater hopping ever since.

If you’re gonna theater hop and see movies for free. Fine. But what the fuck is you’re problem that you have to be so loud that numerous people for two hours tell you to be quiet? And why do you have no shame regarding this? If I was talking to a friend in a movie and someone asked me to be quiet, I would be so embarrassed. Why aren’t these assholes?

Bottom Line: Teenagers and/or other idiots. Shut up during movies. No one wants to hear you talk. NO ONE. Whatever it is your talking about is completely unnecessary. Nobody wants to hear you laughing at your own stupid jokes. SHUT THE FUCK UP

1368467628.0,25,self.rant,1e99gz,Why do the people who are always too warm get to control the damn temperature all the time?? I'm tired of being cold.,34,9,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1e99gz/why_do_the_people_who_are_always_too_warm_get_to/,"So I'm one of those people who is cold a lot of the time, and it's really annoying. I'm really small and always have been pretty small, and I think that's a big part of it. 

What's really starting to bother me, though, is that in my experience, the people who are too warm tend to get to call the shots, temperature-wise. I work in an office building with rented offices, and it's ALWAYS freezing in here. Today, it's colder inside than outside, and it's only 58 degrees F outside. My boss and I have a space heater running in our office just to keep warm. 

One of the things that frustrates me about this is I feel like a lot of the time, the people who are too hot are overweight, and are too hot *because* they're overweight. Now, I have no problem with overweight people. I don't think that because someone is bigger it automatically means they're less healthy than someone smaller. I don't think that people who are overweight are ugly or necessarily need to change themselves. BUT if someone's always hot because they're overweight, they shouldn't be able to dictate the temperature for everyone else in the area (which is what happens in my office building). If it's that much of a problem for them, then yeah, maybe they should focus on losing weight instead of making all the smaller people around them comfortable by turning the temperature way down.

The same damn thing happens when I hang out with friends. I'll be at a nice, comfortable temperature, and then someone will proclaim that they're hot and windows will be open and fans will be turned on, and I'll immediately be freezing. But when I'm too cold, no one caters to me. I'm expected to put on a sweater and suck it up. 

And yeah, I get it, it's easier to deal w/ the cold because you can put layers on to warm up. But I shouldn't have to be expected to wear 3 layers of clothing, socks, and gloves at all times just because some people can't stand being the slightest bit hot. It just doesn't seem fair.

There are people younger than me that claim to be 90s kids. They say they remember watching all these old shows on Nick and Cartoon Network and even the Simpsons. Guess what, all you've  seen were repeats in the 00s. You don't remember shit from the 90s you're just too ignorant to admit it was early 00s you remember.

They also say they remember stuff like reading rainbow and magic school bus. There weren't any new learning cartoons for a while so they had to use those up until 200X. They didn't JUST play those in the 90s.

They also claim they played stuff on original gameboy, n64, and psx. The generation of gaming after that was released around 00-01. Your family was just not interested/too poor to buy the new stuff. So you were stuck with old systems of the 90s.

And all of the candies and toys that were thought of in the 90s were eaten and played with by them. Candy and toys  end to last a while until production stops. I used to play with Rubik's cube and etch a sketches, does that make me a 40s-50s kid? No, it just means that I played with the mere shadow of the decade. Does not mean I am fully attached with the decade.

Furthermore, the people just think ages 0-6 is a majority of what being a kid is. They spend all of their childhood that they can remember, but say they are 90s kids just because they were kids for 4-6 years in a decade which they falsely remember.

Sorry if this is a common rant. Saw a post of a couple 16-17 year olds claiming to be 90s kids and had to type this stuff somewhere. I'm terrible a writing, so if you say this rant is terrible, I understand.

She - and I shit you not - angrily demanded that I change my profile pic to the red Equality symbol to show my support for gay marriage. She went on and on about the importance of civil rights and blah blah blah, and concluded that if I don't show my support, she would ""unfriend"" me. I declined to do so, and she made good on her promise, calling me a homophobe and a bigot.

I am a Libertarian, politically speaking. I have issues with marriage as a whole - a cultural institution - being part of the legal system in a multicultural society where multiple ""definitions"" of marriage are presumed. But all in all, **I have no problem with gays getting married**. I believe consenting adults should be able to enter whatever type of relationship they want, and it's nobody's business but theirs what they do in their private lives. I fail to see, however, how my refusal to *publicly* show support for gay marriage constitutes homophobia. The reason I'm not changing my profile pic is because **I do not want to get involved in the partisan debate.** I don't want to get into arguments, and I especially don't want to listen to the fuming vitriol coming from both sides of the issue. I just want to let the Supreme Court do its work, and when the time comes I will let my votes speak for me. Demanding that I publicly identify as a proponent of gay marriage (though a proponent I may be) for fear of being called a homophobe borders on McCarthyism and Stalinism. Right now I am preparing to ""come out"" as a person with Asperger's syndrome for Autism Awareness month, and I know I will face my fair share of stigma for that reason alone. I would rather not compound it with the controversy surrounding my support for gay rights.

tl;dr: Got called a homophobe for not showing support for gay rights. I support gay rights, but I'd prefer not to get involved in the debate, and forcing me to publicly show my support or face sanctions is complete bullshit.

Fuck you fundraising pricks with your condescending faces when I say I can't afford to donate to your oh so worthy cause that 80% of will go to managing the charity.

And why, why should I have to see the look of disappointment on his face come Christmas morning when Santa doesn't deliver?  Not because I'm not doing my job as a father, but because our fucking society has put so much time and effort into distorting the spirit of Christmas into a contest of who can get the most.

Why should I have to make choices like whether or not I'm going to pay my utilities this month or buy presents?  Would my kids rather have new hot wheels and action figures, or heat and electricity?  Would they rather have alot of toys on Christmas morning, or still have a room to play in.  Well I've made the choice, the only responsible one there is, and therefore by standards my kids Christmas will suck.

Will my kids understand that Dad is doing his best?  Will they take into consideration that I'm driving a deathtrap coming into a New England winter with 4 bald tires?

My 5 year old though, he knows already, he see's his friends with the 3DS's and such, while he still rocks the leapster he got 2 years ago.

Here's what I wish people would get through their fucking heads:

1. The customer isn't always right.  In fact, the customer is usually pretty drunk and his lushy opinion stopped being logical or valid an hour ago.

2. If you want your low-cut top to get you free drinks, come to my house and take the top off.

3. I worked in only one bar where a birthday could get you free drinks.  It had to be your 21st birthday, I needed to copy proof of birthdate, only 3 were free, and only you could come get them.

4. If I'm swamped, please don't order a Chocolate Ice Cream choo-choo or whatever.  Definitely don't complain if it takes me a minute to get it for you.  I'll make it and smile as I hand it to you, but I'm smiling because I'm imagining you being mauled by a lion.

5. If you say ""Surprise me""  I'm either dumping the bar mat or pouring you a fifteen dollar drink.  Depends on your tits.

6. I can describe the face of anyone who came in twice or more without tipping.  I can also describe the face of any regular good tipper.

7. I can refuse to serve you for any reason other than race/ethnicity/culture/religion/gender.  I can refuse to serve you just because you cause trouble every time you come in even if you haven't caused trouble yet tonight.

8. No you do not know the owner.  If you did, I'd know you.  The owner is also typically there or a phone call away.  Knowing the DJ doesn't help either.  I don't know him.  If he knows you and expects you to drink for free, he can give you twenty bucks.

9. I don't care where you saw the bottle or what you think a drink should cost.  If I tell you it's a premium, it's because the computer will charge you for a premium.  There is no button for, ""Wrong, computer.  That's a well drink.""

10. No valid ID, no drink.  The ABC regularly sends in undercover agents just to test that we are enforcing this.  The only way I'll take your word for it is if you look like you went to school with my grandparents.

11. Read your airline vouchers before ordering a bunch of drinks.  No I cannot change the order to reflect two orders of chicken wings because it 'costs the same' and only food was covered by your coupon.  At the end of the night, there's still two frozen bags of chicken wings in the kitchen and four shots in your stomach.  Owners notice.

12. ""What's good?"" is a question you ask when I have time to discern your damn preferences.  You and I both know I am capable of serving you a drink that I think is good and you might hate.  Leave me with nothing to go on, pay for whatever you get.

13. Too much ice, not enough alcohol, no umbrella, doesn't taste right, blah blah blah.  Fuck off.  You got the same drink everyone gets when they order what you ordered.

14.  You think I don't see you.  I don't.  I see drinks on the bar.  If there's a fleshy bag at one end of the bar with no drink in front of them, yeah I saw that.  I also know how long you've been there and don't bother lying to me about how long you've been waiting.  It's not like I have a special bottle of delicious and cheap liquor for people who waited too long.  

15. I have a system for working my way up and down the bar.  Sometimes people know the system and position themselves strategically.  They might get served before you.  Sometimes they even do it by accident.  You were not so fortunate.  It's not personal unless you can think of a logical reason that it might be.

16.  Your five dollars isn't any more valuable to me than someone else's five dollars.  ""I pay good money"" does not make me think your cash is sprinkled with wish-dust.

17.  I decide when you've had too many.  Not you.  I'm *required* to make this decision for you.

18.  Get in a fight, you're both out.  I've heard every excuse from ""he started it"" to ""I'm going through a really rough time since the accident"" to ""That guy insulted the military.  Aren't you military?""  They all told me their excuses on their way out the door.  You can go outside, fight, and come back in once you are calm.  I'll give you a napkin full of ice for your face.  You might even get me to pour you a free drink depending on the circumstances.  Seen it, done it.

Golden Rule:  The bar OWNER is usually NOT the barTENDER.  If you're trying to score anything for free, you're asking the bartender to pay for it, and I don't even know you.  Bring someone with you that cares if you're having a cost-free time and get them to pay for it.  Don't ever expect me to give you a free anything unless there's a posted owner's policy dictating the circumstances.  You might get a free something anyway, but 100% of those occasions were all times that they received an unexpected surprise.

You may say, ""You're here to serve me, I'm the paying customer""  ""No I know this one alcohol that's actually really awesome"" ""I went to this one bar and I know this one bartender who would say you're totally wrong.""

My home was about 1 mile from the beach, elevation 9 ft above sea level. The property was on a small hill and the house had stood for 30 years and never flooded. I packed my car the way I would for a weekend trip and my wife and I left town.

We stayed at my uncles home in Mobile, AL about 30 minutes away. It stormed pretty hard but we sat on the front porch and watched most of it. Even drove around for about an hour during the peak of it. The destruction happening at my home however was unfathomable.

We left the moment the storm cleared up and we were some of the first people back to town. It honestly looked like a nuclear bomb was detonated. Almost the entire town was flattened. 80% of the population was left homeless. I had 8 feet of water in my home and lost everything except my weekend bag, pillow, car and dog. My wife (gf at the time) lost everything as well. 6 feet of water in her home.

It's difficult to describe to someone what it was like because most people have never experienced such a thing. Most people can relate to someone who say, for instance, lost everything in a fire. But there's always someone to help out. A bed, some clothes, a hot shower and warm meal. Those things are still provided for a family who lost a home in a fire. The difference here is, everyone lost everything. There were no homes left to go to. No family was without need. For hundreds of miles there was nobody to turn to.

Small background info for sake of the story: I've never been on any type of government assistance before in my life.

The storm took my home and my job. I applied for assistance. 10 months later I received my first bit of assistance, a check for 5k (to replace the SBA estimation of 45k worth of lost items not including my home) and a fema trailer for 1 year. It was better than nothing and I happily accepted it. I figured 1 year rent free living would get me back on the right track. I was wrong. We've struggled ever since.

The entire year I spent with horrible migraines and sinus infection/ear infections. Doctor visit after doctor visit, all year. My wife went through the same miserable time. Then we find out we had been poisoned by formaldehyde in the fema trailer, along with thousands of other people. My wife had spent the first four months of her pregnancy in that fema trailer and the child was born with a slight birth defect in his foot. Luckily his body repaired itself over time and he's perfectly normal today. Needless to say, I was livid.

I decided to join a lawsuit that was filed on behalf of the poisoned. I've never been in a lawsuit before, never been on government assistance before. All this was new territory for me. The attorney just kept saying he would let us know when something happened. In the meantime, we kept getting huge manila folders full of paperwork to fill out. We did everything we were suppose to do and eventually it began to be pushed further and further back in our minds. We only rarely think about it anymore.

So today I get a letter stating the lawsuit is over. I should receive my check in the next 6 weeks. For $160. fml

Most job applications are done online so there's no human element to it so of course I will never get a job this way!  I'm just another number to any employers.  I'm no social butterfly so it's not like I can simply make a network.  What am I suppose to do?  Randomly walk into a business and make small talk with the manager during work hours? 

I even tried Craigslist and nothing!  It's either a scam or some hairy old man trying to get some strange.  There are no legitimate jobs.  I even tried looking for gigs and part time jobs that will give me some extra cash in my pocket but nope.  There is absolutely nothing posted at all times.

I give up!  I'm already looking for homeless shelters to live in because that seems to be my future.  I'm sick of burning gas I can't afford looking for a job I will never get and I'm sick of being online 24/7 looking for a job that won't happen!

It seems to be my destiny to be a bum.

I dunno about you but as a straight male I would sure as hell be pissed off if I got tricked into getting frisky with a transgendered person. I wouldnt be violent per se, but I'd definetly tell the person to fuck off.

I don't see how the ""oh well that person identifies with that gender so he/she is that gender"" argument nullifies this. I am not interested in a human with a penis. I don't want to make out with a human with a penis. Ever. I don't get how that's offending.

For one thing, the class in general are assholes to the professor. Twenty minutes before class ends, they're all packing up their shit as loudly as possible until the poor guy gives up and dismisses us.

But this past week, I met the queen of the assholes. I made the mistake of sitting in front of her that day. We had taken a test a couple of weeks earlier, and would get it back that day. But, of course, this is a 90 minute class. There's more to do than just hand back tests. There has to be a lecture, still, especially this close to finals.

This girl apparently did not agree. From the beginning of class, I could hear her behind me repeating stuff like ""I'm only here for the damn test, shut up and give me my test!"" At first, this was muttered to her friends nearby, and they laughed a bit. Then she kept repeating it, louder and louder. Through the whole lecture, every couple of minutes. Towards the end, it got loud enough that I was having problems hearing the professor, and since we were in the first few rows, I wonder if he could hear her. It became more like ""That's enough fucking lecture, stop with the damn slides, just give me my fucking test!"" with no care for those around her who were trying to take notes.

Then it came time to pass back the tests. So she should be happy, right? 

Wrong. Apparently she's towards the end of the alphabet. Because as each name was called, I got to hear from behind me, ""I don't give a shit about him/her, where's my fucking test?"" I'm towards the end of the alphabet myself, so I had to hear this quite a few times.

'Count Steve and I in for some BBQ and, of course, drinks!   Sounds fun. '

Fucking really?  First thing in the morning, I'm exposed to one of the three stupidest grammatical errors an adult person can make, next to confusing which ""there/their/they're"" or ""your/you're"" to use.  This is a bad omen for my work day.

Call me old fashioned, but these things matter a little bit to me.

It seems like, about five years ago, ""me"" was the word to use.  For example, ""Him and me are gonna go ride our bikes around,"" or ""Bob and me are Patriots fans.""  Somewhere along the line, word was disseminated amongst the drooling masses that ""me"" was *sometimes* the wrong word to use.  So now everybody and his/her incontinent grandmother uses ""I"" in any sentence that contains themselves and another person.  Can we meet in the middle and just learn how to make a sentence?

You'd sound like a goddamned fool if you said to someone,
""Hey, would you like to go to a movie with I?""
""Me like to drive my car.""
""Me is thinking about food.""
""Count I in for some BBQ and drinks!""

So what's different when you put another person into these sentences?  FUCKING NOTHING.  My mom taught me how to do this when I was 10 FUCKING YEARS OLD.  If a ten year old can do it, so can your grown-up ass.  You sound like a goddamn fool when you make this mistake.

Let's have a quick lesson.  I'll skip the technicals, because I know anyone who needs this lesson doesn't, or can't, care.

*********

TO BEGIN: If you want to say that you went to the mall with someone, first make the sentence without that person.

""I went to the mall.""

Now add the other person.

""ARNOLD SCHWARZENNEGER AND I went to the mall.""


Let's try another:

""Would you like to go to the movies with me?""

Now add the other person.

""Would you like to go to the movies with VOLTRON AND me?""


NOT VERY FUCKING HARD, IS IT?  No, it's not.
The only time it gets even remotely complicated is when you have to change ONE other word from singular to plural.  Take for example:

""I am going to drill you in the booty hole.""

Now add the other person.

""THAT CRAZY HOBO AND I *ARE* going to drill you in the booty hole.""

Holy shit.  That was pretty complicated, right?  No.  If you know the difference between one thing and more than one thing, you can do it.

IT IS DRIVING ME F-ING NUTS,27,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hljmf/staying_at_my_bfs_parents_house_it_is_driving_me/,"Currently my boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house. He is in the process of getting accepted to a job further upstate but we are waiting for his security clearance to go through. The company said it could take up to 2 months. So we are staying with his parents per their request until the job comes through. It is driving me nuts. They are really nice people but they are so opposite of how I was raised. I shall give examples

1. They are messy, not just a little messy borderline Hoarders messy. The house is never cleaned, they leave dirty dishes lying around for days before they clean them. They will do the dishes in the kitchen but never check in the living room for more dishes. I have cleaned them on several occasions just bc it bothered me so much. They have trained their Son (not my bf he is a foster kid) to be the same way. They all clip their nails, and toe nails in the middle of the living room. I can't remember the last time they vacuumed the living room. Its awful. On top of that my bfs mother has barely any hygiene. She leaves a mess everywhere she goes and doesn't clean it up. She is highly over weight and blames it on everything other than her sheer laziness. All she does is sleep or sit in her chair. When she uses the bathroom she ends up pissing on the seat and it ends up going onto the removable carpet that's under the toilet, and does she take it up to clean it. NOPE! It stay's there for several days to approx 2 weeks and she doesn't wash it. It wreaks in there. It smells awful, and rather than actually cleaning the bathroom they put one of those plug in oil burners in the bathroom WHICH DOESN'T WORK! The kitchen is an absolute mess majority of the time and its because of her. SHE REFUSES TO CLEAN! (Warning: Bit of political incorrectness here but deal with it) I was raised in an old fashioned house (so shoot me) where the man doesn't do all the cleaning, the women ESPECIALLY IF SHE ISN'T WORKING cleans the house and makes it presentable for her husband and guests when they come home or visit. NOPE! Her husband has to clean everything and then she has the audacity to say ""You know I do that differently when I clean"" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME SHE NEVER CLEANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and when she does it's half-assed and still needs to be re-cleaned. She huff and puffs when dishes aren't done when she needs something. ARE YOU KIDDING YOU HAVE HANDS CLEAN IT YOURSELF! Her birth son like I said is just the same way.

2. Their table manners are like those of savages who haven't eaten in several months. They have both elbows on the table, food literally on their foreheads (like ketchup), I mean how the fuck do you manage that. It understandable for little kids but come on. They slurp, talk with mouth full, cough with mouth full with out covering face, and smack their lips all the time. His mom gets food all over herself. Its really bad, and then she looks at me as if I fucked something up when I forget to grab a napkin. They set the table and when they do they fondle the fork and knives, the parts that go in your food and in your mouth. Disgusting! I seriously have to look down at my plate so that I don't flip my shit from the nightmare that goes on. 

3. Their son is a selfish fucking pain in the ass. I was raised where if you fucked up you knew it and you always heard about it. Nope if their son fucks up his mom is right there defending him. He stood litterally right outside of the bathroom when I was peeing waiting for me to get out, then pushed his way past me. I can understand needing to use the bathroom bad but come on some cooth goes a long way. It upset me and made me uncomfortable and I told his mother and she said Deal With It... Every time something happens that pisses me off or makes me uncomfortable I'm told to deal with it and then I have to hear excuses and hear them defend him. No nail that fucking kid to the ground. He is too big for his britches and needs a good smack to the head. GRAHHH!!!!!!

4. Their shopping is the next worse thing. THEY HAVE NO SHOPPING ETHIC. They bitch about having no money but they go out, do shopping come back with 5 bags of ""food"" and it costs them about $400. Then when barely a week goes by they start bitching about how there is no food in the house. YAY ITS BECAUSE YOU ARE SPENDING OUTSIDE YOUR MEANS... Rather than by cheap and quality they are buy expensive with absolutely no quality. Then when I buy food for myself and for my diet (have hypothyroidism need to buy certain snacks) they fucking eat it all before I even get too look at it. Its fucking ridiculous. On top of it it doesn't help that there birth son eats them out of house and home. He goes through a box of pasta in one sitting, and then is still ""starving"". Kid I grew up piss poor broke, no food, and only a few pieces of bread or a hot dog to hold me. You don't know the meaning of ""Starving"". What they should do is have him buy his own food, then he will know just how much of a bitch it is to pay for his ass and might not give his parent's so much attitude when they tell him he can't have anymore, or to save some for someone else. He won't do it though bc he is too fucking cheap. The car that his ass is in all day while working he refuses to put gas in. His parent's have too or else it won't get filled. He bitches about putting only $20 in. HEY THAT'S LIFE KID GET USED TO IT, NO ONE IS GOING TO PAY YOUR WAY! 

Rant is done for now. I'm sure I'll post again soon bc of the next fucking thing they did.

TL;DR   I fucking hate living with my bf's parents. I am grateful for their help and allowing us to stay with them but fuck it, its not worth this shit.

Always has. It's so noticeable that my youngest has asked me several times why Grandma doesn't like her. It breaks my heart and pisses me off to absolutely NO END. 

In the past it would be Kid 1 would get a huge box of stuff and Kid 2 got nothing. I mentioned that it was NOT okay that if you send one kid something outside of their birthday you must send the other something (or send nothing at all, I don't care if no one other than me gets my kids stuff). She agreed. 

Next box, FULL of stuff for Kid 1, Kid 2 got a pair of socks... so I had to talk to her AGAIN, no, if you send Kid 1 toys, you need to send kid 2 toys as well. 

It got to the point where I didn't speak to her for a full year because of a stunt she pulled.After a YEAR she swore she'd stop with the favorites bullshit. I laid down very clear ground rules, it's fine if you have a favorite (I can't stop you) but you MUST treat my children fairly. I will not tolerate anything else. 

WELL... Kid 2's birthday is coming up in a couple days, today I got the boxes in the mail from MIL. I open them up and I'm going through them my oldest has the same amount of gifts as my youngest... same size and wrapped too.  WTAF!?  Back when it was Kid 1's birthday, Kid 2 didn't get anything. 

And she honestly wonders why Kid 2 doesn't LIKE HER. Gee I can't imagine why the kid you've shafted for 8 fucking years doesn't like you. 

It's a good thing she lives on the other side of the country because I'd like to punch her in the face.

-In history, a very large, mentally impaired boy would call out after each question. He would ask about nonsensical things such as California Pizza Kitchen, and always drool on the desks of those around him. Anyone who dared confront him, he told his school appointed therapist they were mean to him, and they got detention. Teachers who were reported were reprimanded.

-In science, a girl with Down's syndrome. She would also drool on kids' work and constantly sing to herself. She would also always stand to do so. When asked by the teacher to sit down, she laughed and refused to do so, resulting in a confrontation.

Children like this who are obviously incapable of functioning in the learning environment should not be mixed with those children who are actually learning. They distract students and waste the time of instructors. It is better to not have mentally impaired children in regular classrooms.

Now, I am not suggesting a eugenics program. I am simply saying that there should be classrooms or periods set aside for *only* the mentally impaired children. This would help them receive specialized education while not distracting others.

How they were quite advanced for the time as far as social settings, they had restaurants and bars and regular theater showings and many things comparable to modern entertainment/accommodations/luxury services, but that they were also extremely primitively sexual. There were regular orgies and even locations specifically created and maintained exclusively for these orgies, many phallic/sexually themed pieces of art, very obvious indications of the overtly sexual ways of society. The article made it sound like it was so shocking that they were so sexual yet so socially advanced.

This got me thinking &amp; honestly, I find the sexual nature of this society to be even more complementary to these advances. They were mature enough to understand and accept that sex is extremely important and natural, not to be shunned for the sake of some God. They were advanced enough to circumvent ""appropriate societal norms"". 

Think about it, if people didn't spend so much time worrying about what is appropriate, what should and shouldn't be censored, how they should or should not present things or themselves to others, etc, society as a whole would be far more productive. Language, dress, products, advertising, demographics, entertainment, social interactions, basically any broken down individual aspect of society you can think of could somehow benefit by removing the ""offensive"" factor of thinking. People would be more tolerant of others, allowing for more peace. Advertisements could be more honest &amp; to the point. Kids wouldn't be so ashamed of the ""taboo"" and be all fucked up about natural thoughts/desires/bodily functions as adults. If boobs were openly accepted, nobody would even look twice when they were on TV or if a woman went topless walking down the street (just like men do!). If it was socially acceptable for a person to admit aloud in public that they are most sexually attracted to [insert fetish here] more people could be less ashamed of themselves for various aspects of their body, lifestyle, preferences, etc. If sex were just a fact of life, obvious to all, and maybe even presented as an age appropriate activity like, say, driving...what would the world be like? If kids were exposed to sex and involved topics just like cars. They know it's a normal part of life but they aren't old enough to do it yet. Prostitutes are like taxi drivers, homosexuals are like single-car families or something, glamorous porn is like luxury cars while normal people sex is like mini-vans, fantasies are like that car you love that's too expensive but you still think about getting it someday......it's just normal and when you eventually are old enough to have sex, whatever you like is just like whatever type of vehicle you end up choosing to drive, and it's all good &amp; natural &amp; okay. 

Cursing is becoming more &amp; more socially acceptable all the time...but it's still censored for public broadcast. Even dumb words that aren't curse words are censored now. How stupid is it that society is so stuck-up that we have to censor words like 'gun', 'bullet', 'shoot' on the radio? I get that they're censoring for violence, but honestly if you've tuned into a rap station you already know half the songs are going to be about  Nines and bustin' caps or whatever...if you're child is in the car then buy a damn nursery rhyme CD if you're so worried about their sensitive ears. Little girls singing about ""All I wanna do is rock your body"" is just as bad as them singing bad words...and why do we have to censor language for kids anyway? If this was another age-appropriate societal norm then it wouldn't matter! After a few years of removing censorship, this would all be normal and nobody would care anymore. If you want to censor everyone &amp; everything because you don't want to explain to your kid that things are normal and okay but only once they're old enough then that says more about you &amp; your parenting skills than it does about society. And as for offending people, if these things were normal &amp; acceptable then they wouldn't be offensive anymore! It's all in the way people take things. I live in a highly religious community and saying ""Oh my God"" in public is the same as ""Oh my holy fucking child-molesting Christ is a nigger fag ass shit!"" because the society is offended by the word ""God"" in a non-religious context. Short-shorts or a sleeveless top are as scandalous as having your genitals exposed. It's all just bullshit...we've hit a plateau as far as societal growth because people are offended by so much.

**DISCLAIMER:** None of this is to say we shouldn't protect others from dangers like rapists or child molesters, but there are other ways to do that than to censor the shit out of everything.

To shit with the supposed job opportunities that come with said rag; quite a few young people are graduating from private universities, even in STEM fields, and heading right back to McDonald's. School is not everything in the real world, and that's what our ignorant elders *keep failing* to *understand*!

My university email account gets a constant barrage of ""job posting"" messages. That's supposed to mean FUCKING **JOB** POSTINGS, not these outrageously infuriating unpaid internships! Also, I occasionally look for gigs on Craigslist, and at least half the postings there are invariably unpaid. And yes, I am looking in a Reddit-vaunted STEM field as well as in writing, which I can obviously by this post at least do with competence.

Corporations are shameless. Thankfully, my university doesn't require us to take unpaid internships for credit as all too many schools do. Doubtless these schools are receiving decent compensation for sending so many gofers their way. Nonetheless, I am constantly barraged with messages about how internships are necessary for getting a job.

[They are illegal](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm), but go on unchecked. What in the fuck do you think an intern's purpose is? I'll tell you what it is. It's to be as good a boy or girl as possible so you can impress your potential future employer. It's to fetch coffee and file papers. It's to prove that one day, you might get a reference from your boss if not a job from him or her. But that day never seems to be today.

I refuse to participate. I'll never give any of **MY** time and **MY** effort without fair pay. I already make OK money freelancing, so if I have to go through an unpaid ""trial period"" to get a job, I won't take your fucking job just to make some Ivy League MBA jerk even richer; I'll keep doing what I'm doing. I won't work for someone who does no work of his or her own, opting instead to drink in his or her plush office and delegate tasks. I know all too well these ""manager"" types; they talk like they work 25 hours a day dragging a cross through the building, but this is a Machiavellian PR tactic; they really just drink in their office, delegate all the work to their subordinates, and take all the credit while passing down all the blame. They hold ""meetings"" in country clubs and upscale restaurants. They don't work; they live it up on the fruits of our labor!
__________
Oh, and (trigger warning) I came across [this video](http://youtu.be/zs_Hld6Wj8U?t=2m42s) in which Kevin O'Leary says exactly what I'm saying: that unpaid interns are there to impress their boss through hard work, and their only compensation is that they *might* get a job later on.

Fuck that country club Republican, silk-curtain Irish blowhard in the ass. Obviously he's taking his hollow rich WASP businessman act to the outrageous extreme with his libertarian fuck-everyone-but-me rhetoric. We've seen what unbridled capitalism did to your people 100-odd years ago, working long hours in miserable conditions for pennies, and he wants it to happen again. And it is happening again through the modern internship craze, the decline of unions, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

**EDIT:** A couple of commenters are indignantly huffing about how most unpaid internships in fact *are* legal according to my link; they're ""working interviews,"" in fact!

Look at [this Craigslist section for New York unpaid writing gigs](http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/wrg?zoomToPosting=&amp;query=&amp;srchType=A&amp;addThree=nopay). If you want an example, look at [this ""Blogger Internship"" post](http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/wrg/3858737854.html). Clearly these people are looking for free workers, offering nothing but résumé padding and/or a potential job there in the future.

Now look at the Department of Labor link above. Note the line about ""no immediate advantage."" I am not a lawyer, but give me a break on this one. Of course there are some internships which provide training and not exploitation, but don't act like I'm ranting about a fantasy. Notice Kevin O'Leary's statement above as well.

Ever since high schools been around there has always been a social hierarchy amongst the students.  It seems to be getting worse year after year.  Students are getting more and more cruel, selfish, irrational and just being followers.  A lot of high school students are turning into *""sheep""* so to speak.  They just follow the next move, the next trend.  I remember when I was a freshman I was made fun of a lot for wearing torn up shoes and cheap thrift store clothes because my family didn't have a lot of money.  Any rational person wouldn't make such a big deal out of this but their insecurity about being socially accepted is so great they feel like it's their job to be jerks..  I was always different in school for having a mind of my own and being more mature than most kids my age.  I told them I don't feel the need to buy a $400 outfit from the fashion line of a rapper so I can have *""swag""*  but apparently in their eyes I'm the stupid one.  What amazes me is the amount of stupidity and ignorance that goes on.  There's more to blame than just the kids.  Shitty parents or lack of parents can negatively impact the behavioral patterns of any child.  So to all the kids who are victims in school keep in mind no matter what happens amongst the lockers doesn't mean a damn thing when you get out.  It won't matter what you wear, what you did (except academic achievements), or what sports you played because high school is a bullshit place were nothing matters when you get out so keep your head up high and graduate.

Some people show their creative side via painting, writing or creating other forms of art. Others through more physical means, such as sports, hitting the gym, or shark wrestling in bolo ties (borderlands 2 reference; 10 Internets). Myself, I fall into the couch potato middle ground; I physically exert myself at work ( I'm a Bouncer by trade) and then chill out at home with a good video game and a metric fuck-ton of snacks and 12 year old scotch. 

On my smoke breaks at work, or when I’m stumped at a particular level on XCOM, I write stuff. And since I’m a huge fan of Cracked.com, my thing I make good words for now time (fuck’n) is a list of the 6 kinda of drunks, and why they piss me off.

**The Floater**

Not a reference to that damn BM that just won’t flush, although more often then not they smell the same. Usually an older male, always by themselves. 

**Modus Operandi**

Will prop up at the bar and order a beer, always the largest and cheapest one without fail. After 2-3 beers, the Floater will lick his lips and cast his gaze around the bar. Finding a group  or an individual person, they will sidle up next to them and join their conversation whether they want to talk to him or not. Generally this lasts for 10 minutes or so until the group excuse themselves and either walk out the bar, or move somewhere else. 

**Why they piss me off**

They drive away patrons. And unless said patrons complain to staff or security, we can’t do jack shit. Can’t stop a person from initiating a conversation, however banal it might be. And if the Floater pisses off an Alpha, well, sparks will fly. 

**How to deal with them**

If you are a fellow patron, politely inform them you are not interested in a conversation. Staff, don’t give them more than 2 beers. Security, old fashioned tap on the shoulder and a quick “Sit down and shut the fuck up” speech.

Speaking of Alpha’s…

**The Alpha**

Good segue! Good segue. We all know an Alpha, and I personally hate them with a fucking passion that transcends Snooki’s love of fake tan and fellatio. Early 20’s to late 30’s, tribal tattoo down one arm, hulking musculature crammed into an Ed Hardy or UFC shirt. *shudders*

**Modus Operandi**

Usually grouped with a few friends, the Alpha cares little for others enjoyment. Hell, the main reason that they are in a bar in the first place is to get fucked up and/or fuck someone up. Order up tequila shots, followed by the obligatory scotch and coke. Then more shots, most likely a few Jäger Bombs thrown in for good measure…. 

**Why they piss me off**

…Then someone bumps into them, perhaps spilling a drink. Or guy across the room looks over in his general direction. Then he’s Macho Man Randy Savage (RIP buddy) minus the 80’s fluorescent print tights. Chest out, jaw squared, shoulders back, ass puckered. If you look remotely male, you’re a target. Butch female, still a target. Then the violence ensues without logic or reason. 

**How to deal with them**

Patrons, avoid eye contact, back away slowly. Much like an Angry dog. Wait, EXACTLY like an angry dog. Staff, if you have worked in a bar for a while you can see the Alpha coming a mile away. Give the Manager and Security the heads up. And Security, find the first excuse you can to get these cock juggling chucklefucks out of the bar. Knock ‘em back at the door; minor sparks outside will prevent a major explosion inside.

**The Shrieker**

No general description here, until they get a few drinks up them.

**Modus Operandi**

They could be anyone, literally. You’re sitting there, having a nice drink with mates, than someone decides they don’t have an inside voice. It might just start with a boisterous laugh, but over time and multiple alcahmaholic beverages the Shrieker’s voice ascends to somewhere between a dog whistle and the chorus from ‘I believe in a thing called Love’ by The Darkness.

**Why they piss me off**

Sheer irritation. They annoy the living hell outta me. There is nothing that destroys the atmosphere of a good night out then someone screaming like a banshee whose foot was run over by a 4WD, instead of talking at a normal level. 
Seriously, try it right now; read the following sentence out loud, wherever you are, at a higher pitch than usual, at a volume that is reminiscent of a 50’s ‘Scream Queen’ and follow it up with an Eddie Murphy-esque laugh: 

*‘Oh my god, I can’t believe how much peppermint Schnapps you can drink in a row!’*

Yeh. Cringeworthy. Don’t lie.

**How to deal with them**

Patrons, Staff and Security; headphones, earplugs, and an elbow to the throat respectively.

**The Denier**

Again, could be anyone, and is also the most common one on this list. Usually in a pair at least. My best mate is one, and it shits me to tears.

**Modus Operandi**

Gets munted beyond belief, whilst still thinking they are good as gold. *(Side note; what does that mean? I mean, yeah, gold is pretty awesome, but to describe it as good is pretty underwhelming really.)*
Anyway, when the Denier is confronted by staff or security, they will…well…deny that they are drunk, but not before the share a puzzled look with their friend not unlike you just spoke to them in another language entirely. Hospitality Staff, you know that look. For non-hospo crew, think that bird from the Twilight movies.

**Why they piss me off**

Reasoning doesn’t work. Logic doesn’t work. Words with more than two syllables doesn’t work. You could explain the situation to them as if they were a six year old, and you’ll get the same Bella Swan look every single time. Eventually, frustrated, you start to move them on and they play innocent dumb-arse, exclaiming ‘What have I done wrong?!?’ Like I haven’t just spent 10 minutes DRAWING YOU A FUCKING PICTURE CHIEF? 

**How to deal with them**

Get a black pen, a red one and a post-it note. Draw a stick figure of a guy with a red nose, with a few bubbles leading from its face with ‘hic’ written inside them. Attach the post-it note to a drinks tray. *THEN* approach and explain to the Denier what the go is. The second - the literal **millisecond** you see that confounded look on their face - **bludgeon them with the noted drink tray** until you are restrained/they pass out/the voices stop screaming at you.

**The Suit**

Full disclosure time; I have been this a few times. Justified at the time mind you, I’ll explain that one later. The Suit looks what it sounds; a physical suit, or metaphorical one.It might be a nice tailor made Yves St Laurens, or a dude in a Dimmey’s $99 special. Regardless, it’s the air of superiority they give off that is the REAL giveaway.

**Modus Operandi**
     
Top shelf with all the trimmings. Scotch AND coke? Pfft, heathen. The Suit will, whether you like it or not, have that certain mien about them. And lo, do not try to tell them that the are intoxicated good sir, because their imaginary monocles will pop with your sheer audacity of speaking to someone above your station! They will give valid (to them) reasons of why you should be leaving them be, and various offhand threats to your job and the venue if you don’t dance to their tune. 

**Why they piss me off**

I’ll admit; I’m a bogan. An ejumacated one, but a bogan nonetheless. For overseas readers, think redneck or chav. So the upper crust will always rub me the wrong way. But here’s the thing; I’ve been doing this job for a damn long time. Long enough to know what people are gunna say before it comes out of their mouth, and have spiels lined up to counter it. So when some pre-law 20 something starts telling me how to do MY JOB, I will verbally *OWN THEM*. Which brings me to my afore mentioned example; 
     
About 6 years ago at the age of 25 I was carded at the door at a bar I regularly drink at, with a new doorman that couldn’t have been 19, AND I found out later that it was the owners son. Remember that, its important. Producing my security licence, he refused it, stating that it wasn’t a valid ID (which is technically accurate) and denied me entry. 
     
I gave him the Denier look, then kicked my brain into high gear. I stepped back, lit a smoke and checked the logo on his Tag (security number that Victorian Crowd Controllers have to wear on the job). Firing off 2 quick texts, I stepped back in and stated to him that yes, my ID wasn’t acceptable under Victorian law, but that it was valid in the sense of 59a of the Criminals Act, which is ONE reason we check ID on doors in the first place. 
I then asked him to check his phone. He done so with trepidation, groaned, then stepped aside. I couldn’t resist giving him a conciliatory pat on the shoulder. 

Y’see, not only have I worked for his father at the very same venue in the past (text 1) I was one of the Operations Manager for the Company that subcontracted to another company (his company, text 2) effectively making me his superior. 

Not my proudest moment, but it just goes to show; anything you can say, I can easily retort. 

**How to deal with them**

Quick on your feet and mind your p’s and q’s, because the suit will catch on a Mis-said word or incorrect phrasing and exploit it to their means. When all else fails, be as obnoxious as humanly possible until they crack the shits, then toss ‘em out for being quarrelsome.

**The Unseen**

The Unseen is living proof that some people shouldn’t go out in public without some form of supervision and a helmet. How else could you explain the shit they think they can get a way with?

**Modus Operandi**

The Unseen firmly believe that they are invisible to anyone that’s watching. Tries to pour themselves drinks from over the bar. Jumps up on chairs and tables. Throws ice around a crowded dance floor. Basically they do what ever they want, and act like a martyr when you kick them out after the umpteenth warning.

**Why they piss me off**

Sheer. Fucking. Arrogance. Who in Zod’s name (KNEEL BEFORE ZOD) gives you the notion that walking around a bar with your cock out is a good idea? And one of my pet peeves is one that the Unseen excel at; shagging in a toilet. Really? You’re THAT desperate to plant one, you’ll do so on a mountain of bacteria most likely in view of people trying to take a piss, just so you can walk straight back out to the bar afterward and get another drink? 

Buy a six pack of Carlton Draught/PBR and get a hotel room you filthy, filthy gene pool excreta. 

**How to deal with them**

As harshly as fucking possible, and always interrupt them having sex. These arse-wipes should not breed.

Anyways, that’s it for me. Now I got a 12 - 16 hour on a full moon. There will be blood.

You don't really have to ask. Besides, most refugees end up in China (they won't admit it because of their illegal status). Most of the remainder goes to South Korea (they are under a special form of witness protection).


There are over 700000 ethnic Koreans in the US. Do you really think you're going to meet one of the few dozen North Korean refugees? Don't kid yourself. I've seen Korean-Chinese and Korean-Japanese and even pre-1945 Korean immigrants, but I've never met North Koreans. If you really want to meet North Koreans, go to North Korea.

In the four years we've been split up, I have made every accommodation for visitation with him. He owns no car, and we live about an hour apart. Any time, and I mean, I have never once told him no, any time he wants her, I drive her an hour round-trip. This is never on any consistent basis, and it usually involves me emailing him to remind him to spend time with her. She absolutely adores him, and I'm not taking him away from her. 

He took her last night, from 7pm, to 9am. I was told the 9am thing was because he had to work. He works in an apartment complex, and lives there as well. I've only been invited into the apartment a few times, and we always meet at the office. Usually, he is dressed and ready for work. Today, he was in pajamas. 

So, he didn't get his daughter until 7pm last night, and even though he has a day off, he had to hand her back over at 9am, for whatever reason. I probably wouldn't be pissed, but I'm sick today, and instead of lying in bed recuperating, I've got to handle running a household by myself, while working from home with a five-year old running around. I'm so mad right now I can't see straight. 

We always hear horror stories about the moms that won't let the dad see the kids. I'm not that mother. If I want her to grow up happy and well-adjusted, I know she needs some sort of relationship with her dad. 

But what the hell can I do when he never wants time with her? Her birthday party is this weekend, and as I always do, I have invited him and his new girlfriend. I am never impolite to him, I never mention the past. I stick to the topic of our daughter, and nothing else. 

He pays a ridiculously low amount of child support, but I don't ask for more money, because I know he would be destitute without it. I get by just fine on my own, and he have great health insurance for her, which is something I wouldn't be able to do on my own. 

EDIT, misplaced word

I'm just sick of picking up the slack ALL THE TIME. I'm sick of being in charge and in control all the time. I just want to be able to sit down and be sick like a normal person.

I try to tell her that the US is ranked something like 17th in education, that our healthcare system is flawed, that we're in a borderline police state where police can forcibly draw blood if they suspect drunk driving or prohibit teenagers from leaving their homes after midnight, that we're fat and lazy, that we're culturally barren and isolated from other countries, that we're racist and sexist and homophobic, etc.

Having previously never won a game, this week we finally managed to win and take home the grand prize. Almost immediately after calling out our win the entire pub started shouting at our group for cheating.

This has royally pissed me off. We've been a loyal customer for ages, the bar-staff knew us all, some of the regulars knew us, yet we were accused of cheating. They told us we used our phones to look up the answers (we didn't) yet most of the other groups had their phones out too. We were told we were too young to know some of the answers, despite some of the questions being fairly common knowledge. As a result, the bar lady had to 'remind everyone' that forms of cheating ruined the fun of the game. We then got a reduced prize fund for winning, a couple of people left and we've had our reputation smudged.

I'm happy we won but I hate the fact that any joy we had was instantly crushed by these old fucks who think they know better than we do, who think we're too young to be able to win. It's not like we don't buy drinks, it's not like we've never been there before.

I'm continually amazed at what they report on: Some guy talking about extraterrestrials, day two of coverage of James Gandolfini's death (update: he's still dead). Recap after recap of the NBA final. A story about a kid who hear's his Dad's voice for the first time, a brief mention of the Senate immigration bill, then on to more light-hearted bullshit.

Angelina Jolie went to Syria and filed a story exclusively for CNN documenting the plight of the Syrian refugees. And what did CNN do? They made a story about her making a story - then only showed snippets and soundbites of the piece. Of course, they had to mention the double mastectomy and how she was seen with Brad Pitt at his latest premiere, but only a precious few seconds about the actual subject of her story. 

Then they teased the hell out of Morgan Spurlock's new show - which is pretty much the same as ""30 Days"" but with a different title. 

And then there's Anthony Bordain's new show on CNN - which is also pretty much the same as ""No Reservations"" but with a different title.

Now, I usually end up catching CNN in the morning, so I also get to be subjected to their morning yak fest program. No longer looking like a news set, its three people sitting at a table ""happy talking"" about whatever they're told to happy talk about. 

WHAT THE HOLY FUCK, CNN? Where's your fucking credibility? Where's your sense of journalistic integrity? No mention of the unrest going on in Brazil, no mention of the stock market yesterday, no mention of the unrest in Turkey, no mention of ANYTHING that could even remotely be considered actual fucking news. Just hour after hour of incessant noise.  

What the fuck happened to you guys? You used to be the go-to network for up-to-the-minute news. Now you're just as bad as the bullshit on every other local morning news shows. What's your reasoning for this?

Clean up after yourselves!

I know I'm just a lowly food service employee who's clearly not as good as you in your nice armani suit too busy on your phone to speak to me directly but not too busy to become impatient when I have to repeat your order back to you while you're on the phone, but what is the deal with people making huge messes and leaving them for someone else to take care of?

I honestly do not... do not understand the logic.

Work for years to get to the top of the corporate ladder so you can wear the fancy suits and glasses, 

wear the cool clothes walk the walk talk the talk... 

then go to a restaurant and act like a COMPLETE slob.... Like you don't know how to eat properly without getting food everywhere.

and then walk out in your suit still thinking you're better than me..


I don't understand how you can't see what disgusting slobs you portray yourselves as.

I never knew that simply because someone gets paid to do it, means you no longer need to bother yourself with doing something.



I truly believe it's this attitude compiled with the tons of other shitty shit that's been happening over the years that is turning us all into selfish ignorant pigs who completely lack any sort of empathy let alone know what the word means.


I know I work at a restaurant, and it's my job. But it always baffles me as I'm standing there, cleaning up 30% of the food someone's ordered that ended up on the floor, and I remind myself that adults, grown men and women, businesspeople, professionals...

those are the people I serve. Not children! Not people with disabilities who might not be able to control the mess they make. Professionals. Grown, functional, ""well-to-do"" business people. This is how professionals today portray themselves to the people they don't think they need to impress. 

Somehow my opinion doesn't matter because my paychecks are smaller.

It just disgusts me... and I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people, who leaves a GENEROUS MESS. We're talking, a lot of shit, on the floor. Couple crumbs? no problem, we're all human. But half of your salad and part of your cookie and the napkins you used? Please hear this, as it is coming from the deepest darkest depths of my heart: 

**Go fuck yourself, you're a fucking slob**, and you are nothing more than a pig in a suit. You don't fool me, you disgusting piece of human vermin, not that you care because, whatever, I get paid to clean that, right?


Sigh. This country, our society, is really going down the shitter, fast.

Sorry about the rant, it's been a long couple of months working this job trying to stay afloat with an unemployed fiancé (laid off w about 300 other ppl), and sometimes I just get so damn depressed from cleaning up after these disgusting excuses for adults.

Just makes me sad.

Thanks for listening.

Tl;Dr: I work at a restaurant and people who leave messes are disgusting and should be ashamed of themselves, where have our manners as a society gone? Where is the empathy? 


EDIT: and I would like to add, in how many years I've worked in this industry (don't worry, I know that's super lame.) the only person I've seen clean up after themselves have been homeless people.

I've got sexual and verbal assault by my father on my list, resulting anxiety and depression, and a whirlwind of other dysfucntional American family shit on my list but I never fucking ONCE in my life used any of that as an excuse to *not* do something. You honestly make me sick with that shit really. 

Also, while I'm thinking about it, I did break up with you go to have fun. But not the kinda fun you're thinking about. But really, I broke up with you because I didn't love you anymore. I was getting bored. You were romantically dedicated to me and i wasn't you. That's not fair. I had to end it. But I'll tell you what: I didn't break up with you ""conveniently"" right before my 21st birthday and my trip to go see Bassnectar just to ""have fun."" No. I broke up with you to be with the person I am still, completely and totally, in love with. I broke up with you, to be with the person I was always meant to be with. I broke up with you to be with a man who actually gives me what I need, in every aspect of the term. I don't have the energy to type out all the ways he is better than you, but trust me. He is a fucking gift from God. That I am sure of. 

Also, your dick is small. You can't fuck me well, and never want to *fuck me.* It's always, FUCKING ALWAYS, I have to be on top or no sex. FUCKING LAZY ASS, ARE YOU SERIOUS. God, that sounds so terrible when I write it out. You were literally so lazy that you wouldn't even have sex with me unless I got on top. Fucking lame. Also, D has a bigger dick than you. Much bigger, much better. He always had the best dick, and yes. I thought about fucking him while you were having sex with me so I could get off. I hated giving you blowjobs because you don't know what washing your balls means, or what taking a shower in general means.

Yes. D moved in after you moved out. I'll admit it here. You already know in the back of your mind though that someone else in my bed with me now, you just don't know who. And guess what, I don't have to fucking tell you! It's not your goddamn business! My name and my name alone is on that lease, I pay for the rent, I pay for the bills. All your shit is out of the house and I even paid for the bed me and D are sleeping on. So fuck you and your bullshit. Your little freakout on Facebook about D being in the house cracked my shit up, really. You were ranting and raving about what a whore I was because I had a man over after you moved out... and you only found that out because you saw the picture of the blunt I posted on Instagram... and you know I can't roll a blunt to save my life. You're fucking pathetic. 

I really hope you grow the fuck up. I don't want to be with you, and this isn't a ""break."" This is definitely a forever break up because D and I are going to stay together this time. I don't care what you have to say about him. I don't care how much you hate him. I don't care what you think about him, or how much of a wrong decision it may seem to you to be with him. It's all in our past, and we are moving forward from this point on. I love D, with all my heart, and I never stopped loving him. 

Speaking of D, I fucking love him. He is seriously the best man ever and I fucking love staying up until 3 AM watching American Dad with him. I love the way our bodies fit together when we cuddle and I fucking love the way his hands feel in mine. He's amazing, sweet, kind, caring. Loving. Understanding. He's perfect for me. I love him. 

Also, I like titties. And asses. I think women are hot, actually. But I don't want to fuck them. I just want to stare at their beautifullness.

I'd like to start by saying that unemployment in Britain is an absolute fucking disgrace. Jobs are like fucking gold dust these days, especially if you are a college student. Its like I'm fucking invisible. I've applied for over 100 jobs and I shit you not only 10 of those have had the decency to send me an email back saying I didn't get the job. So there is the set up...I'm fucking skint. Not like ""I've only got a fiver suppose I better stay in tonight"", I mean as in ""I have not got a fucking penny to my name. Oh my god what am I going to do for dinner money""

Secondly, relating to the title. And I know people are going to take this badly when I say this. But my mother is one selfish little fucking bitch. I am now old enough to claim money for myself, I know the dole isn't great but it will get me to and from college and I'll have money for food and such. But my fucking mother won't let me. Why? Because if I claim money for myself she stops getting benefits for me. Benefits which she doesn't spend on the three kids she gave birth to. Benefits she spends on beer and tabs the fucking little cunt. She spend £20 a night beer, that's £140 a week! How many weeks out of a month has the fridge and cupboards been empty, how many times has your children had to clump together their dinner money just get our tea! AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT SPEND THE MONEY GIVEN TO YOU FOR US ON FUCKING BEER AND TABS!!!!

If I was to claim for myself she wants £80 a week off me. Well you can lie down on the fucking kitchen floor, die and rot in hell if you think your getting that off me. I wouldn't even make that. Also I've worked out how much I'd have to pay her and £80 a week is a total fucking over reaction. Most my mates pay £20 a month/every other week. So you can fuck off with that one. Why? Why can't I just have a bit of money in my pocket, since she's not giving me any because she only cares about herself; getting drunk every night and smoking. The fucking selfish little cunt. 

Not to mention she is monumentally lazy and I honestly think she is mentally not all there. Since I'm at college all day sometimes one of her children might ask her to do a small menial task. Such as ""Will wash my dirty jeans for me?"" ""Yeah, sure"". Get back from college and she hasn't moved out of her fucking seat to even fucking attempt it. It literally takes her about a month to get through a load of washing, I've had shirts I've worn for weeks because I never get any of them back. I ask her time and time again when she does the dishes, to just please, please, please dry them before she puts them away. Nope! I've told her that dirty water on dishes is unhygienic and that drying them literally takes about 3 minutes and she just fucking laughs. I'm sorry, I DIDN'T REALISE THIS WAS A FUCKING JOKE TO YOU! She can't do anything right and when I try talking to her about it she just ignores me or laughs.

Most of the time she doesn't have a clue where she is and often asks us the same questions over and over again. She won't leave the house and barely gets dressed. She argues with her boyfriend every night because she can, and she just finds this funny. Yeah, well, I give that poor man about a month before he's sick of your bullshit and has fucked off...At least he has the choice. At the moment I am really, really concerned about my life and where it is going. I don't have a job and the chances of getting one are really slim. I had a chat with a lecturer at college and he gave me some good advice about Journalism (The field I want to work in) and he even got me on a two day course for it. When I got home that night I was quite pleased, things were looking up, so I tried to tell my mam. She completely fucking ignored me and then told me to ""Fuck off"" because she was watching the soaps. 

Our father, who has a fucking well paid job and who promised to pay for things like college and such, has pretty much left us high and dry after he had a fucking petty argument with my sister. He's just glad he hasn't got us to worry about any more and has planned to get a new car when he stops paying my mam child benefits. Well, fuck you. You were never a part of our life and you are just as lazy and inconsiderate as her, I don't know why you broke because you fucking deserve each other.

How the hell are these people getting into college?",23,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/11buau/wtf_is_wrong_with_our_the_us_education_system/,"I have worked at a college in my city as a writing tutor for more than 2.5 years. I have seen all kinds of students come and go, but the overwhelming majority of them are COMPLETELY ILLITERATE. How the hell did they make it this far? Our education system has completely failed.

You might say, ""well, you're just getting the dregs of the school because obviously only the students who really need help go to a writing tutor."" To an extent, this may be true, but many composition/English/writing-instensive subject X professors send their students to me as a REQUIREMENT. So, from many classes, I am receiving a pretty accurate sample of the student body. But this also begs another question: why are TEACHERS sending their students to get their papers fixed by me before they read them? I do not have a teaching degree; I am not qualified to fill in the 14 year's worth of composition instruction that these students apparently missed. I understand these teachers feel the same way; they are teaching at the college level for fuck's sake...why should THEY be expected to fill in that same gap? It's much easier to just pass on the responsibility to the free writing resources on campus.

Anyway, I understand people who need a proofread or a fresh pair of eyes to pick out errors they may have missed in the tedium of writing 20 page papers. However, the sorts of things I witness go straight down to not understanding how to string a subject, verb, and complete thought together. I read four-page papers that are ONE SENTENCE, no paragraphs and no punctuation. I would say 75% of my students claim to have never been taught what a thesis statement is, the backbone of any good paper, nevermind topic sentences, body paragraphs, introductions, and conclusions. And I won't even go into the content of these papers: the ideas, logic, structure, and flow.

Obviously, this is a rant, so I don't exactly expect answers, but HOW THE HELL were these students permitted to leave 4th grade? Is our education system so fucked up that illiteracy is sufficient for graduating high school?

Even more depressing is thinking about the ESL (English as a Second Language) students I see here. They make up a pretty large percentage of my students; I probably interact with ten of them per day on average. These are a group of people who have been learning English for maybe a year, but not much more than that, yet they have a command of the language and composition which is much more masterful than most of the native English speaking students. It makes me ashamed to be associated with the education in this country.

Shame on you, US education. Obviously there are exceptions, but if even one school resembles what I see here, then there's a huge problem. The hell's going on?",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_11buau,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/11buau/wtf_is_wrong_with_our_the_us_education_system/,

To me it's silly to make such a big deal about who is right. Personally, I have strong feelings towards my beliefs (atheist) however when someone says they believe in god, i feel no anger or hate towards them. Christianity honestly is a great way to lead your life since the basic ideal of it is to be a good person and show others respect.

I wish that people could learn to just respect other's ideals and live and let live. The problem with humans is that we feel the need to have everyone agree with us and if they don't they are our enemy. When someone asks me why I am an atheist I calmly say the following

""Personally I feel that God is a creation to explain the world around us, it is an idea of a higher power that created us in some divine way and placed us here to prosper. Science is literally just a different way to explain what happened, in the end they are both theories, nobody is right, i just feel that the scientific explanation makes more sense. I hold no grudge against people who have religions though because in the end all religions just want you to be a good person and respect your fellow man so you can be rewarded in the end. To me that is just a different way of saying be nice and get good karma (lol).""

The only hard part people seem to have is that last part- respect. Nobody should ever be persecuted for how they think and what they believe, simply put it's how they think life should be lived, and it's how they are going to live it. It doesn't matter if you are Muslim, Christian, Atheist, Scientologist, Buddhist, or even Satanic. To that person they are correct, and even if we don't agree, we should still respect their beliefs. Telling people they are wrong is what has created so many religious wars and political battles.

From what I see seems like the Atheists are somehow ""better"" that Christians (or people of other religions) just because they don't believe in what the religious believe in.

I'm not standing by any of these sides - I don't consider myself religious or an atheist. It's because I don't consider my knowledge the ULTIMATE logic and TRUTH. Because it's not - I don't think you can be 100% sure about something. That's why I'm not proclaiming, that my vision of the world is accurate. I just stick by it and that's it.

I mainly started ranting because I really dislike the way atheists try to convince that religion is shit and christians are assholes. If you really base your life around logic, you should understand, that if you attack other peoples' religion/beliefs/faith - they will get really offended. And it somewhy seems puzzling to you.

Ever had somebody trying to shove their beliefs down your throat? Not so pleasing, huh? Ever had somebody try do dismantle your beliefs and saying you're wrong? Sucks as much as the previous situation.

The solution to end this bullshit that is going on now on Reddit is really simple - do NOT try and be a smart-ass about people who have other beliefs than you do. They hate your interference as much as you hate theirs. This goes both ways, not only for atheists.

And ""God"" isn't a dude on the cloud. What I learned from my studies of philosophy, ""God' is simply above the human nature of understanding. Call it physics, call it aliens, call it love, call it fate - you name it. You won't be wrong. Yet, you won't have the right to somehow proclaim it as the ""superior"" way of thinking.

You speak to me in pitying tones because I’m so closed off and obstinate to a greater world of knowledge that only the parachute minded elite like yourself could possibly appreciate while you and your family open boxes, foil envelopes, and plastic wrapped piles of prepackaged, precooked, and preserved palm oil, high fructose corn syrup, and soy extract like it’s Christmas for your gullet every meal of every day.

Your cheap assed husband actually goes out and buys a $60 Fairtrade organic cotton shirt and I need to spend the next two hours of our Thanksgiving dinner listening to how the textile industry is destroying the world and he just did something about it.  Meanwhile, the irony in the fact that the natural gas you burn to to heat your 4,200 sq ft, $650,000 dollar house in the *good* neighborhood that doesn’t have any of those icky black people could power a small Andean village for three months is completely lost on you.  You do these things while oil wars are raging and wellheads are gushing, and then you have the gall to slap a peace sticker on your bumper.

You sing Hindu aartis when people are around to hear it and you recite the names of 800 Hindu gods with your daughter because it makes you worldly and accepting of all beliefs everywhere.  The thing is, you do this while you stuff down hamburgers raised in factory farms.  If I didn't know you, I'd laugh my ass off at that one.  You home school your kids because you never took the time to join your local society and make them part of a community.  And now, as cute as the are, they have a tough life in front of them trying to join a culture that isn’t going to have the slightest clue what to do with them.  They're totally unprepared and they have you to thank for it.

You’re a Shirley MacLaine hippy with a V6 powered minivan, and that’s fine by me.  Go for it.  I have way too much going on in my life to stop and question your choices.  Our kids get along pretty well and your husband can at least talk motorcycles and shit.  You can take your convoluted French horn of a belief system and play it up and down Main Street like every day is the 4th of July for all I care.

You can have all of that and anything else those American dollars will buy, but DON’T. YOU. DARE. sit around the camp fire and judge me because I find the crap you foist on me to be about as nauseating as the individually packaged “Froot Loops Cereal Straws” you keep foisting on my kids.  You tell me that every Atheist you know is either bitter, addicted, or both by the age of 65 and you completely overlook my assertion that Scandinavia both has the happiest population on Earth and the highest rate of disbelief.

The Colorado river has been completely routed to the once beautiful, but now tilled over prairies of the American Midwest to grow the corn that you inject into your bloodstream like heroine.  You put your money directly into the hands of Archer Daniels Midland, Monsanto, Cargill and Kelloggs to keep them merrily plowing, spraying, and burning.  You hand your family's resources to the monolithic and heartless corporate farms that would make you openly weep if you just put down the Deepak Chopra book, and watched a couple of youtube videos about our food supply.  

You want purpose?  Get off your ass and make some purpose.  Put some energy into life.  Kick that husband of yours in the ass while you’re at it, too.  For the love of everything good, clean your house.  It’s disgusting.  Make your whole family help you do it equally, every day.  It’s your nest; have some pride.  Teach your kids how to have some pride too while you're at it.  Wipe their faces every so often.  Paint, sweep, decorate, exercise.  You all could stand a few hours at the gym.  Hell, if you need baby steps, then start by peeling an orange.  Food isn't supposed to trigger an orgasm with every bite.  If, after all of that, you’re still determined to be Mother Theresa, then go **DO** something.  I don’t care what you do, just make it count.  Invest emotionally and physically in it.  Here’s the catch: once it’s done and you feel really good about yourself, don’t tell everyone you know about it.  Just shut up.  You’re not on Earth for the applause.  

Work.  Build.  Sacrifice.  I'm not speaking French here.  Do that and do it quietly, and I’ll respect the hell out of you.  I’ll seek out your opinion and give weight to your words.  I'll spend all night with you pondering why we're here and what it's all about.  I’ll hold you as an example of what I would like to be.

I try to give that energy every day.  Some days I succeed and others I fail miserably.  It’s okay, though, because the race is against me – not you.  The reason I sit there with that look on my face while you spew your corn syrup is because there’s just no point in participating in the conversation.  I’m done defending myself and my choices.

Now let me say 2 things real quick.

1. I hate interviews. Meeting new people mixed with corny corporate attempts at being ""deep and phsycological"" questions (""name a time you had trouble with an irrate customer"" ect.) Plus there is a good amount of self intraspection. I just dont like them. So I was already experiencing anxiety.

2. He (interviewing GM) said he was not much of a computer geek, no big deal you dont nessicarily need to be a nerd to now how to interview someone, thats ok with me.

Any way at some point in the interview he asked what the best processor out there was, I wasnt sure what he meant (the best top of the line processor on the market is not common knowlege IMO) so I simply explained I didnt know what he meant and said something along the lines of better speed = better processor, along with # of cores and cache size being important. He said in a very condesending tone that processors are rated in ""i's"". He said there is an i3 an i5 and an i7 and that i7 is the best one. No big deal, I dont know everything and am always willing to learn. But the way he acted after seemed like it should be something I should automatically know and its basic stuff and im an idiot (I was having a lot of anxiety at the time so I may be over exaggerating a smidge). 

So after the interview I get bummed. Real bummed. I dont know how much you know about nerds but we take pride in our knowlege and I felt like a moron who knew little about computers. I decided to look up this classification of processors to at least know about it next time, and , like I said, I like to learn.

Turns out that classification is for intell brand processors. INTELL BRAND PROCESSORS. NOT SOME UNIFIED CLASSIFICATION OF ALL PROCESSORS!! Its simply clever branding by intell for stupid people who dont want to look at stats!!! Im so happy and feel like im not worthless garbage and that guy is a dick. Best buy is corporate bullshit.

He was a miniature schauzer and he was almost 15 years old.  Last year he suffered a severe bout of vestibular syndrome and he was never the same after that.   His balance was poor, and he quit jumping on the furniture.  His eyesight was very bad due to cataracts, and his hearing was all but gone.  He had arthritis and bone spurs in his spine that made it increasingly difficult to stand up, and it was getting extremely difficult for him to get off the floor.

We fed him Cheetos and a hot dog last night and I took him for one last walk around the neighborhood.  He was game to get started, but he faded fast.  He fell down twice and he couldn't remember which house was ours.  Last night was miserable, as he started having some sort of breathing issues, and I wasn't sure he was going to make it to the 8:15 appointment at the vet today.

In addition to all his physical ailments, he had started to develop something like dementia.  He wandered the house endlessly, going in and out of the doggy door over and over and over again with no reason or purpose.  He would get lost in the house.  Then one day last week I came home from work and he was outside, which wasn't unusual.  But after about 20 minutes I started to wonder about him.  I found him in the back yard, disoriented, staggering around and on the verge of a heat stroke.

Hollister. Why? Why do they exist? Who shops there and why do you shop there?

My son has decided Hollister is everything brilliant because his friends also wear Hollister.

Lets start with the price of the goods. Extortionate would be the term. Nike wish they could get away with such prices. £12 for a small can of deodorant. Really? I can get 12 cans of Lynx for that.

And what about the staff. Staff in Hollister aren't hired based on ability. They are hired based on their looks. Ability is a distant 2nd.

So let me go through the Hollister experience.

You walk through a door into what is essentially the darkest room ever (saves on lightbulbs I suppose).

Anyone who has ever watched Charlie Brooker's tv show ""Nathan Barley"" will now appreciate it when I use the term ""Rise of the idiots"". Basically the place is full of clones. I am not talking the staff, I am talking the customers.

The customers must be wearing Plankton style helmets (Spongebob movie) otherwise there is no sense unless it is the overwhelming perfume smell that causes everyone to want to buy Hollister.

Maybe the smell is some mind altering drug that makes anyone of a certain age or intelligence instantly addicted to buying their overpriced clothes.

The people must be buying the clothes based on feel alone because there is no way you can see them in that light.

The other thing that hits you is the wall to wall noise. Now if I am at a concert I would expect to hear noise at this level but in a shop it helps if I can actually talk to the staff or even my wife so that we can decide to get the hell out.

Now because you can't find what you are looking for (it really is impossible unless you have nightvision goggles) you have to ask a member of staff for help. You may as well ask my 5 year old daughter because her method of looking for anything is to turn her head to the left, to the right and then declare that it is lost. 

The staff are clearly there for looks and not for their skills of hide and seek or looking for a needle in a haystack.

Hey here is an idea ""turn the fucking lights on"" and just so that you can hear what I am asking without me having to mime to you ""turn the music down"" and so that I don't feel like vomitting ""calm it with the perfume"" and finally ""hire staff based on ability, not looks"".

Background: I'm the youngest of 3 girls, with a (mostly) single mother raising us. We are an extremely close family. So, Last year, age 20, I got married. My mom was engaged to her 4th husband. She decided she will get married a week later than me. So, she was so wrapped up with her own wedding that she didn't think twice about the fact that her youngest child was getting married also. My sister, grandmother and aunt all realized how much she was ignoring me when I would ask for suggestions, advice, etc., and would bring up how awesome her wedding will be. I would always tell them it was ok and I had it all together. But essentially I felt like I was being ignored by my mother who was giving all of her attention on this man she barely knew. Maybe I'm just bitter I'm not sure. I would stay up every night trying to figure out how to afford anything and eventually came to the conclusion that i would have to make everythig myself and save my money for a decent dress. Anyways, come my wedding, I had to borrow some glasses from my mom so that the tables wouldn't be empty for guests. I had it at a Mormon church building since it was free, lied about being an LDS member because I simply couldn't afford anything. Bought and served kool-aid and pretzels. I was extremely embarrassed the night before my wedding when I had to stay up by myself setting up. I went home around midnight and started painting my nails. I just started bawling and fell asleep on my wet nails. I woke up late and realized I had no one to do my hair. So my sister curled it. the lace for the back of my dress went missing as I was putting it on, so I had to use a white shoelace. it was so tight I ended up losong my balance every time I stood up and spilled kool-aid on my dress. One of my best friends showed up super drunk, another one was high. Also, I had to change my wedding from Saturday to Friday, because my mom wanted to go to another wedding on Saturday, and a lot of people couldnt come because they had to work. After the reception this side of my husband came out I had neveer seen before. he started yelling and cussing at me for closing the car door too hard. Needless to say, I was discouraged, embarrassed, and absolutely regretting the whole thing. Well that night while opening some wedding gifts I realized my mom forgot to give me my gift. I knew she got one because I saw it wrapped up. So the next day I saw it at her house and asked if I could unwrap it there. She said that she let me borrow her glasses as a gift. I was pretty shocked but I moved on. Anyways, I'm still married after a year and my mom just got divorced (big surprise) and now every word that comes out of her mouth is about HIM. She even had my sisters and I stay the night so she could talk about him until ungodly hours of the morning. I'm so fed up with her obsession with men because I just don't understand how men (who all end up abandoning her) is more important than her children. I'm so frustrated.

I'm so angry right now. I thought calmly describing the problem would help me but apparently not, I'm not looking for solutions anyway. There are none. I can only wait it out and hope my mother realises how pig a piece of shit she can be.
I still live at home, but I am financially independent. I earn my own money, I pay my share of the rent and necessities. I pay my own bills. I know that shit is expensive.

Yet, my mother, who measures everything in money and will do ANYTHING to gain more of it seems to think I am an extension of her. My money is her money, and she apparently has every right to inspect my finances. Now, if she asked 'how much money do you have' or 'how much do you spend on X a month?' I'd answer her. No problem. My problem is when she attempts to log into my various accounts to check it. I just sat next to her as she went through my phone subscription month by month to be sure I didn't spend too much. I had to answer to every single goddamn little irregularity and be scolded for - SHOCK HORROR - sending a single text to a foreign number. May I add that my phone is registered in my name? That the bills are sent to me?
Then there's also the thing with wanting me to sign something I don't even know what is. Oh yeah I'm very well aware that it's so she receives more financial support, but how dare I question what it means for me. I don't think she'd be trying to cheat me, but I still don't feel safe just signing something withut being allowed to look at it and then receive shifty answers when asking. And she says that me not wanting to give her my bank account password is wrong? That it means I'm hiding something? Bitch please.

Australia runs multiple stage driving program. You start on your L Plates, when you are learning at 16 years old. You must always have said plates displayed and an adult in the car. You then move up to your P plates when you turn 17. You must have plates displayed but you can be alone. 

Anyway, in the the state of New South Wales, the government is anal about these stages. They have imposed rules for these people so the young people are not in danger and such. Some of these rules include: L Platers must not travel over 80km/h. Ever. Nor can they drive a V8 (unless it is a diesel), nor a turbocharged or supercharged car or truck. Once you get to P's you can do 90, then onto the second stage of your P's where you can do 100. Only after 5 fucking years of driving are you allowed to do the national posted speed limit. 

Now, I am an L Plater, and I live just off a pretty major highway. So if I want to get to school or to my girlfriend's, I have to fucking do 80 in a 100 zone. This means people run right up the back of me and do stupid fucking maneuvers to overtake me, usually leading to them playing chicken with another car. What is worse is that because I am on a major highway, I get trucks do it. 

**Nothing is more terrifying than being in a dinky shitbox corrola and seeing a full sized, 15 meter truck 3 meters behind you**

Kangaroo hops out, meaning I have to brake? Looks like I'm fucking red jelly. Someone else in front of me tries to avoid a roo? I'm fucking jelly. 

The law was introduced because it supposedly caused less deaths with L Platers. **What it didn't fucking see is that it now causes more deaths for everyone else in the 40 car metal snake behind me**

I mean, what the fuck were they fucking thinking? I understand the vehicle restrictions, stops young guys driving cars they cant handle. But making us to 20, potentially **30** under the speed limit?

When most people say (to me) ""I listen to everything"" it's usually followed by, ""except country.""

The ones who don't add the ""except country"" often overlook the fact that the sound of opera makes them cringe, classical orchestral music bores them, etc.

I find myself switching between genres constantly, fluctuating between my mood and what's sounding the newest and freshest to my ears. Lately...its been dubstep. Apparently, I've learned...this is something to be ashamed of?

Constantly bombarded by comments like ""That sounds like farting robots"", ""Sounds like transformers fucking"" or my new favorite one since Trap music came out: ""Sounds like retarded gibberish chipmunks"".

 Consistently put down when I get back from EDM concerts because I must have been on drugs last night as ""that music isn't good unless you're fucked up"".

This coming from 20 something year olds who listen to classic rock, and only classic rock; because classic rock is the only music anyone has ever played that held any emotion whatsoever and the people HAD to play instruments and HAD to have talent ""back then"" or they never would've existed. End of story. For real. End of story. Music ended when classic rock did. The only shows worth seeing are classic rock shows. The end.
This is the argument I face every day, no matter what faze I'm going through that week. Normally I don't care, but ever since tickets to Sasquatch Festival came out and sold out I seem to have been faced with a much loftier than normal crowd of pretentious friends who've been everywhere, seen everything and studied all there is to know about music. Apparently by not buying Sasquatch Fest tickets I have alienated myself from all there is to see in this world, the beauty of nature, the unity of coming together with people who all appreciate music and are only there to escape reality and be with like minded people. o_o

I got nothing against any of the bands playing at Sasquatch, all very radio friendly rock and indie bands, a couple EDM artists. Not too shabby I guess; but nothing I could justify shelling out 300+ dollars on a weekend road trip for. And this gets my companions angry. For realsies. ""Yeah, maybe you wouldn't enjoy it. Not enough robot squirrel transformer battle music for you."" 

Sigh.

I've been fascinated by EDM lately; I come from a background of all musics. Started with radio pop music like most kids, moved onto rock and classic rock, hair metal, delved into punk before splashing into everything metal. Thrash, death, doom, black, goth, screamo, and on and on until I ran out of fast, heavy music to listen to and settled on kicking back and relaxing to smooth jazz, rap, oldschool hip hop, reggae, etc. I gained an appreciation for synthetic music as I too used to be an offender of labelling anything produced on a computer as fake and ""talentless"". After learning to make cruddy loops and beats on my computer I started checking out EDM; dubstep, dance, house, techno, hardstyle, you name it. I listen to it all. For the past year or so that's pretty much all I've listened to, and thus have been labelled an ""EDM Junkie"" of sorts.

Which leaves my associates with the belief that I must be goin to clubs, knockin up randoms, poppin pills, contracting herpes on a dancefloor downtown, and so on.

Which makes me wonder, if they're so confident that I'm living up to the ""classical stereotype of a person who listens to Electronic Music, what're they doing? So I take a closer look.

As someone who listens to EDM are you really a drug addicted, boozer, dancing amongst lasers, smoke machines and pounding bass? Are you dressed in bright colors with pupils bigger than my fist chewing on your own tongue?
As someone who listens to classic rock are you currently wearing one of many classic rock t-shirts featuring the cover of an album that went platinum at LEAST 25 years ago? Does that shirt have a mustard stain on the collar? A mustard stain that matches the one on your beer gut AND the one in your beard?

After you got done robbing a bank, beating your baby momma and selling crack rocks to buy McDonalds for your daughter, did you come home, throw on your favorite rap record and krump in your bedroom til your moms called you for dinner?

Once you switched your From First To Last album with your Bullet For My Valentine disc did you go back to the bathroom to keep cutting your wrists or did you just wipe the blood away and kick up your nightly ""cry and watch myself in the mirror"" routine?

I suppose once the metal show ended you picked up what you could find of your teeth in the moshpit, straightened your wifebeater and left to crash a tailgate kegger at the WalMart parking lot down the road.
But I'm sure no one on Reddit can relate. I'm sure anyone who uses Reddit is a Weird Al fan. And you're probably too busy playing World of Warcraft or ranting online about how your friend made fun of the music you listen to to read any of this. Fag.

Speaking of fags, only fags listen to Celine Dion. And girls. Fags and girls. So dont ever get caught listening to her or anything faintly resembling her style of music.

It's really stupid. Really, really stupid how music creates these redundant, pointless social barriers between people. I've been to shows for all these genres and more, I've seen every type of person in these crowds.
I've gone to country concerts expecting to see only dudes dressed in chaps and spurs, only to find myself gawking at the all the abnormally hot women strolling about, and wondering why that dude in the hoodie is having such a good time. I can't understand, and refuse to accept that I have to turn my volume down on my headphones for fear that someone might hear a thumping 4 on the floor beat and think I'm an E-tard and I'm gonna try and touch their face if they get too close. 

Or a rap beat kicks up and (classic) the old man stands up ""turn that down! I don't call it rap; I call it Crap, with a C!""

It's been making me very edgy lately, all the comments and backhanded insults towrds my musical preference; when in reality it really shouldn't matter should it? Can't we just accept that music is music, whether its bad or good, fast or slow, metal or slowdance songs. Music is all around us, all the time. Most of the time we can't control it. Nearly every business, household or car that drives by has a radio going at any given time. Whether we like it or not, the music we disagree with is always going on all around us. There's really no point in getting angry that it's there, no point trying to force people to accept that it's there, no point in trying to show people how it's not the genre thats bad, its the SETTING.

Don't listen to death metal when you wanna fuck.

Don't listen to gangster rap whilst trying to set a romantic atmosphere.

Don't listen to reggae when you wanna have a dance party.

Don't listen to sad songs when you're happy if they make you sad.

Don't listen to dance music when you wanna sit and read a book.

Alas, I've ranted myself dry. I needed that. Should've just listened to some metal and kicked the shit outta the man who told me Electronic music takes no talent to produce.

This phrase, said by girls in my high school who unfortunately talk to me, pisses me off so much. Of course the don't have abs, they starved to get to where they are. So fuck you if I want to be healthy and not be emaciated, and I'm sorry if *healthiness* is ugly. And, it's not like women who have basic abs are ripped like a guy. That takes fucking work, and many hard months of it. Having abs that are very basic as a woman isn't like having a six pack. Ugh, why the fuck are people so stupid? Perhaps, having your shoulder blades and back bones sticking out is disgusting. Perhaps, being so skinny you get peach fuzz is disgusting. Seriously. 

And, what's this stigma, that if a woman has muscles, all the sudden she's too manly and unattractive, and ""disgusting."" Being strong and healthy as a woman is almost a crime in this culture. Just fuck that. Why does an obese girl get called strong and beautiful the way she is, and a girl who is ripped is called ugly, manly, and ""disgusting"". Why can't both be beautiful? 

But on the same note, why do people who are for ""body acceptance"" hate skinny people or fit people with a fucking vengeance. Seriously, 'thin privilege is not having people calling you beautiful because they feel sorry for you.' 

SERIOUSLY? Just get over yourself! If you have a problem with so called 'thin privilege', just stop your complaining right there. You can either 

a) educate people that you are not overweight because of actions that you willingly did yourself in your right mind (depression, thyroid issues, medication, etc.)

or

b)Get off your lazy ass and stop complaining and do something about it. Then, thin privilege will be applied to you! 

I'm soooo tired of people telling people who are thin/skinny/fit that they are TOO FUCKING SKINNY. My friend, who is 5'3 and 117 get's called 'too skinny' by my 200+ pound 5'9 friend ALL THE TIME. She's NOT too skinny. She is HEALTHY. Just because she doesn't eat all the time and YOU DO doesn't mean that she's unhealthy. At the same time, I don't care that you eat all the time, your weight doesn't matter to me. But you PUSHING YOUR VIEWS ONTO OTHERS is pissing me off. 

Especially on me. I'm sorry if a protein bar, salad and fruit is 'not an acceptable lunch' to you. I'm sorry if you think I'm perfectly healthy the way I am. I'm a healthy weight, yes, but I'm not in shape, and my eating habits will probably land me with heart disease. So please, keep your opinion to yourself, please. No, being a vegan will not make me starve to death, thank you for your concern, though. No, I'm not being partially vegan for an excuse to eat less. I'm a vegan because of my morals on killing animals, and because of my milk allergy. So please, keep your opinion to yourself.

There is a HUGE database where you can know anything about sex! 

Vagina diagram? Cunnilingus tips? Blowjob tips? Thrusting tips? Hottest things to do in bed? Where is the clitoris? How do guys cum? Does cum get me pregnant? How do condoms work? Why does it hurt when my boyfriend jams him dick in my dry, dry Sahara desert vagina?
 
Maybe the person doesn't have the best Googling skills? No problem! Type the question in! There will be tons of Yahoo Answers on it! 

Also, I'm so angry at the people who think sex is only for men. My mother is one of them. Apparently, only guys want sex! Just lay there until the guy cums and is happy, then bribe him for money/presents!! Though, I don't blame my mother since obviously this just means my father is a jackass in the sex department, plus she did not have the internet growing up. Or maybe she has a low libido?

But apparently since I LOVE the idea of having sex with my boyfriend, and masturbate several times a week, I'm very unlady like. I need to lady up and make my boyfriend beg for sex until marriage, then can lay there like a lifeless doll for the rest of my life! Or then God with forsaken me for being sexually happy! BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY *GOD* GAVE US THESE AMAZING FEELS FOR NOTHING/TO DEVIL TEMPT US. Only men can have the good feeling! 

Then WHAT THE FUCK IS UP with people being grossing out about masturbation? If it wasn't for exploring my body, I wouldn't know how to orgasm. I am not saying this toward the people who try their best to orgasm but cannot, I'm talking about the people who don't even try. Cumming is the *best* for time passing or stress. I feel **kind of** sorry for the people who don't try and instantly label it as gross. It's the best. That doesn't help convince you? Well. I know almost exactly what I'm sexually interested. Do I like hairy cocks? Do I like being dominated? Bondage? Do I want him to pee on me? Maybe. Shit? Do I want tongue in my vagina? Do I like furries? Am I okay with ass involvement? Whipping/hurting? 

Guys: Grab your fucking cock already and whack it.

Girls: Grabs fucking anything cock size (and smooth/non-sharp/sanitized) and put it in your vagina already. God will not hate you for making yourself happy.

We have a patient who comes in every day.  Literally every day.  She even comes when we're not open.  My boss(the Dr.) has to come in on the weekends to feed the fish in our aquarium, and will assist patients if they call him on his cell(he gives patients his cell # in case of emergencies) and need to be seen. He sees her at least 5 days a week, every week, and we're only open 4 days a week.

She's a nice person; she buys stuff for our office (hand sanitizer, snacks and stuff). She's even bought stuff for me, personally (wine glasses).  But the fact that she comes in every day annoys the fuck out of me.  

My shift starts at 3, because we take a lunch from 11-3 and I work only the afternoon. Without fail, she is there every day before I even get there.  She'll be waiting for me outside of the door. It's a personal triumph if I get to work and she isn't there yet.  

When she's here, she talks and talks and talks. She asks me stuff about the office that isn't her business.  She won't shut up. She completely interrupts my afternoon routine when she gets there so early--she talks when I try to listen to messages when she knows I'm on the phone, and she just gets me so distracted, I forget stuff sometimes.

She constantly texts and calls my boss, because she has some weird crush on him. He's married with kids, she's married with kids (I think she's the neglected housewife type?).

Oh, and also--she spends minimum $60 a week at our office (she spent a total of $3,000 this past year alone) for chiropractic care and then blames her young adult children for ""sucking up all the money"".  ARGH!

I am sure you have convinced yourself that it was not your fault; that it was me that drove you away that I wasn’t supportive, caring, “there for you” I really don’t care what lies you tell yourself to ease your mind and get by in your delusional world. We both know the truth; your family knows the truth, even your children. Good luck growing old and having your looks fade because that was all you ever had going for yourself. If only you had ever read a book, had an intelligent thought or even attempted to use that hunk of fat between your ears.

Saying “I am sorry” and never changing are empty words. You never even seemed upset with your actions. Did you ever once show an ounce of remorse? Besides the affairs, there were the years of you putting me down, constant criticism, belittling me for no reason. Ever feel sorry for that? Do you even remember how crazy you were? You sold all of the furniture because it had “soaked up negative energy” you ripped walls out of the house and called it “remodeling”. You freaked out because you thought you saw the antichrist on 60 minutes. Should the list go on? Besides that you spent every penny we had and then borrowed more. New clothes, salon treatments, hair, nails, just simple maintenance of those things was ridiculous, but you deserved more, the BMW, the plastic surgery, nicer jewelry. I wonder how many times I heard you whine about getting a house with a pool. Did it ever occur to you to work for something you wanted? You probably don’t even remember the times you asked me to get a second job so you could have more “stuff” Even when you got what you wanted you weren’t happy.

And please don’t start the “I raised the children” crap. You raised them while I was at work and then I took over. I stayed up with them when they were sick, calmed their nightmares, I was the one who they cried for. You didn’t even have a job, yet were too lazy to get out of bed for a crying child that you claim to love so dearly. If you remember when we first got a dog (a dog you begged and begged for) you didn’t take care of him either. I asked if that was what it would be like when we had children, you promised me that you would change, you didn’t. But at least you got your beauty sleep, got what you wanted, and everyone knows that is what is important.

And speaking of children, thanks for lying about being on birth control. Nothing so great as to have a lazy wife doing nothing except trying to ovulate while I worked full time and went college at night. I begged you for help, you were too self centered to help with anything. Meanwhile I got the joys of not sleeping, working and working just to support you. Then once we had children you decided you didn’t want them, every minute you could spend out with “friends” you went. Great times!!! To know that I stayed home and raised the kids while my whore of a wife was out blowing random guys. What class, but I should have known better than to marry the town slut. I think my favorite was when C****** was sick with Strep throat and you brought two guy “friends” over to the house after a day at the wineries to wait on you while you changed to go out again. What a insensitive slut. Thanks for throwing everything in my face.

And yes, to be fair, you did finally get a job. You can always say I didn’t support you but I did. I went out of my way to make sure you got through cosmetology school, paid for it, took care of the kids, helped you study. Then you worked, and complained. My favorite part of you working was your idea about paychecks. My pay check was “our money” –pay bills, buy groceries with. Your paycheck was “your money” free to spend however you wanted. Except all of “our money” was already spent on you.

I suppose to sum up how extremely shallow you are when you finally confessed to having an affair the first thing you asked is if you had to return the diamond earrings I had just bought you. You destroy all trust, rip my heart out and yet you only care about your stupid material possessions. I think this is you at your best. Thanks for telling me just a few hours after I got out of the hospital after being quarantined with viral meningitis. You just had to give me another kick when you could.

So, after all of this, before the divorce I ask for one Saturday a month to do something. Remember how nuts you went when I was gone for a Saturday afternoon. What did you think I was going to do while out hiking? But your mind went wild, claiming that I was getting my revenge, my revenge, I just wanted out of the house after being the sole caretaker for years. Thanks for hitting me over the head with the remote control after I fell asleep. Sorry I grabbed you and made you stop, I know that was the “abuse” – the time you claimed I grabbed you while I was in a rage.

The one thing I can thank you for is at least I have some good stories. I talk to divorced guys all the time and no one has ever beaten mine. From the “I’m religious, I’m a child of god” to the “I’m going into porn, take these naked pictures of me” – remember how you screamed and screamed that I didn’t shoot you at the right angle??? The stories are just too bizarre to believe. And what sort of prostitute are you? “I’ll have sex with you if you take me out to dinner” – that is simply prostitution, just not for money, a one off prostitute, but it still an exchange of goods.

And to top it all off, showing up with your new boyfriend a few weeks after the divorce. Just had to try and kill me didn’t you, well it didn’t work. Now you are stuck in a crappy marriage with another baby you don’t want to raise. At least you have all your “stuff” now. Enjoy it. And when you get tired of the baby and your husband I am sure there are a line of guys at the local bar just waiting for their chance. Everyone loves the town slut. Go kill yourself.

http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i64ny/other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so_pissed_off/

So I'd gotten tired of telling everyone the same long story over and over again so I hadn't updated here, but I'm finally getting around to it.

So on the Friday that I posted the original post, the police came by and I gave them everything I had. However, most of what I had was not solid enough for the police. The officer told me that the case would be passed along to an ""investigator"" and he'd be calling me at some point.

After that I'm thinking, if I were a police detective who is kept moderately busy, how much am I going to care about a $300 theft? My answer was not at all, and I knew my case would require some digging to be 100% solid. So I became very upset. I'd felt that I'd lost and the bitch had bested me. 

I drove to my dad's house because my room mates idea of calming me down was to try and convince me via devil's advocate that I should assume she's innocent and look at that from her perspective. This absolutely infuriated me as I knew I was right.

So I drove to my dad's house so I could rant and calm down. My parents raised me to have a strong belief in what is right and wrong as well as honesty. And it wasn't so much that I was upset about the money. Honestly, I didn't give a shit about the money. Yes, I wanted the money back, it was $300 and I'm not rich, but $300 isn't going to make or break me. Instead I couldn't stand that someone would do this. It didn't even compute in my head how someone could do this. Especially since I'd thought we were friends. We sat next to each other at work, were constantly interacting and I thought it was a good relationship. 

And then there was the whole fact that someone who should be smart to be going to UCSD and able to get an internship at Sony. When I first learned that someone else had used my cash card, I was terrified because I knew that if I had committed this crime, I wouldn't have gotten caught. It really wouldn't be that hard and I assumed that the person would be at least as smart.

So before I'd calmed down talking to my dad, I was literally shaking with rage. And I wanted justice, not just my money back. Not necessarily justice for me, just for someone who is so stupid and wrong to be held accountable for what they did. And that's another reason the police felt worthless to me. The officer made it clear that their only concern was to get my money back, to retrieve what had been lost. It wasn't important to catch the person and hold them accountable. I didn't say this, but my thought was, ""But wait, I'm not reporting a loss, I'm reporting a CRIME!""

While I was talking to my dad in the kitchen, my older sister comes through and I let her know about the whole thing and everything I have. She's a lawyer who just took the bar this week. She told me that I could file a law suit against the person and after filing I could get subpoenas to get the security footage from Staples and my company, which is conjunction is very solid evidence. This surprised me because I didn't realize subpoenas were something that I alone could get.

I turned to my dad and said, ""I've won."" I felt immeasurably better. I had felt for sure that even though the evidence existed, I'd need the police in order to get it, and at that point I'd felt they would be worthless (understandably, I get that my evidence was purely circumstantial from their standpoint and they need to be impartial in the way they pursue justice, but it still pissed me off). 

So I knew I'd won and now I turned my attention to enjoying giving the bitch exactly what she deserved. At that point I'd been so pissed that I wanted my money back, I wanted her fired and I wanted her arrested. 

So on Monday I got all the paperwork from the court's website and began filling it out. My sister gave me instructions on how to write a declaration with everything I knew and then she made it all pretty and legalized for me. I printed off the subpoena forms as well and contacted my company to figure out who I needed to name in it. I had been nervous about that part. I was scared they might resent me for subpoenaing them, but after I got a response they seemed cool with it and told me who to name. 

My plan at this point wasn't to actually file the lawsuit. I wanted to get it all ready so that it just needed to be filed at the courthouse. I was going to take the stack of paper and confront her about it and I felt that if I made it clear that this wasn't just a typical ""I'm going to sue your ass"" kind of threat, and I was actually ready to do it, that it would carry more weight and scare her into just taking the easy way out.

I met with the HR manager again on Monday and updated her that I felt the police wouldn't be of help and told her my intentions of filing a law suit. At this point I told her she could go ahead and talk to the suspect. I'd asked her to hold off until I spoke with the police because I'd felt that the only way to definitely prove her guilt was if the police could find the purchased items in her apartment. And I didn't want to clue her in that I knew she'd done it so she could get rid of the evidence. The talk revealed nothing because all the HR Manager could do was tell her that someone had stolen it from me and ask her if she knew anything about it. Obviously she responded that she didn't.

But now I didn't care because I knew I'd get the video evidence I needed and it didn't matter what she did with the merchandise.  I also stopped being nice to her. Up until that point I'd been reigning everything in so I was still acting perfectly normal with her. Now I just flat out ignored her and it was kind of fun watching her reaction to it. Obviously I'd respond to anything purely work related, but that was the extent of it.

The HR Manager had also told me that I needed to handle this outside of work and asked me not to talk to her about it at work. This was a bit of a problem because we worked different schedules so I didn't know how to get to her in person. I also didn't have her number or personal email. My room mate was facebook friends with her, so I just messaged her on there which was also nice because it could show me that she'd read it.

My dad had been strongly advising me that I can't just flat out accuse her of it so I chose the words carefully. I just said that on Wednesday night I'd found out that my warranty card had been used and that Staples managed to bring up the security footage of the person who used it. Then I said that the footage showed her using my card to buy the stuff. I said that I'd already drafted all the paperwork to file a lawsuit against her and if we hadn't resolved this by lunch time the following day, I would be taking the paperwork to the court house. I asked her to please pay me back my money.

So the next day I went into work. I was feeling really anxious because I don't like confrontation. I just didn't want to deal with it. But I walked past her cube and sat at my desk like normal. After a minute she pinged me on microsoft communicator, asking for me to help her with something. It felt vague compared to how she'd normally ask that, so I assumed it was related to the money.

With that inkling I went all spy-mode and I brough up the voice recording app on my phone and tucked it into the breast pocket of my shirt. When I entered her cube, she pulled the receipt from the purchase out folded up to just show the giftcard number used to pay for it. She asked me if that was the number for my card. I looked at her sceptically and said yeah. She then started the worst acting I've ever seen, like seroiusly, Hayden Christensen's performance in Star Wars felt like an academy award performance compared to this. She pretended to freak out like she couldn't believe it.

She asked me to follow her and we went outside. And this is the best part. Are you guys ready for this? It's awesome.

Her story... was that on Wednesday a friend of her's that she's in business with called her up and gave her a Staples giftcard code and pin number to use to buy some business supplies. She said that he'd gotten it off craigslist and she couldn't believe that it was mine.

For a minute I just stared at her. I could not believe that this was the best story she could come up with. It was so fucking ridiculous. I honestly couldn't believe for a second that she could honestly ever expect me to believe it. She wants me to believe that someone else at work, a full-timer who was an adult and been working at the company for years, stole the cash card and put it on craigslist. Even though the ONLY PERSON I told at work was her. And that somehow, by astronomical odds, it just happen to be her fucking friend who bought it and just happened to give it to her, the only person at work who knew and that sat ... right... next... to.... me....

But I went along with it, tried to play it cool. I said that if this in fact true, that she'd need to show me the craigslist ad. She said but what if it isn't there. I said a big site like craigslist wouldn't delete any of the post data. It may not be visible to us, but they'd definitely have it and I would be surprised if they didn't make tape backups of everything and such.

I'm sick of everyone and their self righteous bullshit.  Every single one of these groups of activists.  Whether it be feminists, or LGBT, or race or whatever.  I'm specifically speaking about the ""radical"" types of these activists.  You take the things you go through as a woman, or as a homosexual, or as a person of color and you  try to make them the foreground of everyone's universe, all the while trivializing the struggles and issues of every other group of people while claiming that the best course of action is universal equality.

Now before I continue, let me just say, I believe that all people should be treated as equals.  It's not unreasonable to want to fight for your rights as a human being, no matter what it is that makes you stand out, that makes you different or unique.  We should all be treated as equals.



HOWEVER.



This is not excuse for you to laugh at and ridicule and disrespect the people who aren't the same as you.  Now you're just doing the exact same thing that you don't want done to you!  I've seen a lot of posts about this ""butthurt striaght white guy"" or whatever it's called.  People of color think white people don't have struggles?  Women don't think men face problems?  LGBT people think straight people don't get bullied?  That doesn't sound fair.



As I said, I'm on your side 99%.  I view all people as equals until they wrong me, and I don't judge an entire group of people for the wrongdoings of just one, or a few.



So this brings me to my side of the story.  So here it comes.  These are the struggles of a straight white man in our culture.



As a man, I'm expected to be strong, and masculine.  I'm supposed to suck up my feelings and tough it out.  I have to ""man up.""  I have to be a ""worker"" and I have to provide for a family and be able to sustain that.  What about the fact that we're also expected to look a certain way?  That's right women, men are pressured to look a certain way as well.  We have to be chiseled like gods with washboard abs.  We see magazine covers too, you know.  The thing is, we're expected NOT to bitch about it.  I'm not allowed to complain about my body and the pressure I feel, because then it's, ""quit being a pussy,"" or, ""you sound like a bitch.""  See, women can complain about this stuff because it's generally accepted that women complain, and are unhappy with their bodies.  Men are expected to be well hung, and they're ridiculed if they're not.  WE are the ones expected to please a woman during sex.  



All a woman has to do to get a man is look fairly decent.  Men have to constantly prove themselves to a woman, but anyway, this entirely a man/woman issue.



So people of color think that white people don't struggle like they do?  I was raised by a single mother, with my little sister.  We faced homelessness, months in a tiny apartment midwinter without any electricity, or heat.  My father was in and out of my life, and he was an alcoholic and a heroin addict.  He was abusive.  When he was around, he would beat me and make me fight him as if I was a grown man.  This started when I was around 5.  He would also try to wrestle me, and he'd choke me so hard I'd pass out and wake up to him calling me a bitch because I couldn't defend myself.  ""Oh stop, you're fine.""  When he and mom together, he beat her.  He strangled her while she was pregnant with me.  I was a really troubled kid in school.  I was expelled multiple times.  Often lived in impverished neighborhoods.  My mom treated me more like a friend and confidante instead of a son.  She came to me with her problems when I was just a little kid, and I was forced to grow up super fast so that I could solve all her emotional problems for her.  All while being a blonde haired blue eyed white boy.

And as for LGBT, this may not be something I can ever relate to, but I was bullied like crazy all throughout my twelve years of school.  I was called gay and faggot all the time because I was sensitive, didn't know anything about cars, couldn't build a goddamn birdhouse in woodshop.  I was even picked on because I didn't have callouses on my hands!  I was a very small child, and was constantly made fun of.  I came home bruised every day and my mom was too busy working or trying to get someone to wife her up for financial stability to care.

So, just to clear it up, straight people, white people, and men also deal with shitty lives.  So please try to consider that the people whose struggles you're trivializing might actually have some shittacular life experiences under their belts too.

A few months in I became suspicious that the landlady was stealing my mail: lots of things I had always reliably gotten in the past began to appear extremely sporadically, including bank statements, credit card statements, not to mention actual packages that were marked as delivered but that I never got. When I asked her about it, she went all defensive. Dude, just say ""I don't have any mail for you, sorry"" and leave it at that.

The straw that broke that camel's back was the time I got from her a credit card statement that had already been opened with ""oh sorry I thought it was mine""... but several pages were missing. Bullshit, lady, don't tell me you didn't read it through and steal pages. 

Lease finished up, we ended on relatively good terms mostly because I kept my mouth shut after the first time I asked her, and I left her my forwarding address, phone number, email address, yadda yadda. I moved ONE mile away. I told her that I would happily come pick up any packages if they showed up for me, even though I had obviously changed my address way in advance as I figured I would never get anything from her.

Fast forward three months and my prescription doesn't come in the mail. I call the pharmacy to ask and they tell me that they fucked up and shipped it to my old address... i.e. address of crazy bitch ex-landlady.

WHY???! 

OK, OK, this is still not a disaster. This is why I made an effort to end things on good terms with crazy bitch ex-landlady so that IF I ever was in the misfortune of having to deal with her again, it wouldn't be super awkward. So I call her. She tells me that yes she did get it.... ""but since you don't live here anymore I just threw it back in the mail"".

MEDS, LADY, MEDS. Did you not think they were remotely important? 

I LEFT YOU ALL MY FUCKING INFORMATION FOR A REASON. I LIVE LESS THAN ONE MILE AWAY. I TOLD YOU I WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME AND PICK ANYTHING UP.

To make things even better, the post office has no record of ever getting the package back. Part of me thinks crazy bitch ex-landlady probably just threw it in the pile of all the other things she never gave me when I lived there. 

So, I have no meds and they are floating around somewhere in cyberspace, because of crazy bitch ex-landlady.

It was a card to replace a chair I had under warranty for $300. I know 100% she did it, but my evidence isn't 100% conclusive in the eyes of the law (as far as I know).

Staples was able to track the usage of my gift card and pull up the receipt and then bring up a picture of her from their security footage. Unfortunately it only shows the back of her but the description the employees gave matches her perfectly and the clothing she is wearing in the picture matches what she was wearing. She is also only 1 of 2 people I told about it, and the other is my room mate who doesn't even own a Mac (all three products bought were Mac related) plus he wouldn't do that to me since we've been friends for awhile now and this other intern has only been here about a month.

Since I don't have an image of her face, I'm waiting for our building's security to get back to me. Hopefully they have an image showing at least what she was wearing that day and hopefully that's enough for the police to check her apartment where they will definitely find the stuff she bought.

Plus, one of the things bought was a wireless keyboard, and coincidentally the day after the purchases were made she brought her own keyboard in from work since our keyboards are crap. It's so interesting that the day after the purchase, she doesn't need her keyboard at home. 

Regardless of security's response I'm going to the police during my lunch break today. Tried last night but they were closed.

See, when you want to use this *very expensive* piece of machinery, you're supposed to sign your name, the date, the procedure, the lenght of time you spend on it on a sheet of paper conveniently taped to the front of the machine.

That's, of course, exactly what I did the last time I used it. 

That's, of course, exactly what the people who used it after me *didn't* do when they used it.

So, who got the blame for the very very VERY expensive broken piece of machinery (uh, did I mention it's very really fucking expensive)? 

I'll give you a hint: the last person whose name is signed on the pretty pretty piece of paper.

I'll give you another hint: it's ME.

Because the girl who used it *right after I was finished* (I SAW her use it, she specifically asked me to leave it on for her) didn't sign herself and now, understandably, won't admit to using it last so she won't get blamed. 

Now, the boss is not in so I can't complain about it (and even if I do, I'll pass for a snitch) and everyone is giving me the stink eye despite the fact that I declared (more than once) that I'm not the last person who used it. 

Please grant me the strenght not to stab someone in the eye with a pencil.

First time with the bf for his birthday. We've had a hard time with money lately (just moved) and he knows I'm always broke. He specifically requested no presents - we both had the weekend to finally spend together, and a party planned for his friends to join us. I was told no balloons, homemade cake, or anything, even with my excitement to do so.

We watched the Blue Jays win Friday from amazing seatd I scored, we slept in Saturday which we never do anymore, got drunk and danced all night, slept in Sunday, got high and had lunch before World War Z and even played baseball until 11:30 at night. His favourite sport.

I give him his card, when were finally home Sunday, thinking it would be nice during downtime before bed -  because he had to rush on his work computer to leave again on business. Third time since May 5. Despite ordering early, none of his presents have arrived yet-  the ones he said not to buy, but I had to anyways.

His first night away from home.. and he's ""allowed to be cranky"" because all he got for his birthday was a card I wrote just before midnight, and failed at birthday sex. I'm shy - my advances (what I thought were obvious) were rejected. Multiple times.

We've never, ever, been so stressed with one another before, and I feel like I've truly disappointed him. I guess a weekend of my undivided attention and company, catering his friends, and the ""amazingly sweet card"" I wrote, with the promise of incoming presents over the next few weeks, wasn't good enough.

1372098543.0,17,self.rant,1gzf7b,"RIP, Reddit of old.",32,15,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1gzf7b/rip_reddit_of_old/,"I have been a Redditor for many, many years. Although I have used multiple accounts over the years, and am admittedly not super active in the Posting/commenting (because of school, then work, and life in general), I have read links and comments almost daily.

I write this as more of a farewell to what I used to love, and less as a slight at the current state of affairs. And although I'm sure this will be down-voted into the bowels of the Reddit servers, I feel obligated to bid adieu to what was my favorite website on the internet.
To me, Reddit used to be a place where opinions were welcomed and responded to without ad-hominum attacks. An issue was presented, redditors weighed in on the issue, responses to the comments were given that both justified the concerns of the previous commenter and presented a different point of view. This was the standard ebb and flow of Reddit. This structure allowed for (mostly) intelligent conversation about issues with little backlash or useless banter.

However, this is no longer the way things operate here in the new-age of Reddit. (I will apologize in advance for my use of analogy to explain issues. As an attorney I do this often, so it’s become almost second nature and my most effective way of simplifying complex patterns.) Think of Reddit as a bee-farm, with each hive being an idea or an opinion, and each bee representing a redditor. In the “Old reddit bee farm,” the bees used to fly into various hives as they pleased. Bees weren’t protective of a certain hive. They didn’t care which bees flew in and out, nor what their opinion was on the “structure of the hive” (if you will). Bees could fly to a hive, suggest possible improvements to increase the structure of said hive, and the bees at the hive would relay their opinions on the opinion. This, ultimately, would lead to a stronger hive. Stronger hives breed stronger bees. Stronger bees + stronger hives combine to create one hell of a bee-farm. This is no longer the way Reddit works.

This new Reddit is a whole different bee-farm. A farm where the hives are strictly protected from bees that may give suggestions. Thus, only bees that agree with the “current state of operation” in a hive are welcome. If a bee flies to hive and makes suggestions that aren’t exactly in line with the current hive’s way of thinking, the bees swarm and attack that audacious bee until it’s suggestions and desire to help the hive have crumbled. The new bees in the farm have become the definition of “Hive minded.” Protect the hive at all costs, and conform with the other bees if necessary. This isn’t the way things should operate.

Applying this to reddit, there are topics and issues that many redditors have an opinion on. That opinion is a fairly popular opinion in a certain sub-reddit. What happens in the new reddit? Redditors swarm together with this opinion in mind, and if (god help him) a new redditor comes into the “hive” that has an opinion about why the certain popular way of thinking may be incorrect, redditors swarm and attack the new redditor. “You must be new here.” “Riiiight.” “You must work for (insert unpopular company here).” “Trollololol.” Comment/post downvoted by everyone, because it’s being downvoted by everyone (the hivemind vicious circle). Logical fallacy after logical fallacy, ad hom’s and insults. This isn’t right. This help no-one. This method does not spur new and better ideas, it reinforces conformity at the cost of independent forethought. It makes the idea/opinion weaker, makes the hives weaker, makes the bees weaker.

Let’s take, for example, the recently popular idea that “The PS4 is better than the Xbox-One.” (I choose this topic mainly because of how recent and highly-debated it was). This was a perfectly acceptable hypothesis on its own. However, like all scientific hypotheses, they often (and should) change. What has happened with this debate? /r/gaming has become a hive of pissed-off bees that are absolutely entrenched with the notion that the PS4 is the way to go. If a redditor came into the /r/gaming hive with anything other than the popular opinion, that bee was ostracized from the conversation and the opinion is left at the status-quo. I’ve seen this time and time again, and what it does is creates a swarm of ignorant pissed-off bees… and if that swarm gets big enough, it can do real damage.

Think about what happened with the Xbox and its reversal of some unpopular policies. Likely, it was /r/gaming (and similar blog sites with similar ideas) that took a substantial part in MS’s decision. Were these changes good or bad? We don’t know, I don’t know, MS probably doesn’t even know. However, eventually we will, and what if these changes, that were partially spurred by the angry-hiveminded bees of reddit, turn out to be horrible? What if they set the gaming-industry back? This is what I am afraid of, albeit not on the trivial video-game scale. I’m worried about politics, and if Reddit keeps on its current course, it could have a drastic impact on the way people live their lives.

It is excellent that Reddit has this kind of power. I love it, and I love the idea behind citizens of every country being able to solve problems with each other, develop solutions, and these solutions actually being applied by governmental entities. The bee-hive is getting bigger and stronger by the month. However, if the bees of each hive continue to be simple-minded conformists, the power that reddit has could inflict severe (likely unintentional) damage to things that actually matter.

Reddit didn’t used to be this way. As I stated earlier, it used to be primarily consumed with actual problem solving. Twisting and shifting concepts that changed rapidly when new information was brought to the table. Bees didn’t swarm around an idea and protect it to the end; they swarmed around an idea as long as there was a reason to swarm around it. With new information and new avenues to approach an issue being introduced, redditors would think outside the box, and the opinions would change. Redditors became increasingly educated about topics/ideas and the pitfalls to certain ways of thinking.
I loved the old reddit. It was an information superhighway. A place where hot-topics could be discussed rationally and people introduced meaningful, interesting, and often selfless concepts. It was serious and funny at the same time. The community felt stronger.

I don’t blame Reddit itself for any of these changes. Things change with popularity, and lord knows that Reddit is more popular now than ever. At risk of sounding like I live in the depths of Portland, I’ll say that I guess I don’t like the popularity of Reddit. I think it’s made the community worse and the debate/problem-solving intolerable to be a part of. Rational debate exists, but very few and far between the hive minded bees that control most hot-button issues.

There will be a few of you that understand where I’m coming from, and a lot of you that won’t. That’s fine… it’s your Reddit now, your farm to run. However, just know that the hiveminded mentality doesn’t create anything useful. Does it allow you to feel a sense of comfort? A sense of belonging with the community and the (illusionary) feeling that your opinion is the correct one? Absolutely, all of the above. However, this doesn’t create any real lasting worthwhile change. It suppresses creativity and logical thinking. Please, keep this in mind as you watch Reddit grow and become increasingly powerful. Eventually, redditors will be able to change things that matter. You don’t want to be the one that conformed with the swarm and inflicted catastrophic damage. Rationality, logical thinking, and change… these are good things, and have become very scarce in the new reddit.

To avoid needless repetition, I’ll stop here. I love you old reddit… you were a huge part of my past and I learned about so many things from you that I couldn’t have otherwise. I hope, one day, you resurface.

Tl;dr – Reddit isn’t what it used to be.

As a result of this my auto insurance was cancelled. It was going to cost me roughly $350 to restart my policy. Well, when you have no income, $350 is tough to come by. In the meantime, the DMV sent me a notice that if I did not have an insurance policy by May 31st, my license would be suspended.

At this point, the job I've found is basically shit. $7.50/hr and damn luck to see 30 hours in a week. I borrowed some money from my brother and my dad to clear up all this insurance mess. I make a payment to my insurance company on the 31st of May to reinstate my policy. (Not because I wanted to wait that long, rather that was how long it took for me to get it together.)

Now we're at today. I get a letter from the DMV that my license is, in fact, suspended. The policy, for whatever reason, did not take effect until the 1st of June. This made me ONE day late for showing proof of insurance. One day. Because of this I now have to pay a $200 reinstatement fee along with another fee. This other fee is $5 a day for every day the car was uninsured. My prior policy was cancelled in mid-April. I'm at the maximum amount, $200.

So, because the policy I purchased of the 31st of May (within the deadline) did not take effect until ONE day later, I am now on the hook for $400.

A women gets raped. She was probably asking for it. A man gets accused of rape. Screw all women, she is clearly lying, she is scum, just trying to get out of it.
Or, even more commonly, forgetting the women that was raped and instead  bitching and moaning over how men can get raped too, ignoring the issue completely that, regardless of gender, PEOPLE ARE GETTING RAPED! That's a pretty big deal, but how about instead of discussing which gender has it more problems, we do something more important and work on stopping anyone from getting raped.


Of course, it's perfectly clear as to why this keeps happening. Because clearly girls are only good for sex and cooking, and other than that should just sit quietly in the corner. 
Oh, but I'm just kiiiiddding- Well stop. You are not funny. You are not clever. You are not ironic. You are not original. You are an asshole. How about we treat people as people regardless of whether they have two X chromosomes or an X and a Y. 


And of course, any girl who refuses to have sex is a friendzoning bitch, who doesn't deserve the asshole- I mean nice guy that you are. I wasn’t a complete asshole, why aren’t the girls lining up to have sex? I wonder why! I definitely am not a complete and utter fuckhead all the time, contrary to all of the casual sexism and racism I constantly post on Reddit. 


Speaking of racism, let’s go over that. AskReddit asks about racist opinions, and happy feelings all around! But don’t anyone dare someone insult Suburban White people. Suddenly this is all not okay. But racism is funny, right? And as long as I don’t think it is overly offensive, it’s perfectly fine for me to say whatever slurs I feel are appropriate! And I must be right because some comedian said it was alright, and everyone knows comedians are the only source of trustworthy news and opinions in the world.


Oh right, and remember that conservatives are horrible people who hate anyway. But fuck any minorities that might need help in life, as I might not get all of the benefits. They just haven’t accepted the absolute enlightenment that is liberalism (As long as most of the benefits go to me). Fuck those selfish conservatives, but fuck any policy that doesn’t directly help me before anyone else. 


And fuck corporations and people with more money than me. Only the worst of scum can possibly make more money and they clearly couldn’t have worked hard for their status. People that run corporations are clearly awful people, and never help anyone. Also, they are the sole cause of any problems in the country. Clearly. 



Oh, and don’t forget that you are entitled to anything your heart desires. Want a new game, but don’t feel like paying for it? Just pirate it. They are le evil corporations, and deserve to lose money. Same with music, but don’t dare accept any flaws. You are a (non) paying customer, and deserve a higher quality. Same with any research papers. How dare you be denied any new scientific discoveries, everyone knows research and publishing is free and so there is no reason to for it to cost anything to access. 

I am getting so fucking sick of this shit. Everyone acts so fucking enlightened, but in reality, they just act like assholes and expect everything to be handed to them. For free. And no input on their part.

his head over by the snow cone concession.

Maybe we should make fun of people because they watch a show and obsess over it. Maybe we should believe 4chan and take everything they say seriously. Maybe we should, based off the porn they make, call them disgusting pedophiles, scum/cancer of the internet, horse/ponyfuckers, etc.

Or maybe we should learn to accept that not everyone is a fucking extremist. Maybe we should learn to be more tolerant of each other and learn to A: Realize that shoving things down people's throats your beliefs isn't always (and usually never is) the way to convince people and B:[Warning: Hypocrisy] complaining and bitching about things that bother you, especially very trivial things (or at least things that are objectively trivial), isn't also the best way to deal with your problems. Maybe we don't have to insult people and assume the worst of a group and judge them with extreme prejudice. 

Or maybe I'm just a huge faggot who is probably some peace-loving child and clearly doesn't know any better. Like my opinion even matters here. Oh well, we all know who's gonna have a field day with this post.

I'm sorry that maybe you didn't fit in with the popular hypocritical Christian kids in high school or if your overprotective Christian mother and/or father beat you over the head with a bible every single day or whatever other childhood traumas that led you to have a complex that made you feel better than every other person in the universe. But guess what? YOU'RE NOT. 

This hollow lie you hold on to, that you have everything figured out and you are better at life than Christians or Muslims or Hindus or any other religion, it's no different than what they're holding on to with their religion. It's the exact same thing! They hold on to Jesus or a Hindu god and you hold on to Carl Sagan and Neil Tyson, you're no different. 

If you're right? And this life is all we have? Why would you want to spoil theirs? Why couldn't you just let them believe what they want to believe? It's not that hard. You see that guy posting a bible verse? You scroll down. You see that girl tweeting that she loves Jesus? Why do you care? Why does it make you want to say something? You just HAVE to prove that you're smart and they're stupid. Do you feel better now? You probably made her cry. Cool. FUCK YOU. But guess what? When she goes to bed, if she's a strong Christian, she's probably just going to pray and read scripture and feel better and be reassured by the passages that say she's going to be hated by the world and people like you so WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT. 

You know, as an outsider looking in, it just makes me want to be a Christian when I see you pricks mercilessly bashing on some poor guy. I want to stick up for them. Cause the majority of them DON'T hate gays, DON'T force their beliefs on you, and DON'T want to argue with you. You just forced them to.

A lot of people liked it, and and I got a lot of upvotes. But a few people were complaining that I was a pre-teen (I'm 18), saying ""now I know what people mean when they say this subreddit's full of nothing but preteens""

I replied to one of their comments ""I'm 18,"" which got 22 downvotes.

When somebody tried to defend me, they got downvoted.

Then one of the mods said it was put on f7u12_ham.

I wasn't complaining, I was just curious to know what rules it broke.

""1 4 and 8. Complaining? rule 13.""

I did not break any of those rules. I don't see how a STORY about a little kid being able to finally reach the top of a fridge if blogging or self-preachy.

and rule 13 says ""If a comic is removed by a moderator, even if it doesn't seem to violate any of the other rules, it remains removed.""

In my defense, it says nothing about complaing.

Normally I would have ignored this and went on, because I've had stuff taken off before. The rules haven't always been the same, and I haven't always kept up with it, but I ALWAYS look at the rules to see what I did wrong. When I see what I did, I learn and move on. But I'm kinda tired of mods being complete douchebags just because they're mods.

I said ""I don't care what rule 13 says, if I want to bitch I will,"" knowing damn well that both he and I knew that it wasn't against the rules.

So he banned me. All because I said I didn't care about a rule that he didn't even use right.

So I got banned because I got pissed off, because the mods don't ban posts that actually break the rules. If they like it, it stays, no matter what rules it breaks. I've seen it. But if they don't like it, they'll take it off. It doesn't matter whether the post breaks the rules or not. This might not apply to all of the mods, but there's over 14 of them so.. ya. The whole thing's freaking corrupted, it seems.

And that got me thinking, who the fuck cares? And then after I asked myself that question, I realized how fucking dumb society is. And how brainwashed we all are. So when it comes to Justin Beiber. He is just another mindless zombie who will try to do anything that will make him/herself look cool to an certain audience. 
When you open your eyes and see what drives our generation (past, present and future). It's what other people do, and they want to imitate it to fit in. This isn't just normal people, it's celebrities as well. If you want to remain relevant, you talk about or do things that others are doing. Our society isn't about parenting; it's about the marketing machine being all around us. Who ever created “molly” is having their product marketed by rappers. Weed is now the really cool thing to do now. With all of the legalizing weed laws, and everyone all about smoking it. Weed has always been around. But with the current society, they are all about making themselves look cool by admitting to smoking it. Hoping that someone will congratulate them or honor them somehow. This might sound weird, but really think about it.

Everything we do, is a result of something we seen, or heard. We are all impressionable people. We all want to fit in, one way shape or form. Whether you want to fit in at your new job or you just joined a church. You will do things that others might be talking about or doing, to make yourself noticed and likeable. And who is the blame, the media. Social Media is included.

How many people are on twitter, trying their best to be noticed? Millions! From current celebrities, and people who want to be celebrities. And the normal tools who think they are funny, witty or just bite other people's post. Hoping for someone will notice them. Some people who are chasing a dream, like in music, modeling or acting. Their main purpose is to be verified on twitter. Because in their minds, that means that they are somebody. And most of the time, those people who strive for that kind of recognition don't give two shits about the dream they are chasing. They just want the status. 

This girl I know is just like that. She is all about Nicki Minaj and being a ""Barbie"". It pissed me off every time I hear her talk about her. She’s delusional. She actually calls herself a Barbie. She buys all of her stuff, wears the lipstick and dresses like a whore. And her friends all call her out on the way she presents herself all the time. But in her mind, she's a ""Bad Bitch"", and this is who she is. Instead of having a drive to hard, and get a good job. She wants everything handed to her. But complains about not having anything to be happy about. She hates herself so much, that she is trying to replace her real life with fantasy. 

And I gave you guys that story because that is how society is impacting our lives. Hell look at reddit. How many people on this website are trying to fit into the culture that this page brings? If you’re not an atheist, then you will get shitted on. You can’t get your images up voted because your might not have enough Karma in a lot of people’s eyes to give you a thumbs up. How pathetic is that? I see so many people trying to matter on this website and others. They will post or say anything to get recognized. And yet hate it when someone calls them out on their shit. Because society tells us to be ourselves and never let anyone tell you how to live. But society is actually telling you how to live. How to love yourself, and how to succeed. So people always want to come up with an excuse on why this happened and what was the cause. Bad Parenting is a part of it. Parenting isn’t about keeping your kids from blowing up buildings and shooting sprees. It’s about providing your child with morals. And religion isn’t the key to applying this. Everyone should have morals. And pass those along to your child. But if you’re an asshole, your kid will most likely be an asshole. And if you grew up not caring about your life, then you are the continuing trend of allowing the media and society to give you their morals. Which are all pretty much shitty.

* Cancer
* Diabetes
* Coeliac's disease
* Liver disease

I can't take the manic phone calls in the middle of the night any more. Please stop calling my physician and dropping ""hints"" about what you think I have. Please stop begging me to get unnecessary tests and urging me to ""keep going to doctors until you find one who believes"" you. This is annoying at least, and obnoxiously controlling at worst.

Please don't call the HR person at my job and tell them you think I'm overworked again. That alone caused me more stress than anything you *think* I've dealt with at work. 

I had a physical last month, and generally speaking, *I'm healthy*. I need to lose a little weight, and that's about it. I'm active and happy. Why do you keep insisting I'm ""hiding"" something? I've never kept anything health-related from you, yet you insist I'm keeping ""the truth"" about my health from you.

But I just have to be so damn understanding about everything, even when it upsets me. Warning: this post will probably touch on a wide range of confusing topics.

Honestly most of this has to do with my SO of 3 years. We live together and it's becoming painfully obvious how different we are, but also how in love we are. It's a really weird thing. We are all over each other, we talk about pretty much everything, we love each other and we tell each other regularly. But we have such ... differences...

Most of the time, I feel like I have to just ""understand"" and suck it up when he doesn't feel like doing anything. This weekend I actually had off (for the first time in MONTHS) and I wanted to find a free activity somewhere in the city that we could both attend. We work opposite shifts during the week and only see each other in the mornings, and when we fall into bed. So naturally spending actual time together would have been nice. 

But of course he wants to stay home all weekend and not leave the house. He works a standard 9-6 video game testing job. He is pretty introverted, plays video games as soon as he gets home from work. We smoke pot together, however I've had really strong feelings of quitting since my life has been at a depressing stand-still. I want more than a minimum wage retail slave job, and I need to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do. I have student loans to pay and I can't apply for assistance forever, dammit. THAT'S why I want to quit smoking pot - I can't afford it anymore. I can't afford going out to the store and buying junk food every single night. That shit is EXPENSIVE! The shittiest thing is that I have to be understanding about him not being able to leave the apartment.. he's too ""scared""... so I have to go and buy us goddamn munchies... I also have to be understanding about him needing to smoke pot because it helps with his stress. If I decline smoking that evening he gets really pouty with me and it's FUCKING ANNOYING.

I'm just really fucking sick of being broke all the time. I've missed credit card payments because of this shit... he always wants to stay in and send me to get shitty food for us... then when I come home he plays WoW &amp; LoL with his friends from work. They all Skype at once so I can't even talk in my own apartment. I would go into the bedroom and do my own thing but he wants me to stay out in the living room with him and sit beside him and ... reddit? Like why the fuck would I want to sit out there and not be able to talk or listen to music. I feel like a damn dog.

It's just expected that I know the drill. Come home from work, get high, play video games, go get munchies. I have no time to actually try and plan meals so we have stuff to take for lunches. And why am I the only one TRYING to do this stuff? Isn't this OUR apartment, OUR life? Shouldn't he be helping too? Shouldn't he be thinking about this shit when he gets home from work instead of ""I need to smoke a bowl and play some games"". And it lasts right up until we go to bed. No change at all. He fucking loves this routine and it's making me so goddamn angry.

It needs to fucking end but how in the world do I even BEGIN to change it? He's recently suggested that he might be autistic but wants to get diagnosed by a real doctor. JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE AUTISTIC DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT NOT LEAVING THE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO SCARED... how do people get too scared to leave a fucking apartment? I mean, I can understand if somebody actually has autism that prevents them from doing these things... but this guy goes to work all day and has many friends from work, but just from work... he doesn't go outside or interact with the real world if he doesn't have to because he claims he hates going new places and hates being in rooms with people he doesn't know.

Sometimes imagine what it would be like to have a boyfriend that would come visit me at work and not be scared of interacting with other people. These dream boyfriends might suggest going somewhere for dinner, or they would have a date planned going to the dollar cinema or a free comedy show, or they would have already made a meal that would yield leftovers for a while. How perfect. Bonus is if they would actually stay off of their computer once they get home from work. The hardest part about all of this is that I love my boyfriend, and he has been supportive of me in a lot of ways... I mean, we moved states together and he used to pay for a lot of my shit when I was unemployed a few years back.

I don't know if she thinks it's cute or what but it gets annoying when every other statement is ""cool story bro"" or ""I like X because X"". It's not even like she had the same interests as Reddit before discovering it - she merely copies it. Like, suddenly she's the biggest Doctor Who fan and loves bacon.

She works at a fucking library and sits at the frontdesk surfing Reddit! Now she has to actually put books back and (OH NO!) that means work! ACTUAL WORK!

Third, she complains about how ""poor"" she is. She'll spend money to go to ComiCon (why? ""because ComiCon"" in her own words) and a bus ticket to NY but then whines that she's poor and can't spend money. It's so goddamn annoying and goes on about how bad her life is because of it. She went on a study abroad trip to Ireland (suddenly Ireland's the hot place to go now according to her) and of course because she's ""poor,"" her grandparents paid for her trip.

Fourth, she drinks to get drunk and act obnoxious. It's not so much that she gets drunk and acts obnoxious as a result, she just drinks and then uses it as an excuse to be obnoxious in front of others. When she drinks, every other statement is ""I'm drunk"" like, ""I'm too drunk for that,"" and, ""Well I'm drunk right now."" It just gets on my nerves since she does it for attention. People think she's being silly and I'm always tempted to just tell her how much of a bitch she is since, of course, she's ""drunk"" and would be ""too drunk"" to care.

Fifth, she doesn't shower! If she does, it'll be once a week. Why doesn't she shower? Because, as she claims, the blue hair dye from a little part of her ponytail (that you can't even fucking see!) will run in the shower. So she can't shower because a little blue ponytail is really important over smelling good. I wish I could just leave a bar of soap on her bed as a message to shower.

Sixth, she has one chore and she rarely does it. It's to simply run the dishwasher and unload the dishes when they're done. It takes half a week for her to unload the dishwasher so a pile of dirty dishes (with 5 people living in the house) begins to collect and while most of us think she should put them away (not even wash them, just put them in the dishwasher), she refuses to do so because as she puts it, ""It's not my fucking job."" Anything that takes her away from her computer is like a detrimental loss in her life.

Seventh, she's always angry which gets annoying. She can never be happy - every little thing pisses her off or makes her bitch about it. She has these free Stella Artois chalices she got a few months ago and added them to our glass collection for communal use (i.e. anyone can use it if they have a drink). But whenever someone does use it, she repeats each time to them, ""Don't break it or I'll fucking kill you."" It gets old when half of her statements end with ""I'll fucking kill you."" She wonders why she can't make new friends. If she has homework, she's pissed because she has to actually do work. But when she does work, she has Netflix open on one monitor and Reddit on the other. She wonders why she fails her exams and drops out of classes because they're so much work. Her major is psychology which is not too difficult in my opinion but taking 3 courses total for her is like back-breaking work.

Eighth, she's the biggest hypocrite I know. She'll make threats to you, be mean to you, and if you do anything like that in return, she'll just get defensive and break down in tears because she's a fucking psychotic maniac. I find it really fucking ironic and hilarious that she's a psychology major since she can't even get help for herself. How the fuck does she expect to deal with other people since she always complains about people?

Ninth, she's oblivious to everything that goes on around her and is very self-centered. Like if she invites friends over, she usually won't be there because she made plans at the last minute to go see a movie with other friends and so her own friends just sit and wait for her to come back. She'll leave the house and leave the door unlocked (sometimes leaving it open in the fucking winter!), lights left on, and just makes empty promises to ""try harder to remember."" It wastes electricity and we all pay more for it. And of course, she's so poor!

Tenth, she feels so entitled to things all the time. Like if she bitches, she can't listen to anyone else bitch about how bad their life sucks, she just rants and expects you to be receptive. Everything you say to her just goes over her head and she just ignores it to continue on how her life is worse. If anyone goes somewhere for food, she incessantly nags them to get her food in which case she'll pay them back ""when she gets money."" Of course that's if you remember to keep reminding her for money. But it's so annoying since I usually have to sneak out to go to Wawa otherwise she'll ask me to buy her food. What annoys me more is when I'll be having a conversation with my other roommates, she likes to invite herself into it. Like if anyone is over, she immediately has to be involved and talks really loudly to emphasize her point. She constantly yells things like, ""NO IT'S FUCKING NOT!"" or ""I FUCKING TOLD YOU!"" She'll go to bed while all her annoying friends are over and doesn't give a shit about what they do. She fucking sleeps through everything so of course it's no a problem to her. But when I need to sleep, she bitches about how I'm annoying for asking her to keep her friends quiet. How self-centered do you have to be?

We spent a week after talking it through.. I spent time talking to.her as well... Trying to get the truth... In the mean time she had cut all ties with him.  He spent that time sucking up to me and trying to win me back... Needless to say I fell for it.

And other stuff.,20,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/14uwwq/thoughts_on_the_connecticut_shooting_this_morning/,"I have been reading my friend's thoughts and prayers going out to the families who have just suffered losses in Connecticut this morning. I even just saw my boss burst into tears, asking, ""Who kills 26 people?! ...That's our babies!""

It's truly sad when these things happen on our soil and we all feel that pain because we can associate ourselves with them... (They are American families like ours, who lead lives like ours, and do things like us. They go to work in our schools, and go to learn in our schools...)

But again, I'm the shocking one on my friend's list, by trying to post something meaningful that most of you won't care to read... that's fine, I've accepted that the majority of humanity doesn't give a shit. But I want you, friends, to try and associate with this viewpoint, however different it may be from your own.

This pain that we feel today, as our thoughts and prayers go to these families, is a pain that is lingering within all of us EVERY SINGLE DAY. Some of us do not feel it, some of us cut it off, and some of us allow ourselves to feel that pain, because we choose to associate and connect with all life on this planet, letting compassion guide our hearts.

I feel the same way as you do in regards to the Connecticut shooting and all of the other shootings and ""terrorist attacks"". But when these things happen, I also think about these never-ending wars, factory farms, all of the inequalities and injustices on the personal rights of living things and beings, etc... I don't choose to think of these things because I'm a morose person, I love life. I choose to think of these things because my heart feels for those things and I choose to accept my feelings instead of bury them.

You may not see the connection, but some of us feel that EVERY DAY. We just have to keep it to ourselves, accept things the way they are and wait for people to open their minds and hearts. (Or post things like this, in hopes of reaching anyone.)

And while all I can do from my desk is post my emotional rants on Fb and Reddit, I see that there are many people out there, putting their own personal freedom on the line, getting beaten and jailed, getting made an example of by regimes and getting publicly executed. I see many people now truly fighting for what is right and truly fighting for humanity, and that gives me inspiration and hope, which in turn creates more compassion within my heart, which I only want to share with you.

What's wrong with the world? Well, that's a pretty big question with a lot of dirty &amp; painful answers... But here's my opinion on where to start: 

""Idealists"", as we choose to label them, are only compassionate people who want what's best in the world, they only want to help humanity. Don't discredit these people because they think different than the masses, it's these very types of thoughts that will create change...

People ask, ""What's going on in this sick world?!"" 

Here's my opinion in short: The masses still believe in fairy tales, but not in love. Humanity is a specie that is still incredibly primitive and sheep-like. We are self-centered, arrogant, ignorant and greatly lacking in compassion for any life but our own on this planet we all share... I know it's incredibly cliche to quote Jimmy Hendrix here, out of all people, but when the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace.

Let's keep moving forward to make these connections one by one and to work towards a more peaceful, loving and compassionate world.

Let us make these connections before electing the next warmongering politician to do our work for us, before electing the next Republican or Democrat POTUS, who will be exactly like the last. 

Let us make these connections before allowing the next war to begin, undeclared. Before we allow them to decide to use our hard-earned money to send our own children to kill other humans and to die for this country's interests.

Let's make these connections before choosing to support CEO's who openly disgrace humanity with shitty values and morals. 

Most importantly, let's make these connections before teaching our own children WHAT to think instead of HOW, based on some book that has only caused killing, pain, suffering, and further differences for us to disassociate with.

The column on the left side is gone, replaced by a [drop down menu tool bar](http://i.imgur.com/J6OSy.png).) on the top of the page (much like Bing's search results page). 

Apparently Google has been slammed by complaints due to their removal of the feature that allowed used to filter image results based on file size.

I have a favorite website where the creator posted a critical e-mail a reader sent, something that made them feel low enough to self harm again.

Well another person replied to that post saying, ""Maybe if you grew some fuckin balls and were willing to say “go fuck your mudda” to some of these cunts your comic wouldn’t be so shitty,"" and ""Having a meltdown about it should be a sign that you can’t take the pressure of being a real artist.

As a female, I bothers me that a woman are labeled as a bitch (or what have you) for ""friend zoning"" a guy. I have had that talk with a guy that I thought was just a friend and it turned out that he had more feelings for me. I never dragged him shopping, I never boohooed, and cried on his shoulder, over anything, or had him pay for any movie, or meal. Rarely was it just the two of us doing things together, it was usually with our group of friends. He slowly started inviting less and less people out to do things, so by the end it was just the two of us, and I realized he was trying to get a date like atmosphere going. I told him that I wasn't interested in him that way and I was sorry.  Shortly after there was a FB status from him complaining about friend zone. I wasn't mentioned by name but I could tell he was referring to me.

Guys, if you get friend zoned, and can't get over the girl, she is a bitch. If a girl is friend zoned by a guy, she is an insecure mess, that is afraid she will be alone for ever.

I have been hung up on several guys since I was 14 (now 25) and It is the shittiest feeling ever. If someone does not want to be with you, you either have to accept that you will not be in a relationship, and be happy with your friendship, happy that they were honest when you opened up to them, or sever all ties, (which I have done) because the person just likes to string you along.

Look at it this way; if the person you are infatuated with, or have a crush on is the kind that strings you along because they like the ego boost that you give them, and all the attention they get from you, and they never return the feelings, they are a shitty person and you are better off not having them in your life. Believe me, when you make yourself stop and, refuse to give this person your attention, and the bootie calls stop, (or the opposite for you guys, when you are no longer the emotional fluffer) you feel so much better about yourself. Your self esteem skyrockets and you then can see the situation clearly and realize it was not a healthy situation for you, and now you are free of them.

And if they are honest and tell you no, you cannot begrudge them for not having feelings. One can't force oneself to have feelings. If the girl just pretends to have feelings for a little while to throw you a bone, to then end things, it is worse, because you then start to let your feelings get stronger just to have the girl completely shatter your heart. 

Please take responsibility for your own emotions, and realize you friend zone girls too. It doesn't make you a bad person. Please, I don't want to feel like a shitty person because I can't reciprocate feelings.

Yesterday, VETERAN'S DAY, I'm working on my job pulling fiber optic cable through some conduit when a parade in my small town starts.  I didn't even know we had a Veteran's Day parade.  Ok, cool, whatever.  Who's leading the parade?  A firetruck pulling a piece of the World Trade Center.  My blood immediately began to boil.

This is November, two months after 9/11, which firefighters already are treating as a national holiday because lots of them honorably lost their lives at the WTC site.  I get that.  But let's face it, no firefighters were directly killed by terrorists on 9/11/01.  NONE.  They ran into a building people were jumping out of to try and DO THEIR DANGEROUS ASS JOB THAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR, AND FULLY KNEW THE RISKS OF GOING IN THERE.  If ANYONE should be trying to treat 9/11 as a national holiday, it should be flight attendants and pilots.  They were the ones who were killed by terrorists by hand and appear to have stopped (with other passengers) the 4th plane from hitting the White House.  

When you work your way into being an airline pilot, or a marine, or other careers that imply a certain amount of risk, you inherently take on a risk of being killed in the line of duty.

I live two blocks from a fire station.  3 years ago, a 19 year old kid ran into a fire (stupidly) and the floor collapsed, killing him and another fireman in the blaze.  It's a very dangerous job.  He didn't run in their to save anyone at an abandoned wood mill.  There was no reason for anyone to be in there.  It was a rush.  A fix.  An andrenaline buzz.  Just like the other volunteer fireman who killed someone on a country road in the county because he was passing people in a double yellow on the way to get to the station to go take some call about a minor vehicle incident.

In the weeks following the death of the 2 firemen, this fire station actually shut down for close to two weeks, having other fire stations cover their calls to honor their fallen brothers.  Ridiculous.  Little bitches.  News crews were coming out as they staged several funerals and media events.  No mention of them ever NOT responding for emergencies and therefore increasing the response time to everyone else in their duty area. Hmmm.  Duty area.  Duty.  As in, ""the fucking shit your stupid ass is supposed to be doing, because, you know, you volunteered to do it, asshole"".

Living so close to the fire station, i here some of their bullshitting around and go support the food sales and community stuff, and they always used to talk shit about the 19 year old.  How big of a dumbass he was, etc etc.  NOW, there are about a dozen of them just in that fire station with ""in memory of"" tattoos.  Pieces of shit.

I am ex military, and I don't even mention it IRL on veteran's day.  Why?  Because I was in the Navy during the gulf war as a nuclear steam plant mechanical operator.  EVERYONE in the Navy is a trained firefighter.  You spend weeks doing it in boot camp and constantly stay trained in it your entire naval career.  You know what?  It's a fucking rush, and everyone not on watch runs to the fire.  We lost to the sea or flight deck an average of 1.1 people per month.  We didn't shut the ship down.  Didn't stop launching planes.  Didn't go get a bunch of tattoos or any other bunch of high school fucking faggotry.  

Yeah I'm a vet, but I don't deserve to get the accolades that men who stormed the beaches of Normandy deserve.  You know, people who literally threw themselves into the world's biggest meat grinder hoping to break the machine.  People who put themselves in front of gunfire.  In front of people and surrounded by people who want to kill them and what they stand for.  I was on a ship.  I was running an engine and fighting fires.

It's frankly offensive to me that municipal city workers with tremendous benefits and get to enjoy those benefits by going home every night are trying to co-opt a holiday designed for people who actually give several of their lives in service.

So, firemen, thank you for doing your jobs.  Please do them safely and efficiently and keep talking shit about cops while turning your meters, that's what your are good at.

TLDR:  When a terrorist flies a 767 into a fire station, let me know, otherwise fuck off on 9/11 and especially Veteran's Day.  ",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_m9uek,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/m9uek/firefighters_thanks_for_putting_out_fires_now/,

Yes, the music was good, but the characters, who were supposed to be diverse and progressive, were actually just propagating stereotypes. 
To refresh your memory, they have:

* Two jocks
* Two cheerleaders
* A kid in a wheelchair
* Two Asians
* A black girl
* A gay kid
* A showbiz diva

The jocks are shown as initially hesitant to join the group, which is realistic, but one of them continues to struggle with the idea, at least through the time I stopped watching. He just can't allow himself to fit in, the way he should if the message is that music is for everyone.
The cheerleaders are stereotypically dumb as rocks, especially, and this is a shocker, the BLONDE one (whose name just happens to be Britney S. Pearce. hmmm... sounds familiar.) The Asians, of course, are just the opposite of this. They have perfect grades and parents with super high expectations One of them got an ""Asian F"" once. Translation: A-. Is this true of some Asian families? Yes, but not all of them. The black girl is relatively normal, but happens to have a fully Aretha Franklin-esque voice. Of course she does, because all black people are jazzy or soul singers, right? WRONG! The gay kid perhaps is the most irksome, because he has been made into a full-tilt diva. High voice and everything. He has a moisturizing routine and once memorably tried to sing with the girls.People like this do exist, but it is hardly a fair representation of the entire gay community. It's just all around cringe-worthy. The showbiz diva is alright I suppose. I have met someone like her, so it's a real personality. I just don't find her very interesting. She doesn't contribute anything to the show, other than her voice. As for the kid in the wheelchair, I don't really know what to think. On the one hand, people treat him normally, which is great. On the other hand, he was the main part in ""Safety Dance"" during which he miraculously got up and walked around. Speaking as a guy in a wheelchair, I had those fantasies once, when I was little. But as you grow up, especially if there is nothing modern medicine can do to help, you stop wanting that, and see the wheelchair as just as much a part of you as your nose. It's there, but you don't really think about it. There are hard days, sometimes, and I don't know if they explore that in later seasons, but in what I have watched, they really don't. I guess the common theme here is that the show uses characters with traits that do exist, but are hardly the representative qualities of their race/gender/interest/ability. So much for ""everyone can be whoever they want to be.""

This lady bragged about how strict she was with her kids - controlling everything aspect of their lives - when they study, what they do in their free time,  their diet, internet use, etc. - these kids are living in a prison in their own home! This lady truly believes that this is the only way to raise children correctly in order to become successful. She even went on to criticize other parents who were not as strict with their kids because they are the reason the new generation is lazy and incapable of hard work.


That was a huge insult - guess what lady? My parents did the complete opposite of what you did and I turned out like a superstar in comparison to your bitter, socially inept children.

I have a close &amp; strong relationship with my parents. I can talk to them about everything - ask them for advice or help when needed. My parents have always been there for me and encouraged/supported me in every way. They trust me and expect that I will do the right thing and have never enforced a curfew or made any attempt to 'control' me because they knew that I would be fine on my own. I have never been physically punished - if I ever did something wrong, just knowing that my parents were disappointed was punishment enough. 

I did chores to help my parents because I wanted to, not because I received an allowance (I never have). I never had to be bribed to get A's or do extracurricular activities- everything I did was though my own interest &amp; hardwork. (This lady had to bribe her kids to do anything via point system). 

I am a self-sufficient adult now. I got into one of the best colleges for my interest, I have traveled abroad through many grants I received because of my own hard work and just recently was accepted into another program for a year abroad in Europe. 

I am unbelievably lucky to have had parents like mine.


Lady,I know your kids and they're not as great as you think. They are unable to talk without stuttering, they have nothing they want to do or like to do. Nothing they do is out of enjoyment. You may have taught them to be book smart- but you have harmed them by forgetting the other important skill needed to function in society - the ability to socialize. It won't matter how smart your kids are - they'll never be successful  if they can't talk. These kids can't talk or function in a social setting. They're robots only capable of following orders and incapable of making decisions for themselves.

You have robbed these kids of their childhood and their future as independent adults.

They tell me they want to start using unit tests, which is something I know a thing or two about, and so I start adding them to the build.  Then people start getting uppity because they don't like seeing the unit tests run every time they build (I'd like to do dependency based runs but their build environment is too fucking ancient and featureless).  Then one of the builds breaks because a unit test I added failed to compile and of course I'm getting hell from the team about it.

Turns out that someone had changed the signatures of everything under test...I can't even figure out why...and then checked it all in without updating the tests!!!

So no, just like everyone else in the world, this team isn't disciplined enough to run unit tests before checkin.  Not only that, but they seem to prefer to go out of their way NOT to run them.

I have two full time employees, one part time employee and I'm on the hunt for another permanent part time employee. I hired a part time employee on Monday who said she could start on Saturday for the weekend position. Was also going to interview another candidate who sounded perfect but didn't show up to the fucking interview that I traveled an hour and a half to get to. Right. Thanks for that, you cow. Yesterday, that recently hired part time employee told me that she was in fact going away this weekend and cannot start until next weekend, despite the fact that I asked her if she had any booked holiday and she said no. Saturday and Sunday are our busiest days. Okay, well I don't have time to find a temporary part time employee so that's fucking brilliant. 

Organised two interviews for later in the day, amazingly they both turn up. One of them is brilliant, can start immediately. Let her know I'll be in touch. She still hasn't got back to me. Wonderful. The other candidate - can't speak a word of fucking English (seriously - how the fuck do you expect me to fucking hire you if you can't understand a word of what I'm fucking saying!) 

Mention to the full timers that we have a temporary staff member coming in on the weekend (assuming I can fucking find one.) One of my full timers said she can cover. I nearly hug her out of relief (I don't, I'm actually pretty intimidating with permanent bitch face.) I stop looking for temporary staff and concentrate on looking for another permanent part timer. Try to organise interviews. No-one fucking getting back to me or THEY DON'T TURN UP TO THE FUCKING INTERVIEWS. 

In the meantime we've had a problem with an order of 5000 leaflets and merchandise. I ordered it two weeks ago, it should have arrived on the 9th May. Launch came and went without leaflets or pricelists. It's losing me customers, call them up today to find out when it's going to get here and THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF IT ON THEIR FUCKING SYSTEM.

I end the call after being assured it would be done in the next couple of days before looking at my emails and getting one from the full timer who can cover this weekend, saying SHE CAN'T ACTUALLY FUCKING DO IT ANYMORE.

It isn't a bad job, I rather enjoy it considering what else I could have ended up with and what not. But recently we lost a guy and I have been working every single day for the past two months while my boss and the three other old fucks he relies on make a decision on who to hire. I work 56hrs a week and while I don’t mind working 16hrs of overtime, I would like one fucking day off. Instead of hiring someone, he keeps us at a three man team which makes it almost impossible to have someone cover my hours on one day because we work 24/7.

All I want is for someone to be fucking hired. I used to enjoy coming in and sometimes staying late to help out (without being paid if it is less than 2hrs). Now I just sit on my ever increasingly fat ass doing nothing because that is what my job is: to wait around for the phone to fucking ring and then I might get a chance to walk around without looking like I am doing nothing. So finally you decided we needed to map out our environment… now I get to take 5 steps and click the mouse button and then take five more steps… rinse and repeat… all fucking night long if I push myself.

But that is bearable… you know what isn’t fucking bearable mr. I-work-five-days-a-week boss man? I DON’T HAVE FUCKING TIME TO DO ANYTHING AT HOME. Ok, I have eight hours on Fridays to do something. But fuck you. The guy you fired should have been fired back in December after he verbally abused me after he got fed up in a situation YOU put me in. You had over 100 applicants for his job and it took you over two months to fucking hire one that wants to work out his two week notice. That is two more fucking weeks that I have to spend on this shitty shift until he finally gets hired. Then you want to coddle him and have some 50yr moron train him… so that is another three weeks. From this day today, I will have to work past my mother’s birthday. I miss spending time with both my parents. My birthday was non-existent. I missed the Superbowl with my dad.. which I was looking forward to this year because I have never cared once to watch it with him but for whatever reason, I was excited to this year and guess what? Fuck you, that’s what.

And I have yet to mention my marriage. This shit is taking a toll on my marriage. Thankfully my wife is out of work so she can maintain the house. Thankfully she understands my situation. But I hate the fact that I am, on a more regular basis than I want to, taking out my frustration on her. She deserves better. She deserves that I should help around the house more often. We have a storage unit that we are paying over $130/mo on that should have been dealt with last year but I haven’t fucking had time to get the shit out. I wake up, spend about three hours with her and then go to fucking work. That is my daily routine… except on Fridays. On Fridays, that is our date night (that I am surprised you haven’t fucking screwed me over on). We have a ton of shit to do today because I work third shift and don’t feel like doing shit when I get home at 9am. Oh man but boy is it a blast to wake up at 5 or 6 and imagine how much fun I am going to have in a few hours when I AM BACK AT FUCKING WORK!

And fuck you and your response to my email about asking about inventory. I emailed the guy for a reason, so he can take time and write up his four page response to something that should have taken two sentences. I don’t want to fucking talk to him because he is one of those assholes that don’t know how to shut the fuck up and let you speak… everything he has to say is more important so it takes 10 times longer to fucking say what I have to say. So your response: “I sense frustration, it sounds like communications are lacking” IS FUCKING GOLD. No shit. Your technician let a third party do our inventory without discussing it with anyone and you expect me to be fine and dandy with it? Fuck, it would have been easier to just let the third party do my job, but I am not about that shit. Let me give you just one good (out of hundreds) reason it wouldn’t be OK for third party man to do it: how about you remember that email about that laptop that went missing and no one in our department could find for over a month? Remember that shit that your tech blamed on me? Remember how I fucking found it on the top shelf where your tech fucking put it because I had to clean it off because no one else in our department is young enough to be the fucking maid? So yeah, fuck you… Oh wait, never mind… the 50yr old bitch that doesn’t know how to remove spyware without doing a System Restore (consequently fucking the system up worse) can make those intelligent decisions without consulting our team. Oh but woe to me if I did something without discussing it with him!

Oh and I am so glad you offered to move our times around so I can get a day off. Wait, what is that you say? You need me to come in when I am sick and can’t even sit up long without having to puke? Yeah, thanks a lot you fucking selfish fuck.

I thought I was going to actually learn, strive, and excel my mind. It's been 4 years, and now i'm lazy, apathetic, and almost hate learning. This isn't learning.
Learning is starting with a question, formulating a speculation (hypothesis) and through data, coming to a conclusion. I used to research diseases, get giddy over learning about new microbes, viruses, and new diseases. 
Now, I just want to drink, smoke, play videogames, and fuck around because honestly it doesn't matter.

Those that want to learn, to grow, and to strive will be trampled by their own drive. I'm tired of trying to understand concepts, information that is irrelevant, and time consuming when I could be applying my drive and passion to shit I actually want to do.

I hate that as children, we were told to pursue our dreams, that we can be anything we want to be, and that in college you actually learn shit relevant to what you want to be.
That's a bunch of fucking bullshit.
I want to be a microbiologist, why must I take ancient history that demands more time than my genetics class? Why must I take communications when I want to work in a lab? To be a 'well rounded' student? You know what 'well rounded-ness' creates? sheep. It creates mediocre people who wish they could do something better with their lives. We're not going to be great at everything, so why can't we allow people in the education field to truly specialize? Why must students get so burnt out before they even come close to doing what they want to? Honestly, everything should just be field work and trade schools. If we know that most people learn by visuals and hands on learning, why do we demand such rigor in textbooks and multiple choice questions?  

How about instead of me spending 5 years on a degree that is general, I go to a school where I work hands on in a lab, truly only focus on things that I will utilize, so this way when I leave i'll actually be qualified for a job. This kind of shit breeds poor work ethics. Those that are good at taking tests can become lazy to just skate by, get a job that someone who's bad at test taking wouldn't get, only to lack the knowledge and understanding that job demands. This shit is unacceptable. The US sits here whining and complaining why we're so behind, it's because we stamp on those who know what they want to be by leveling the playing field for everyone. It's cute how many people get pissed off about communism while living in a communism education system that is funded by capitalism. 

Gah, sorry about the rant. I wish I never went to college by an academic standpoint, but i've completely grown into a person I love because of it so i'm not pissed at college, just what it actually is about. College is what you make of it, but if you're not good at bullshitting the system and genuinely love to learn, you'll kill that part of yourself to be successful in college, or drown trying to save your love for learning.

Ever since, it's been the elephant in the room. It's not to be discussed, I'm not asked about dating, and anything remotely homosexual that pops up on tv is immediately changed.

I have a boyfriend, who has come to visit and has met my whole family. Everyone likes him. But she's realized we're more than ""just friends"". She apparently freaked out a little. But hasn't approached me or said anything. When I have him over to visit (which is very rare), I inform her so that she's not taken by surprise.

I took a class with her so she wouldn't be alone with a professor who I knew was a great instructor. I referred her to my science professor who happens to be one of the best on campus. 

But then I realize exactly how she expects to get through college. We have a test in class, so I make a sufficient amount of notecards to study. I study them and know them like the back of my hand. She wants me to give her my study cards, she looks at them 20 minutes before class, then gets pissed off at me for getting an A while she pulls a C. She pays more attention to her phone than the surrounding world, pays attention to facebook more than the surrounding world, then wonders why she has no real connections with people.

Just today we had a medical term test that had over a hundred conversions and medical terminology that we are supposed to know. If you get all of the answers right the first test, then you don't have to take  it the other two times later in the semester. Of course, I am going to study hard and attempt to get a hundred so I can save my self from two more tests. She comes to my house before class and sits on my couch with her phone two inches from her fucking face while I am studying. I got fed up and started forcing her to study. She kept sighing and getting annoyed and I told her, ""You fail this fucking class, I will not retake it with you."" So for an hour, we study back and forth learning these note cards. I had studied the night before so this was a refresher, but for her, this was the first time seeing any of it. We've had a week to study these terms. Still, she kept putting her phone in her face and I'm thinking. 'Seriously? you're gonna come into my house and sit there and ignore me cause your texting all of these people who could care less about you?""

Fast forward to class, we take this test. I feel confidant in myself but she says ""I think I missed four."" I just nod and take notes. Periodically she keeps checking her phone, and I roll my eyes knowing that she'll be asking me wtf we are doing since she wasn't paying attention.

A few hours later, she's at her house and I'm at mine. I check my grade to see a 102/100. (where the extra two points came from, idk). I tell her the grades are up and she asks me for mine, and I say ""Just go check yours."" She got a 92/100, which is good but sadly it doesn't exempt her from the other two tests. I tell her how good it was and that the study session I put her through was actually beneficial. She again asks for mine, and I tell her. And she has nothing nice to say. Literally, nothing good to say to me. That annoyed me more than I can even express. She acts like a brat cause she failed to get her 100. I work my ass off to get great grades, it isn't my fault she thinks texting and facebook is whats gonna make or break her life.

She thinks getting a few likes on her FB status is more worthy than getting a letter saying she's on the Deans List. 

After all I do for her, she has the nerve to accuse me of being petty when I finally have had enough. Like I am the one who needs her friendship, haha, yeah right. I told her that without me she would be working a dead end job with nothing to show for her life. She has this idea that we're still in highschool. You just breeze on through while trying to gain enough friends to make you popular or at least 'cool' enough to be recognized. College is the difference between having a career and being a pregnant trailer park mess. 

The best part is that she is talking to this guy online. If you ask me, I'd tell you he is a serial killer, but ask her and she'll say they're meant to be together. Has never met the guy. Never talked to him other than via IMs or emails but acts as if he is gotta ask her to marry him. Stays up late talking to him then complains cause she's tired at work the next day. Doesn't study cause she rather talk to this weirdo. Am I the only one who thinks she's a 20 year old set on being 16 her entire life?????

Then tonight while she rambles on with this douche about his issues, she makes the mistake of lying to me and telling me she is going to bed. Firstly, I know when your online, I am not stupid. Secondly, I was trying to talk to her about something important and she says Oh I'm going to bed, talk about it tomorrow. When I know she is still talking to douche. As if I wasn't irritated already, she just added some fuel to it. Fuck you. I refuse to carry a bag of useless weight if she won't grow the fuck up and take responsibility for her fucking future. 

So tomorrow when she goes to IM me and wants to discuss, I'm gonna unleash my fury. Sometimes I get tired of having no one to help me when I am need when all I do is use my energy to help them. 

Fucking. Over. It.

I've been there, my husband died when he was 22, it hurts and you do your best to get through everything. Everyone deals with things in their own way and time. Celebrating someones life instead of mourning their death is perfectly acceptable! Just because you mourned one way doesn't mean its the only way to do it! Every one and every situation is different.

Everyone needs to grow the fuck up and learn that there are times that all you need to do is be supportive to other people when they need it. Its not always about you. This grieving family isn't going to change their mourning process because you think they are doing it wrong. All that is going to do is upset them even more when they already have enough going on.

Both sides spend more time pointing fingers at each other and trying to discredit one another than do any actual work. ""this study proves your wrong"" ""well this new study proves that your study is wrong"" They even fight within themselves and form even more specific subreddits because even they can't agree with their own side. 

This r/againstmensrights thing is the final nail in the coffin. We now have an entire subreddit with the sole purpose to discredit another. Everyone stop it now. I know what you're thinking, ""but they started it"" or ""they're worse and more extremist than us."" It doesn't matter what they do, all that matters is what you do. There are just too many assholes on all sides to make any of it worth while. 

The thing that everyone needs to realize is that all the genders get screwed. ""we get raped by men"" ""well we get false accused of rape by women and thrown in jail"". This isn't a contest. All groups have good points, all make good arguments, and each have important issues that our culture should address. Then someone feels the need to terrorize or attack the other and it goes in the drain.

I'm so sick of my cousin and her brattiness. I want to slap her so hard it'll bring tears to her eyes, and when she finally looks at me and understands that i can cause her pain like her mom never does because she's a fucking pansy perfectionist who thinks her bratty-ass daughter is a perfect fucking princess. 

This entitled, selfish, bratty fucking girl, and i have to deal with her. I am so sick of her shit and her twatty behavior. I wish her parents would FUCKING DO SOMETHING other than a tap on the wrist and candy as a prize, but for fuck's sake, they're for one, never home long enough to see her be a fucking twat because they both work long hours, and for another, the father is too nice and the mother is just as self-entitled, self-absorbed, and thinks her daughter is a perfect fucking princess. 

I don't even know why the fuck they decided that HER ROOM would be a good fucking location for the internet to be in, but they've set it up there. My cousin will go and flick the switch to the fucking powerstrip BECAUSE SHE'S MAD. Doesn't even matter WHO she's mad at, she'll do it. And SHE honestly has no right to be mad at anybody, because someone will be telling her what the FUCK she did wrong, and explaining to her the bad behaviors she exhibits. Then she'll get fucking pissed, stomp her feet, scream, stomp her way to her room, shut the door, and rage, then fucking flick off the internet.

What a fucking twat. 

She'll pick at and complain about her food, she'll chew with her mouth open, she'll laugh while she's chewing (her laugh isn't adorable, either... Some high-pitched child-scream kind of feel), stick out her tongue because i told her she can't have desserts before she finished her food, get mad at our grandmother for feeding her the wrong things when SHE'S NOT EVEN EATING HER OWN FOOD, get angry at someone for telling her to stop and behave, fucking get up from the table, go watch tv, go to her room to dick around, get her little sister to get up from the table and run around the house, and sometimes do it just to piss people off. And that's just barely scratching the surface of things.

I want to get a nice, long, supple, durable switch and hit her so hard she'll get red, swollen welts that burn to the touch. I want her to cry and run to her grandmother in fear of me. I want her to know that when i raise my voice i fucking mean business and if she continues her twatty behavior, she will face that pain again. I fucking want. To slap her so hard, it will leave a mark for her mom to see. Because her mom's just as much of a twat as her fucking daughter, and just doesn't give a shit about her daughter's behavior, and gets fucking pissed when people get mad at her daughter about her poor behavior. 

I swear, the only thing her mother yells at her is for having attitude, and that's just the beginning of this brat's fucking problems.

But i can't. I can't do it, because she's not my daughter and i can't do it because her mom would lose shit, not at me, but at my grandmother. Fucking fuck. I want to seriously slap the shit out of this twatty ass of a girl, but i can't. 

The worst part is, everyone, and i mean EVERYONE coddles her and lets her do what the fuck ever. What the hell. People shouldn't do that. It's like i'm the only person getting exasperated at her bad fucking manners and her shitty attitude. And then when i get angry and yell, my grandma tells ME to shut the hell up because it's loud, and just let it go, they're children.

Max (my 9 month old) is a baby, developing his fine motor skills. He's been shaking his head ""no"". We were over there the other day and he began doing this. She gasps and goes ""Why's he doing that? You don't think he has autism or something, do you?""

He does not have autism.

My husband (her son) actually asked her if she was stupid.

This is the kind of shit I have to deal with all the time. I'm seriously considering crushing zoloft into her food when she's not looking. 

We found a newspaper article about how drowning doesn't look like drowning. She had written me and my husbands names with an arrow pointed to the article on it. My husband looked at me and rolled his eyes.

She's told us 4 times in 2 days to not let Jude (our 3 year old) swim in the pool alone/ watch and make sure he doesn't get in. (It's outside, in the back yard, locked and covered). Because we're totally irresponsible, right? (If you saw their house layout, you'd understand why this is so ridiculous, and why she thinks she'd have to remind us to watch our 3 year old and make sure he doesn't go drown).

She fucking INSISTS on feeding Max all sorts of shit, thinking he must be starving. She will more or less fight me over wanting to give him an ENTIRE CONTAINER of yogurt! I already gave him a full plate of dinner AND a boob (nursing)! She needs to shut the fuck UP! I told her his tummy is the size of his fist, she can't keep over feeding him with shit like that. (Not that yogurt is bad, but he doesn't need all of this food she's giving him.)

And the one thing that's really been pissing me off is how, if Jude doesn't want to eat his dinner (and I KNOW he's hungry because he doesn't eat all fucking day!), she'll offer him FRUIT SNACKS and JELL-O or PUDDING. Then I'll say ""Well he can have it after he eats dinner."" BUT SHE JUST OPENS IT UP AND GIVES IT TO HIM ""Well he's hungry and doesn't want to eat that!""

She's constantly sending me E-Mails about the newest news scare she's read about. ""Egg Yolks are as bad as cigarettes!"" ""Don't use black henna on the baby!"" (Wtf? Why would I?) ""Don't let Jude eat raisins!"" (He's almost 4, he can eat fucking raisins.) ""

OH MY GOD. I want to SHOVE HER DOWN THE STAIRS.

But the icing on the cake was this: 

She asked my husband in private if I BEAT JUDE. Because he didn't want to go home. He wanted to stay and play on the swingset there. He's 3, of COURSE he's going to throw a fit when having to ditch the swings!

I almost called her up and tore her a new one. No fucking way. I can get snippy at him, sure, but how dare she say such a thing. I would never do such a thing and I've never hinted at such a personality.

Fuck. I don't even know what to do. I love her, she's my mother in law. She's genuinely nice, so it's not like I can call her a cunt and throw a fit about this stuff. But come ON. What in the fuuuuck! And what I've mentioned before is just the tip of the iceberg. 

I've just started being passive aggressive about it. Almost, sarcastic and rude. I can't handle this crap. And it makes me almost sad that I'm going to deal with this forever, since she's my MIL.

So yah, I'm pissed. What about it? I've put up with a number of months of unsuccessful dating and I've had enough. I know that venting to internet wont help anything, it's like screaming at a rock for being lazy. But you know what? I'm still gonna do it! Because if it makes me feel just that little bit better, it's worth it.

Where should I start? Online or offline? There's so much to say it's hard to decide. How about offline dating, it seems like the slowest gazelle in this stampede. Such a waste of time. Unless you are one of the many sheep out there who are simply looking for another warm body to occupy the space near you as you snore away a few hours after wheezing on top of each other, you will not find anyone worth a damn in a bar. And even if that's all you're looking for you're still rolling the dice. Big, nasty, VD-laden dice. In my recent delving I've dredged up more 'married' women, prostitutes and actual psychotics than I've met in the rest of my normal waking life.

This is what I can't stand the most. I see a girl, she came into the bar alone and she sits there watching the band with feigned interest. Her eyes dart around the bar occasionally; I can tell she's looking for attention. I buy her a drink and we begin to talk. She's got an alright job, lots of hobbies, a good house. Sounds like a good girl with things going on in her head, and I'm excited. The second drink is bought and as though summoned by accepting whatever shit specialty beer she's given, her husband enters the conversation with a throbbing vengeance: ""My husband does this, that and the other thing. And he's such a great guy""

He certainly must be to put up with your two-timing ass. He must also be a no-esteem rube to think you're being saintly on your weekly trips to the local dick-corral. That nice place you have? The time you have to build and enjoy your hobbies? That house you love so much? It's not paid for by your cashier job at WagaBag. Its probably paid for by your husband who is at home blissfully unaware that you're trolling for dick to tickle that old village well of a vagina you own.

I know some of you (womenfolk) out there are shaking their heads and saying ""she's only saying that to you because she's not interested."" Good for her. I had the same excuse presented to me by a couple friends of mine. The strange thing was that with all of them, their next little nugget of information was that ""women appreciate honesty"". Really now? That pans out in neither of the scenarios that end with these girls talking about their 'husbands'. Lets say that the girl isn't married and is just using a made up husband to scare me away. Why? If you 'valued honesty' like my girl friends say, you would tell me you weren't interested in some way that doesn't make me question your fundamental values. Men like straightforward, concrete answers. Variables make us uneasy.

But then let's say she's actually married. She's not wearing her ring. None of them have been wearing a ring so far. ""Honesty""? So she's just here to get free drinks. You know what? Fuck you. You have a husband at home that (hopefully) works his ass off to provide for you and whatever cunt-spawn you've hurled out into this world before he met you. If you're so unhappy and feel so unloved that you need to go out and mislead others into giving you attention, you've got problems to work through. Don't involve me and waste my beer money.

What are you here for married girl? You want attention? Your husband tired of your fat, tired ass? Fuck you. Try harder.

How about that online dating? Oh that's about as fun as a bag half full of used razors and herpes scars. Here's where the double standard really rears its ugly fucking head. One thing I've seen more often than not is girls who describe themselves as BBW's that are only interested in young, fit guys. How does that work? If the genders were reversed, it'd be like a pimply 30 year old who's never ingested a liquid without corn syrup living in his mom's basement only dating swimsuit models. But for some reason this kind of ""I want something overly specific no matter what reality says"" attitude is something girls can get away with. It starts when they are kids, and gets worse from that point on in my opinion.

Another example. I've worked with a number of girls who have that ""queen bitch"" attitude. They take pride in their bitchiness. They have a number of T-shirts between them that sport such stirring anthems as ""Super Bitch"" and ""Look out, Bitch coming through!"" How would that roll if a man were to have a similar shirt? I highly doubt a man could get two steps in the door with a shirt that said ""Complete Asshole"" in big bold letters on the front. Or maybe ""Doesn't pay child support""? What about that one? Nope? Didn't think so. Noone thinks such an attitude is endearing in a man. Why should we with women?

First off, I never hear back from anyone. At all, ever. I know I'm nothing special, but really? I've gotten responses from three people. That's not three people on one site, that's three people over every site I've signed on. I mean, that's not including gay or bi men, but still. One of those three? Still the most curteous girl yet. Told me that she was glad to hear from me, however she doesn't date bi men. I wanted to give her a medal and a donkey.

Like I said, I'm nothing special to look at, but at the same time I'm not sending out messages like ""hur, you're hawt. I wanna put mah weiner in your bun"". I've spent time looking through profiles, finding interesting things to bring up and talk about. You say on your page you want someone interesting to talk to? I'm doing it. I can even see when you check out my profile and then nothing. Did I write my profile wrong? Do I have bad grammar? Is there an ethereal serpent latched around my neck that only you can see? I don't know. I can't fucking know because you don't tell me.

What about those good old lines I see so often on girls pages? There's that whole ""only dates fit men"" girl that's the size of two touring buses of course. How about this one: ""I want to be treated with respect"" in the same paragraph as ""I only date black men"". Hate to get all racist on your ass, but you can't have both in most cases. I'm white yes, but I grew up as a minority in the south. I know what black men think of white women because I grew up deep inside that culture. Most black men date white women because they put up with bullshit better than black women. A black woman would slap the shit out of a black man for the kinds of shit I hear from my mixed race neighbors.

You can't have it both ways. That's got to be the first thing I teach any daughter I have. I see too many girls online that are ""highly opinionated"" and yet they ""want to be treated like a princess"". Guess what sweety!? Princesses had posh lives but their voice meant jack and shit. And jack left town. You can be a princess in my house, but don't expect me to care if you whine when I act like a king.

""If your profile picture is just a dick, don't waste my time"". Really? You're on a fucking site for and about sex! Not only should you expect dicks to fly at you with a mouse-click, you have a filter function that can block out all the nasty pictures. Fuck you for not being informed and proactive and subsequently placing the responsibility on me.

But on that subject, what about those girls with the overly specific wants and needs? ""Only wants a white male between the heights of 5'8"" and 5'9"", must be able to juggle two pins and a chainsaw at once""... why? can't get off with a three pin juggler? Fuck you. You know what? You'll never be happy because you are looking for exactly the same thing that let you down before and led you back to dating online. Eat that and love the taste of it.

""I want to be pampered and taken care of by a loving man""... How would you react if a man posted on his page ""You will make me sandwiches on the hour and suck my dick every time I fart""? Probably wouldn't be appealing. Take a fucking hint. Men aren't free tickets to the easy life. But if you find yourself with one of those men, you best damn appreciate it. He'll turn on your ass like a fucking PCP cobra.

So in conclusion, there is no conclusion. Dating sucks ass and I'm tired of it. I should just be like all the other dumb hicks out there and not expect much from people. But even then I've not met anyone I would trust in my house even for a fire inspection. Hope you bastards have a grand damn life.

I've double checked with the faculty and its perfectly fine to play as long as I use headphones. And im in an area of the library that allows talking, music, etc. So I start playing.

""Haha bet he has no friends""

Many times you'd hear on some kind of article of someone raping, and/or killing someone. The people in the comments usually want some kind of revenge and death penalty against these people. These people usually came from abuse, over-coddling families who caused them to go ape shit on everyone. These people usually have some kind of personality disorder, like ASPD (sociopathy) and NPD(narcissistic personality disorder). These people lack regard for human life and empathy, but they don't just end up like that out of no where. Bipolar, schizophrenia, and depression are caused by a chemical imbalance. There's not enough attention and studies towards mental health, and people actually trying to cure mental illnesses. Instead, the media and people have very inaccurate portrayal of mental illnesses and sub-par studies that caused lots of misconception and bad judgement. I'm not saying rapist and killers shouldn't have some kind of punishment. I know what they did wrong, and not saying they should get away with it. It just drives me nuts that people still THESE days in 2013 think the best way to deal with these people, is execution. I feel like we're no better for killing someone who killed other people, especially if they were already brought up in abusive environments and possibly raped themselves. The cycle of abuse and sociopaths just keep going on. Instead of finding kind of cure, or ways to prevent these disorders, it would be a lot better. I don't know anymore than psychologist do, but I do think there could be a better approach to these disorders. Prevention is better than trying to find a cure in my opinion.

Last year, you and my boyfriend, who also lives with us, talked about starting a CSA (community supported agriculture) on the property we are living on.

ALSO, you barely do a fucking thing to help around the house.  You don't sweep or mop EVER.  You empty the dishwasher maybe twice a month if that.  You NEVER offer to fill our water jugs which you benefit from.  You don't fucking clean up shit that you spill on the kitchen counter.

Oh and you also want to grow weed outdoors even though the landlord made it clear that that was not okay. You even said, ""I'm just going to do it anyway"" with absolutely no regard for how my boyfriend and I would feel about it.  What a fucking self-entitled brat you are.

OH LET'S NOT FORGET... Our landlord is nice enough to give us some of her family's goose eggs every week and we only get about 6 at a time.  These eggs are equivalent to about three chicken eggs.  You once told me I shouldn't be eating four chicken eggs in one day because of cholesterol yet I saw you eat TWO LARGE GOOSE EGGS AT ONCE.   HOW IS YOUR CHOLESTEROL DOING, ASSHOLE?

He recently got into a car wreck that totaled his car. It was his own damn fault for driving under the influence. This was not his first DUI either. He lives at home with his mother and is sucking off the government's tit by collecting food stamps. 

He's a college-educated guy with his substitute teacher certifications. He gets offers to sub all the time, but he refuses to do most of them because they're not ""interesting or stimulating"" subjects. It pisses me off to no degree. He could be making $100/day, living on his own (he complains ALL the time that he lives with his mom), and getting his shit together. Instead, he will take MAYBE one sub job per week and spends the money on pot. 

I have no problem with ANYONE smoking weed. I, myself, indulge on the sweet wacky tabacky occasionally. But, I'm not on food stamps, and I hold a steady job that is also uninteresting or stimulating. 

We both have the exact same degree, but from different colleges. Unfortunately, what we have studied is a difficult field to enter. It sucks to spend so much money on tuition in an area that is extremely competitive, but that's not an excuse to keep someone from being a contributing member to society. 

The nail in the coffin was when he complained about welfare distribution. He believes that he deserves more government hand-outs. I, on the other hand, believe that he doesn't even deserve his food stamps, because he is blatantly not even trying.

When I pointed out how fucked up it was that I have to pay for his food stamps with my taxes, he bowled me over with arguments as to why he needs them. Since, he lives with his mom, why does he need money for food? Why can't he use his $100/day to help his mom with the cost of living, or save up to improve his life?

He complains all the time that he is single and lonely. When I pointed out to him that women usually like men his age living on their own and taking care of themselves like a normal adult, he wrote it off saying that all women are golddiggers.

She was cute and we had good chemistry so despite the age difference, I asked her out (I might have also asked her for my 19 year old self who was King of the FriendZone back then). I knew the age difference would bother her parents, but I felt if they met me and got to know me, they wouldn't mind. So, 2 weeks of dating, there's a message on my parents' answering me from her stepdad (a Washington DC police detective) about how I had been ""sneaking around with his daughter"". We had just gone on a date to Applebee's on a Friday at 8 pm. That's hardly ""sneaking"", but whatever. He then proceeded to chew me out on 1) how a 36 year old man should have absolutely no business sitting with a 19 year old girl who he wasn't related to at Applebee's and 2) in his year's on the job in DC, he's seen what happens to young girls that get involved with older men.
He then told me to lose her number and don't contact her anymore. I end the relationship although we still have class together for a month. She then starts dating a couple weeks later a new guy who's more age appropriate (22), her parents meet him and approve, even letting her stay overnight at his place.

I'm on probation for a DUI back in September, but I haven't drank since the night I got arrested 5 months ago.

I can't understand how they did everything they could to break her and me up, perceiving me as a threat, but then let the new bf continue dating her when he's doing something that would be a danger to her (coke). Her stepdad never saw anything bad happen to a girl on coke? As a cop? IN DC? Fuck me sideways.

Today, in Great Britain, gay marriage has been legalised; however, a church has a choice on whether to allow gay couples to marry based on their beliefs. I have heard many people firing shots and saying that churches should be forced to marry gay couples (whether they want to or not).

It's not crossed people's minds that religious beliefs should be respected, no matter how much we disagree with them and how ""backwards"" they seem to us. If a church does not agree with gay marriage then that's they're prerogative; it's common knowledge that, no matter what the bible says, religion has never been hot on homosexuality. If you're not going to force gays just to get a civil partnership then you can't force churches to marry gay couples. Would you force a Muslim to eat pork? Of course not, even though many of us would view that as a backwards and irrelevant to modern life. 

I realise that the churches view is a bit more repressive, but it's not as if they're lynching them. They're merely upholding the traditions of their religion and many of them probably aren't homophobic, they just believe that marriage is highly religious (which it is) and should be between a man and a woman. There is a difference; they're not saying you can't be together, just that they don't feel marriage is appropriate. 

There will always be some churches who will marry gay people, which is great, but don't force all to if they don't want to. Gay rights should take no presidence over religious ones and I feel as if we forget that religious people do have rights to free speech, as long as they don't harm anyone.   

tl;dr - Some churches, surprise surprise, do not want to marry gay couples. Don't force them to. Religious rights should be respected. ",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_17ynyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/17ynyy/gay_marriage_and_respecting_religion/,

Now, you can attack these people for what the believe, OR you can shut the fuck up! 

Seriously, as an atheist it bothers me to no end when I see (usually younger) atheists desecrating religious property, insulting religious people publicly, and shoving their beliefs down people's throats.

You don't believe in a god and you have an understanding of science/evolution? That's great, that doesn't make you better than anyone and it certainly doesn't give you the right to be a hypocrite. You can't hate on a group for spreading the word of their beliefs and then scream ""THERE IS NO GOD!"" like a moron.

If you don't believe in a god, shut your mouth and wait for this whole 'religion' thing to blow over. Don't argue and validate their stance. 

Keep calm and carry on!

Edit - I won't alter my post, but I do agree that you shouldn't 'shut your mouth and wait'. I phrased it poorly, but all I'm getting at is you can't fight violence and hate with violence and hate. Don't be aggressive or hostile. I'm not saying all atheists are and that it's an issue for a lot of us to think about. I'm just saying that there are a great number of atheists that take it too far and they give us a bad name. I understand you're bound to get that with any large group of people, but if you're smart enough to see through religion, be smart enough to know it's not a fight.

Edit 2 - Just so it's made clear, I'm not only referring to r/atheism. I've seen people do it in real life, I've seen vandalizing done to religious property and it doesn't help.

I know a year from now I'll be gone and in college, so I should just continue to bear it. Its just getting more and more difficult. I'm seventeen (the second youngest), the first of six children to be going to a university. mom and dad didnt go, either. 


My family is in a financial hole. I like with my disabled mom in a 700 sqft house in downtown. I have a little brother who is two years younger than me, and all he does is lie and steal and smoke pot. My father works as a taxi driver in another state and sends as much money as he can, but its never enough, We have to survive off of canned food and pasta when the end of the month comes. 


At the moment, my moms bank account is overdrawn by a hundred or so dollars. Bills still need to paid. My brother sometimes sneaks my moms debit card and buys things with it without her knowing. 
I haven't been able to go out with my friends in a long time. We dont even have a car and my friends all live uptown (Im in a magnet program so I dont go to my zoned high school).
Its difficult trying to take care of my mother and balance my school work, as is. I wish I could get a job, but i live in an area where its hard to go anywhere without a vehicle. The bus system sucks, and I dont even have enough money to ride the bus! 


Its like my mothers given up too, she just doesnt do anything for herself any more. She watches television, eats and waits to die. Its the saddest thing because I love her and can't stand seeing her like this. In fact, the only reason she still lives here is so I can graduate from my program. Then she's moving back to my dad.
The money issue causes us to fight often too. We yell at each other a lot because she thinks I have an attitude. But she doesn't reprimand my brother who's a druggie, goes out and doesn't come home until late at night. Its just not fair.


I like to paint and draw, and I'm fairly good at it, I use it as a way to distract myself from outside negativity. But its at a point where I can't even afford to buy my own supplies...
I'm just ranting because Christmas is on its way and I couldn't possibly be any more depressed. Granted, we don't celebrate christmas in my family. But still, I cant help but feel upset when constantly being bombarded by people raving about their holiday plans and the presents theyre receiving.

I've lived here almost exactly a month and I'm seriously going INSANE. I don't know how 3 people can be so fucking stupid. They're all friends and I'm the random one in the apartment. To make me feel better, here's a list of the shit they do on a daily basis that pisses me the fuck off:

* They leave the dishwasher hanging open. Just fucking hanging wide open with the lower rack pulled out. ALL THE GODDAMN TIME! Why the fuck would ANYONE do this? It gets in the way and our kitchen is fucking tiny as it is. I have to fucking shut it 95% of the time I go into the kitchen.
* They don't know how to load a fucking dishwasher. They're 19/20 years old. Can't. Load. A. Dishwasher. I heard one of them ask another ""Do the plates go on top?"" earlier this semester. REALLY? ARE YOU FUCKING MENTALLY CHALLENGED OR SOMETHING? And you know what? They do put plates on top.
* They either don't start the dishwasher when it's full or they run it when it's half full and there are dirty dishes in the sink. Just what the fuck?
* Someone has this stupid fucking clothes rack thing in the tiny ass laundry room that you have to move out of the room to access the washer and dryer. And there are a lot of empty boxes on the single shelf in that room. I was lucky to be able to fit my laundry detergent up there.
* I guess they're all fucking deaf because they always turn the TV up ALL THE FUCKING WAY. And they leave it on ALL THE TIME IF YOU AREN'T WATCHING IT FUCKING TURN IT OFF HOW HARD IS THAT? Jesus Christ I'm always having to turn it off when I get back from class or want to sleep or study.
* They pile up trash behind the door. I don't mind if the kitchen trash is full and you move the bag by the door and plan to take it out on the way to your next class. But they stack bags and bags and random other shit trash behind the door so you can't even fucking open it all the way and leave it there for a week.
* They take their shoes off RIGHT inside the door so they're in the way when you walk in. I keep kicking them out of my fucking way and they don't seem to get the hint. Don't put your shit in everyone else's way. They don't understand this concept whatsoever.
* They leave trash and dirty dishes all over the kitchen.
* One of their boyfriends wears too much goddamn cat piss (Axe) and the apartment reeks of it when he's over. I haven't determined which boyfriend it is yet.
* One of them came to my room once to ask me a question. She said that she was trying to cook some chicken in the oven, and she turned it to 350˚F and the light came on for a while but then it went off, and when she opens it the light will come on but it'll go off again a bit after she closes it.

* There are 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The bathroom is split - the toilet and shower are in a sectioned off area separate from the area with the vanity and mirror. There are 2 sinks, each with a cabinet under the sink and there are 2 drawers in the middle. Makes it easy to divide the space evenly, right? Wrong. My roommate keeps putting shit on my side and I keep moving it back. And I found a bottle of some moisturizer I had near my sink IN my sink earlier. I know I didn't knock it into my sink. Don't fucking touch my shit you ape.
* Whenever I walk into the living room and one (or all) of them are out there, I will give them a friendly hello/how are you. They completely and utterly ignore me. I have tried being nice to them for the month we've lived together, making small talk with them and whatnot. They just ignore me. Maybe I'm just intimidating. I don't know or care anymore. Fuck 'em.
* There was a problem with the air conditioning but it's pretty much resolved itself thanks to the cooler temperatures. One of my roommates is too stupid to know how to close the vents in her room though and had to get her boyfriend to do it for her.

Those are the main things I can think of right now. Last week I picked up a room change petition and found out there was an empty 2 bedroom apartment available.

Receiving a positive karma score means that your content was well received by others and/or you contributed something of value to a conversation. Much like in a real conversation, when you contribute something of value you'll get a smile, a laugh or even a rebuttal. On Reddit, you receive an upvote which is feedback from another person on your input.

Saying that upvotes and downvotes don't matter is like stating you don't care what people think about you. You do. You might act like you don't care but you feel good inside when someone compliments you and it certainly doesn't feel good to receive criticism.

Ladies, don't let a guy you're not interested in guilt you into doing something you don't want to do. Be honest with them. That's it. Don't worry about hurting their feelings. They WILL get over it. 

I dated a guy for over 2 years who was always the ""friend zone"" guy. He got rejected ALL the time. We were friends for a few months at first. I thought he was a nice guy so we started dating. I was his first serious girlfriend. He always told me how lucky he was to be with me. And after 2 years I found out he had been cheating on me the entire time. I guess the confidence he got from dating me really went to his head. **That ""diamond in the rough"" isn't always a diamond.**

Another example: I had a guy try to ""friend zone"" me. We started hanging out and drunkenly hooked up a couple of times. He said he wasn't looking for anything serious (I was) and that we could just be friends. Fine with me. We still hung out occasionally. Then one night he tried to hook up with me again. I said no, because ""We're just friends, right? Also I've started hanging out with this other guy..."" Guess what? Suddenly he didn't want to hang out anymore! Weird, right?
**""Friend zone"" guys just want things THEIR way on their own terms. They don't care about what you want!**

Phew! Glad I got this off my chest. I swear I'm not bitter! (the new guy I started hanging out with is now my boyfriend and we've been together for over a year).

I am exhausted.

Oh, he can't take the kids this weekend? Again? Ok. I was going to catch up on sleep and laundry and cry and scream in a place where they wouldn't see it, guess I can still do some of that. He deserves to go hunting. Again. Like he has EVERY weekend I've known him. Oh, I mean when he wasn't fishing that is. 

I am such an idiot for believing in him. He would take care of me. He would love me forever. There is no romantic love, it simply doesn't exist. There's lust and when that's over comfort and then resentment.

He worked retail while he got his EMT certification renewed and got tons of extra littler certifications - CPR, AIDS, etc. etc.  

He's been working at the biggest hospital in the state (over an hour away) that gives him no sick time or vacation time, has been screwing him on his differential pay (he works 7pm - 7am saturday - tuesday), and never gives the raises they promise.  He's worked there over a year now and is making the same $10.16 base rate he was hired at (plus up to $2 differential which randomly changes amounts every shift).  He gets no breaks at all during his 12 hour shifts and has spent entire weeks in quarantined rooms which, according to hospital policy and state law, no one is supposed to spend more than 4 hours a week in.  He spends his nights keeping delusional crazy people alive, cleaning up blood and shit, and putting down people who attack him.  He's had 2 tuberculosis scares and a couple broken fingers.

He's been trying desperately to get a job closer to home, or anywhere out of this hospital (which finally admitted nobody was getting raises because they spent the money building a giant jesus statue outside and paying fines for making a profit even though they're a non profit organization).  He FINALLY gets an interview at the hospital down the road for us for a position which, normally, pays $30k - $35k per year.

What do they pay?  $7.58 per hour.  WHAT. THE. FUCK.  Fucking illiterate high school morons get paid more than that at walmart.  They can't even do basic every-day math.

I would be shopping online for trucks and would see a very sweeeeeeeet pick up with everything I wanted, brand new and it would say “internet price” $28,000 or something like that. Something I felt was a very reasonable price. Then you get to the dealer and they say, “oh, that price is based on all possible incentives.” Incentives like what? Military discount, recent college graduate discount, returning customer discount, trade in bonus, friend of the dealer bonus, all kinds of bullcrap. So, basically, no one gets it. But they don’t tell you that until you say that you’re ready to purchase and talk numbers. 

That’s when they call in the finance guy and go, “oh well… you qualify for… lets see… one incentive”. Keep in mind, there aint nothing wrong with my credit. This aint even about the credit part yet, this is just price. That’s when they come out and say, that in reality the truck is $36,000. Now look, seriously, that might actually be a “fair” price. But if you’re going to a place expecting the price to be 8 thousand dollars less, it seems like a bunch of bullcrap, right?

So, I point this out to them and they say, “well, look, the invoice on the truck is $37,000… so that’s how much we have invested in the truck, so really we’re giving you a great deal.” And then the finance guy explained how he’s been in the car business for 15 years and they very often sell cars below invoice, which he asserted means its a loss, and how he doesn’t understand how they even stay in business.

Well #1, clearly the dealership isn’t TRULY invested in the car for the full invoice price, because nobody pays invoice except for the most luxerious models. So don’t give me this crap about how you don’t understand how you stay in business. I understand and you understand. It’s a cash flow business. You make money by taking in cars and then selling them, and then you make money over the long term by having people buy accessories and having their car serviced at your location. Obviously if you sell most of your cars below cost (invoice) then clearly thats not how you make money. and #2, if the invoice on this truck is $37,000 and you can’t possibly sell it for less than what you’re offering me than why in the name of MOTHER FUCKING SATAN are you advertising a price many thousands of dollars lower than that? Someone being a recent college graduate somehow makes it easier for you to lose more money on a car? How does that work?

This is why people find buying cars stressful. You know what the price of a new car is? Its the price you are willing to pay. If you go to a dealer, look at the sticker price of $42,000 and say “whelp, thats fine.” They will sell you that car for $42k, but if someone else hassles them and haggles, they might offer it to them for $3,000 less. Or maybe even lower. Because its a cash flow business. They want to get new inventory and then sell it as quick as possible. That’s why people find it stressful because its hard to know what the “true” price of the car is. They could offer the same thing to someone else for less if the wanted.

Anyway, so I looked at a few cars and decided… maybe I should look at used again…

Edit: Addition. I've actually bought a used car since having this experience at two new car dealers. I should stress, the prices they were offering me were not outragious, but they were many thousands higher than what they were advertising.",,False,,t5_2qn2b,1376670247.0,,,True,t3_1kgcm8,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1kgcm8/have_you_dealt_with_this_internet_price_bullshit/,

I took a class at a community college because it's suppose to be easier than at my school. (Yes, I understand in a way this is my fault- but I'm a journalism major with a required math course. Math isn't my thing.)

This class is an online class. I emailed my professor six times throughout the whole class. Never once did he return one of my emails. 

And then, last week, I receive an email about how final grades are in. I figured hey, maybe mine hasn't been received by him yet. I'll wait and give him until the end of the week. 
NOTHING.

I finally ended up emailing the school saying I still had no final grade or any other grades in my book to even estimate my final grade. They email me back saying HES BEEN OFF THEIR PAYROLL FOR TWO WEEKS NOW. WTF.

How do you let something like that go by? Does nobody check to see if teachers have final grades in?

I am now late applying to the journalism school because I don't have this grade yet- to even have it transferred. 

Needless to say, I'm frustrated with the way things are ran.

It doesnt mean anything to you, and I learned that from you. Marriage means nothing to me and that sucks. I know I wont ever get married, and its the same reason I wont ever have kids.

I've watched him spend five of the twenty bucks he had in his pocket on a sandwich for me because he learned I din't have breakfast that morning, he sat down gave me advice on that extended project even though he was in a big rush; and even though he got straight-A's, he broke down and cried when he learned that I failed, because **he valued my success and well-being above his own.** And when he describes himself, the last word he'd use is ""nice."" If you're gonna be a nice guy, try to actually fucking be a nice guy, and don't be nice to that girl, be nice to motherfucking everyone, because you are seriously missing the point about being a nice guy.

And the friendzone? Give me a fucking break! You know what I do when I get friendzoned? I move on and accept it like a fucking adult would. Because I know that even though I still don't have a girlfriend, I have a few friends. A good friend will be there during your lowest points, make you feel better about yourself en lieu of your family, and listen to your opinions because they find them interesting and not because they have to tolerate you. A girlfriend, in my understanding, should be all that and more to you, while you clearly just see girls as a carnal distraction whose opinions are worth less. Those friends I described, some of them are friends whom I feel attracted to, and while you would blame her for being a heartless bitch (she's pretty much the exact opposite of that), I blame myself for being a coward who can't admit his feelings. By now I've learned to accept it, and I value our friendship more than any potential chance of getting my dick wet.

As for the assholes who get all the girls, there's a perfectly simple explanation. They got swag. You see, what women like in men is confidence and charisma. No matter how much of a dickhead a guy is, if he uses some choice words and is completely sure of himself while saying it, they get all weak-kneed. It happens the other way as well; we lose our fucking minds at the prospect of some tail. But she isn't completely robbed of her rational mind; she knows he's an asshole, while he is not in complete denial of the fact that he is an asshole, so while a relationship may start up, they never last long. And since you are an asshole with no charm who swears up and down he's a good guy, she's able to think with 100% her brain and see you for what you are, and you are fucking poison.

Long story short, you're not actually a nice guy, and you should stop blaming everything from jock culture to feminism, since the fault lies with you. I suggest you take a long, serious look at yourself before you describe yourself as a ""nice guy."" Oh, and lose the fucking Fedora! It actually makes you less sexy, because they're associated with people like you.

I see now that not only is your intelligence beyond the average but your ability to have your head so far up your own ass.  Thanks for choosing to play dota instead of making the hour drive to see me on my birthday. It's not like I make that same drive for you  every week or so amirite?

Fuck me right for spending the better part of two years cooking and cleaning for you in an apartment I didn't live in and then helping you move several days in a row after 8 hour 6 am shift  of work. Thanks for being too busy to help me move  after that.

Sometimes I can't stand the sight of you. I don't know what world you were brought up in, where you think you're entitled to act his way, and think this way, but you need Jesus.

And that’s putting it politely.  More like full-on batshit crazy bitches.  So he phones me last night to tell me he came home from work to find all of his belongings thrown out in the street.  Not because he’s been accused of cheating or anything, but because his girlfriend just decided to do it.  Like “Fuck you! All your shit is out in the street.”  I told him I don’t know how many times not to stick his dick in crazy, but he keeps picking up women in country western bars and shitty rap clubs, so whadaya gonna do? 
 
So I tell him gather up your shit and go sleep at your mom’s place and deal with this in the morning.  Five minutes after hanging up he calls back and says he needs to borrow a ladder because half of his shit was tossed up a tree.  There were *THUNDERSTORMS* out there last night.  Jesus Christ, I’m not hauling out a fuckin ladder and joining him on climbing trees using a highly conductive aluminum ladder.  

So he gathers what he could and sleeps over at his mom’s place.  Then early this morning he calls the police so he can retrieve the rest of his belongings.  The girlfriend is so screaming and violent the police actually TASERED her and arrested her.  My friend decides to abandon the apartment anyway (despite the fact it’s his and he paid for it) because he’s worried she’s going to come back, and instead of going to his mother’s place (because his girlfriend knows where his mom lives) he’s staying with a relative outside of town she hopefully doesn’t know about.

Guess who I get a phone call from today?  Crazy bitch girlfriend says she’s all sorry and shit and wants her man back.  Fuck me, and I’m shitting my pants over the fact this fucked up whackjob has my phone number.  So I tell her don’t call me or I’ll phone the police and don’t come over or I’ll call the police.  The next time I see my friend I gotta tell him his crazy girlfriend got a hold of his call list somehow.  

Meanwhile, you can count on my friend to find himself yet another screw up to call girlfriend.

It was very rainy that day and the bus's emergency exit in the ceiling wasn't shut all the way. The poor girl next to me's knee was soaked. I just kind of turned to her and said ""Well that's shitty"" and we had a nice little chat. She goes to the same school and as a matter of fact our programs are in the same building. Cool. We get off the bus and go our separate ways. 

A few weeks later I see her again on my morning commute. I figure I might as well acknowledge that she exists and say hi. The conversation was awkward and not going anywhere this time, so I just let it die and moved on.

Yesterday, I'm at a party with my former high school friends. Turns out a bunch of them work with the girl from the bus. ""By the way elchriso, never talk to bus girl on the bus again. It's fucking weird OK?""

Well now look here, I understand that you don't just start talking to people on the bus out of nowhere like some sort of fucking neckbeard fedora worshiper. I've got that much down. But every once in a while the context of the situation permits some flexibility with the rules. Due to the leaky ceiling I wasn't just saying ""HI MY NAME IS ELCHRISO DURRRRRR!!!!"" I had an actual reason to talk. The second time maybe the proper thing to do was just pretend we had never met and go back to being strangers for the rest of our lives, but I thought it might be a little neighborly to say hi. Fuck me right?

I am butthurt Reddit. Very butthurt indeed. I thought she seemed pretty cool and an all around decent person, but it seems I was just another weird guy on the bus because I didn't just stick my earbuds in and crank the volume so loud that the guy two seats up can hear the lyrics to the song I'm playing like a good bus patron.

My impression of the title is that it's satirical, and we all know people just scapegoating their shitty habits onto genetics. But I'm so rubbed the wrong way right now because as I speak, my mother, who has been overweight for awhile (and according to her BMI is borderline obese), is at the doctor trying to see if ""a thyroid problem is causing me to keep all this weight despite dieting.""

She claims that because she's ""extremely hungry"" after work, this is the *key issue*. Just because she refuses to eat an apple at 3:00 because she limited the amount/type of food she had for lunch due to her fad diet, she's clearly suffering a medical condition.

I also absolutely don't understand what her perception of ""exercise"" is. We went to a family event with members who had an in-ground pool.

Is this the mentality of larger people?

But if you keep spewing out things to make me feel guilty or trying to make me feel like I am wrong, I might have to start screaming. 

Telling me I am a selfish bitch really only makes me want to move even farther away. I'm not the one being selfish here. In this situation there really isn't much a compromise. Either he moves here or I move there and thing is, I like it over there. A lot. It makes me happy to be in his city and it's got what I like in the feel of terms of living. It makes me happy. Yet you are completely unwilling to put aside your fears or minor insecurities about it. 

You say you will never see your grandchildren and will never see me again. Well two things. One, I plan on visiting the states again once I move to Finland. Two, you could if you didn't absolutely refuse to fly. Or even just take a ship or something over there and go by train. But no, within seconds of the ideas mentioned you shot them down. You said no, it was not going to happen. You weren't going to do it. 

Well then if you see less of me than you want to now, it is your own fault. And don't try and tell me it will be because you don't have enough money. You would have so much more money if you didn't smoke almost a pack a day and buy more cartons every two weeks. Sorry you're easily dropping upwards of $100 to $120 a month on things like that. But you have blatantly refused to quit smoking as well. We have tried to help you out with that by buying you the gum and the patch but you use it for a week, claim it isn't working and give up. You just don't want to quit, which is fine but it's not going to stop me from moving. 

Do not tell me my feelings are wrong and that what I claim I want isn't really what I want. I know myself a thousand times more than you do. You claim you know me but just because I am your daughter does not mean you know me. You have not known me for most of my life and while I appreciate you putting in the effort now, it doesn't change the image you have portrayed of yourself. 

I want to be happy. For most of my life I have been so completely unhappy. Something you never noticed and I had to tell you and then you said it was my fault and that I was making you feel bad so I should stop it (Which by the way, when you say things like that, it only makes me want to move the largest possible distance I can from you). So seriously, for once think about someone else for a change rather than yourself. 

You can be angry and sad and upset about this. Those are normal reactions. But the fact that you would rather I be unhappy where you are rather than me be happy but far away only makes me more determined to be happy far away.

Almost 3 years ago, we were still living with our parents, but then they got fed up with us and asked us to move out. Fair enough. I was going to move out on my own, but my sister begged me to let her find a place with me. At first I refused because my sister didn't make as much money as I did and I was worried she wouldn't be able to pay her share of the rent, but eventually my sister (backed up by my mother) convinced me to find a place with her. So we find a two bedroom basement suite that my sister can afford to pay half the rent, but I wound up paying the entire damage deposit because.. I honestly don't know why. Because I'm a sucker I guess.
Anyway, 3 months in everything is fine, my sister is paying half the rent and life is nice and then BOOM she loses her job. We signed a year lease so I couldn't bail. So I pay FULL rent for about another few months and instead of trying to find a full time job my sister decides to TAKE A ONE YEAR HAIR DRESSING COURSE. My mother thinks this is a great idea and she's so proud of my sister for doing and it and when I flip out about it *I* become the family asshole. Anyways, so my sister takes out a student loan that my mother has to co sign and they tell me she can start paying rent again, but only give me 30% instead of the 50% and because I'm the biggest sucker in the fucking universe I go along with it. So a year goes by of my sister taking this shitty little hair dressing course and when it finally ended last June, lo and behold she barely makes any money doing and still can only afford to pay me 30%.
And you know what? I really wouldn't mind paying the majority of the rent if she gave me some fucking gratitude or respect, but she's a fucking BITCH who steals my food, gets irritated if I ever have the gall to try and talk to her about anything, and talks shit about me to anyone who will listen. It's like living with a high school junior! Have you ever lived with someone who basically ignored you, took for granted all the nice things you do for them and hold you in utter contempt? Someone who constantly tells you they can't afford to contribute, but is going out drinking once or twice every single week? That's my sister in a nutshell.

So I finally have had enough and tell her that once this lease is up I'm on my own and I don't care what happens to her anymore and now guess what? I'm the monster of the family. Apparently 3 years of babysitting my sister isn't enough. My sister had tried to stop paying me anything at all out of spite after I told her I didn't want to live with her anymore, but her name is on the lease too so I threatened to go to small claims court for the FULL 50% and put a stop to that at least. 

Guys I'm just so tired and emotionally worn out from living with her. My decision to move out has brought my mother and father's wrath down on me and they tell me I should look out for my little sister. When I tell them maybe they should let her move back in with them that just simply not an option. WTF?

I'm so damn sick and tired of culture, and the new STUFF that comes out every damn year for us to purchase instead of giving 6 fucking dollars to feed a family of 4!  fuck the capitalistic system.  everyone pursuing his own selfish interests is apparently what makes capitalism work, but why is that best?  because 90% of the world's population are selfish bastards?

what value is there in gold?  what does it do?  it's rare?  SO?  WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO ANYBODY? What REAL VALUE does gold honestly have? throw it away.  melt it all down into one giant, jagged, dirty mass and sink it in the mariana trench. 

All these new ipods and cars and smart tvs and faster food and watches and fucking huge houses and air conditioning and $200 shoes.  *What good is it doing us?  How is this helping mankind?  How does so much focus on these useless gadgets of society provide anything of real value to anyone's life?* What is our final goal as humans?

And what the fuck is the deal with church these days?  Why do my parents hold on to it so hard?  I grew up in the church and now I just think it's a white man's invention to feel better about himself. That's it. The bible is radical.  So radical, I'm really not convinced more than .01% of people believing in it have actually lived it out in the last 100 years.

Is it so hard to take care of the needy and the hungry?  Why do we justify our small contributions to the world's less fortunate just so we can still live comfortably in suburbia?  Mom.  Dad.  I can't bear to watch you or anyone else claim this as a belief system only to see them water it down in front of the very people we are called to help.  We go to central america and build tongue in groove wooden houses for people living in aluminum lean-tos.  And we do it clean under shirts we buy from walmart specifically for the trip.  And we do it only if we can safeguard ourselves against that country's diseases and bugs and bad water.  And we do it with a pearly white teeth we paid thousands of dollars for, and we take smiling pictures with kids there who have rotting molars.  And they smile with us?? Are you kidding me? Do they think we're just lucky, or do they have any idea just how much we're holding back from them, when we have full power to equalize this lopsided world, but instead, outright deny people a life of dignity?

I hate living in the same city as my family.  We have different beliefs and they smother me.  They fucking smother me with love and affection and they have no idea just how far I want to get away.  They think i'm in a mid-20's phase and need a roadtrip for a week before I settle in here in my hometown where every other fucking person i've ever know is and will remain forever.

Except for my brother.  He just had a son, my nephew, and when I move to CO in May, I don't know when I'll see him again.  I will miss my brother and sister in law dearly.  He has been an invaluable source of sanity for me over the last 7 years.  I don't know what I will do without him.  

But the rest of my family.  They are so close knit with each other it's insane.  Their entire lives revolve around each other, and I can't handle the idea of that.  I have to get out.  *I have to get out.*  I have to run, far away.  And if any of them follow, especially mom or dad, I'll just have to keep running.  CO, Cali, AK, swim to russia, walk to nepal.  I don't care.  I have to have my own life.

I have to get away from my ex girlfriend.  Our split was mutual, and needed, and I have no romantic feelings for her anymore.  But she's seeing someone else now, and I can't watch her new life unfold in the same city as me, and bump into her at the grocery store, or mutual friend hangouts.

I can't stand what I see in society anymore.  I want to shake it by its neck.  I feel like ted kaczynski.  I would never hurt anyone.  Ever.  But I feel for that man.  What else are you supposed to when you see the whole world damning itself to a hollow existence?  This is not what it's about.  This country is not god's country.  This country is not what it's about.  We are not some saving grace for the world.  No country is.  

I could rant for hours.  and hours and hours and hours.  I don't know what i'm looking for.  can anyone read my mind?  Can I just drive away and boondock for the rest of my life, at least until people start to love each other some more?   

Mom.  Dad.  I need a holiday. A very long holiday. And I don't expect I shall return.  In fact, I mean not to.

I wanted to play some of the games that I never finished so that I was experiencing something new. I started out with Skyrim, but I decided against it as I had finished a majority of the game. I looked through my game and I stumbled upon Dragon Age: Origins. Awesome! I had bought it a year ago at GameStop and I got halfway through the game and quit, so I booted it up.

The install went perfect and soon the game was up and running. I thought that the DLCs were loaded in, but apparently they were only installed and not actually playable. I got halfway through the game before realizing this (grrr....).  So one night I decide to fix this issue, figuring it would be easy (apparently half the people who got the game edition I did had this issue).

I try all of the solutions they gave. I installed a patch, messed with some of the files within the games, and deleted (I backed them up) my saved games, mods, and settings. Nothing worked. I was pissed at this point. I had installed DA2 the day before along with the DLCs from a pirated version and they had worked fine. I bought this game for $30 and it definitely was not working fine. I literally wasted 6 hours trying to fix this issue one day and another 4 the next day. Eventually, after several attempts to reinstall and uninstall the game, the DLCs magically started to work. I forgave that one because the game was good.

Que me playing DA2. I payed $10 for it and I am glad I only paid that much. I literally finished the game on hard difficulty in 10 hours. The graphics were improved, but that was about it. The game itself sucked. The storyline sucked. The combat system was perhaps the worst I've ever played. It relied way too much on nuking and they completed screwed over any healing capabilities (cool down for heal was 40 seconds I believe). So now I am super pissed, but I have Mass Effect 2 in hopes that EA can rectify their situation with me. Uh, no.

I can't even load Mass Effect 2 properly. It literally gets 1/5 of the way through then crashes. After 3 hours of screwing around with it, I finally get it to ask me for the second disk. Only when I put in the second disc, it doesn't accept it.  My computer recognizes that it is there, but it doesn't work. So I spend another 30 minutes making a .iso file of it. I get it to install with the .iso file finally. Ten minutes later, I finally click on the icon. It pops up with an error about disc authentication. The game finally comes up, only it crashes after (literally) 10 seconds. This repeats for a good 10 minutes.

I finally uninstall it and reinstall it. It works perfect now (thank god) but this ordeal reminds me why EA sucks. I feel screwed over by Ea...

TL;DR: I have had more issues with legally purchased versions of EA's games than I have the pirated versions.

1358064308.0,15,self.rant,16hfi6,Don't talk to me like I'm scum because I call out your kid.,18,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/16hfi6/dont_talk_to_me_like_im_scum_because_i_call_out/,"Ok, so I’m sorry for letting this out here, but… well, fuck it. I needed to.

I’ll set the scenario.

We’re at a BBQ to celebrate the first birthday of a friends little girl. 3 sets of parents. 5 kids. 
I have a little boy, he’s almost 4. The hosts have a 1 yr old and a girl who’s almost 5.

The 3 dads (Me included in the 3) were out the back watching over the kids play in a small paddling pool. 
We were a bit of a team, watching over all the kids and calling them out if they did something naughty or dangerous. It’s what parents do.

The 3 mothers where inside doing whatever the hell mothers do without kids (Possible orgy, I don’t fucking give a shit at this point)

Right. So while the 3 of us were talking outside, I noticed the hosts 1 yr old trying to shove rocks down her throat (It’s what kids try and do I guess) I called out, bent down and got them out of her mouth and told her “No.”. 

Pretty straight fucking forward, no harm done, crisis averted. The father thanked me and we all had a laugh about the “good catch”.

About 5 minutes later my son was splashing a bit hard and the host called him on it and told him not to splash – once again, no harm done and any potential crisis averted. Over the course of the “Overwatch shift” All 3 of us called out any of the kids if they were doing something that was venturing in the “Naughty or dangerous” zone. 

Once again about 5 minutes later the host’s daughter (The 5 yr old) was throwing these plastic balls at my sons head – with a bit of force. I called her out and told her not to throw so hard. I didn’t tell her off, I actually just asked if she could be a bit more gentle. She proceeded to give me the foulest look, and I just glared back at her until she finally grumbled “I got it”. I smiled and said thanks and she went back to playing and I thought that was it.  

Her mother happened to be outside taking photos when it happened and really fucking rudely told me –

“Greenmash, Your son has done plenty of things wrong I could have told him off for, but I didn’t. So don’t you dare tell my daughter off. If you have a problem with her talk to her father (Who was one of the 3 guys) and he’ll tell her off” she then proceeded to spin and storm away.


So I was a little gobsmacked. I turned around and looked at her husband and he was equally as fucking baffled. He apologized to me and told me he was so embarrassed and ran inside to talk to her about it. 
I looked at the other father out there and his response was “You did nothing wrong mate, If that was my wife I would’ve fucking headbutted her for that”


So this is why I’m a little pissed. 
Your 1 yr old was half way from choking on fucking rocks about 10 minutes ago. Would you rather I just turn around and tell the father instead of fixing the issue? I can assure you by the time I mentioned it she would have been gasping for air. 

How fucking dare you talk to me like I’m the scum of the fucking earth. I called your daughter on being a little brat and you get in my face? If my son had done something that warranted a talking to, and you’ve seen it, fucking say something. Don’t just whinge about it to me an hour fucking later. Either practice what you fucking preach and tell me immediately so I can act on it, or do it yourself.

I think I’m just rattled because the way I see it (As does my wife and the other guys) I did nothing wrong. Yet apparently she saw fit to talk down to me in front of all the children and the other parents. 
And me being me, instead of causing waves and drama I bit my fucking tongue and held it in. 
God fucking damnit. 

Speaking to her husband after (Not the brats bio father) He told me that she’s raising a spoilt bitch who gets away with everything and even he has no power over trying to raise her.  
Some parents have issues with people telling off their kids. And fair enough. If I don’t know you and you tell my kid off I might be a little pissed. But we know these people. We’ve known them for years. So I don’t see why she got so fucking up in arms.

I was protecting my son from physical violence. 

Fuck you, you cockjuggling thundercunt.

She's also the most patriotic Chinese citizen living in America I've ever met. She bleeds nationalism. Our new roommate this year is a close friend of mine who's also a Chinese immigrant.

Now, every time I state this to someone they think I am insane. However, after I explain the logic behind this they agree with me.

So, here's the scenario... a group of friends go out to dinner at a semi-nice restaurant. For the sake of this scenario, the group contains four people and the restaurant is your typical family sit down restaurant.
This group of friends decides to order an appetizer. After a brief discussion, they decide to get the fried cheese sticks. When the appetizer arrives, there are five on the plate. Each of the friends takes one leaving only one remaining. 

Now, the game becomes ""find the prick"". Only one cheese stick remains... four people are eyeing it. Each of the friends in turn makes an excuse why they don't want the last one. ""I don't want to ruin my meal"" ""I'm lactose intolerant"" ""I've made a New Years resolution to only eat one fried cheese stick per meal""

Eventually, one of the friends decides he is going to take the last one. He offers to split it, but of course the others refuse. After he has taken the first bite, he official wins the title of ""prick"". In reality, every one of the friends wanted that last one, but no one wanted to be the bastard to take the last one.

Now, the fault completely lies with the restaurant to put these friends in this predicament. And here begins the meat of the rant...

Appetizers by nature are made to be divided among a group of people. Typically, the group will contain between two to four people.
A prime number is a number not divisible without remainder by any integer except itself and one.

That being said, why would you serve an item that is intended to be divided in a prime number? Instead of serving appetizers in five or seven count, why not spend an extra few cents and serve them in six or eight count. 

This at least gives the group a chance of getting an equal portion.
In my mind it seems fairly logical... but then again, those who know me are aware that I tend to think outside of typical logic. ",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_1100ha,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1100ha/appetizers_in_prime_numbers/,

At the mall tonight with some friends.  Sitting by the water fountain, and since it's late, the fountain is drained.  It's about half a foot deep.  I look down, and there's a quarter, so I pick it up and put it in my pocket.

Flash forward 10 minutes later, and a mall cop comes up to me and tells me that he's *pretty sure* I took something from the fountain and he is going to remove me for the night.  I told him yes, I took a quarter.  He tells me that's theft.  I apologized, told him I had no idea it was considered stealing, returned the quarter to the fountain, and started following him to the exit.  I didn't complain.  In fact, I didn't say anything.

As we reach the exit, he turns to me and says that he is now banning me from the mall and surrounding parkade, etc. for 30 days.  He doesn't say anything to me as he takes my ID and starts writing me up.  His mall cop partner comes up and takes my photo for their wall of shame.  The partner starts explaining what happens if I come back before the 30 days is up, and then the guy writing me up says ""I already told her.""

This was weird, because he didn't say more anything about that to me!  So I got the other mall cop to explain to me what would happen, and he explains about the fine and trip to the police station I'd have to take.

So then after that, the guy finishes writing me up and says ""I'm only banning you for 30 days, not 6 months, because you put the quarter back.""

""So if I hadn't of put it back, you would have banned me for 6 months?""

""No, we'd of arrested you for theft.""

Woah.  Now I'm not upset about being removed for the night--I really had no idea this was considered theft and wouldn't have done it if I had known.  I cooperated with everything and even returned the quarter, even though he didn't know for certain I had taken it in the first place, and certainly never asked me to put it back.  I did that on my own initiative.

So this is why I'm kind of upset: first he tells me he's *pretty sure* I took something, never tells me the consequences of anything, initially says he's removing me for the night and then just ups it to a 30 day ban for no reason, and lies to his partner about how much he's explained to me.  He seemed kind of sketchy.

Seeing as most of the classes at the University are 200+, this is quite the accomplishment. The downside, however, is about 10 of those people are Football players, 5 or 6 show up, but are on some other planet for the majority of class, 4 are snooty goody-two-shoes whose biggest disappointment is not have 40,000 twitter subscribers. Then there's the 4 that try their damndest to get an A, and then there's me.

For the past two quarters the handful who actually care about the language and the course have been diligently trying to do homework, classwork, gets As on exams and quizzes and ace the oral exams. This class is lit erally the only non-artsy class I've ever hoped to get an A in, and I really enjoy it, so I work hard to get an A. Meanwhile, the Tweets and the Football junkies flirt endlessly with each other while the others stare blankly at the screen. I don't know how most of them didn't fail 101, but here we all are in 102, like some perfectly dysfunctional family. There have been times when the people who want to do well can't stand it anymore, get up and tell them to shut it. We've done it politely, we've done it with some sincerity, we've done everything we can think of that wouldn't illicit a fight right there and then.

Today was a different day. After half of class had been laid to waste because the teacher kept asking everyone to put their phones away, stop having private conversations, not to have phones out during quizzes, etc. etc., I couldn't take it anymore. I turned around, stared straight at one of the Twitterbugs, and asked if she was born in a barn, because even cows would've taught her better manners than that.

It was rude, it was out of place, I'll give it that. Had she given me the chance to apologize, I would have (not to the extent of saying I was wrong, I'm not. I have every right to fight for my education). Instead, she made this huge scene screaming how I was disrespectful, how the teacher was stupid (all the while her little posse are cheering her on). She then gets up and slams the door, leaving all her stuff on the desk. 

I felt a little bad for the teacher- he's from a country where children learn early on if they don't have an education, they'll be in a sweat shop the rest of their lives. So he's very used to a quiet and respectful class. He fumbled around for words but since he's not a native English speaker and caught with a very large elephant in the room, he didn't know what to say, other than repeating the same things over in different phrases: Don't talk in class. Don't be disrespectful. People have a right to learn.

He had both of us stay after class (she came back just a few minutes before the bell) and naturally her group kept trying to egg me on. I'm used to it, I've been tormented the better part of my High School years. I ignored them.
When the teacher shooed them all out a few minutes early and had us stay behind, things got ugly. He had us sit down and try to calmly explain our differences- I was coming up with a way to apologize, but also point out that I wasn't necessarily sorry for what had happened, either. She went at it. First she asked Mzee (teacher) if she could say something. He agreed, and the first thought that hit me was uh oh. When a girl with a weave and accessories that would make a metal detector commit suicide says those words, you know it's about to be a replay of a Jersey Shore meltdown. 

She laid it on me. She told me I'd insulted her, insulted her mother, insulted her family, insulted everyone in the classroom (to which I objected no, by being a bratty loudmouth, she'd done that for me). She stood up, in stereotypical intimidating fashion, got within a foot of my face kept saying things like ""You have no idea how hard I work to be here, you don't know where I come from, just because I'm black doesn't mean I get scholarships, you don't know me, you're a rude little bitch, blah blah blahda blah...""

Let me point something out.
I never once said it was because she was black. 
I never once inferred she had received scholarships.
Most importantly, I'm studying a predominantly black language from a black teacher because I will be teaching black students in a black country literature and science. Please take your race card somewhere where it ACTUALLY matters.

I don't know what our Afrikan teacher was thinking. Eventually he got tired of her trying to intimidate me and tried pushing her away, where the typical 'I'd hit you if he wasn't holding me back' situation occurred. Sweetheart, you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if you tried (I really like that barn insult, teehee.) She kept saying she'd done nothing wrong, and finally my patience wore down and I started yelling back at her, telling her it's my education and I have a right to hear the teacher, especially when all she can think about is what her next status will be.

Fuck you guys.  Seriously.  I have spent the past few months toying with my iPod touch and iPod shuffle trying to figure out how the fuck to get them acknowledged by iTunes.  They're being ignored.  I have followed your ""five Rs"", reinstalled iTunes multiple times, followed every step of every item on every help page you have that's in any way relevant, and nothing works.


My only option, after this Joycean epic waste of a day, is to PAY YOU for the privilege of fixing some goddamn DRM nightmare of your own creation.  All I want is to be able to move music from point A to point B so that I can enjoy it at the gym, on runs, etc.  But no.

This marathon, blood-clot inducing session of typing every combination of ""unrecognized"" ""iPod"" ""driver"" ""USB"" and ""useless piece of crap"" has ended with me here, in a subreddit I didn't even know existed shouting into the wind.


I fucking hate you guys.  I will never, NEVER buy another apple product as long as I live.  In fact, I'm going to use the iTunes gift cards I have so that you don't get the money of my loved ones for free, then I'm going to transfer all of my music to some other, non-Apple mp3 player.

Fuck your minimalist aesthetic hiding a labyrinth of convoluted code designed to keep the masses updating and upgrading and buying more crap until the end of days.  


I'm off the hamster wheel of constant updates, constant upgrades, trying to stave off this eventuality; this planned obsolescence will be the end of your company someday.

1247226274.0,16,self.rant,8zyta,My thoughts on the film American Psycho (spoilers),19,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8zyta/my_thoughts_on_the_film_american_psycho_spoilers/,"I only saw the film once, was a bit confused, but liked it overall.

Then I hopped online. Then I read the debates: Was it real? Was it all in his head? Was his sketch pad just his fantasy land?

I didn't want to think these things, but ended up doing so anyway. These two quotes always nipped at me though: ""In the book everything is real."" and, attributed to the author of the book: ""If what happens in the movie is a dream then it destroys the entire meaning of the book"" or something like that, anyway. That's the essense of the quote.

But I got to thinking and came to the realisation that there is *no possible way* that it could be anything but a dream. Here is why: (please excuse  jagged, wayward descriptions and memories of the film as I only saw it once)

Firstly and most clearly is the scene with the chainsaw. Not only is his victim running *screaming* through the halls of his apartment building AND banging on all the doors as she goes through, but he is following her WITH A CHAINSAW through the corridors and yelling at her. [slow pause] And *not one single person* - not ONE person AT ALL comes to see what the screaming, yelling, revving hub-ub is about? [pause] Not even after he drops the chainsaw several stories onto his escaping victim (she made it down all those stairs awful quick, didn't she?) and somehow disposes of the body without being noticed. He is naked or in underwear throughout all of this, if I remember correctly.

Secondly! There is the little matter of detectives. At one point they suspect him and/or search his apartment. Hmm, did you notice that when he stabs Paul Allen with an axe (hip to be square scene) he sinks the axe in, then flings it above his head as fast as he can? Do you know what blood spatter is? Do you know that newspaper can't even hold the grease from chips without dissolving, let alone the amount of blood gushing out of his victims open wounds? And did you notice how the carpet is spotless? There isn't a speck of blood anywhere in the apartment... not even trace amounts.

Other things which bugged me were the gigantic explosion of the cop car which he shoots. I felt this went from a very realistic scene (bullets having no effect on a car) to grandoise Hollywood style (massive explosion) very quickly. As in, he wanted the car to blow up like that, so he imagined it did. Check out the look\_of\_surprise he gets on his face when it blows up ""like it should"".

Also, having the ATM ask: ""Feed Me A Stray Cat"" is a fucking awesome scene, but far from reality-based, wouldn't you agree?

I'm sure there's more I'm not remembering right now, but you get the jist of it. I think there is far too much evedence in the film to support the dream theory, than there is to disprove the dream theory. There are far too many elements like the above mentioned which just go without explanation.

Fucking asshole. He went to film school like a decade ago (a fact he drops *all the time*) and in general walks around like he's the next Spielberg or Lucas, but they're too mainstream so he instead strives for a ""higher art form,"" and anyone who enjoys ""commercialized big studio garbage"" isn't *worthy* to speak to the nature of cinema.

A few weeks ago, I was with a bunch of my buddies at one of my/our favorite bars. This one guy that we all know (an a acquaintance of ours) shows up. He orders a few drinks at the bar, argues with the bartender about seating, then tips $0.00. (I know this because the bartender told me later).

So all of us talk to him a little bit while we're out on the patio.  A few hours later, (after last call), our waitress tells us that not all of us have paid our tabs. We had six people at our table, and she had six tabs to go along with it. Then she says that ""our buddy"" from the other table hasn't paid yet. We explain he's not with us, and that he's an asshole. He fucking left way before that.  Long story short, we end up paying his tab, because we didn't want the waitress to ""eat that"" as they say. (Also, the manager told us it was the waitress's first night on the patio). So we paid it, left a nice tip, and it was all good.

So, three fucking days ago, I'm with my one of my buddies (one of the same guys we were with that first night). He and I meet with some of my friends at a bar across the street (there are numerous bars in Midtown).  We are all doing shots, getting cocktails and beers.  At one point a friend that we met with leaves with her friend/boyfriend (still unclear on their status).  A little while later, we are presented with the tabs. Our waitress says, ""Hey where is the guy that was sitting there? (points to an empty seat).  We say he left a little while ago.  She said he didn't pay.  So my buddy ends up paying for this stranger's (stranger to him, he had just met the guy, as did I) tab.  

Neither of these tabs were exorbitant, but it's still frustrating.  It's not like either of these guys bought a beer and forgot about it; they had both ordered decent cocktails and shots (on each occasion).

I'm not entirely sure about the second situation.  Maybe this guy just honestly forgot/was too drunk to remember to pay. Shit happens I understand that. The guy was actually a nice guy, so no big deal.  But the first guy, man fuck him. He knew exactly what he was doing.  He even mentioned at one point how he doesn't live up here anymore (which to me should have been a sign that he was going to do something shitty at some point).


Anyway, these situations (mainly the first one) make me frustrated, and I wanted to vent. Thanks for listening.

Dan.
Lets call him dan because that's what he wanted his name to be in his shitty little stories he wrote. Let's face it, you're a condescending prick who has no idea when to stop and overreacts. You also don't know that people need privacy. You are obsessed with what i do. I tell you ""it doesn't concern you"" When i'm writing something or on the internet and you reply ""if you hide it from family it's not important."" ABSOLUTE FUCKING BULLSHIT. You are always seeming to watch me on the computer and you insist that you stay. You are also obsessed with the fact that i fap. COME ON! This is natural! At Least i don't leave my porn on my desktop and search porn up on my mother's phone. You just can't dismiss the fact that  do it. No no no you bring it up at dinner n front of all my brothers and my mom but form the sentence so only us two know what we're talking about. HE BROUGHT IT UP AT THE DINNER TABLE. DINNER. TABLE!!!!!! He is also the most condescending prick ever. I tell him he is retarded his response "" Really? What's the answer to [calculus or something]? That's right.
You ranted about us for class in school as if you want us to look bad and you constantly insult us. No wonder your friends are surprised when i actually form a sentence. If i so much as slap you you full out punch e 20 times. IN MY WEAK SHOULDERS! Why are they weak? Well they get punched so much that they hurt after 30 seconds of sprinting. No i'm not old this is the result of that. Anyways NEXT!

Des
Des is part of his name. I can't say much except that he beats me up and constantly takes stuff from me. Occasionally it gets out of hand (see my weak shoulders)but other times it's tolerable. This is why i prefer him over Dan anyday. Unlike Dan Des is tolerable


Lastly D.
D is part of his name so here we go. D Is a condescending prick. He's like dan but 10 years older. and 10x worse. Let's just say thin: My mom said and i quote"" D is an ass. Do you see the way he acts towards you guys? I wouldn't consider him my brother if  were you."" My mom said that. She didn't give birth to him (technically he's my step bro) and she dislikes him that much.

My dad
My dad isn't bad compared to dan and d but he still is bad. He excluded one of my other stepbros dave from my family cause they got into a fight at my grandpa's funeral. We got back in contact with him and the first time we talked to him in years he was crying tears of joy and sadness because he could talk to us again but he missed us very much and he missed out on a lot.

I do my work (I'm a good student, at least I like to believe) and I ask for help when I need it. Which is TOO. FUCKING. OFTEN. My teacher has us go over our homework answers, and 'grade' our work.

I usually score around 50 - 80 percent.

Despite this, I still keep an A- in the class. This is by asking my brother for help, which is often times more helpful than the teacher. 

I feel like I'm the dumbest student in the class. Lessons that others will understand immediately, I have to spend extra hours at home to understand. Even when I get help, I'll still get those fucking horrible 50-80 percent 'scores' on the homework.

Even now, it might look like I'm fretting over nothing, but I still feel shaky on the material. How is it that I retain an A- and not feel confident? I don't remember anything. We'll revisit lessons from a while ago, and I'll be sitting there, the only one that doesn't know it. In a flash, the lesson I spent much time, effort and frustration tackling will be much wasted. 

Another thing. I'll make the most idiotic careless mistakes ever. Recently, I missed on answer on a 8 question quiz I would have gotten an 100% on. Bye bye 12%. Why? Apparently, to me, 3 x 8 = 16. What the fuck? It's not like I'm rushing through my work either. Actually, I'm often one of the last (if not last) person to finish tests or quizzes. I will check every single answer for correctness, but on the 8 question one, I felt so confident that I decided to skip this careful procedure. Fuck me.

I should have invested the time in the beginning, but I was so ambivalent that I just didn't care enough - I thought I would be moved out by now.

I need to move out - I feel so stuck here with her. I feel like I have to contend with her messes and her slobby tendencies, while I try not to freak out because she is using my things - and not giving them or me respect. She actually asked me when I was going to do my dishes - they have been out since LAST NIGHT (I usually do my dishes twice a day, but have been busy with a looming deadline, so cleaning has taken a back seat). The worst part is that she wrote this on our window... she didn't even bring it up with me in person. It's written on the fucking window. I don't know how to respond to it. I'm just going to leave it, I guess. I'm really angry that she has the audacity to ask me about cleaning my dishes that haven't even been out for 24 hours. I've had to deal with her dishes (well actually MY DISHES), caked with food, for days at a time. I've had to deal with used tampons out in the bathroom, with her hair in the shower drain, with her carelessness with food being left out/ staining carpets/ on table tops and not to mention her near total aversion to doing any kind of cleaning. She has used the kitchen sponge to clean our bathroom, she has been using the same dirty sponge since August (which she proudly declared to me in December that she hasn't had to replace it yet) to clean the dishes (I cringe anytime I go to use a dish that she may have cleaned) and she uses counter top/ dish clothes to wipe up messes from the floor. She wants to split things like toilet paper, dish detergent, etc... evenly, but never takes the steps to do this. Instead of giving me a cheque for the bills, that are in my name, she insists on paying them herself, but yet requires constant reminders to pay by the due date... 

I know I'm probably not the greatest roommate, but I generally keep to myself and let her do her thing. I have brought some of these things up with her and nothing has changed... and frankly, I'm not her mother and I'm not going to nag her either. I don't care if she does thing exactly the way I want, I'm not that crazy... I just want her to be respectful. The main issue is that we don't have the same philosophies about what constitutes 'cleanliness' and 'consideration'. I have to go through this for 2 more months.

However, I am incredibly frustrated with this situation and just would like to talk about it.

As a disclaimer, I am a fairly successful student. I've maintained high grades and it looks like I'll be able to get into a great college, but I just can't stand high school anymore. Between Theology, Art, Study Hall, and when the classes that are actually useful are unproductive, the majority of my time spent in that school is completely unnecessary. When I have to miss school for something, it feels like the only thing I have to catch up on is busy-work. For example, I'm currently working on a 200 page (yep) project for Theology (yep) that is basically straight bullshit about my life and accomplishments. I'm only 17, there's only so much I can say about what I've done and how much I just adore God. Also, if I neglect that God part, I probably won't receive a fair grade as the teachers are well known to automatically give poor scores to students who mention any kind of atheistic or agnostic perspectives.

What's worse is that the time I'm wasting wouldn't otherwise be spent on video games or something equally useless. I maintain a few websites myself which collectively earn me a few thousand dollars a month and I do additional programming/web-dev stuff for clients. I truly enjoy this kind of work, but it takes time, time that is currently wasted on high school. I have no problem with learning, but the majority of high school isn't actual learning. The majority of the time is spent on these useless projects and watching movies when the teacher decides they don't feel like working. I'm taking a few classes at my local college and it isn't too much different. I guess if I get into a more established college I may be able to avoid that though.

This isn't really a rant, but I just thought I'd explain something that has been frustrating me and was wondering if anyone would sympathize.",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_15xdmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/15xdmq/high_school_is_a_colossal_waste_of_time/,

Here's the deal--my car broke down at a halfway point between where I am from and where my new hometown whilst returning after Thanksgiving. After a few weeks of dealing with the car dealerships and warranties, etc.., they tell me that the car is ready. So the night before (like Dec. 19th) I get a ticket for 1PM to go to the halfway point to pick it up. Well, turns out they called in the morning, said it WASN'T READY AFTER ALL. So, yeah, I guess fuck that dealrship's maintenace department also.

Anyway, Greyhound's website is less inviting than having sex with a transvestite hooker with crabs so big and bad they can pick her up by her PUBES and drag HER sideways with their collective gait. Not to mention that I had to run some errands and would try their mobile site, which it appears doesn't exist...some 504 error or some crap. I don't know what it said, you guys are Redditors--figure it out or something. So I couldn't exchange the ticket online and then had to call customer service as if we're still living in the 10-10-321 era. That didn't help. Menu is terrible. No speak selection, the states are in order yes, but NOT THE FUCKING CITIES. Pressing 0 like it's a clitoris, hoping something will work, nothing does and I get frustrated post-menopausal-style like it's going out of style. At 12:15 though, 45 minutes before departure I FINALLY GET a hold of someone who says ""oh, you have to go to the station to exchange it"". ARE YOU FIST-FUCKING ME? The next day, I go to exchange it since I was so pissed already (and now as you can tell) that I didn't bother.

Next day. Go to window. Hand lady ticket. I get denied like she's goddamn Dikembe Mutombo and get told ""YOU HAVE TO MAIL IT"". Really? The last time I used the U.S. postal service, we had a white president, I wore a white tuxedo to prom where I tried to bang my white girlfriend with my black dong and got blue balls. Catholics. Fun people.

So NOW, today, after getting a ticket now that the holidays are over, I call to see if the bus is running on time. It leaves at 8:25. It is now 9:10. You mayhaps see where this is going.

No answer or a busy signal at 7:35. I was gonna bus it downtown, which was doable, but I cab it to make absolute certain I don't miss it. 15 minutes and 13 bucks later, I find that THE BUS IS RUNNING TWO HOURS LATE. The fuck, I do the right thing for once in getting there early and it's 2 hours late. I don't show up early to do nothing. Well, maybe for work I do. Looks good I guess.

At any rate, I have wasted money, wasted time, and wasted effort trying to give this partial-birth abortion of a company a chance. I should've taken Amtrak and then a $50 cab ride from the nearest stop to the town I gotta go to. It'd cost 50+30 so 80 bucks as opposed to 45, but Amtrak in my experience gets the job right. And it's RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT. CHECKMATE, LIBERTARIANS. GOVERMENT DOES SOMETHING BETTER THAN PRIVATE COMPANIES.

Fuck Greyhound. Fuck it with Snuffalufagus's erect trunk. Maybe then this three-legged dog will run properly. It's a bus company, not an Alice in Chains album. Stop shooting heroin, get some crystal meth and GET HERE. Go back to Albuquerque and find that Heisenberg guy if necessary.

So I just don't know what to do or say anymore so I will just try and vent it out the best I can.

My life as been plagued by a whole lot of bad decisions that I have no one to blame but myself.

I think this  started on December 24th 2001 when I guess, the universe sent me its first warning. I was a 20 years old with an 18 years old girlfriend ( now ex for years ). She got  pregnant while giving me my birthday gift, kind of ironic when you think of what came afterwards. So we decided the best choice was to have an abortion ( I don't know if it was the best choice for me but for her and her happiness it was ), so on that day December 24th 2001 she got aborted. So Christmas ever since for me is not a really happy times.

I don't want to blame her for anything that happened afterwards. I just look at this time as an event that started me down the road I am on.

We split up a few months later, because I met another girl and I was in love with her. Now that was when  things really went to hell. This girl had some major problems in her life but I was in love and wanted to stick with her. So after a couple of months she comes up with a lot of cash and we party like crazy smoke weed, go out, party etc..I moved in with her. But as usual it was too good to be true. What really happened is she stole a debit card from her aunt's boyfriend and she stole the money. She gets caught and we make a deal to pay back the money.

So now I'm in debts when over my head, got bills coming in and was about to start school again to you know get ahead in life. My thinking was well fuck it I love this girl so I'll quit school, find work and pay back the money. I get a night job start working my 40 hours a week with crap pay. But who cares right? I'm doing the right thing. What I didn't know was this girl didn't want to work hard for her money and to do it the legal way. So she becomes an escort without talking to me about it.

One night probably in 2002, I got out of work early and I called her to come pick me up because I knew she was still up and she had my car. She doesn't answer her cell phone or call back. I'm like okay she fell asleep no problem. I walked for an hour and a half to get back home, I get there but she isn't it,it is past 3 am. Now I start asking myself questions, she didn't say anything about going out or anything. I look around the apartment and see a newspaper on the table, odd I think she never reads the papers. I look at it and what do I see? Escorts adds have been circled. 

I put things together and realize she's been selling herself and lying to me since I quit school. That is when I lost my shit. I mean, I felt like a failure I a man I'm supposed to be able to provide for the ones I love. But she decided that what I was doing didn't bring enough money and felt terrible because I quit school to pay out the debt.

And she some how convince me it was okay and I should be her driver. Man was I ever blind or fooled by what I tough was love. We stuck together for 3 more years

Anyway during that time as you can imagine we fought and had a really troubled and fucked-up relationship I'm skipping a whole lot of it even with anonymity there are some parts of my life that should never be told and be my burden to keep. That is when I found a new love for easy money and all sense of pride and morality was lost in exchange. So I talked her into quitting it and I'll just drive for agencies since I'm making good money and we can pay off the debts. 

As I was working nights and for god knows what she wanted more money and started again in the escort business so thats is when we broke off and for some god damn reason I kept her in my life as a friend. Or maybe it was because of all the shit we had been through. That made me think I couldn't get a better friend that knew everything about me.

As that relationship ended I continued in the driver business and after a while I quit because I couldn't take it anymore the headaches from those girls yapping while being high on god knows what. I quit in 2006 , tried going legit once again. But failed miserably with money so I lost everything my apparent, my furniture everything... Went back to my parents for a few months until.... drum roll... 

I get this offer from my weed dealer. He wants to hire me to be his runner, since he knew my past and could be trusted with illegal money.

You might wonder my god LeGeantVert when do you stop making so many stupid choices in your life? The answer : not yet.

So in 2006 I get an apartment back and I'm on my way to make some easy money. Since it seems I still hadn't add enough troubles in my life yet. Life found a way to get back at me once again thru yet another girl I met. It was nothing serious it only lasted 3 days but managed to cost me about 5k in stolen materials and damaged goods in my car. How can that happen in only 72 hours? 

Well I'm cursed you know nothing good can happen to me and if it does it can only be to good to be true. After the 3rd day of intense sex she gets in her mind that she wants to move in with me... HAHAHAHAHA that was probably my answer before kicking her out the door. After all the hell I've been in, I'm no way ready to let some girl move in with me because of 72 hours of sex fuck no! 

To get back at me she got some under aged kids to break-in my car and steal all my audio system. About 5k worth of it. A few weeks after the theft I finally find out who did it turns out its a 15 year old kid that lives 5 streets from where I lived and who for what-ever reason was friend's with the girl. And she is the one that gave them my address.  So me and a friend had some fun scaring the shit out of that family for a week until I let it go when I got my insurance check.

Hey you might think that is not too bad it kinda ended okay I guess? Nope good endings are not for me my friends oooohh noooo they are not for me or they just don't last long.

Anyway so a few months pass IIRC we are now in 2007. My failed relationships with the few girls I've been with have turn to shit that I can't even wish on my worst enemy. This creepy feeling of not deserving to be loved grew in me  put together with the shame of my past secrets that I couldn't share even with a girlfriend, with a depression problem. I felt like no one in their right mind could be understanding enough to be with me. Or even love me...

So I closed myself to anyone that tried to get close to me and kept dealing drugs thinking now I should be problem free since you know I decided I don't want anyone in my life. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh fuck no. I went to bars a lot to drink my problems away and always used a cab r a DD. But one night for some unknown reason I didn't and used my car. Got busted for a DUI. A whole new level of shit hit the fan now. Lost my income for a month but managed okay started working again. And in my stupid mind let that DUI go unchecked court wise. So now booze is gone from my life thinking hey that will get rid of another problem so I should be on my way to happiness again. 

Fate as a way to give you many warning signs but I was dumb enough to not see them... Anyway on to the next chapter of this sad story.

The inevitable unwritten law of criminal activity happened to me. You think what law are you talking about? The one that says that if you take that road you will get caught maybe not the first time or the first few years but one day it will happen, whatever the field of criminality you are in. The longer you are in it the higher the chances of you getting caught. So I get caught for the first time for dealing drugs and we are talking not a small amount nor a huge amount but about a 1/4 pound of weed separated in multiple baggies, about a 100 pills of speed and extacy. Plus a dash of viagra. Lucky for me I am a damned CANADIAN Oh yeahhhhh! So I get busted by cops they take my stuff and take my info and let me loose into the wild like a fisher man does when he only fish for sports.

So dumb ass self goes into panic mode and was kinda let to die by my boss. I was probably sold to save someone else's ass but its a long story and the details of those events are not important because its shit that was totally out of my control. I kind of quit/left to rot that job so I went to work driving strippers instead of escorts thinking well I'll make okay money till I get something better.

A few weeks pass, I had nothing telling me there was anything happening court wise for my arrest. And destiny would go and temp me once more into the game but this time with a twist.

A childhood friend of mine that used to deal a whole lot of drugs got back in touch somehow with me. His offer : You know the drug business in the area pretty well people know you and since your old boss left you to take the fall, I can offer you to start your own business and supply you with the drugs. 

You can guess what I did next right? I took the offer and started once again selling drugs thinking well its been over a month and I got no news of charges and such maybe the cops just smoke it all or sold it off. Don't care need money, want money, can smell the easy money. So here we go for another round.

So at this point in life after so many problems I put some rules for myself: no gf, no booze and be like a ghost. Meaning that you couldn't tell that I was selling drugs even if you were my neighbors.

Everything went well at first until.... I get caught again.... Plot twist by the same cop!!! You know I'm a lucky guy right. Same old shit happens they find the drugs talk to me took my money, drugs, cell phone and sent me back my merry way. That's where the part about being a ghost helps because from the look of things you are a nice guy that just does stupid stuff to put food on the table.

 In Quebec my raging American friend with the 3 strike rules, it is not the same. Back in 2007 if you were a little fish in the pond like myself the law is basically a joke. So lets recap my bad choice concerning the law : a DUI, 4 charges of dealing drugs ( one for each kind of drug, for the first arrest ) and now we add 2 more because I had weed and extacy! Oh yeah we have a winner here!

Now with all this shit happening I get my first letter with the charges for the first arrest a few months prior. I get a lawyer on that and what he finds was that I was about to be on warrant because of my DUI that I was too stupid to take care off. This fabulous lawyer was recommended by the big cheese of this organization... 

Yeah that is one effing big mistake that costs me about 10k $ You see this lawyer smelling the opportunity to bleed me dry out of cash and how a dumb ass I was. Was charging me 500$ every time we went to court but the twist is every time he would just set another court date the next month so he could charge me 500$ more. So during that time my business is dying because of bad associates, lack of steady supply and every one near me running away from me like I'm the black plague.  I got a legit job and kept selling drugs because I was in debts and was forced by the big cheese to keep pushing drugs but all the little money I could come up with went to the lawyer, my rent and some food I was broke and desperate. Some one I didn't know called me for a small amount of 3.5g and 3 speeds. So you know with all the heat I had on me, I still went and it was a set up. I get to the address no one is there I leave and that is when I see the cop car come after me. I get busted again but this time with only possession charges.

Now after that incident I finally made a right choice and quit everything thing altogether! Kept my minimum wage job struggled like hell to pay my lawyer. The Bosses tried putting pressure on me to pay back what I owed for the drugs kept telling them fuck I got no money all the money I have the lawyer is getting it, I'm 2 month behind on rent, I'm really late on every bill I had. They took the things of value I had and I thought it was the end of it. So I can focus on my legal problems.

I get a room-mate to help pay the rent and get back on track. Everything was going okay for a while until low and behold the room-mate flooded the entire duplex from the second floor to the basement when he did some laundry after installing his washing machine, starting a load  and left for the entire day. 

You see I didn't have enough problems yet! So lady luck turned her attention once again to me! That happened in October in an 1930's house! 14 000$ of damages and us without insurance! Oh yeah! How do you like that LeGeantVert! This time life ain't using some lube before its fucking you over!

So here comes a shit load of stress with my legal shit, my drug debt the room-mate disaster it can't get any worse LeGeantVert! Cheer up now you've hit rock bottom there is nothing left that can hurt you!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA with an extra A! 2 months later I got fired from my job! Oh wow that is like a baseball bat to the face! 

But hey I see a glimpse of hope in that because for once in my life I was actually fired from a job so if I had the numbers of hours needed for unemployment benefits I could get them, get in a program to go back to school and make my life better!!!

Yeah I'm not even lucky enough for that to go right... You see we are in the beginning of 2009 and that was my first experience with our oh so loved system.........

So the first month of waiting period is over, I get a letter saying a decision will be taken soon. Okay I think its not too bad I can maybe borrow some money and wait it out maybe even get a job till then.
Another month passes, another letter saying the same thing. No decision yet. 2 months without salary with a lawyer asking for 500$ a month threatening you with jail time if you don'T pay up plus rent was adding up I went up crazy stressed out. Moved back again at my parents cuz lets face it I can't pay rent I can't pay for food or anything and since they won't charge me for the food but they'll charge me only rent when I get my checks it seemed the best option.

In the end it took 5 freaking months before I got my first check! I had to declared bankruptcy to protect myself from the flooding incident, the back rent I owed and for all the other payments I couldn't make while waiting for them.

Luckily for me threw all of this shit emerged one true Friend with a capital F it is not a grammar mistake. He takes upon himself to find me a better lawyer and supporting me into keeping on right side of tracks, which my family to be honest was never there for moral support of anything except for my mother always saying where is our money this week? 

With his help and a new found lawyer that wasn't screwing me up for money and the unemployment check coming up things were looking positive for me!

The lawyer bought me enough time to go back to school during my trial!
I went back to school but not on a rush decision because of my pasts experiences of bad choices I was like oh hell no I'm not taking a decision without making sure it is the right one. I went to a counselor did all the right things to make sure we find the thing for me. Turns out from the tests I took its a tough choice because I could do so many things. 

I ended up taking Land Surveying! And for once felt some what happy I was going the right path, I was going back to school and had something positive to take my mind of all my problems.

I was focused and driven to succeed in that class, I was acing everything, helping out everyone that asked me. I felt good about my future for once and the legal problems were going okay.

So the summer of 2010 comes around and I finally see and end to my legal problems with my sentencing! You see at that time I've came to see my arrests as the kick in the ass I needed to get out of the dealing.
I got a light sentence because all my charges were dealt in a package deal! And was my first offense, I did 90 days in jail, 60 hours of community services and 3 years probation. I was okay with it as it was finally an end to 3 years of going to courts and the first steps to really putting my past behind me.

I was in jail all summer long got out just in time for the class to begin again after the summer vacation. I was more motivated than ever to succeed in that class!

Then comes October 2010, I don't know what expression I can use anymore to express this event... When I went back to school I did it with the government program that paid me to go to school. This is important. During the summer I was supposed to do an internship in land surveying but you know I made it in the field of prison time... So you can guess I didn't do the internship. So I shouldn't get paid during that time from the government, makes sense right? Well lo and behold since I haven't fucked up my life enough by myself someone else had to do it for me! Yes! 

What happened was a mix up of the dates of my internship, instead of being 3 weeks. The secretary that sends reports of my attendance to my agent put the internship from 3 weeks to 8 weeks. We are talking 2 500$ for a broke ass student.

I got paid all summer long and thought nothing of it because well I was in jail and you know sending those reports had nothing to do with me.

I got a letter saying I had fraud the system and I owe them back the entire 8 weeks of pay instead of the only 3 the internship was lasting.

So here goes another list of bad choices. I try to get to the bottom of this debt I got imposed on me. But that turned into a nightmare! So I just gave up on it and focused on finishing my class.

Which was really hard on my morale because all I could think of was WTF? I'm trying to set my life straight to get out of debt and I get a new one just thrown at me like that.

But you know what I've seen worse its only money. I finished my damned course! Got my diploma and found an internship!

Oh yeah finally the good times comes rolling you think? Not even close....

2 weeks into my internship my team leader and quits the job without warning after learning that the boss offered her job to one of her friends. That is where after all my experiences I should have seen that red flag coming up! Nooo I stick it out finish my internship get offered a job. I'm like awwww yeah!!! So I'm like one week off my internship a new intern comes in the boss tells me now I'm the leader and go on the field do the job with your 2 weeks of experience and you have to show him how everything works too. Major red flag showing that all the boss wanted was cheap labor and cutting corners everywhere, but  I was like okay I'll try why not it couldn't be that hard? You have to understand in land surveying we work with precision machines that some manufacturer uses different OS. And the machine I got used to broke I got stuck with an older generation machine that no one knows in the office how to work. I get a crash course on the phone of a long 15 mins after the first questions I asked and got an answer of hmmmmm I don't know. I was sent on the field and told lets go do it!

After an eternity trying to set up and the rage building in me from lack of any help from the office or my boss. We start the job everything seemed going well for you know 2 guys not knowing how to work the machine. I go take a look at it and the damned thing saved nothing, the settings were in imperial system ( Fuck you with your inches, foot, yards and whatever ). Which it was supposed to be in the metric system made me lose it! So I went back to the office and quit right there on the spot!

That was the end of my career in land surveying 6 weeks. So I look for any job that needs my qualification, went to get my CCQ card to work in construction sites to help out into finding a job.And wow  turns out a HUGE engineering firm wants to hire me for a short term contract. I'm like hey why not it can't look bad on my resumé? So I take the job! It is even paying more than any job in legal surveying I can get right now! Even if it is for 3 and half months its better than no job at all?

So I start the job, in the first week of employment I got a piece of equipment stolen because of my fault, yeah I really felt bad for that and kind of blamed it on my ongoing bad luck. They didn't fire me I was happy :)

So yet another recap we are in 2011. I've quit the drugs business since 2008. Went back to school in 09 finished in 11. Finished with my legal problems, did my jail time, did my community work during '10.

Now in October, I've had like 3 months of problem free living, a steady job that I loved. I was starting to feel stressed out again because I had this feeling it was going too good to last. Bam more bad news came my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and the government wasn't done messing around me with me yet! Oh hell no!

2 years prior, when I was on unemployment benefits I took a part time job to keep busy before starting school. The problem was in declaring my worked hours I made mistakes and put in the wrong numbers of hours on some weeks. 

At this point in my life I was like bahhh its my mistake I'll pay it back no problem which I did. Now thinking I should be fucking clear of anything I can get back to my life.

Noooo now it was time yet again to get fucked over by people! I was sent 2 weeks in a far off Northern Quebec for my job I was ahh yeah I'm going to make mad money with the overtime! I get there, my colleague and I start our job. 12 hours a day 14 days straight was the original deal.The first week goes as planned than the problem starts. Server problems made it so that we couldn't do what we came there for a few days. So we were sent to do quality check up on the job some teams did in the region prior to that. I get there realized a team completely and willingly botched up their job tell my boss that you know the work done here is complete shit. Major set back to the 2 weeks plan.  But around the 10th day my shoulder was in major pain because of repetive movement and bad posture during does 12 hours day + carrying 40 pounds of equipment everywhere by foot but at the time I didn't know that all I could say was I was barely able to move my right arm with out major pain. I tell my boss I can't take much more of this before I go bat shit insane because of the pain but I will make it to the end of the 2 weeks that we agreed upon when I left. So on the 14 th day I take a bus back home which I paid out of pocket and never asked to be refunded as it was my decision to leave while the other guy got to finish the job alone because it could be done alone. He stayed a week more. And as punishment I was given a week off without pay. I was like okay no problem I'll take the time to heal my shoulder and I'll be okay the next week! But little did I know what kind of 2 face asshole was my supervisor! That guy told the contract manager that I left the job site without warning that I only called to give a heads up when I was on the bus. Yeah even when trying to stay out of trouble it find me I'm lucky like that. I only knew that the following year tho if you've read this far keep this detail in mind its still important.

So I finish my contract with the company and everything seemed fine I was never told of anything bad about my 2 weeks up north.

All hopeful and stress free I start looking for jobs in my field because that contract was nothing to close to my field of work. It was somewhat related like a redneck 4th cousin's or something. I sent about 300 to 350 resumé when I noticed I never got any call back or anything? Was like what the hell man whats wrong? So I start thinking to my prior job in land surveying and I'll try a new approach and not say anything about them on it. Well at least that worked I got some calls but it didn't end up any where because  of my criminal record :( Yeah sucks but not much I can do about it. At-least I have enough hours to get unemployment benefits! 

But you know of my love affair I have with government services, just for another stab in the back because you know my life is just full of happiness! It took an extra month for no reason at all. But you know I expected nothing less than that so I was okay with it. Nothing can hurt me anymore its just money. Its not like I can feel anything anymore, I've been broken, destroyed, chewed out, abused and spit out enough times that emotions, family, love or soul are just words in a the dictionary that lost all meaning to me.

I pass the winter with out a job hoping that my contract job will call again when the job starts again in  the spring. Which they did! Oh boy was I relieved! 

Oh boy was I in for some disappointment down the road. We have a new supervisor this time around. Guess what? It's the guy that botches up the job every where he goes. Yeah.... that guy is the son-in-law of some big cheese in the company..... First Red flag was seeing that he promoted his cousin that was working with him that only knows how to fuck up a job before people that had more experience. Then he turned the company into a freaking hell for people that weren't part of his family or licking his ass.

After a few months, half the team leaders quit. The people that got promoted was for example the chick with the least productive % of all the others that were qualified for the job. That pissed off a few other people myself included. That is when the bomb hit me that they were trying to fire me because of what happened last year and the BS the other supervisor told. That really really pissed me off because ever since I quit the drug business I promised myself to be a reliable person that takes his work and work ethics very seriously. It is kind of my way of making up for my past mistakes. And in my opinion I did everything by the book.

Anyway looking at my options they were limited I didn't quit. I started getting my productivity higher just to show them the mistakes they made about me and judging me on what other people say.

So anyway I get treated like shit the rest of the contract for all kinds of reasons that to be honest I don't care anymore about because all I cared was to finish my contract again, get my unemployment benefits again. But this time I'm getting help making a better resumé. I got a part time job  delivering pizza to keep sane because I've realized that when I don't work I go insane.

Now this should be the start of something good. You know after 4 years keeping in the right path, taking the right choices, not being so impulsive and being responsible I could start living again? This was last week. 

To keep in my oh so good luck I get a delivery one night to some place. I go there no worry in mind except to get the food hot. I ring the door bell and this guys answer. I do my thing say the price he goes to pay me and says wait a minute I know you! LeGeantVert! You know Mister X from your drug dealing days! My jaw drops I'm thinking fuck me after all this time I've haven't seen or heard anything about them since the last time they took whatever of value I had 4 freaking years ago!

He goes yeah man I was stuck with your debt and now you have to pay me back. 

So this bring us back to today I'm fucking pissed, outraged almost to the point of going bat shit insane mode! I can't take anymore of this shit! I work too fucking hard to rebuild my life! 

I don't know what the guy wants out of me but I don't have the money to pay it back and I'm done with this part of my life I never want anything to do again with it. I've paid enough already! I've had my share of hardships for 3 lifetimes. I've lost so much,my heart, my soul, my dreams and hope even my family left me. I'm alone, broke and all this shit comes back in my face a few weeks before Christmas. 

I'll probably go insane and do something really stupid because anyway whatever I do there is no such thing as an happy ending for me... Even if I manage to fix this up what will come next? 

Another year starting on the wrong foot, alone no light at the end...

But hey I guess that was my price to pay for all the wrong decisions I took with my life I  must have deserved it.

He's a spineless, loudmouthed cunt, hiding behind whatever communication device he can find.

I hate these people with a passion. Oh, Obama is illegally having people murdered, is he? where's your proof? They link me a conspiracy theory forum. WHere there is no proof whatsoever.

Just today, somebody I know refused to honour Rememberance Day, simply because he believed that the American and British Armies are all criminals. Even after I pointed out that it wasn't just about them, he went on about Obama, Bush and Blair.

My mother is morbidly obese standing 5'2"" and 400 lbs. 

My mother was an angry person who did not like to move much. I was an active, thin child so naturally, she was always angry towards me. I was  never allowed to have any friends over, because she did not want anyone to see her (the thought of asking friends to come over angered her). We would have the usual American fanfare of junk food in the home, along with a steady diet of fast food. My father and myself would by some cookies at the super market, I would snack on cookies normally. Mother inhaled the bag. I would then confront her about this unhealthy habit, and she blamed my brother for eating an entire carton of oreos in one night. Eventually, I picked up some bad gorging habits of my own. If you wanted to eat something, don't take a small, normal piece, mom would eat the rest. Eat as much as you could, as fast as you could, before mom took it away from you and ate the rest.

When I was 10, my family, save for my older sister (so myself, younger brother, mother and father) went on a trip to our Nation's Capital. We were staying at the Holiday Inn, 4th floor. Wednesday, in the middle of the night, the fire alarm was pulled. I woke up to my mother screaming to get her out of the bed. I helped her then we evacuated (well, TRIED) the hotel room. My parents, brother, myself and everyone in the hotel was freaked out and so I outran everyone down the stairs. My mother being so large, very slowly descended down the stairs. My father started cursing and calling my all sorts of profane names because I was leaving my mother behind to die. I suppose this is what really gets to me. My father would rather have me die on account of my obese mother, than run and save myself. Because she was so wide, she blocked the majority of the staircase. This caused scared lodgers to try and push her forward. On one side we had people swearing and pushing my mother to move faster. On the other side we had my parents calling me profane names because I tried running for my life. 

When I was in jr. high school, What's Eating Gilbert Grape came out. I wasn't allowed to see it because the woman in it looked pretty similar to my mother. Everyone in school even pointed out the fact that the mother was strikingly similar to my own (it was a small rural town, much like the movie, the school was not very big).

If I were to bring up the idea of weight loss for health purposes, she would become irate and violent, but had no problem telling me about losing 5 lbs (I was a skinny teenager). I guess after my brother was born she discovered that she was born with only one kidney. The other was just a vestigial mass. The doctor told her that she would not live past 50, so she ate herself into a very large person in 2 years. When she was 37, she was told she had heart problems from her weight and underwent a couple of surgery on her knees (again, from carrying around all that weight). She's 55 now, but I do not see her living past 65, unless she sheds the weight.

The “Don’t give a fuck, just do it!” attitude that it perpetuates with stupid people. I’m sure most of the time it’s typically just some stupid harmless meme women prattle on about before chugging drinks, (YOLO LOL!!) but it annoys the hell out of me. Why, just the other night, when I was dining at was probably the closest thing to a first class restaurant in this shitty town of Dundalk, (Applebee’s) I heard some girls going “YOLO!” as they gulped down their overpriced drinks.

At first, I decided to let it slide. I simply endured their chatter while waiting for my steak. Then another one mentioned how the zombie apocalypse was coming. That was the last straw.

I picked up my entire table and threw it at them. That knocked one of the three girls out cold. I then picked up the unconscious girl and used her as a weapon against the other two girls. They took cover behind the bar, and whenever they would peak their heads over to see if I was still there, I’d hit them on the head with the knocked out girl. (Side note: This gave me an idea for a game I plan on copyrighting, called ""Whack-a-girl."" It's just like Whack-a-mole, but instead of hitting moles with a hammer, it'll be the entire female cast of Jersey Shore.)

One of the two girls got ballsy and tried making a run for it. Big mistake. I leaped over the bar and tackled her in mid-air, causing her to break and fly through the window. Two down, one to go. I found the last girl cowering in a corner in the kitchen. I was in a very generous mood, so I gave her the choice of doing this the hard way, or the easy way. She took the easy way out, and picked up a frying pan and whacked herself in the head until she passed out, saving me the trouble. But right before she did that, she looked at me, tears in her eyes, and faintly whispered: Why? I coldly responded with the simple comeback of:

Example 2: Moe sits behind me and is an absolute dumb ass. He keeps bragging about how the iPhone is the best phone and that the white one is the best shit ever because all the other dumb asses have it too. 

Example 3: Moe was eating in class one day when he wasn't supposed to. so the teacher comes by, sees him eating and puts his sandwich away. He starts having a fit on how SHE is a dumbass just because she didn't catch some other guy who was also eating. And how he was going to sue her for taking his sandwich. 

Example 4: Today was the worst one and I wanted to punch them for it. (before i continue I'm straight but I support gays) The prom king was named today since prom is tomorrow for our school. So the prom king was a very good actor, probably a runner up for valedictorian and guy has all AP classes. the only thing is, he isn't afraid to be gay in public. He even wore a dress and a wig another spirit day.

I'd like to think i'm not racist. While i'll admit some stereotypes i've noticed to be true.. I am a rational human being who does not ASSUME every race will behave as their stereotype entitles them to. I also would never discriminate against someone due to the color of their skin.
Is appalls me to no other though the ""black community"" and the ""white community""
We're Americans and bigger than that, we're fucking human beings. Why can't we behave like the goddamn evolved mammals we are? Why must everything be about race!? I didn't start this race war, I don't care what color people are so long as we all get along... but people want to make everything about race. I'm not saying I want tolerance -that is only to ignore the differences and quite frankly, it's our differences that make us beautiful and interesting people. I don't understand why the black community wants race to be such a massive and identifying factor in American culture. Like I said, I believe everyone should be proud of where they came from and I personally find it exhilerating to learn about a new culture... but as a white girl, being treated like i'm going to be racist IS RACIST. I have NO IDEA if my ancestors had slaves or not, so to accuse me of being a white devil because of slavery is not only a fucking stupid argument, it makes you look like a racist asshole. I'm so fed up with the white community being too scared to say anything. I'm so sick of this stupid conception that is has to be black vs white as all the other ethnicities get treated like shit because everyone is so focused on black vs white. How many hispanic children have been killed and it wasn't a race crime, how many asians have been killed and it wasn't a race crime? This whole devotion towards race is WHAT BREEDS RACISM. Gah!

Everything was standard in our relationship up until middle school when your family decided to home school you because ""it will allow you to get ahead"". Your parents even asked me to ask my parents if I wanted to be home schooled with you. I begged my parents, but they said no. Fine. 8th grade comes again and you ask me if I wanted to go to this camp that you had been going to since forever. I had never done camp before and asked my parents, my parents reluctantly said yes. I convinced them by telling them about how there was canoeing, and a giant pool with a trapeze, and a day where all you do is play commando in the forest at night. Sounded rad. You left off the part where 80% of it was Christian related, where I'd have to sit down with a councilor and have them tell me to my face that I should ""probably talk to my friend (Indian and Hindu) about Jesus Christ"" because he might not go ""where we go"" when we die, that I would spend a significant part of my time learning bible versus I didn't agree with. I felt obviously uncomfortable, but I guess I was still too young to understand why.

A couple years go by. You trick me into attending various church events you knew I wouldn't want to be a part of with promises of rock climbing or Frisbee golf. One time you were up front with me and asked me to come to church because if she brought someone you got a prize or something which I wanted you to win. Got there, ""do I have to sign something?"". No. There was no prize, there was no game.

Fast forward to high school. I see on facebook one of those ""say 15 things you can't say to certain people"" posts. Thought I'd snoop, it's just a stupid facebook game anyway. But I find there's one that talks about a ""friend I've known since kindergarten who has gone down the wrong path in life and I pray for him every day"". She's been home schooled all her life, I AM that friend. I ask her about it, ""what wrong path?"" She avoided the question. I'm doing well for myself, but I've gone down a wrong path apparently.

I got into an argument with her whole family about evolution and how the world isn't 6000 years old, but that's another story altogether. We even traded literature on it, I'd read your two books on flood geology and you'd read Dawkins' ""The Greatest Show On Earth"". A month later, I returned yours because I read it. ""Oh, I still haven't finished the first chapter."" Of course not.

But we're still friends right? She wants to hang out all the time. Everytime we're at Denny's now catching up, talking about some random topic that would be small talk even by a stranger's opinion because I don't want to bring up anything that would slightly challenge your views on anything. I mean, for goodness sakes, you don't watch Glee because ""my Mom said it was inappropriate"". You mean, because they have a gay character right? You're Mom also doesn't let you live on campus of the college you attend which is an hour away from your home because that would involve having to get a vaccine which you also don't believe in. Having her make decisions like what you watch on tv is definitely what a 19 year old should be doing. But I stay away from those topics because I know they upset you.

But there are a few questions I want you to still answer. Is the only reason you're friends with me is because you think you can ""change"" me? Am I still on that ""wrong"" path? How often do you pray for me, honestly? I would really like to know that. Am I going to hell? I don't believe in hell, but to assess our friendship that would be a very apt question to have answered. Because if I did believe in hell, I would think pedophiles and serial killers would go there... not people who just didn't believe something you did. So, if I am, am I really that wretched in your eyes? Am I some kind of demon your exorcising by asking me to go to bible camp with you?

I have a great deal of fucking problems with the mass amount of temps places hire to begin with. For one its awful for the fucking economy as a whole. Also you are decreasing the quality of life physically, and mentally as well im the US. But this is just a start...

Today I got called to my managers desk and was presented with a broad question...""how have things been between these two employees?"" So in return I give him a broad answer giving some example of there typical interaction and nothing from what I could see was effecting the work place or making a hostile work environment. His response to this is ""well that isn't specific enough and I'm ex-military...(small ignorant ass rant about how this makes him extra powerful and some BS)...and I have no problem terminating your contract as a temp here with us.
Okay at this point I am already nervous as fuck cause this guy is on some fucking power trip and he just threatened my employment because he can and he knows this will make me say something even if complete BS because I am fear of losing my job cause he doesnt have to have a real reason to fire me because of my temp status at where I work.
So I try to be more specific and he stops me and said ""no I need SPECIFIC."" and fucking glares at me like I'm a complete dumb piece of shit.
Finally after about twenty minutes of this shit he is satisfied with the stories I have told him  and mentions my employment here being temp and I leave.
This is fucking 100% BS!! I understand want specifics but throwing your ignorant ass ex-military mentality of threatening me is crap. I might be a temp but that is because The ecomony sucks dick and thats basically the only jobs open where I live, hell I drive over an hour to work every day for $12/hr because its the best employment I can find and there is a slight chance I might get hired on. 
But all im all the whole fact that US employers have approximately half of there staff as temps is complete and utter BULL SHIT!!! Ans it doesnt help that when you hire them that Your employees treat them like crap because they cant do anything about it. Not to mention when that the people they put in charge are ""ex-Military"" and beleive the only way to skin a cat per say is to kick it to death, beat it with a hammer, set it afire, and then blow the fucker up.

A few mutual friends set me and her now fiance up on a date, it fell through on his end b/c he (Jason) and Jessie were quietly dating. So J&amp;J decided to set me up with a friend, it didn't work because said third person said zero words on our group date. So... One night Jessie &amp; I went out to a comedy show and met up with Jason and his friend... Robert... yeah, Robert. That night Robert and I really hit it off, and we exchanged numbers the next day and have been together ever since. Well, I tried hanging out with Jessie a few more times and because I had been talking with Robert so much, I'd reference him in our conversations. She got mad because all I ever talked about was now Robert (not true, but I would use him as an example from time to time on stuff). The last time we hung out was at the movies, and Robert was coming into town to visit me and see Jason as well; I tried setting up an outing the 4 out us and she literally shut down in front of me. Crossed her arms and sank into her chair. I dropped it, and we never got all together when Robert came into town that next time. 

SO ANYWAYS... during one of the pay it forwards I made her a quilt and I guess she loves it (and barely said thanks for it), but she's super rude to me all the fraking time. We've visited (I moved to live with Robert after about 9 months together) quite a few times and only once has she made herself available to come out with Jason, Robert &amp; I. That time she made fun of me for being out of shape (while climbing at altitude when I hadn't been in Colorado for about a year). She's just rude. 

And now Jessie &amp; Jason are getting married. I just replied a positive RSVP to her wedding (which is the same day as a friend here, but we'll be there in CO so I feel bad) and I asked her if there was anything happening for bachelor/ette parties - here's her literal response: 

*Don't ask me about Jason's plans. Bachelorette party will be weekend of Labor Day in Vegas*

So basically, I'm not invited to her party (was never expecting it, but you know... I hate Vegas so I wouldn't have gone) YAY!!! But I really need to know when my fiance, Robert, and I need to get into town. She's such a witch. I wanted to say something super snotty back to her, but I don't need to cause drama with Jason &amp; Robert. Not fair.

Guh, I just needed to vent/rant/bitch/piss &amp; moan about her shiz. Robert and I think she's just petty and jealous b/c we started talking right away and dating within about a month of meeting, but she and Jason took almost 3 years to get off their butts and do something about it. When we did hang out this second to last time in CO, she was just very off putting and rude even to Jason. I feel bad that he's picked this woman to love - but I have no say over someone else's heart. 

**TL;DR:** old/ex-friend is too bitchy to even FB chat with anymore and I just want to punch her, but instead I'll be giving her amazingly embarrassing gifts for her wedding.

Our innocence wrapped in ignorance, it carried us into what we imagined was adulthood.  You a high school senior and me just barely graduated we did what most kids our age did...  And not like most, we left our lover's embrace with a new life.  A child, our child, our life.  Now that child is 14, and though we have made it this far in our lives as divorced parents, we have always done so with a bond.  A bond that is almost as powerful as when we made her.  We may be re-married and with new children of our own, but there will always be that bond between us.  It will not falter, waver, or retreat in disparity.  It remains solid.  You remember, when we were children each with our own divorced parents and how they brought vile home with them, they spat hateful words about our other parent behind their back.  We witnessed it all and somehow managed to walk away from it almost unscathed.  We did carry a scar however, a small one at the back of our hearts.  A matching scar if you will, a scar that stood as a reminder like a string tied to a finger that very much so molded our relationship with our daughter.  We raised her as most divorced parents would not, together.  We swore to throw away all pride, all remorse and all resentment.

""tradgedy has struck in the state of florida...17 year old trayvon martin was killed today by a white [Hispanic idiots] George Zimmerman""

But did you know that from 12 am this morning to 12 pm at night..... a total of 45 people will be brutally murdered in the u.s....... where is their new coverage? Why does the trayvon martin case get full time coverage? Why does it get so sensationalized that the president make multiple public statements about it. What makes this case any different from what happens with the other murders? The news makes a deal out of it.

""BREAKING NEWS, A sentor has been investigated for sexually harassing his co-worker"" 
     so? As of this day approximately 215 children will report being molested, in many cases multiple times...... were is there news?

""Britney spears has been once again caught driving over the legal limit""
     So? today 49 people will die due to alcohol related accidents... were is there news?

""Micheal douglas has been diagnosed with cancer""
     So? 1.4 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer each year..... were is there news?

Every time I turn on the news it is some glorified story about a celebrity taking out their daily life, why should I care? I have a life of my own, what makes their situation any different from mine? Because they are a celebrity does not make them any more important than the rest of the people in the country. For example... the royal baby, OH YAY, THE ROYAL COUPLE IS HAVING A BABY! I MUST MAKE SURE I WATCH THIS GO ON BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT......... who cares? Why is the '""royal"" couple having a baby any more important than the hundreds of dedicated parents who are expecting a baby?  

It is either celebrity's or small occurances that are hyped up by the new (ex. trayvon martin) that make up our daily information intake. 
Just because an even like the trayvon martin case happens doesn't mean you need to go ape over it, daily things like that happen..... it's not news? They take small stories of a mass of horrible daily actions and they germinate on it, why?

The news is only good and only should be used for: traffic, weather (which are both being wrongly predicted) and stories that will affect a large group of people, or a terrible occurrence with mass victims that is needed to watch so we can actually think and help each other. sigh.

Today, I discovered a 17 year old I knew from high school is now pregnant. Everybody is congratulating her and telling her they're happy for her. It makes sense though; if you say otherwise you'll get ridiculed, and told to go away. 

I can imagine their future from that point on. Don't get me wrong, many teen moms become successful, but the fact of the matter is, most teens are too immature to fully take care of themselves, let alone an infant that is completely dependent on you. They will likely be stuck in this town (which almost every teen claims they hate the town and want to leave), and definitely struggle, if not drop out, of high school. 

I'm only 19, but I have to take care of my sister with Autism and manage to pay 2/3 of my rent with my minimum-wage job. The thought of getting pregnant right now frightens me to no end, yet these kids are excited about it? 

Granted, most of them probably have their parent(s) to rely on, but I still have an issue seeing why teenagers become thrilled with the idea of being a parent at such a young age. 

I think what makes me most angry about this is there is a clinic in this town that will supply you with free condoms and birth control. There is even a variety of birth control: pills, shots, bars, etc. You don't even need parental consent; you can walk right in, ask them for an appointment, and in two weeks you will start off with three months of Orthocyclen. Then after you check up you get a years worth. 

Why are all these teenagers getting pregnant if it is so easy to prevent it?

**Side Note**: I am not trying to insult teen moms; they are brave and strong for being able to do such a thing, which I know I could not handle currently. But I wish teens could be a little more careful when the consequences come to something as serious as raising a child. 

TL;DR Teenagers should become more aware of birth control options.",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_1i291v,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i291v/there_is_an_unbelievable_amount_of_teenagers/,

1373303117.0,13,self.rant,1hvh4q,My stepdaughter is abused and neglected and there's nothing we can do about it.,14,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hvh4q/my_stepdaughter_is_abused_and_neglected_and/,"I have been with my SO for eight years. When I met him, his beautiful daughter was just 3. The first time I met her I knew there was something wrong. She was more shy than anyone I had ever known, and I am shy myself so I understand what its like. But this girl, was not just shy, it was like she was scared of people. Terrified even. When I would see her coming from her Mom’s, she would always be dirty, matted hair, disheveled, tired and hungry. I was just the girlfriend then, though, and really didn’t have a good enough look into her life to know if something was seriously wrong. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, I gave her mother the benefit of the doubt. I just wanted to get to know this little girl because he father meant something to me. Let’s call her Sarah for ease of reading. Anyway, Sarah has an older sister, same mom different dad. We’ll call the older sister Jennifer. Jennifer’s Dad was a deadbeat and basically disappeared from her life when she was around 7. So my SO has basically stepped in to be Jennifer’s Dad too. We treated both the girls the same, even though only Sarah was biologically related to my SO. When Sarah came for her weekend, so would Jennifer. 

So, over the years, I bonded with both of them. I learned that Sarah and Jennifer basically fend for themselves when they are at their mom’s house. Jennifer was basically raising Sarah. When it was their weekend to come over, Jennifer would pack Sarah’s bag. When I spoke to Jennifer I was able to find out that she did all the laundry, she fed Sarah when they were at home, cans of soup and noodles and Kraft Dinner. I learned that they never, ever, ever make it to school on time and miss tons of school days. Their mother has always been notorious for being late for everything and has not been able to hold down a job because of it. We’re not talking 5 or 10 minutes late, we’re talking hours and sometimes days. There are no exceptions, in the eight years I’ve known all of them, their mother has not been even near on time for one single thing.  I really wish I were exaggerating. I really do. 

I also learned that their mother had boyfriends on and off and they would move in with them almost immediately. It was more of a money necessity thing than it was about her being in love. Having someone to pay the bills was the idea. These guys were no prizes either, we would get calls about him hitting her in front of the kids, and once we got a call while she was driving saying he was pushing her while driving with the kids in the car. But of course, when we go to report it she doesn’t want to get the guy in trouble so she won’t say anything. 

So, because this woman can’t hold down a job, she gets evicted from every place she lives and so the kids have to move around all the time. In the past 3 years they have both changed schools 3 times, and lived in 9 different homes, including couch surfing at aunts and cousins and friends.  Sarah has a bed wetting problem and the laundry never gets done which means she sleeps in her own waste every night and goes to school in filthy, urine-smelling clothing. Their home is a disaster, filth and mess everywhere and they keep adopting animals and then when they get to be too much they surrender them at the shelter, and then they adopt more animals. And so on and so forth. Over and over. At one point Sarah had a pet rabbit who was kept in the garage at one of the places they lived and I am positive that thing was forgotten about and starved to death alone in the garage.

Sarah has an eye condition for which she had to have surgery when she was 6. The doctor explained that in order for her to heal properly, she needed to wear a patch and glasses every day. Of course this didn’t happen and now Sarah needs surgery again and will probably never have good enough eyesight to get her driver’s license. 

In the 8 years I have known Sarah she has been to the dentist once and that was after we fought and fought and fought her mother to finally have her on our coverage and we set up the appointment and we took her.

We have, throughout all of this time, reported her to the ministry of family development here in BC. She has files on her in 6 cities throughout BC. She has been reported by a counselor Sarah is seeing, she has been reported by Sarah’s friends families, she has been reported by a retired suicide counselor and a retired school teacher. The ministry shows up at her house, asks if everything is ok and leaves. They do nothing about any of this. 

In 2008, Sarah’s father and I had our first child together, a boy, we’ll call him Tommy.

About 3 years ago, after losing her job once again, Sarah’s mom decided to move them to the Okanagan. She did not have any housing lined up there, nor a job. They were just going to drive there and wing it. This is about 6 hours away and would have cut into our time with the kids heavily. So we took her to court to stop her. We also urged the courts to consider letting Sarah live with us. The courts told Sarah’s mom that she was not to move the children outside of the Lower Mainland but that they would remain in her care. In order to move them from the Lower mainland, she was required to have written permission from Sarah’s father. This is in a signed court document. So she midnight moved to Chilliwack (about 2 hours away) without our consent and told us as she was doing it. We called the police to enforce the agreement and found out that the only way we could enforce the agreement is by taking the mother back to court, which would mean we would have to serve her again with papers, in Chilliwack, while she was avoiding us at all costs. The situation was fucking impossible. 

They have since moved back because of course she lost her job again and of course she was evicted. After a year or so of bouncing around on couches, she moved back near us and we were relieved that they were closer. But on Christmas eve this past Christmas, she came and picked up the girls from our house after they had a visit with us, drove them home and then texted us that she had nothing for them for Christmas, that they had been notified of eviction in November and that at any moment there would be a sheriff there to remove them. She told us she didn’t put up a tree or stocking or anything, she didn’t even have cards or anything for the girls. This was being told to us at 11:30pm on Christmas Eve. To be clear, had we known, we would have happily had them here over night and had their stockings up and been prepared to fill them up with gifts and treat everything like there was nothing out of the ordinary, but we were given zero notice. We insisted on picking them up in the morning so they could come and open their gifts from us anyway and have some kind of Christmas. 

Now she has been hired by her Uncle, who we know to be involved in drug trafficking. She says she is cleaning his house for 8 hours a day, 5 days per week. She rents a house for $900/month, and has a brand new phone, pays for Jennifer’s phone bill and drives about an hour to and from work each day so she pays a lot for gas. How is she making this kind of money cleaning her Uncle’s house? This makes no sense to me. We have continued to report her. Sarah’s friends families continue to report her. The child is neglected and needs help and no one will do anything about it. 

When Sarah comes to our house on Friday nights, she is unhappy, messy, unclean, smelly, hair tangled and unwashed, dressed in filthy ill-fitting clothes and comes empty handed. We immediately get her in the bath, get her in some clean clothes we keep at our house, and work on talking to her and cheering her up. By Sunday, she leaves happy, relaxed, clean. Then the cycle repeats itself.

We have gotten Sarah into counseling and her counselor was almost immediately shocked at her level of care and immediately reported the situation to the ministry.

Over the past couple of months, Sarah and I have been planning her 11th birthday party. When we first came up with the idea for the theme (macklemore, haha) I told her we needed to clear it with her mom first because I didn’t want to take the planning of her daughter’s bday party away from her. I knew full well though, that she wouldn’t plan anything for Sarah’s party until it was far too late because this is how it happens every year. So I spoke with her mom on two occasions, she spoke with her mom on several occasions and my SO spoke with her on several occasions. She knew we were planning the party and in her own words said it was fine. So we made plans, we sent out invites (you can see them in my submitted links). We have had 11 kids RSVP that they are coming. We bought Sarah a new outfit and we bought prizes for the games and ordered the cake. This is happening this coming Saturday. 

So last night we asked Sarah’s mom if we could have her for a few extra days this week. She said that we could for two but that on Wednesday she was taking the girls to Drumheller, Alberta. A 12 hour drive. Sarah’s party is on Saturday and this woman is notoriously days late most of the time. We knew that if Sarah went on this trip she wouldn’t make it back for her birthday party. We questioned the intelligence of this, and her mother said that she basically didn’t care because we didn’t clear the party with her first. WHAT???? We all did on several different occasions. I have emails and text messages and so does my SO, proving we spoke to her about this. 
I just am at a loss. I don’t know what to do. The government won’t help this child, and she is sad and depressed and headed for real trouble. She has a home here with a clean room and clean clothes, and structure and love and routine and a little brother and pet dog. 3 square meals a day, homework help, love and support. But yet they leave her in the filth of her mom’s home, her mom ruining every special day of the year for her. Most of the time when Sarah is not at our house she is at someone else’s house, she is rarely at home getting pawned off on anyone who will watch her except us, just to spite us. Her mother just wants to party, she goes to every rock concert in Vancouver no matter what the cost all while her kids live in absolute filth and poverty. She has left Sarah home alone at age 7, she is likely working for a drug dealer and no one the fuck at all will do a goddamned thing. I am ready to denounce my fucking citizenship and burn my goddamned passport. I was under the fucking impression I lived in a first world country where kids THE FUCK MATTER. 

This child is having her childhood ruined, stripped from her. She is heavily affected by the way she has had to live. Her older sister has even expressed anger about it and is now on anti-anxiety medication because of the panic attacks she suffers due to her upbringing. Sarah is obsessed with people who have killed themselves, and talks about Amanda Todd all the time. This child is in danger and needs help and it seems like only me and her father give two fucks about it. 

We can’t afford a lawyer. We can’t get help anywhere. I don’t know what to do and I am so sad and fed up. This child means as much to me as my own and I am witnessing her be broken apart. I just can’t understand why no one cares.

Nothing helps us relax more than gently pushing each other off the couch. It's not meant to be competitive or threatening, and it never will be.

One jerkass kid didn't get the memo.

My youngest brother had a friend over and we all joined in to have a huge Nerf war. After thirty minutes or so the darts ran out and the battle progressed to a hand-to-hand showdown on the couch. We wrestled and I took care to be especially gentle with our nine-year-old guest. I grabbed his arm, was just about to roll him over and **WHAM!**

Full-strength karate chop straight to my throat. 

I desperately struggled to gasp for air. When a breath finally came, it felt like it was coming in through a plastic straw. I coughed so hard it felt like my lungs were gonna fly out, each contraction coming with a stab of knifelike pain.

When I finally regained my breath, I realized that I nearly could have died.

""Suck it! I'm a red belt in Karate!""

Being twice his size and trained in Karate myself (thankfully at age 15), I used all my willpower to keep myself from rearranging his organs and calmly explained the danger of using [death blows](http://www.wikihow.com/Learn-Martial-Arts-%22Pressure-Points%22) in friendly roughhousing. His response?

""Whatever. Get a life, loser"".

No. Just no. With great power comes great responsibility, and no nine-year-old little shit should be given the power to kill someone over not going to McDonalds or to impress their friends. As I type this, my throat still hurts and I feel unusually drowsy. I don't give a fuck about self defense. If you really want to protect your kid, teach them how to avoid fights, not encourage them to start one.

1372733801.0,13,self.rant,1hh01j,Fuck Sears,16,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hh01j/fuck_sears/,"I started at Sears a little more than a month ago and let me start off by saying the rumors about the company going down the shitter are true. The entire store is understaffed, customers are constantly complaining about not being attended because everyone is swamped at the registers, and the management has their heads shoved so far up each others asses that they can't even smell how bad their shit stinks. Next time you walk though a Sears take a look at the registers. There aren't too many to begin with and the majority of them will be empty even on the busiest days of the week. The boys department in mine has never been used, they don't even bother turning them on half of the time. 

And now for the credit cards. As you may or may not know the sole purpose of Sears is to make sure you get one of their credit cards. We have to get a certain amount every day or else our bosses start talking shit about us. Basically how it works is for every $1000 sold you have to get one credit card. Now that may not sound bad but what happens when someone buys $500 worth of items? Well your shit out of luck because you now have less opportunities to get a credit card and be positive. And someone buys AT LEAST $500 at once every day.  Usually more. So far I'm negative 22 credit applications. I ask every customer, twice. I make shit up, lie, offer them discounts that I shouldn't, and trick people into getting in but I still come out negative. I get at most 3 a day but my fucking co-workers who come in with their low cut shirts and push up bras always get 5+ a day. I can't flirt with the fat horny Cuban men who haven't even seen their wives dried up wrinkly pussy in years, and because of that I'm getting fucked over. 

My boss is the biggest cunt as well. She constantly talk behind my back, treats me like I'm a bumbling idiot, and I've never heard her speak without that stupid sarcastic tone in her voice. She tells everyone how I'm lazy, but I'm the only god damn one who actually tries to help the customers. Everyone runs down stairs or hides in the in the back folding clothes. She says I'm not working hard enough to get credits, even though I've asked ever single fucking customer I've rung up. And she doesn't even want me at the fucking store. The only reason I'm working in this shit hole is because HER boss liked me. She at least realizes I'm one of the fastest on the register (BECAUSE I CAN FUCKING READ WHAT IT'S SAYING) with the exception of red head but I replaced her on the floor, she does stock now. 

And on top of it all, no one in my department speaks English except for me. Nothing against them but it's a little frustrating. My co-workers are a decent bunch of people. Except for you candyass, and my boss. 

TL;DR? Sears sucks, it's unemployed, the system with the credits is fucked, and my boss is a stupid cunt who has a dumb hair cut. You look like a boy!",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_1hh01j,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hh01j/fuck_sears/,
1372624300.0,13,self.rant,1hdsoa,Asshole Coach,19,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hdsoa/asshole_coach/,"Ok, so this is kind of a long story, so I'll try to keep it brief, but just to preface this, my rowing coach is literally the worst person I know.

So, now the story. I am just a regular guy. I was never especially athletic. Up until high school I had never even played a sport, but when it came around a friend convinced me to row. From the beginning I was fairly mediocre. I wasn't very big or athletic, and I lacked motivation due to my lack of confidence. Success just always seemed too far out of reach.


That is until junior year. As a result of a combination of a few things I worked my ass of junior year and earned my spot in the priority boat along with a novice. Now this novice was no ordinary guy. Novices who aren't freshman have a hard time making the team let alone making the priority boat. This guy was fucking gigantic, and is probably the strongest guy on the team. Long story short, we won one of the biggest races on the east coast, and we were all very proud. 

Now comes the rant part. So at the end of every school year, our team has a big banquet. We say goodbye to the seniors, look back on the year we had, and give away some awards, namely the ""Most Improved Athlete"" award. Now I'm not a cocky person, but I had my eye out on that award. I had improved so much that I went from a boat in which the other member was cut from the team after the season was over, to having an undefeated season. Not that my other boat mates hadn't had the same amazing season, but they didn't start from the bottom like I did. So firstly, the banquet took FUCKING FOREVER. I mean, it was a school night, and we were there listening to my asshole head coach thank people until like 11. But I wasn't mad. I was just waiting for my award. I had made sure to be very humble to people beforehand. I never outwardly said I wanted the award to anyone but my friends and boat mates, who all agreed I deserved it. In fact most people on the team had, at one point or another, mentioned to me how incredible my improvement had been, and some even mentioned the award. I was always sure though to diminish its importance though. After all I knew I improved, and that's all that matters. Or at least, that's what I told them. 

So award time comes around, and my fucking asshole comes on the mic and makes an especially big deal out of this one even though everyone's tired and just wants to get home. Except me. I want my award.  

""Normally the ""Most Improved"" award is a difficult choice. After all this is a team where everyone is constantly improving. But this year the choice was obvious.""

Off to a good start.

""I'd like to offer this award to....""

My heart sank when it was given to the six foot five novice who had been in my boat. 

""When my son wanted this rower to join the team as a novice junior, I was hesitant, but he was insistent. So I met him, and I immediately knew he was in.""

My boat mates had all told me not to get my hopes up, but they weren't convincing me. God dammit sometimes I'm gonna feel deserving of something I've earned. You can't deprive me of that. 

Walking out of the room to my car, multiple people told me that it should've been me, and it continued over the next few days. But on to the rant.

Really? I mean.... I was literally the worst rower on the team, and went on to being in the top eight, and you're gonna give the ""Most Improved"" award to a novice who's predisposition to rowing is so significant he could join two years behind everyone and still be incredibly successful? You literally told a story highlighting exactly why he shouldn't have been most improved. You told us all about how you IMMEDIATELY knew he would be a success. How could he have improved that much if you INSTANTLY knew, just by the size of him, that he would be great?But not only that, you told everyone it was an EASY CHOICE!! LIKE I WASN'T EVEN FUCKING CLOSE?! WELL I'M GONNA LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE FUCKING SECRET! THAT ASSISTANT COACH YOU PAWNED ME OFF ON FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING IN ME IS THE REASON I AM WHERE I AM TODAY!! I AM A CHAMPION AND YOU CAN NEVER TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME!! I WILL NEVER STOP BEING GREAT, AND JUST IN SPITE OF YOU, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU JUST HOW MUCH I CAN DO!! NEXT YEAR, I'M COMING BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!! I'M GONNA BE BETTER THAN FUCKING EVER!! AND YOU KNOW WHAT?! YOU'LL STILL PROBABLY TREAT ME LIKE DIRT ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER SLIGHTLY LESS INCLINED ROWER BECAUSE YOU ARE A SELFISH SHALLOW FUCK, AND THE WORST PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!!!!

1371219681.0,13,self.rant,1gc7m6,Another housemate rant. [Long],15,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1gc7m6/another_housemate_rant_long/,"I don't know if it's just a problem with me now, seeing as I seem to have a problem with everyone. I know I get irritated really easily but fucking hell, I just want to be able to live with a group of people without falling out with most of them. Maybe it's their fault. Who knows?

Housemate A stopped talking to everyone out of the fucking blue, and at first we all thought we offended her somehow but no, she just decided to be a complete tool to everyone. Ignored all our messages when we tried to reach out. Most of us have dealt with depression, so it's not like we alienated her or made her feel bad, or didn't understand what she was going through. Hell, the least she could do is let us know she wanted space, and that would've been totally fine with us. In fact, it would be infinitely better than leaving us to worry about her and wonder what we did wrong. Found out later on that she pulled the same stunt last year, so any sympathy I had for her: gone.  It's a shame too because we got along really well.  She was crazy and fun to hang out with and now my already tiny friend circle is shrinking even more. Fanfuckingtastic. 

Housemate B has been alright up until the last week. She's moving out in two days and going on a gap year thing so I probably won't see her for at least two years. Initially I was annoyed but now I'm thinking, good fucking riddance. I used to dig the fact that she didn't give a fuck about what people thought, she was unique, and we could joke around about pretty much anything. I let so many things slide because I didn't want to seem petty but guess what? Turns out she fucking does. When we go out clubbing, I ask her how she is and she's just standing there pretending to shoot herself because she's that bored, and that sober. I go out clubbing to keep her company. I do it because she suggested it. And what does she do when she's there? Act like the most miserable cunt in the world.  


That's not even all of it. Like I said, I never brought any of that up with her because it would seem petty of me. Although in hindsight, it probably would've been better if I did tell her because that way all this shit wouldn't pile up on me right now.


Her and Housemate C seem to think it's okay to speak in French around me, knowing fully well I don't understand them. No guys, that's not alienating me at all. If you're going to talk about me, do it later over Facebook chat or something. If it's not talking about me, maybe saying it in English would be better, no? Cos that way, even if I'm not included in the conversation, I don't feel like a fucking idiot. And for god's sake, at least have the common decency to *not* speak in French in front of my boyfriend. Doing it in front of me is one thing, I just let it slide like most fucking things but don't do it in front of my boyfriend after you completely refuse to acknowledge his existence. That's just downright rude. His friends actually make the effort to make me feel welcome. They don't have to engage me in a proper conversation, but at least they make small talk.  


I recently messaged Housemate B because I could sense a lot of tension and I wanted to make sure things were okay, and that I wasn't overthinking things. LOL NOPE. Turns out she's ""disappointed"" in me because I make ""plans and don't act on them"". Right. Okay. So *I* paid for three tickets for this cocktail party, for me and Housemates B and C. I paid. Not once did I tell them to pay me back for it. It was just a little something from me, to them, so we  could enjoy a nice evening out. And they've been flakey when it came to deciding on a date for this night out, but hey, the tickets are valid til next month so whatever, no big rush. Only now, Housemate B is using that as an example. I don't owe her fucking anything, if anything, she owes me. If she wants to go to this party so fucking bad, she should just set a date for it but instead she's going out with friends and going off to festivals. She also said I say we should go out clubbing where we live and apparently I then don't act on these ""promises"". Right, so it's not like the last time I made the effort to go out with her we ended up coming home as soon as we left the house. Didn't even go anywhere near a club. And every other time we go out, she's the most miserable bitch ever. I'd rather stay home than go out with someone that keeps making suicide gestures every five minutes. I asked her why she didn't just tell me she had this problem with me apparently bailing on plans instead of just being stroppy with me, she said she messaged me on Facebook a few times. Except I went through every message we exchanged for the past few months. And every single time we tried to organise something, either she cancelled or she never replied to me. And every time I've been with my boyfriend at his place and Housemate B has asked me to go out with her, I've told her I'm not around but I'm more than up for doing something when I come back to our house.   


I've used our past messages to reply to every point she's brought up, and you know what, I'm just done now. I'm done with all of this. I'm glad she's leaving soon and I'm glad we're not living together next year because I can't be friends or housemates with someone that thinks the whole world revolves around them.

Someone commented saying that people exaggerate about having things like OCD, insomnia, etc. And this really hit home for me.  
  I have been struggling with Anxiety and panic attacks since grade school, and over time I've noticed how much people just claim to have anxiety. Like, ""Oh, I'm so scared about whatever fucking thing most people would normally freak out about, and I'm having a panic attack! I must have anxiety. It's so bad. Boohoo.""  
  Well, okay. First of all, ONE panic attack doesn't mean you have anxiety problems. And second, freaking out over something that should be freaked out about is totally acceptable!  
  Me? When I have attacks they are usually for no apparent reason. They are simply because my body can't control it's own fight or flight reflex. Whenever I have anxiety attacks people always say, ""Well, what's wrong? What's bothering you? Let's work it out, and then you'll be fine."" Except, nothing is bothering me, and no it's not that easy to ""get over it""!  
  So now, whenever I have an attack, or when I try to explain my attacks to someone I have to say, ""I ave anxiety disorder. No, like really. For no reason I sometimes freak out, and cry, and shake, and become immobile, and I feel completely and totally hopeless and helpless and awful. For. No. Reason. And there's nothing that you or I can do to stop it."" And yet people always still try to help me when they happen. Not that I'm not grateful, but really at that point you're just getting in the way.  
  Long rant, short: People belittling disorders like mine cause me to feel even worse about myself.  
  And what gets me the most is people who say, ""Oh yeah, I totally have anxiety attacks like all the time!"" and either smile or laugh afterward. Trust me, anyone who actually has this problem and knows what it's like will NEVER smile or laugh about it.

I'm moving in July to a larger house from my small apartment. My aunt was getting rid of a lot of furniture and offered me some things. I am taking her deep freezer and this really nice set of dressers. I drive a small car so I can't transport these things on my own. Today is the last day to get them because she is moving. 

Yesterday a friend on his only day off helped me move the freezer to my mum's house for storage till July. The dressers are too big for his truck, so I left them. My Aunt suggested I ask my father to move them since he has a large pick up. I thought, ""Good idea!""

When I asked, he said, ""Where are you going to store them?""
""At Mom's."" (because they don't fit in my apartment)
""Well I don't think that would be a good idea if I helped you then.""

I checked with my mother and she agreed. My father is unwelcome at her home. He is not even welcome in her driveway.

So because I can't take care of this problem myself, I don't get the dressers. Not only do I not get the dressers, (and this next part is the thing that I'm most upset about) but I am now inconveniencing my aunt. She has these two huge dressers sitting in an empty house that she could have sold or already moved. I am making her day harder. 

My parents can't just suck it up and deal with each other for five fucking minutes. Upon telling my dad my mum said no, I then got the lecture about my mother, and the rehashing of what went wrong between them, just like every time the topic of my mother pops up. I am sick of that conversation. I've been getting it for 12 years. 

It's not about the dressers. I'll find some. Buying dressers is not the issue. It's that when one (or both) of them offer ""help"" strings are *always* attached. I've also found that saying no to help is futile as well because then I get a lecture about not being grateful. If I refute or disagree, that becomes an argument as well.

I remember when they first divorced and things were really rough, I looked forward to being this age. I thought that living on my own and having a career, taking care of myself, would free me from these games they played with each other. But it hasn't. It's just made the games more convoluted and the relationships more strained.

So I guess there was the chick my guy was fucking before we met. He says that it was never a full blown relationship and that it was all on the down low because of who she was (best friend's sister). It's my understanding it was just a secret fwb-type thing.


Well he tried ending it (it was a long process as she just would't take it; kept saying ""no"") and while he's ending it, he meets me. We hit it off and start dating, all the while she continues to harass him constantly. We're great, things are fantastic between us.


Well she starts seeing that a new girl is in his life and proceeds to stalk me on facebook. I tell him that I'm not going to change my privacy settings or anything because *fuck her*, I'm not going to let her get the satisfaction. I'm not going to change things in my life and give you the pleasure of knowing that you've made an impact on me or our relationship.


All seems well for a few months. He tells me everything, it's all in the open; I ask him if she keeps bothering him and he says that she's slowly leaving him alone. Great!


But I guess this is not the case. This bitch has been stalking me so much that she now knows my reddit handle. And proceeded to bitch him out about a post I made that briefly mentioned her but in no way actually involved her, causing undue stress to both of us. He again asks me to delete my reddit so she can't have any ammunition. I again say no because really, *fuck her*. 


I can't even bitch her out or tell her to fuck off as I know it'll just make things worse for him and for our relationship. It could also ruin his friendship with his best friend. I wish I could punch this cunt in the babymaker. She even stalked outside his house once; I saw her as she was driving away.


I want to key your fucking car. I *need* petty revenge but my hands are tied because I care about my boyfriend.

And not some horse shit nap, and not at the fucking dinner table, but at night in the comfort of my bed. My cells need to repair, my brain needs to heal, my heart needs to rest. Only those who cannot sleep understand the pain of so desperately wanting what most creatures seemingly have an abundance of.

I envy you, because if I hated sleeping I would be the happiest mother fucker around. But I don't. I love it. I need it. And it's comparable to the feeling that those who starve must feel watching others gleefully throw a half eaten meal in the garbage. Sleep makes you sane and stable, and allows you to enjoy life.

WHY WOULD YOU FEEL THE NEED TO SAY THAT? im not sure whether youre just fucking with me or youre actually serious. im leaning on serious since i bet thats all you do with your time anyway. so i tell my mom exactly what im thinking. ""why would he say that to me? whats the point of that?"", and she says im not close enough to you. i say, why would i be, with the way he acts? and then he wonders why im not. so she talks to you. and what do you do, walk by my room and say ""i wont joke around with you no more, im tired of you already"".

So let me know if I'm being crazy:

Basically almost every thing my parents say is a question, a question about some sort of detail of my life either personal or professional.

if I don't provide my work schedule to them they ask me several times a day about my schedule. if I don't come home immediately after work my mom freaks out thinking i'm fucking dead or drinking a fifth of vodka driving down the road or some shit. My dad doesn't assume the worst but he still asks immediately as soon as I get home where I was and why I was late. 

 They also want to know where i am AT ALL TIMES, when exactly I'm leaving, where I'm going every time I walk out the door, and when exactly I'll be back. if I'm carrying anything when I walk in I'm asked about it (""What's in your hands/the bag/tucked into your hoodie pocket""). if I'm going out to hang with friends, they always ask who it is and then want to talk about who these people are even if they haven't ever met them. They say they are ""just making conversation"" but it seems like the only thing they ever ""make conversation"" about is details of me (and my brother's) life.

 I either didn't notice or didn't mind when I was in high school but I'm not a fucking kid anymore and I don't need to share every minute detail of my life anymore. This is compounded by the fact that there's basically no privacy in the house thanks to bedrooms being feet from each other and the downstairs mostly being one big open room. If I'm in my room with my door closed my parents will just yell up the stairs and expect me to come running that second. If I don't immediately drop what I'm doing they ask what I was doing. Sometimes its actually personal, like jacking off. Other times I just need a few minutes to wrap up my immediate task such as playing a game, reading, or doing some kind of paperwork. But all the same I don't want to answer that question every time i fucking walk downstairs.

I have nothing to myself anymore. It actually affects me because I am trying to get back into school but they ask me like every week if I've made any progress and soon it becomes less about trying to get my life on track and more about just getting them off my back, which is not healthy and is a recipe for failure. I know they care, and I admit I have been having a rough time in life lately but I need to do some things for myself.

Ugh. I didn't explain this very well because it has me all riled up. All I can say is its like the spanish inquisition and its driving me nuts because I have nothing to myself anymore. Am I overreacting?

I in no way hate women or degrade them. I treat them as I treat any other human. No more, no less, and they're rarely treated in an especial manor. And that's why I'm kind of pissed. There seems to be this sort of quasi-entitlement that we both birth unto and enable among a greater majority of the female population. Never hit a woman, women are the world in terms of relationships, and everything we as men (and some ladies) do is to attract women as mates.

Almost no matter what, if a woman does something, she or someone will find an illogical justification for it. Woman can make huge blanket statements and call it ""intuition"". They can manipulate and even falsify claims in their favour simply because of their reproductive parts and then have the audacity, the unmitigated gull, to blame men of objectification. Are you fucking serious? Yes, men tend to view certain women as objects. But most of those women are models or celebrities, then of themselves objects to marketing and a special brand of voyeurism called fame. They (well, most) accept that men will view them as such. Here and there they'll stand up for the empowerment of their kind, it's common. But those woman are objectified simply due to the fact that the industry they're in makes them objects.

The point does hold true, however, that once objectification reaches the civil masses, there's a problem. That I can agree to, as once you get into the real world, people are anything but objects, and those that objectify others are quite simply disgusting and singularly minded. But women do this too. And it's made worse by their oft outrageous claims against men because it's ""so common"" among them. It's not that it's common, it's that we're more forward about it. That's a very common male attitude; men are often very blunt and straight forward. It's the clearest line of communication as there's no discrepancies and no misunderstandings. It's not always deal in some social situation, but this line of communication makes up a very large portion of male culture, hence a lot of insult humour and the enjoyment of physical sports and extreme mechanics. 

Women, from my experience, do not do this. They do quite the opposite, making their lives more like a political drama intermixed with Martinis on Saturdays. Subtle cues and undertones are over-analysed by females and thus they tend to over-react and once they realised they've over-reacted, some are too far-gone that they can't find it in themselves to recognise their mistake. Again, not always true, but from perceptions of the every day citizen, it's extremely common. That aside, sexual desires and interests are rarely discussed outside the home or ""watering hole"", save for the occasional ""he's hot"" comment as a good looking male walks by or is mentioned. But this is exactly what I'm talking about. Given the subtleties of feminine communication, this is no worse than saying ""That girl has a nice pair of tits"". The only major difference being wording and slightly more open interpretation. But frankly, those implications are pretty clear. Take this for example, /r/LadyBoners. I realise that's a bit unfair, seeing as some of those men are famous and thus objects. But the fact that this even exists in the state that it does is, well, proof that woman are just as prone to objectification. Worse, even. And the ultimate sin is how they use their abilities to be objectified to their advantage. As the Eagles put it, ""City girls just seem to find out early how to open doors with just a smile"". And sadly, that's the dichotomy that occurs. Women are masters at manipulation so long as they're pretty and have the stones to do it. And it's rightly unfair that I have to feel like shit simply for being a male when women are often the ones causing grief or creating it, and then insulted when you call them out on it.

Am I alone her, or just rambling? At any rate, this is one of life's quirks that I find actually unfair and something that'd be easy to defeat. &lt;rant&gt;",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_1buh4v,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1buh4v/women_and_objectification/,

back on topic, I haven't been in a serious relationship in over 5 years, let alone have I even had a single girl even give me a second thought. Some days I just feel so depressed over the fact that I'm utterly alone.

I have one friend that actually even gives a fuck about me. I'm almost positive the other people in my life couldn't even be bothered to give a fuck and they only talk to me if no one else is around. Speaking of, this girl was all excited to tell me shes coming home from college for the next few weeks. That's cool, why even fucking tell me when you have no intentions of wanting to do anything together???

Lets not forget that I didn't even take high school seriously, never took my SATs was lucky to have all B's graduating year. I want to go to college for psychology but good fucking luck getting a job in that field furthermore, who the fuck doesn't want to have to sink 10 years into school just to graduate with 200k+ debt.

There's nights I drive home and all I want to do is drive my car into a tree at 90mph and just be done with it all.

and I swear to fucking god if someone tells me one more time ""the right girl is out there, she will come along eventually"" I'll fucking puke.

It has gotten so bad that I've been cockblocked by my own living room, even when we're in the bedroom. So why even clean up? Why not let it get so bad that you have to clean it yourselves? Because your personal spaces are fucking atrocious, I can't imagine the whole house looking like that. Even when the possibilty of eviction arose (it was all bullshit but we didn't know it at the time), you didn't do anything (with the exemption of one).

He had a table of people who were rude and crappy the entire meal.  He then proceeds to drop off their check.  They then inform him they wanted separate checks.  He split the check and delivered two checks.  One for around 30 bucks and one for around 55.  The person with the 55 dollar check complained about a 99 cent charge on his bill which was slightly arbitrary(they also complained about the high sales tax percentage), so my friend takes the check back and gets the 99 cent charge taken off it.  He then accidentally printed the 30 dollar check instead of the ""now 54"" dollar check.  Dropped the same check as the others at the table by accident.  So they ended up with two identical bills for around 30 bucks each.

Now comes the incredible part...  These people who were so picky to notice a little 99 cent charge on their bill and complain about the taxes proceed to pay the exact same amount in cash and take off very quickly.  So they shorted the server about 24 bucks on the overall bill.  And if that isn't bad enough!!  They leave a dollar each to combine for a total tip of 2 dollars and left the server holding the bag for a 22 dollar loss overall!!!!  Thankfully our manager was friendly about the incident and took off two items so the server didn't owe any extra for the rude table.

How are there people out there that are so cheap they will pull this kind of crap?  Do they not realize that someone is going to have to pay for this bill?

We were poor as shit and our parents had to work many jobs just to have enough to eat. Poor as in sometimes we couldn't afford the $0.40 school reduced cut lunches. My parents worked their way up, sacrificing everything, and now they can afford her a luxury like a fucking $10,000+ wedding.

I am to be her maid of honor, with six other bridesmaids in the party. Then comes the time to buy the dresses, in which she forced my parents to foot the bill for half the dresses. I had to buy my own because she didn't want to ask money from her friends. Whatever, angry time #1. After this, her friend didn't like her dress so my sister GAVE her friend MY dress without asking me ever, forcing me to shell out another $250 for another one.

I've never said anything to her about it, except that I think it's shitty that she let her friend have two FREE dresses and I have to shell out $500 total. I complain and she gets my parents to try to buy me out. I'm not okay with this. I got fitted today and the conversation turned to the old dress again after I found out my mom gave my sister my parent's credit card to spend whatever the fuck she wants, including the alterations to her dress and I had to pay for mine.

I brought it up to her again, not even asking for the money back. All I wanted was an apology and a confession that she continually chooses her friends over her family. She then freaked the fuck out and said that she has been paying for the entire wedding even though she got $3000 from my parents for Christmas just for her reception. I told her that she hasn't paid for everything- or really anything for that matter, to which she started screaming at me in the car with my mother on the ride home telling me that I need to ""shut the fuck up"" and that I need to ""grow up"" and to ""pull over the car, she has to get the fuck out and walk home."" My mother was driving and I was five miles away. When I didn't get out the car to walk home she started to call me names and say hurtful things and about how she thinks family members are more appropriate to foot the bill for her wedding and not her friends.

I wasn't letting up, but I also wasn't being an asshole. I just kept saying I wanted an apology. She then tried to open the car door and jump out to get away from me when we were driving 50 mph on a major six lane road, causing my mother to panic and scream.

My mother has cancer right now and my parents are getting to the age where they need to start thinking about retirement and medical bills. The fact that she did that to my mother is the most abhorrent act I've ever witnessed. My mother who gave her everything.

Combined with the fact that I'm broke as fuck. I only have $4 to my name until next week when I get paid and I'm too proud to even ask for a small trip to the grocery store to eat a normal fucking meal, and not sips of the last almond milk and whatever fucking leftover dried out cheese slices. I want to do it my own way and I don't want my parents to have to sacrifice any more than they already have.

I just don't understand how she can't feel even a little bit guilty about her $200+ trips to Victoria's Secret, her $1000+ shopping sprees, her $20,000 initial wedding reception, but cancelled last minute and lost my parent's $10,000 to have it a year later. Draining their savings, just to give her something they never thought they could.

I'm just so sick of her. I'm sick of her bridezilla bullshit. Her excuse to freak out and try to jump out in traffic going 50 mph, even as a threat. I'm sick of her never talking to me unless it's about her wedding, for over a year now. Her not even trying to apologize. Her throwing tantrums in public. Her shitty and victim attitude. Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her. She's a selfish fucking bully who has tormented me since I was a child. And I have to see her again in a few hours, where I'm sure she'll give me the silent treatment and ruin my dad's birthday party tonight. Fuck her.

He had his reasons, it was fine. But the way he did it... he broke it off with me out of the blue, no good talks, no explaination and Disappeared. Left the country.. He kept talking to me over facebook and skype, but barely answered, he was mean and acted annoyed. After all we had been through, after all the good times and love we had shared I was so shocked. I had no idea how to handle it and at one point I couldn't take this so called 'friendship' anymore. If he didn't want any contact, he should of said so or he should of stopped talking to me. Stringing me along like this and at the same time being so mean was crazy..

Now we skip a year and I didn't hear anything from him in the meantime. All of a sudden he sends me a sweet song on facebook. One saying; Stay the way you are, you're gorgeous like this. It made me smile and cry at the same time. I didn't know what to answer, so I said nothing. After one day of not replying he got kinda fucked off and said that this was his way of saying he wanted to chat again and that it was immature of me to keep ignoring him. I was really confused by this message.. it wasn't what I expected.

So we did chat for a little while and he kept the same tone.. cold, annoyed and like found me kinda pathatic. I tried to joke around and get the conversation friendly and fun.. but nothing worked. He pressured me to talk about my sex life, which I declined. He got annoyed and told me to speak up. Again; confused I told him about my current guy. He didn't believe I only had sex with one guy in the meantime and told about the dozens of girls he slept with in the past year. He told me he never wants a girlfriend again, because they are so much trouble (I was his first and apparently, only girlfriend). I took that kinda personal.. did I ruin the girlfriend-experiance that much!?

Crazy.. I used to miss this guy.. it's ALL gone. I have no idea why I should try to talk to him again, so I won't. I don't care anymore. He's still a dick and I can't really remember what it was like. He used to be sweet, loving and caring. But I can barely imagne that. I took a little while to think about the way he approached me and also about what I should do with this. After a while I wasn't confused anymore, but kinda fucked off. He dumped me (fine), stringed me along for a while (not fine), came back into my life (fine) still acting cold, annoyed and not interested (not fine). He has no place in my life anymore. I used to wonder how he was doing, if he still thought of me sometimes, if he missed me at some moments... But it's all gone. I barely think of him anymore and I really enjoy it. After he left I had so much insecurity issues. I scared away the guy I was/am so in love with because I was so insecure, so scared he would Suddenly leave, change his mind about me.. We're kinda fine again now :) Because I've been working so hard to get over these fears. It felt so respectless and arrogant of my ex to bust into my life like this. If he wanted to be friends, fine! But be friendly then.. don't be a dick. He brought back the insecurity, and it was quite a struggle to get it out of my head. 

So yea, fuck him. I'm going great without him in my life and I'm not planning to change that. It's always funny how the little things get to me the most. After that horrible and weird talk; he didn't say goodbye. I told him I was going because I had to study for an exam. He didn't ask what I was studying now, he didn't wish me luck, he didn't say goodbye. And that stuck with me the most. Made me so bloody angry xD. He's a fuckhead and he should stay away from me. So thanks, for showing me you actually ARE an asshole.. not only when you broke up with me, but you actually are a fulltime-asshole. That's fine.. I can invest my energy in someone else now. 

tl;dr Ex acted like an asshole when he broke up with me, but still wanted to stay friends. After a year he found Me immature because I didn't want to talk.

Working with Dasbaus, we were able to get her a very easy job filing paperwork and checking over a building at night (Easy as it comes). 

When she finally divorced her (supposedly) abusive husband, we allowed her to stay at our home, and store her personal belongings there as well.  We had to help her move, because she only had two days to get her stuff and leave, as her now exhusband didn't pay the rent for two months, and she did not know she was going to get evicted. 

We put gas in her car, because she had zero money and needed to go to work.  and we took time off of work to take her to court over her ex stealing most of her stuff that had any value, as well as child custody court (two seperate days and courts)   We also had to help her find an attorney that could work for cheap. 

After everything, she found herself a new boyfriend (the day she left her husband) and it turns out it was someone she worked with.  Instead of fighting her ex for custody and visits, she spent the next 4 weeks running around with the new boyfriend ""exploring"" their relationship, and buying whatever she could get her hands on, including a new smart phone (which she broke 3 days later in a tantrum), and new shoes that ended up costing as much as a brand new smart phone (without the contract).

She finally decided that I lived too far away from her boyfriend, and moved with family closer to him.  It took her 3 weeks to get her crap out of my house, and the only reason it is gone, is because I warned her to get it, or I would donate it to charity.  The next day she sent me a text claiming I ruined something of hers by storing it in my basment, and wated $50.00 to replace it.  I let her know, she can deduct that $50.00 from the $1700 we spent on her getting her moved, into court, and the time we lost form work for her making sure she actually showed up for her needed appointments.

She got mad and said I was being an Ass, and posted nasty crap on facebook.  Dasbaus and I decided to cut her off all together, as she got fired from work for multiple things, and her new BF quit because she had to leave.  

I finally decided that she is not worth any more of my time, and informed her of this, as well as to just forget about me.  The money lost was to help a friend and I did not expect it back anyway, but I told her the next chance she gets, she owes me my money, as she ruined everything with us.

And no, this is not just over the internet. This is how everything works in this country. You pay so much more than other people pay in other countries for way shittier quality of service, for ANYTHING. And YES, I'm comparing dollars to dollars, I'm not a fucking idiot. For example, this last week, we've had 4 electricity outages, about 6 hours of weak tap water pressure. Guess how much the electricity bill cost last month for about 5 light bulbs and 2 AC units on half the time, and 2 PCs and a TV on usually? 860 EGP; $180, yes, for one month. 

When i went to get my driving license, it took 8 fucking hours in the searing heat amongst 10s of other sweaty, smelly and frustrated fucking people. You think the test took time? Oooooh no, the ""test"" was doing a fucking u-turn. What took time was a combination of their decade old compute**R** failing repetitively, people cutting in line, people skipping the line altogether because they got connections, and that's how you do ANYTHING that has to do with legal papers here. 

And let's not even talk about the fucking attitudes of the majority of the people here. You walk outta the house, everyone's fucking depressed as shit. Nobody's smiling. You're lucky if they're neutral. Everyone hates their god damn lives, and for good fucking reason. I remember being a jolly ass kid several years ago. Now I feel uncomfortable smiling in public, it's like depression is a disguise I gotta wear to fit in.

You walk into a store to buy clothes? Guess what? Clerk's having a bad day, everyday, AND FUCK YOU. ""You wanna try that shit on too before buying it? uuuuuuuuuughhhhhhhhhh i make so much less than you, i hate my life, please fucking die"" express the majority of the store worker i've ever met.

Let's not even fucking go near being an atheist in a 90% muslim, 10% christian country. It's depressing to no end. There's no non-fake friendship or relationship for me in sight. There's no sex for me before marriage in sight either, god fucking damn it.

1347240090.0,14,self.rant,zmol2,Want to have a happy experience at a hotel? stop being an asshole...,16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/zmol2/want_to_have_a_happy_experience_at_a_hotel_stop/,"I work for a hotel in the Hilton family and I love it EXCEPT for some of the guest. I love helping people with their problems, don't get me wrong, if something is wrong with your room I am more than happy to help. But there are just some people that are complete assholes no matter the issue.

Here's a few things that can help your experience so me and you can leave the hotel happy. Seriously use these or think them over if you ever plan on staying at a hotel whether it be a vacation or your too tired to drive the rest of the way home.

1. If there's something wrong with your hotel room, PLEASE for the love of God, don't wait till the next morning and then tell me... I can't help that your room was 100 degrees due to the air conditioner went out, yes I know it may have worked when you first went into the room but a simple phone call can let me know that I need to move you to make you more comfortable. This has happened to many times to count, I am more than happy to help you move your luggage cause I know it sucks. All it looks like to me is that you never intended to pay for that room in the first place.(I know that's not always the case)

2.YELLING AT ME DOES NOT HELP. Plain and simple. You can try to embarrass/scare me at my hotel by raising your voice while everyone is down for breakfast but I'm 6'5 260 pounds and I could not give one shit about your problem if your yelling at me. Why should I want to help you? 

3. I personally hate hotel sites like Travelocity and Expedia. Nothing against them as a business because you may find one hell of a deal and that's great. But if there's something wrong with your room, guess what? you have to take your complaint to wherever you booked your room at because we can't do shit about it. We charge a business card that is i.e Expedia's credit card THEY charge you we don't. I had some one come down the other day that started griping at me because it showed his room rate higher than what he booked it on Expedia and he didn't want to be charged the higher rate, and I understand that but of course when I told him he would have to talk to Expedia, he started raising his voice, Well I didn't tell you to go through them it's your choice and you have to think about that before you book your room. 

4. Don't leave stuff you can't live without in your room especially if there's no lock box. Unfortunately we do live in a world where housekeepers are more than happy to take care of that pesky item that you love so much, doesn't happen to everyone and I haven't had a problem with it myself but don't think it can't happen to you. If you do have to leave something in the room, put it in your luggage at the bottom under all your clothes.

5.And make sure you have your big ticket items with you before you check out, it's amazing how many people are surprised that their item is not at the hotel still after they checked out 2 weeks ago...

6.Last and not least, be nice to your front desk clerk because they are the ones that are the most helpful in the hotel. I've made my rooms cheaper for someone who didn't like my rates but were very nice about it. One example, I had a guy walk in asked our rate and kinda seemed bummed out about it but was nice, he said he was going to ask his wife and I decided that I would change the rate once he got back in, BUT his wife came in bitching about the rate so I let them walk out. 

7.If we are sold out, we are sold out. I don't hold a room because you are a diamond member, you are not the only diamond member staying at the hotel. It's amazing how many Diamond members think that fucking own the hotel. I've had people raise their voice at me because we were sold out, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? I've been called a DOUCHE BAG because we were sold out. What the fuck do you want me to do about it? kick some one out? (coincidentally we have had some one want us to kick someone out before...)

Being nice does wonders, if there is something wrong with your room, and you come up and whisper the problem to me because you don't want everyone in the hotel to hear about it, I jump at the chance to give you your money back so that I hope you'll be back. I don't want rude people to come back, ever. Nice people I want to make their stay the most pleasurable experience in the world. If they have a problem, I will do back flips to fix it.

I feel so much better now, I've been wanting to get some of that off of my chest for a while.

But this has been on my mind for a while only because it's TOO pathetic and saddening, as well as disappointing. 

About a month ago, a couple of my best friends (I'll go with fake names John &amp; Mark) were going to a local music event that we had planned for a while. Me, wanting to be sure what time they were going, texts both John and Mark with no response. Okay, fine, whatever. I think nothing of it.

More ignoring ensues and eventually, after some time, I inquire Mark about the whole deal. He comes forward and explains how they both thought I was ""being annoying"" and ""complaining about how I don't get my way with women too much"". Okay, what the *fuck*? The last time I did that was like 5 months ago and I got over it in like 3 fucking days. Meh. Whatever. I tell him we all complain and talk shit every once in a while and that I'd be more mindful of my ""annoying habit."" It's not worth a friendship and he agrees.

John, however, continues to ignore me. This kid used to be one of my closest friend and doesn't even have the guts to come forward and be honest. Every time I ask him a question up front, he just shakes his head and looks away like I'm begging for some money. Okay, fine. Be a little pussy. I think nothing of it, people change all the time it happens.

A couple weeks later, another good friend of mine (Mike), who has not once talked shit behind my back, asks me if I can pick his girlfriend from the airport. Yeah, sure. Of course. The next day, Mike talks about it to John (who both are friends), who then advises him to ""not bring Jack (me) along because he's awkward around girls."" [My reaction.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1tcdvKygW1rrmfzqo1_500.gif)

First of all, I *helped* him and his current girlfriend get together. I got them together because he was having issues with his feelings and couldn't, wait for it -- ***CONFRONT*** her. They get together and she starts calling me almost on a daily basis because she's all sad/depressed since he keeps breaking up with her on and off. Now they're stable, but if it weren't for me, there would be no goddamn relationship in the first place!

As for me being awkward around girls, I wasn't even raised in America, even though I'm half-American/Chinese. I've been surrounded by open, intelligent, interesting people for most of my life with my greatest relationships all occurring overseas. And John, some shallow, sheltered, holier-than-thou, my-opinion-is-best, smug (which, by the way, is 90% of kids here) motherfucker thinks he's got *me* figured out? [LOOOOL](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1qgdfiefC1qi6mxw.gif). Even Mark, Mike, and another one of my good friends ALL agree he's become such a *shitty* friend. And he doesn't even know that his actions in the last three weeks has just proved nothing but that. 

But whatever the fuck. I typed this shit up so fast and furiously that I'm pretty much over it now. I don't care who reads this or thinks it's absolutely retarded. Maybe it is. Maybe I'm an overreacting little pussy. All I know is, place your trust wisely because sometimes you get this sad, shitty feeling knowing that you've invested that trust and time on a fucking *idiot*.

I've been ~~participating~~ lurking at /r/atheism for quite a while now. I liked what I saw at first. But now, that entire subreddit seems like one big circlejerk used to promote your own goddamn political or anti-religious ideals rather than ATHEISM, like the subreddit is supposed to.

You do not have your own definition of ""atheism"". Atheism is not your political ideal. Atheism is not anti-religious. Atheists are not irreligious. Atheism is not rationality. Atheists do not simply ""not believe"" or ""arrive at that conclusion"".

Atheism is simply the rejection of belief in deities. Nothing more. At all. Zip. Nada. Nani mo. Nichts. Nichego.

Stop promoting your political or anti-religious stance under the guise of atheism, because NOT ALL ATHEISTS think like you. Buddhists, Satanists, Jains (Jainism) and many other religious people are atheists.

Similarly, NOT ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE IRRATIONAL THEISTS. I am an atheist but religious. I believe in science, evolution and all that cool physics 'n shit. But guess what? Not all atheists do. Buddhists think life begins *before* conception, beating creationists by a full step. Not all atheists are liberals and not all atheists support gay marriage (I do, though). Atheists are not morally superior than theists. Scientific literacy is not exclusive to you.

To say that ""atheism"" is the opposite of religion is ""false dichotomy"", or ""false dilemma"". False dichotomy is black-and-white thinking. In other words, you're creating a scenario in which you have ONE alternative to your current choice, for a grand total of a whole TWO FUCKING CHOICES. You have many more than two choices.

You can be an irreligious atheist, as are *most* atheists, or you can be a religious atheist like Buddhists (you know, those guys that *don't* equate atheism with irreligion). Or you can be a religious theist (Christians and the like) or an irreligious theist (Deists). That, and atheism/theism are totally different ideas than religion/irreligion.

I think I've had it with wading through the filth in the cesspool of /r/atheism trying to find a post that isn't a rage comic, pro-gay rights or some political bullshit that has nothing to do with atheism at all.

1335303268.0,12,self.rant,sqmi5,Was looking forward to this for a long time. Teacher fucked it up to the point of embarrassment.,15,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/sqmi5/was_looking_forward_to_this_for_a_long_time/,"I realize this is a huge firstworldproblem but I don't give a fuck, I'm on my period and I'm angry. 


So, I'm taking a class on the Sixties in college. I'm very, very big on lots of the music played in the sixties in particular. So when the teacher said we'd be having a music day I was psyched. Now, the teacher has made it clear that she is supposedly very well-versed in music. She said we could contribute to what was being played, so I spent days stressing over making the perfect compilation. Everyone has their obsession and this is mine, with Dylan in particular. Have you ever had one of those silly daydreams of showing your favorite stuff to the class and feeling cool for a day? I've been thinking about wanting to do something like this for years. 

What happened, you ask?

Well, have you ever watched someone that didn't know how to use a computer, let alone youtube, try to do so on a big screen in front of the entire class?.... So you see a large part of the source of my frustration. The biggest problem, however, was that she had nothing prepared.

*Nothing.*

You and I both know that you *can't* do that with youtube. Finding things on youtube is a science, and one with trial and error. She literally went on youtube and typed in a band name and went around trying to find a live version. Once she did, she didn't discriminate between shit and gold. For some reason she was dead set on finding a live version of everything, even though VISUALS DO NOT A GOOD PIECE OF MUSIC MAKE. She said that she wanted there to be visuals to make it more interesting, but we aren't fucking 3rd graders. 

The result? 


**The Who**: I'm pretty sure they were all drunk. Roger didn't hit a single note and stuttered half the song. Extremely early video, apparently. It was poor enough of a performance that when they smashed their instruments at the end (of which they only really succeeded in knocking over an amp) the class confusedly asked why the fuck they did that. When someone makes a kickass performance and then does that, the audience goes wild. When you bomb a performance and then do that, you look like idiots.


**The Velvet Underground**: In her quest for a live version, we ended up watching them air hump each other in The Factory while a couple of people *attempted* to play Venus in Furs in the back. It was perhaps the worst case of screechy-bad quality I've ever listened to. Among the screeching was a baseline that sounded kind of like it must've been Venus in Furs. There was no singing.

In terms of 60s music I *know* my way around youtube. I tried to point her to a proper video but she didn't listen.  You know, that infuriating thing where someone you're trying to help says ""yeeeeeah... let me just-' and clicks on something else.


**Joan Baez**: Horrible quality Blowin' in the Wind. Static was loud enough you could barely hear her sing. She stopped it a minute through because it has ""soooo many verses"". When it was over she said ""Hmm I think maybe Dylan wrote this but i'm not sure"" NO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK I THOUGHT YOU WERE A TEACHER ON THE 60S. I might give you a pass on a more obscure song, but that's like saying ""Hmm you know, I think the Beatles wrote Strawberry Fields Forever but idk.""
I told her that she could look up Newport Folk Festival videos that were great quality and she said ""But it's been going on until now even so we probably can't find stuff from the 60s"" and didn't take my advice. WHAT THE FUCK. Type in the year, jackwad! 

**Janis Joplin**: She looked for a live video for at least 5 minutes. It was painful to watch. She got fooled by the same still video 3 times, and every time she clicked Back to get back to the search results, she double clicked, so we kept seeing the Velvet Underground video again. Every time it happened she got extremely flustered and spent 15 seconds trying to figure out wtf just happened and how to undo it. I don't even know what was going on in the video that was eventually chosen. What she was doing on stage looked like a cross between a seizure and someone getting a bukkake. (singing included.) 

**Peter, Paul and Mary**: Blowin' in the Wind. A second time. WHY???

**Jefferson Airplane**: Now, I was very excited to see her type in White Rabbit. But alas, it wasn't meant to be. Live version, BAM! It wasn't complete shit, but there are some songs that are so  mind-bendingly perfect on the album, you're doing the song an injustice if you try to introduce people to the song through the live version.

**Jimi Hendrix**: We watched him do the pre-song making-weird-noises-with-the-guitar, at which point the teacher decided the song wasn't necessary and skipped to the next band.

She didn't use our playlists/requests at all.

1329022874.0,15,self.rant,plpoh,My problems with some people's justifications of subreddits about children being depicted in a sexual way (Part I of II),16,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/plpoh/my_problems_with_some_peoples_justifications_of/,"Certain comments I've seen have been frustrating, and I needed to vent. Not going to post links to said comments or the users that said them.

* 1) ""I can’t believe you people would want to censor something just because it’s not agreeable. They have a right to Free Speech."" - This has nothing to do with free speech or censorship. Reddit is a privately owned website. If the government came in and censored images or FORCED Reddit to take down certain subreddits, that would be a violation of free speech. However, Reddit has every right to choose to remove certain images or subreddits. 

* 2) ""They're just looking at pictures."" - Part of making the transition from fantasy to reality is normalizing the idea and practice. You start small, then work up. We don't (for the most part) consider torturing and killing small animals an acceptable outlet for someone with the desire to commit murder just because they're not killing other humans. We have found repeatedly that that behavior can, and often does, lead to violence against other humans. In addition, the images have to come from somewhere - yes, some are taken from facebook, others from professional studios, etc where the original intent was not sexual. This does not mean that ALL the content was taken with innocent intention and then recontexualized. 

* 3) ""It's not illegal if there's no nudity."" - Actually, no, it very often IS illegal, **even without nudity**, depending on content, context, and where the focus of the image is. Look up [The Dost test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_test) used to determine whether or not an image of a child is pornographic. Some of the criteria are:
&gt;    1. Whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area.
   2. Whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity.
   3. Whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child.
   4. Whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude.
   5. Whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.
   6. Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

* 4) ""If you shut it down, they'll just go somewhere else or make a new subreddit."" - Imagine if reddit was an actual, physical building where people met to exchange pictures and have discussions. If you knew there was a section of the building where people shared pictures of children and talked about them in a sexual way, and someone suggested that the owners of the building keep an eye on that room, report people in that room to the authorities if they actively discussed engaging in child abuse in a positive or premeditative manner, or maybe close it down altogether, would your argument be that ""Oh, they'll just find another room"" or ""They'll go meet in another building.""? You'd be okay with their activities going on unhindered because your assumption is that if they're stopped, they'll just go somewhere else? How does that make it right? Again, keep in mind normalization - not just in repetition of fantasies, but being in a social setting (virtual or otherwise) where they can find support and camaraderie. 

* 4a) “If you take away a place to view pictures, they’ll just go after kids irl” or “Would you prefer them to look at pictures, or stalk children?” - People seem to believe that all, if not most, pedophiles target children they don’t know through picking kids up in playgrounds, kidnapping, and of course the old cliché of the ‘windowless white van.’ This isn’t true. The majority of child abuse victims are easy access - family members or acquaintances. A [2001 study by Abel and Harlow that interviewed 4,007 adults ages 18-95 who had admitted to committing child abuse](http://www.yellodyno.com/pdf/Child_Molestation_Prevention_Study.PDF) found that 90% of their victims were children they knew, with 68% being family members, and 40% either family members or children belonging to families in their social circle. If someone is going to abuse a child, the chances are that their victim is already in reach. Creating an environment where they can fantasize/normalize their desires does not help the problem. The same study found that abusers who fantasize/maintain fantasies - 41% of overall abusers - had more than three times as many victims.

* 5) ""Oh, it's okay to censor pedophiles, but not homosexuality/furries/alt. Sex/bondage/etc."" - I... I just... listen. Consenting adults engaging in sexual acts of any form are *consenting adults.* They are **adults** who can grasp the pros/cons of their actions and the long term ramifications of their choices, and have reached (hopefully) a point in their life where they are physically and mentally mature enough to understand what they are doing. **Children are not.** Being aroused by someone of the same gender/in a fursuit/by being tied up/etc doesn't involve victimizing someone who doesn't understand what's going on. If you like to sniff shoes while getting off, sure, some might find that weird - but a subreddit about sniffing shoes doesn’t create a venue for fantasizing about/normalizing children being sexual, even if in fantasy form only. You cannot equivocate adult/adult sexual fetishes or acts with adult/child fetishes.

You separated when I was 11, leaving me to care for my then 6 year old brother. I love my brother, but I wasn't ready to become his second mother, so thanks a lot for that.

Dad specifically: fuck you SO much for all of the times you've made me feel like a worthless piece of shit. You don't call your daughter skanky/stupid/ugly/useless for most of her life and then magically get to try to work shit out when she's 22. I've forgiven you and have tried to be civil, but you're still crossing far too many boundaries. I don't know why you think that I'm going feel sorry for your current situation when you're half of the problem! Stop wallowing in your own self pity and get the fuck out if you're unhappy. Stop bad mouthing my mom to my face and expecting me to ""side"" with you. Everybody says you're incapable of having empathy - for thinking of anybody else but yourself, but I'm sure you have it in you SOMEWHERE to stop and fucking THINK before you start running that stupid, fat mouth of yours. Consider my feelings... please. You went ape-shit when mom left the first time. Threw things around, swore, broke my stuff, wrote obscenities on our boxes on moving day, blamed me then apologized then blamed me then apologized... you were a miserable fuck. I never wanted to visit you because all you did was question me about what mom was doing. As an 11 year old I had to hear a lot of stuff about you and mom that I didn't need to know. Remember that time you took advantage of mom while she was drunk in Florida? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YOUR KIDS WERE IN THE ROOM? Luckily your son was asleep... but I heard everything. Why do you wonder why I have terrible anxiety? It should be obvious.

Mom: You have to stop drinking. I'm so tired of seeing you wasted... you have no idea. Your face is starting to show that you're an alcoholic. You're so cranky when you're not drinking. I miss my mom - the old one - who didn't need alcohol to survive. Some days I almost wish you weren't such a functioning alcoholic so that the people around you would *have* to stop and say something... maybe it would make you face reality.
You push everyone away. You don't have any friends anymore. The ones that you do have, you keep at a safe distance so that they don't have to know how fucked up your life really is. I wish you would realize that these people care about you, would listen to your problems and maybe give you the strength to leave dad and start a new life. I'm sick and tired of your pride. I'm tired of hearing your excuses. I don't care that you feel like you'd be down grading if you moved from a (dumpy) house into an apartment, but isn't that completely material!? What about your sanity???
What about your son? He still has to put up with this shit first hand - I'm lucky to live on my own. 

Both of you need to get help. Both of you need to move on. I don't know why you got back together in the first place! Dad fucking sleeps in the basement, and even though he irks me... I feel sorry for him. That's no way to live. Oh, and don't even get me started on the dog. From the time I was 4 years old, the only thing I ever wanted in life was a dog. I was always told that we were too busy and too poor to afford a dog and that it wouldn't be fair. Well imagine my disgust when dad called me up two years ago to tell me that you guys were getting a puppy after I was no longer living there. He later told me that the only reason he got one was to keep mom around. Fast forward to now: you're STILL too poor and busy to have a dog, so she remains virtually un-trained, has anxiety issues and bit my grandpa so badly he needed stitches. She could be a good girl if you would just give her to a family that would be willing to TRAIN her. She's a German Shepherd for fuck's sake... she's going mental without a recognizable authority figure in the house. Oh, and mouse traps in the plants and on the furniture are NOT proper training methods. Neither was skipping out on a crate because you thought it was cruel and instead barricading her into the kitchen. YOU'RE BOTH SO FUCKING STUPID!

Also, I'm still bitter about the lies you told me about having a fund for my post-secondary education. Who the hell tells their 16 year old who asks if they should start saving now ""not to worry about saving because everything will be fine. Everything is covered."" Imagine my surprise when I caught you filling out government loan documents... imagine my greater surprise when you told me that you weren't actually ever sure if there was a fund and just assumed someone in our family had started one. Imagine my fear and embarrassment when I realized that I was going to be in heaps of debt and didn't do a single thing to prepare.

Dad, you should have trusted me more. I hung out with good people, I've never touched a drug and I didn't drink until I was of age and with people I trusted. I studied hard and tried my best to impress you. The other day when we were talking and you said, ""I'm glad we patched things up... 'cause you used to be crazy"" my heart sank. I didn't say anything because the only thing that would have come out of my mouth would have been mean. I'm trying to maintain a decent relationship with you but you make it awfully difficult. You've never really known me despite watching me grow up.

To my extended family: you guys are no help either. You chose to turn a blind eye to the chaos. When I reached out for help, you made it all about yourselves. Thanks for leaving me in the dust.

I asked her where they lived so if I see the dog out again I can take her home and tried to explain that I just didn't want the dog hit by a car or something bad, and finally the woman said, ""Thanks"" and drove away.

I just found out an acquaintance lost their baby. Her and her husband have been trying for the longest time to have this baby, and have spent thousands of dollars on IVF. What pisses me right off are people's responses to it. So many folks are writing things on her Facebook like ""god wanted an angel"", ""at least he's in heaven"", and ""everything happens for a reason"".

I am well aware that still birth, miscarriage and death of children is a taboo subject, and not many people know how to react. BUT it just kills me that people would have the audacity to say ""well, at least he's with god""...WHAT?!? No. That's their child. The one they have been wanting for years an putting everything they have into giving this child life. And you want to tell them that ""ahh well...shit happens, at least his in a good place."" That child doesn't belong in heaven. That child belongs in his parents damn loving arms!!! That child belongs holding their hand, sitting in their lap for bedtime stories, and getting piggy-backs around the park. They should NOT be comforted in knowing someone, or something was so damned selfish they said ""nah, I think I'll take it back"". 

If someone tried to comfort me with ""there's a bigger meaning to this that you aren't aware of yet"", I'd likely to tell them to fuck off. The ""meaning"" parents intend for their child is a long, happy life. Not to be ripped from them before they even get to know the child. 

I just want people to really think about what they're saying to someone in those circumstances. There is NO other place that parents want their child to be than right there in their arms, alive and healthy. Not in the clouds, not at the right hand of the father, not even floating in the cosmos as stardust. 

PLEASE if you know someone who has lost a child, just tell them you are sorry for the loss of their child, and let them know they have your full support. Don't try to explain it away, because to a parent that just lost a child, there is no reason good enough, be it scientific or faith based, to explain to them why they can't see their child grow up.

I was booked on 8 different flights at different times, delayed again and again, lied to, barely fed or compensated at all during the disaster, jerked around, needlessly trapped in an unfamiliar city, and delayed for a total of 27 cumulative hours. At no point did any AA representative make me feel comforted or safe and my every interaction seemed part of a facade to keep me quiet. Before I go public with the story (I maintain a small blog and am a frequent poster to Reddit), I would like to share the details with American Airlines and give you the chance to rectify the situation, adding a happy ending to an otherwise tragic tale.

My 8:45 AM flight was delayed again and again with no information given. Eventually, after waiting in line for half an hour, I was told nothing and given a $12 meal ticket that didn't cover the cost of eating anywhere really, still had to pay out of pocket. I was then told that the American Airlines help desk was outside of security and they could help me with more details so I left the secure area of Austin Bergstrom and was again told basically nothing, if the flight was cancelled officially, I could check back. Then I tried to go back through security but my mobile boarding pass had been cancelled so I had to go back to check in at the AA desk where they still gave me no information other than that there was another flight later if this one was officially cancelled and sent me on my way with a paper boarding pass that I couldn't help but think was a monumental waste of paper. I'm a very environmentally conscious person so this was a little infuriating. In the hubbub of the security line, I somehow lost an insert to one of my shoes.

I now found a comfy place to sit and wait for about an hour and a half, checking the board repeatedly for any updates. Eventually, my girlfriend called and told me she had checked online and it said the flight had been cancelled hours ago and why was I still waiting around. Having been around the mill with the AA representatives, this was shockingly to my dismay. I went and stood in another long line at a terminal and, upon showing the rep my ticket, she, without my verbal consent, just tossed me onto the then boarding plane to Dallas, telling me I'd have a connection from there to Chicago tonight. Apparently the initial flight was finally cancelled for technical difficulties. Based on the times she said, I figured I'd make it home for the end of the Blackhawks game. Was I mistaken.

That flight was uneventful, though I recall not even being served an entire can of soda. Just a little plastic cup, mostly ice. However, when we got to Dallas, we were greeted by an array of uniformed soldiers in the terminal, something that made me rather uncomfortable, especially with their demeanor and attitudes. I have much respect for the military but they did not make good representatives of our nation's Army. Furthermore, the entire terminal was crowded with a gaudy memorial to dead soldiers. It was cheap and tasteless, failing to convey the seriousness of the situation. I am not often offended.

When it was time to board the connection, I realized that, although the ticket I had paid for had been a boarding group 2, something I appreciate for the fact that I like my carry-on luggage near me, I was now, because AA's plane was in disrepair, shafted to boarding group 4. This trend would continue for the subsequent 5 planes I was eventually booked on at one point or another during my trip. If you have to delay someone like you did me, at least have the decency to give them a ticket as good as the one they paid for. The plane was full, loading was difficult and awkward, we finally got settled in, taxied to the runway, and just sat there. For a long time. There was a kid kicking my seat, no drink service, we just waited, the Captain kept saying we would either depart or go back soon, but we kept waiting. We finally got back off the plane back at the gate and were told to ""stay close."" I went to the counter, hoping to get another meal voucher because it had now been about 6 hours since my last meal but was told that would not be happening and we would be boarding in less than 10 minutes so there was no time to eat. I waited over half an hour before we boarded, could have bought my own food in that time, but then we reboarded, me still in group 4, and filled the plane once again. After going through all this hustle and bustle again, getting settled in, and thinking I was going home, despite the Captain's insistence that we would be taking off, the flight was cancelled and we went back to the gate. Again with the kid kicking my seat.

When we got off, I was now given my meal vouchers, the one's I had asked for 90 minutes prior and been denied, as well as put in a hotel for the night. This was a nice token, aside from the back that I was booked for a 7:45 AM departure and the only guaranteed shuttle I could get back from the hotel was at 6:15. I got to the hotel around 9:30 or 10 PM, so, after settling in, I got maybe 5 hours of sleep. But I made it to the gate just before 7:20 boarding. Well, after waiting a bit, the flight was delayed an hour or two and I was then rebooked on a 10:30 departure. What really upset me about this whole situation is that I could have spent the night in Austin, a city I knew and loved, with my friends having a good time instead of me thrown to Dallas for little to no reason just to wait. After the fact, I learned that AA already knew about the Chicago weather concerns before I was sent to Dallas. This was just poor planning and, I suspect, an effort to keep me satiated by at least putting me on a plane. Additionally, seeing at I didn't get on an airplane until after 11;00 AM, I could have slept in, had a decent breakfast, etc if not for the further poor planning of an AA representative. Simply unacceptable.

This last flight, though it got delayed to be a lunchtime flight, had no meal service whatsoever. No extra meal vouchers were provided, and I was running out of money. I hate to consume airport food in general, I'm usually very particular about my diet, but this entire mishap had me grubbing out much to my own disgust. Also, this last flight was way too cold, it was freezing, I didn't ask but I was not offered a blanket.

A few things to add, I always book myself window seats in the back of the plane. I like looking out the window and I also have a weak bladder to being near the lavoratory is convenient, especially so I only get up when it is empty. On all my random flights, I had middle seats with aisles, adding insult to injury. These numerous and persistent delays not only cost me an entire day or more's worth of work (I freelance), but I also missed a date with my girlfriend and troubled the people who were to pick me up at the airport by convoluting their schedules with misinformation for two days. The entire voyage took 27 hours longer than the initial 3 hour direct flight time I had paid for. This is simply unacceptable and has severely tarnished my perspective on air travel. It is not the lost time that I lament but the entire experience of inaccurate AA representatives coupled with excessively rising false hopes and expectations.

Yui, your face needs some remodelling aswell. I thought we loved eachother. I thought you cared. I thought you would give me some of your time. I thought we would be together forever. Don't ever wonder why I cut you off bitch. I told you what has happened to me and why I am the way I am. Then you just GO AND DO THE SAME DAMN THING.

At night we have less staff on the floors which makes sense and everything but it leaves me with 11 patients for the night pretty much every night. The other shifts have to take care of 7-8 tops and if they get any more they throw a fit and literally refuse to take care of people. I understand they have more hands on work to do but they never do fucking any of it! 

I come in at 11, no one is usually there to give me report so I'm pretty much going in blind since the nurses are all busy getting an actual report and about 5 call lights are going off. I spend about 5-10 mins figuring out names and diets so I can have some sort of idea what I'm dealing with and all of the hourly documenting from the shift before is still red (meaning they didn't do it) but I'm told they spend 10:30-11:00 sitting at the front desk gossiping so they just choose not to do them. I go into the rooms and start my rounds. The tables are covered in left over dinnerware, the laundry bags are over flowing, catheters haven't been emptied, and the patients are either on a bed pan or in a mess. So I spend a good amount of time cleaning up after the last shift and don't get done with my ""hourly"" rounds until around 1-2. Then I have to neaten up and stock everything for 1st shift since they're always busy in the morning and don't have time to stock, by the time I'm done it's almost 3 and time for me to do vitals/rounds again, I get done around 4 since I've already cleaned everyone and their rooms at 11. Then I relieve the sitters watching our patients that can't be left alone, they usually take 30-45 mins and I'm not out til almost 5 when I run off the floor to grab something to eat. I come back before 5:30 and plan out the worst part of my work day. I have to wake everyone up, clean them up, weigh them, get blood sugars, get special vitals, empty the linen bags, empty ostomys and catheters, and I leave the rooms in decent conditions, I can't even start most of that stuff until 5:30 at the earliest. This is all on a perfect night where everyone sleeps through the night and needs very little help.

ofcourse no one ever sleeps and if they do something goes wrong and we have to keep waking them up all night.

The next shift comes on at 7am and complains because the wires on the vital machines are tangled, I don't know everything about all of my patients, or I'm too busy finishing up my work to give them report the second they walk through the door. They've actually complained to the supervisor about messy vital machines. They have no idea how good they have it.

I usually don't leave until 7:30 when I'm supposed to be out at 6:53. I know I could just leave but I'm not the type of person to leave my work for someone else to do.

She broke up with me a few weeks ago because she felt we both needed time to work on ourselves.  It sounds cliche, but it actually had a bit of truth to it.  I was very sad, but understanding.

So this guy has been my friend for a while, and has always been an all around good guy.  He started to become friends with my ex through me a few months ago.  He would drive six hours to visit us a couple of times.  I thought it was weird, because it seemed like he was kind of into her, but he assured me that he was not, and I trusted them both enough to believe that nothing was going on.  When she broke up with me, he helped to comfort me.

This was three weeks ago, and I haven't had much contact with either of them since.  Except my ex and I will occasionally text, and she will say how she feels incomplete without me, and stuff.  Two weeks after the breakup, my ex went to visit the city where this guy lives, but we have other friends there too, so it wasn't particularly odd, but I was a bit suspicious.  She reassured me, and I didn't think too much of it.

But then, last night, I get a call from this guy.  He says they have developed feelings for each other.  I was pretty upset, but I sort of had already suspected as much.  I pried a little bit, and found out that they ended up having sex when she went to visit.  I immediately felt heartbroken and betrayed.  I still can hardly contain my anger.  I think I'm so upset because I was very close to both of them, and it feels like neither of them considered my feelings at all.  Even though they both claim to be sorry, and I believe their goal wasn't to hurt me, it has caused me an immense amount of pain.

You're pathetic. You don't know how to handle your emotions and you blame everybody but yourself.

A year later, I took you back into my life. I accepted your apology. Big mistake. Then I let you live with me. God, even BIGGER mistake. Because guess what? You couldn't even talk to me then. You blamed me on our falling out. 

I was there for you, bitch. I was there for you when your ex broke up with you. I was there for you when your mom died. I was there for you when you were practically raped. I WAS THERE FOR YOU YOU STUPID CUNT. And yes, you were there for me? But then our friendship started deteriorating again and I didn't know why. I didn't have TIME to figure out why. I showed you a picture of an art project I wanted to do for my parents for Christmas and your response?

""Well, it's the thought that counts.""

WHO FUCKING SAYS THAT? WHAT BEST FRIEND SAYS THAT?

But I let it go. I let it go because I LOVED you like a sister.

And then came the day you blew up at me again. You pulled my other roommate against me and you know what happened? I tried to reason. I tried to apologize for making you both feel like you didn't matter. But did you apologize to me? Hell no. You turned everything I said back into my face. You kicked me out of my own home...and don't even try to deny that because you know it's true. 

And then I see you yesterday during the speech contest. That fake smile you put on for everybody. That annoying LAUGH that you can hear across the room. You invited our other roommate because you wanted to shove it in my face. You wanted her there because you can't stand to be around me without ""protection."" You get her to do your dirty work for you because you're too scared to talk to people.

But you know what? I decided to be the bigger person today. I tried to contact you to tell you that you did a good job yesterday and I wanted to talk to you but was afraid to. I wished you both good will and your response?

""Thanks. You too.""

Really? After all this time you can't even drop the fake attitude? Because if that were sincere, I'd have an apology. If that were sincere, you wouldn't have caused so much drama and shoved me out of my home. Stop lying, to me and to yourself.

Ya know what, I'm sorry for calling you a bitch to your face the last time we talked in person. I'm sorry, because you didn't deserve that. You're much more than that.

This morning I brought up the topic of money to my girlfriend, she started telling me about going to this concert coming up when she hadn't paid me back for the tickets I bought from the last one. She flipped out about this, accuses me of 'hustling' her, and right then I had to draw the line of what a boyfriend should be expected to pay for (food and alcohol) and what she should be expected to contribute to (concert tickets). The argument ended because we both said what we needed to say, but we haven't talked to each other since.

Then, my roommate who is in a frat tells me some pledges are coming over to clean the fuck out of the apartment because its hell week. He says he's gonna be in the library, but I should let them in and tell them what to do, along with some sticky notes of things he wanted to make sure gets done. Now, I'm a clean person (and he isn't), I ended up cleaning our kitchen/living room the night before. So 2 pledges come over and I'm like 'yeah just follow these instructions, heres the stuff you need, clean the living room' and they did an ok job but left after no more than 15 minutes, saying 2 more will be on the way. The next 2 pledges come, and I tell them to clean the bathrooms, throw out a heavy ass retired server sitting in my room, and then clean some dust under my bed. They stuck around for a while and did all of those things really well, then left cuz one had work.

So I get back from the gym and my roommate calls me (who has yet to even see the work they did) and bitches at me for making them clean my room and not the kitchen/living room/his room. Now, I cleaned the kitchen last night, and the first 2 kids cleaned the living room. We had a prior incident where I learned not to mess with anything in his room (he cheated on his ex-girlfriend and i let her in to get her stuff without him being there, which he wasn't cool with). So I'm not gonna go into his room at all, yet he's pissed off at me because 'i took advantage of an opportunity at someone elses expense'. They did everything that was written down on the sticky notes he made, and the place is clean, but he's mad at me because the last 2 pledges were doing things in my room and not the (already clean) kitchen and living room.

I grab the stuff I want and I head to the self-check out. I've done this a million times before, due to my inability to plan grocery shopping, so I come here often. So yeah, I know how the self-checkout works. 

I scan my first item. It goes through. I scan my second item... there's a problem. The screen reads ""Please wait for an attendant"".

Alright. Shit happens sometimes, I can wait. There's really no other option. I look around for the attendant... he's at the other end of the store, stacking boxes, putting away carts. ...Okay. Wait some more. He's walking to a different area of the store, writing shit down, taping things... doing everything else EXCEPT helping me. They usually carry around these little grey electronic scan guns that alert them when they're needed, but he seemed to be ignoring his.

So now I've been waiting for a little over 5 minutes, being super patient, and I can't exactly leave to go grab him. Why should I have to? The only other people I see are 2 cashiers, both busy ringing up customers. So I wait. MORE WAITING. I'm getting really fucking impatient.

All of a sudden he walks over from whatever the fuck he was occupying himself with, had this despicable look on his face like I was the scum of the earth and says, ""Do you WANT something?"" I didn't know what to say for a minute. I've been fucking waiting for you for almost 10 minutes at this point to come here and fix whatever the problem is. I don't work here, I don't know how to fix it when shit's fucked up. That's your job.

So I say, ""Uh yeah, it said to wait for an attendant."" He stands there staring holes into my head, I swear he wanted to kill me. So I say ""Well, for some reason when I scanned this, something went wrong and I need you to help, please."" He heaved this huge disgusted sigh and walked away, grabbed his scan gun and fucked with it a bit, then the screen cleared and it was fine. He walked back across the store kept doing shit other than being an attendant.

The rest of my items were fine except the last one. It scanned and I got a different notice that said ""This item requires assistance, please wait for the attendant"" and I said fuck that. I'm not dealing with that again. So I just left it there, paid and got the fuck out. 

Seriously, your job is to step in when the self-check out machines indicate that there's a problem. Not to ignore the customer for almost 10 goddamn minutes and then get in their face and be a fucking asshole when you finally have to do your job. Jesus Christ! I've been working in retail for 5+ years, and I know how to be a good customer and a good store clerk. And that shit would have gotten me fired on the spot.

I was never good at math in school; for the first time, I'm actually doing really well in it.  But most of our (great) grades comes from the fact that this idiot fucks up our exams so much.

This prof. is from Israel and isn't the best English speaker (sorry if I offend anybody for that reason), and unfortunately, that carries over in the exams he writes...and apparently he's been teaching this same class for several years.  Did I mention that he only teaches this ONE class, ONCE a week, getting the same salary as all the other professors who take the time to teach more?

The class is a joke.  Some cores are stupid, but nothing compares to this.  He makes such casual mistakes in solving problems, but he laughs it off and makes way for my classmates and I to correct him.  He says he's ""testing"" us, but he's not fooling anyone; he fucks up his own problems.  When two people asked for help on the same problem for a midterm, he gave them two different answers.  Note: if you're doing box and whiskers and figuring out quartiles for a data set filled with numbers that range from 2 to 7, I really don't think that the first quartile would be 12 (he actually did this in a review).  Also, he apparently finds it funny that a lack of response from us when we don't understand what he's saying is like him talking to his cat.  It's even better when one of us tries to be humorous with him, he gets pouty and angry.  Ugh.

Also, just because we don't always respond doesn't mean we need coffee, stop repeating that.  It's not amusing, it never was.

I was sure that after my stretch of blissful unconsciousness I would awake to find that I just wasn't enough. But even more, I was scared I would awake to the realization that you weren't enough. I wrapped you around me like a life preserver because I was sure your love was the only thing that would keep my head above water. I knew that if you left, I would drown, but I couldn't admit that maybe even you weren't enough to keep me afloat. 

But you weren't a life preserver. You were a pair of concrete shoes. For all my problems, yours amplified them. Your depression, your anger, your complete inability to empathize, your obsession with jealousy, your inability to appreciate and love others because you don't have what they have, your consistent criticisms, your perfectionism bordering on compulsion, your haughty assurance that my own contributions never matched what you brought to the table, your regret, your guilt, your inability to admit your faults, your resort to rage instead of apology, and, finally, most importantly, your inability to forgive. 

But this rant isn't about you. It isn't for you. It's for me to put these thoughts of you on paper and realize that even when you're not here, even when we don't talk, these feelings reverberate in my head like I'm  trapped inside a drum.

At the same time, you don't see me bitching about it. Because it doesn't bother me. It doesn't even affect me. If I had kids, I would keep them away from that. Sadly, idiots dubbed ""Soccer Moms"" will do anything to get it banned from the face of earth and all 500 layers of hell. For those of you who don't know what a soccer mom is, soccer moms are people who have the ""everybody is inferior to me"" attitude, and think that nothing is ever their fault. If they knock a glass of milk off the table, it was the wind. Breaking a vase? Harry Enfield came in and smashed it with a hammer and said it was them, when it CLEARLY wasn't. Their kid seeing blood? IT WAS CLEARLY FOX'S FAULT, WHY WOULD IT BE THEIRS?

Anyways, onto the rant. Soccer moms come in hordes, similar to the zombies in Left 4 Dead. If there's any sign of violence on public television? The secret chips implanted in their brains activate and they all activate ""write_complaint.exe"" and will complain the f*** out of it. Probably even beyond that. Whatever they complain on, they will destroy it. And why is this? It's because of their morbid intolerance of anything for adults, as well as their allergy to having any brain cells. For example, if a kid plays let's say, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Then whose fault is it? Is it A) The company, B) The parent, or C) The child's?

The correct answer is B, but soccer moms instead will always circle A. After all, how would they know if there's blood and violence on it?! Where's the information on that?! How am I supposed to know this, it's not like there's some magical sticker on the back that has a rating for the game and reasons for the rating! By God, we must BAN this monstrosity! So they send a fairly heated letter and tell other parents that the game is BAD and promotes [x] and [y], possibly even [z]. More or likely, depending on whatever it is, it might get taken off the air, or censored, or something of the like. I haven't (thankfully) seen this happen to any games, and it better not, because I ENJOY my blowing zombie's heads off, thank you very much madam. It hasn't turned me into a homicidal sadistic failure of humanity.

It just baffles me that, if so many people 'secretly' like musicals, then why can't we just all collectively agree to break the stigma that surrounds them and just embrace them as a form of performance art that can be openly enjoyed just like any other?

Now, I understand that this problem isn't one that has a real ""solution"" seeing as how it's a societal problem- a problem of perception- and that's not really something that can be ""fixed"" in the traditional sense.

Allow me to explain the situation to you. while you were sending that super-important text, your car drifted from your lane, across the double-yellow line, and into my lane.

In fact, she said multiple times ""Well FedEx and UPS deliver on Saturday so I'm sure it will get there on time.""

So, I did. Originally $70 with my one day shipping and then about $50 with the 30% off. Ordered their ""high quality, heavyweight"" sweatshirt that is supposedly ""great for winter temps."" Well, surprise surprise, come Saturday and no delivery. Soo eventually Monday around 6PM the sweatshirt gets delivered. It is the lightest, thinnest, lowest quality sweatshirt I have ever bought. It would cost $20 or less at any given department store. This shit would not keep you warm in 50 degree weather, let alone the fact that it is now December and I live in Upstate NY. The logo looks like it was printed in 1990 and faded for about 20 years. And oh did I mention that it was my anniversary on Sunday? The day I wanted to give my girl the sweatshirt. Cause ya know being a day late on things like that is ok, especially when i paid TWENTY FIVE FUCKING DOLLARS for one day shipping.

Call customer service and I get some asshole who tells me I am wrong and that I am a liar for saying their customer service person would tell me that. Then when I ask for my money back, he has the balls to ask for proof. Claims that I have to email them a picture of the sweatshirt and if they find that the printing was not correct, then, and ONLY THEN, will they refund my money. FUCK YOU ZAZZLE!

I'm used to people being people, but it just frustrates me, day after day, to have to deal with people like this.

Let's get something straight. When the train stops, you're supposed to let people off FIRST, before you crowd them and try to get the fuck on. You shouldn't be crowding the door because people are trying to GET THE FUCK OFF the train to get where they need to go. Especially during rush hour. Just because the train stops in front of you does NOT mean you should stand right fucking in front of the damn door. 

Also, when it is rush hour, and there are people trying to get on the same train as you are, MOVE THE FUCK INTO THE GODDAMN TRAIN. You're not the only one who has to get off at your stop, so move the fuck in because you're also not the only one trying to get ON the fucking train. I've seen incidents where so many people just take one step into the train and expect everyone else to fit around them when there is a ton of space right in the middle of the train.

And another thing: when people are asking you to move, GTFO OF THEIR FUCKING WAY. If these people can't get past you, they can't GET OFF THE FUCKING TRAIN. If you don't have the common sense to make room for them, at least exit the train with them and then you can get back on. The conductor won't move the train until the area is clear, you should know this already. 

Oh, and one last thing: please for the love of God, don't just sit down and relax like you're sitting on your couch with your best friend. I'm a stranger, and you're a stranger, and i don't want to touch you. I'm doing my best to avoid touching you (for my own reasons, i just don't like having strangers rubbing against me). Not that i've got anything against just brushing up, but you're just basically dryhumping my arm and i dislike it greatly.

1346442090.0,11,self.rant,z5g75,A Vitriolic Rant About Facebook Timeline,14,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/z5g75/a_vitriolic_rant_about_facebook_timeline/,"Since the dawn of mankind, people have continually produced amazing inventions, like the wheel, the lightbulb, the Internet, self-flushing toilets, and swear words. For every great invention that enters the public eye, there are vast numbers of inventions that fall by the wayside. Why? Because, to put it bluntly, they're just crap, and failed ideas never take off. Such as glow-in-the-dark loo roll, Adobe Updater, and 5cm-deep bathroom sinks (thanks, IKEA). But once in a while some crazy buffoon comes up with something so phenomenally, extraordinarily ATROCIOUS that you just have to wonder how it is physically possible to possess such a twisted imagination. Of course I'm referring to nothing other than the much-hyped Facebook Timeline. Thanks, Mark Zuckerberg.


Let's get straight to the point. The first most striking thing is that Facebook Timeline is as ugly as a solenodon. (That sounds like Céline Dion. And looks like her too.) In fact, if Facebook Timeline were to make love to a blobfish and gave birth to TimeBlob v2.0, it would be a noticeable improvement. It's just there's this random straight line in the middle of the page with speech bubbles poking out to the side in a jagged, disorderly fashion. There's no obvious focus in the same way as the old Facebook profile neatly listed things. And when you hit F5, the speech bubbles randomly rearrange themselves by jumping across the line from one side to another. LOOK AT ME, I'M A STUPID SPEECH BUBBLE THAT BEHAVES LIKE A 3-YEAR-OLD WITH ADHD WHO HAD TOO MANY E-NUMBERS FOR BREAKFAST SO I'LL JUST JUMP AROUND EVERYWHERE ON THIS GODDAMN PAGE, OK? Oh, and the line itself is completely pointless. It's just this stupid blue line down the middle of the page. It doesn't even stand out. Hooray for that.


So now people can access all my old posts at a glance instead of having to click on ""Show Older"" a lot of times and wait for stuff to load. Thanks for invading our privacy, Facebook. So now any and all embarrassing and frivolous posts that I made from the Dark Ages are now available to the world pretty much instantly. I'm not just speaking for myself here. I only got Facebook in 2011, so looking back through a year shouldn't be--- Why does the timeline go back to 2010 then? What is this? Did some of my facebook posts travel through the Internet on superluminal neutrinos? Why do I even bother checking? Next thing I know Facebook will start posting my statuses before I write them. Thanks for that. (Sarcasm sphere self-test complete.) Ok, seriously. Other people will either (1) look back at their own timeline and go ""WHAT THE HELL? I DID NOT FLIRT WITH TUTANKHAMUN AT 'THE PYRAMID CLUB' IN 1324 BC!"" or something equally implausible (and presumably have the common sense to change their privacy settings), or (2) have their friends point it out to them (even worse). Dear facebook, some bits of history are better left untouched. What is even more ironic is that posts that other people make on your wall are now gathered together and hidden in one hard-to-find speech bubble at the corner of each year's section on timeline, instead of listed together with the rest of the wall as they formerly were. So like it's going to reveal all MY embarrassing old stuff while sneakily hiding everything everyone ELSE posts? Amazing.


What else? Oh yeah, photos have to be obnoxiously large and clog the page up. Oh wait, there was something else I forgot to mention. IT WAS FORCEFULLY IMPOSED ON US AGAINST OUR WILL. THE INTERNET IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEMOCRACY. I'm entitled to my opinion and if I decide that the old layout is acceptable and Timeline is mind-blowingly awful, I have the right to refuse to convert to it. Even if I deactivate Facebook, when I reactivate it again it's still going to convert my profile to this stupid rotten layout. There is no point trying to brainwash me into thinking it's a good idea by saying it's an EXCITING NEW KIND OF PROFILE!!!1!!1!one!eleven!tan(pi/4) and calling it an ""update"". You know that's the sort of rhetoric that computer viruses use too. Facebook, make up your mind. There is NO POINT in changing the look of your website every few months just as we get used to the last change. It's a website profile, NOT A FASHION STATEMENT. We can already customise our profiles ourselves. We don't need you to do it for us like we're 6 years old and still need parental guidance on how to do art homework.


This rant is now longer than my UCAS personal statement, I've just noticed. And because I'm not going to let a website layout be more preposterous than this rant itself, it goes on. Facebook ""Like"" pages totally suck. Not only are they hideously ugly, but posts from others are hidden in a little speech bubble in the corner which is retarded. And lack of activity really shows up. If you're a page owner who hasn't posted anything in a while, your page now has a BIG BLANK SPACE at the top with: &lt;Month Name Here&gt; People who like this: 2 (in ENORMOUS FONT) People talking about this: 1 (in ENORMOUS FONT) or something like that. How minimalist! Isn't that great? Er... NO.


Furthermore, the Friends list is no longer in alphabetical order, but in a pretty much random order that changes every time you press F5 like the stupid speech bubbles. WHAT'S THE POINT IN THAT? Facebook says it's supposed to be based off an algorithm that determines the friends you interact with most often and are more likely to interact with in future. Yeah, thanks for that, I'd rather have them in alphabetical order instead, I'm not going to trust your stupid algorithm that changes its mind every 2 seconds and also thinks I could be best friends with someone just because I had a poke war with them three months ago, OK? (For those who share my anguish, there is a very non-obvious workaround. You have to allow subscribers, then go to your About page, go to About -&gt; Subscribers then click on ""(number) friend subscribers""; this lists your friends alphabetically.)


I want to be very clear that there is considerable difficulty in writing this too harshly. This is very hard to overstate. The full implications of this need to be understood. Facebook Timeline is not a minor mistake. It is not a simple slip-up. It is a major, world-class, catastrophic fucking disaster for Facebook's reputation. Having said that, the website itself now has a long way to climb until it is to be considered aesthetically acceptable, let alone decent. And if Facebook's graphic designers have any shred of humility or sanity, now is the time for them to step back and reconsider how their collective artistic sense and common sense could have failed to such an apocalyptic degree.

I'm not surprised, because you are the kind of arsehole that gives them a reason to say no. If you were really 'friendzoned' you wouldn't be so douchey about it, especially to the girl you are apparently friends with.

I'll tell you what it means to be 'friendzoned'. It happened to me once, and I'm happy it did.

So, I'm about 16, and theres this girl I like, called Sarah. Now, I've asked her out once before, and she said no, and we're awesome friends. Now, one day, me and Sarah and a group of my friends were gonna go to a local park to hang about. All of our friends skipped out, leaving me and Sarah on the day.

We went around, talked, bit of flirting started, then it escalated. The usual banter, tickling, I fed her a couple sweets, all that business. It was pretty much a date at this point. Obviously, there's only so much flirting two people can do, so I walked her home. I gave her a hug goodbye, and it got awkwardly long. I looked at her in that awkward
way, and she let go of me. She said, ""I'm sorry, I can't do this with you, I value your friendship too much"".

I was crushed; we both had feelings for each other, but she thought our friendshp was worth more. She hugged me again, and we both went home.

When I got home and calmed down, I realised that this wasn't such a bad thing; I had a friend that cared about our friendship so much she was willing to pass up a relationship with me, just in case afterward, she lost me as a friend.

That is what it means in my mind to be 'friendzoned', not this bullshit about some girl you barely know saying no to your advances; its about a person valuing your friendship above their feelings for you. I think it was hard for both of us that day.

tl;dr IMO 'Friendzoned' means your friendship is more important than your feelings for each other. Anything else is just someone being buuthurt they said no.",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_viyug,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/viyug/about_the_friendzone_and_why_it_isnt_a_bad_thing/,

Why is it that America (more specifically) drives people to be in a prestigious world while shitting on everything towards educating the youth. It is seems so ridiculously ineffective. 
As trying to govern a world upon a bible, we're trying to teach the world with old ineffective forms of education, more specifically how one gauges the affinity of information within that class.
How many countless people you know bank on test taking skills instead of knowing the material they're being tested on? Too many. 
I'm so sick of watching people study to the point where it's unhealthy, know their stuff because they are teaching me/clearly know their stuff, and then bomb multiple choice exams. I have a problem with that.
Not only are you NOT effectively analyzing the student's knowledge, but how many fucking people are amazing at learning how to dissect what a teacher wants them to let alone be confident in themselves to do well on that test. Multiple choice questions don't analyze how much  you know, they analyze how well you can handle pressure and comprehend exactly what the teacher wants you to. There are too many reasons why this method is stupid:
1. What if the teacher has poor grammar/writing skills? 
2. What if the student's first language isn't English?
3. What if the teacher has ""choose the right answer"" and multiple answers are right (I could go on another rant about ""well choose the BEST right answer"" - so glad it's based upon the TEACHER's opinion which is best while never explaining it is. I can't read minds you fuck. 

I'm sure there's more, but i'm too frustrated to come up for reasons. 
My favorite, are teachers who have you take a multiple choice test, but never show you the answers afterwards. What. The. Flying. Fuck.
How the fuck am I supposed to learn if not from my mistakes?
How the fuck am I supposed to do well on a cumulative final?
We should start running psych tests to see which is the best way people learn, ACTUALLY FUCKING START DOING THAT.
Did you learn how everyone is practically a visual/hands on learner? How many times do you learn that way? Only a lab? If that? Oh nice, glad we're being so incredibly arrogant to ignore the needs of many.

This issue goes so much larger than just education. We're talking about the MINDSET OF THE FUCKING FUTURE and it's treated like shit, you think that's not going to have any repercussions?  Because it's not like most people in their 20s have large egos due to everyone telling them as little kids that they're awesome and can do whatever they can't.
No, not unless you're great at bullshitting tests/taking multiple choice tests the cake is a lie.

I was reading this on the front page and someone was talking about studying 16 hours for a chem final to get a 62%. That's pretty common here where I go to school and what always pisses me the fuck off is when people go:
Oh, that's normal. Everyone gets low grades....
SO WHY ISNT IT BEING APPROACHED DIFFERENTLY. Is the education system so deep that people can't get out to change it? is it something everyone has given up on changing? are we so set in our primative ways that we're no longer adapting and evolving to education? Knowledge grows and adapts with perceptions and time so why arn't we adapting the way we convey that knowledge? It's completely garbage that people busting ass recieve bad grades. 
I have a friend that is studying for the MCAT this week. He has never taken college Anatomy or Physio college level. There's a lot of anatomy and phys on the MCAT and he told me that [he's] good at taking tests so even if he doesn't know it, he knows what to look for in answers.
I'm sorry, but perhaps one of the reasons why doctors are sucking in America lately is because people like this that bank on test taking skills instead of the knowledge they are supposed to know.
It's a prestigious world, it's a hard life, but don't brainwash the young ones in elementary school or primary school with lies about achieving your dreams and if you work hard you'll get good results because here in college the rewards are made up and the effort doesn't matter. 

I know this post is somewhat depressing and I don't mean to bring down anyones day the thing is: I love school.
I love the concept.
It's beautiful I think educating people and gaining more knowledge will give you more power and give people more unity and skills to work together and actually make some concrete changes in the way we live out life.
What is here in America though, is not education. It's a buisness. You go into debt for about half your life, waste 1/4th of it to buy a piece of paper that apparently qualifies you for a job. 
I never knew all it took was one sheet of paper to tell me I can do things with my hands, respond to situations, and adapt to my environment all while being independent and goal driven towards helping out the company I work for.
Really, a piece of paper proves that? Wow, i'm so happy that physical work can be defined on paper. That's fantastic. -.-
Why waste a good 4+ years of your life to only go through on the job training? Why need training, you have a degree right? You should know all your shit right? Then why is America losing it's ""big dog"" card in the world? especially with education? 
We need some re-defining of what education is. I'm sick of America being so ignorant that they're eating their own shit.

I'd just like to pop in and say something if I may.

As someone that has been tested and confirmed as being dyslexic, you have to realize that a lot of us, most won't admit, will try our hardest to create sentences, with good grammar and correct spelling, to appease grammar Nazi's on the internet and IRL.


I understand your pain when you see people who are for example, writing or typing like this: 'den i wuz lyk wut. wut r u tlkin about.'
But just remember what ever you call it, some people's cognitive functions struggle with words. How they see them, memorize them, reproduce them.


As an example imagine it took you one hour to learn how to spell expostulations. It my take someone like me 1 day, even a week to get that shit tight.


Be careful when you're challenging someone about grammar and spelling, because it can be damaging and upsetting, getting battered over something that is simple, even though they probably are an intelligent person.


Sometimes it is helpful, for example I couldn't for a long time figure out your and you're. Yes, you read that right, I'm in my 20's and have a degree, but it baffled the fuck out of me.


I will say this, it was embarrassing but the sheer force of grammar hounds on the internet, picking and prodding flipped my gears and helped me learn the proper use.


Try helping first, when you get annoyed just point it blatantly the fuck out.

I had a near $80 fee for going over my unlimited data allowance by 786 mbs. After nearly an hour of arguing I could not get them to drop the fee (I suspect a court date soon).

So since I am a poor student I decided to lower my data plan. He explained that I could switch to a plan that would still be unlimited data, but only 200 mbs of 4g. This sounded fair enough since I usually don't go over 200 mbs anyways.

Again I called T-Mobile and found out that this whole unlimited but 200 mb of 4g doesn't exist. When I asked about their website they said it must be my browser displaying the wrong numbers. She said if I went back up to unlimited again that I would avoid being charged and it would be cheaper this billing cycle. So I agreed for this cycle and then asked when my contract will be done.

I've put up with, ignored or dealt with the shit for the past two and a half years but now it's finally gotten to me. This university is split between being stuck in the 1960s and wanting to be modern but having no fucking clue how to do it properly. It's like watching Communists try and reform, or Amish learn to use a computer. Except it affects me directly and not in a sense of amusement.

Let us start with that oh-so-glorious of new and modern things at my university, the football stadium. Great $70 million investment there Board of Trustees, its not like we needed more teachers or anything. It's not like we have a chronic shortage of math teachers or anything. It's not like our Philosophy department is in total and complete fucking disarray. It's not like Seniors have had to wait TWO YEARS for classes because the last class they need to graduate is only offered in the fall in one twenty-person section. 

And yet, instead of all the many things $70 million can buy, any one of which might make it just a little better here, we got a football stadium. A giant, gleaming, 30,000-seat dog turd. And I'm not even opposed to sports, but maybe we could get a handful of winning seasons and sellouts before we splurge on this.

And while we're talking about dog turds, let's talk about the people this school lets in. Seriously, claim all you fucking want to about how ""admissions standards are improving yearly,"" but you can still get in with a 920 on your SAT if you have the right background. Three quarters of students that come into this university don't graduate in four years and the administration wonders why that is. STOP FUCKING TAKING ANY IDIOT WHO CAN SIGN THEIR NAME AND GET STATE MONEY.

And its not just the administration that has to suffer because of this bullshit, the students do even moreso. I know this campus possibly better than any other student who's walked it, there's not a single place and time at which I do not feel safe, but at the same time I should not have to walk by a dorm and have people sitting outside slamming whiskey and talking about whether they should rob me. That sort of person should never be allowed within pissing distance of a university. 

The university should not have to go on a lockdown because Random Idiot A brought 10 of his boys from back home to a campus function and one brought a gun. When an attempted double-homicide happens 500 feet from a dorm the university should maybe do something other than release a mass-text the next day that most people don't even get. And its not like any of this shit does any good to begin with; our cops are so fucking incompetent it takes four of them to make a routine traffic stop. Our police force's greatest accomplishment is that an officer ordered a hooker and then killed her when she wouldn't fuck him in his uniform.

And that's my university in a nutshell: shit in, shit out. Thank Flying Spaghetti Monster I'm only here for another year and a half. After that's over I'll probably do what every other student does: get degree, get the fuck out of Dodge. The university can continue to complain about its endowment and remain forever oblivious to why it continues to have the same problems year after year.

But he's an independent contractor, so he works when he wants. Therefore, he doesn't work a lot, and has been just smoking pot, hash, and taking edibles all day, every day (he has a MM card). 
Initially it was for his TMJ headaches, which got better when he was high. But now, he just smokes to smoke, from the moment he wakes up until bed time. And he's just so goddamn lazy, useless, and irritating when he's high. He literally cannot get out of bed, and shuts all the blinds and drapes, even when it's beautiful outside. He can't buy groceries, and only eats out or orders take out. He can't wash his dishes, and I counted, let his dirty dishes pile up for 11 weeks. There was black mold and shit growing on every dish and it stank. I can't even go in the kitchen, it's so disgusting.

For example: yesterday I was telling him how sore I am from a hard work out, and he said he'd rub me down, and we'll do yoga and stretch that night. Before he came over, he said he'd bring over some Qdoba for me to eat. 5 minutes later he said he ate it.
So he comes over, plops on my bed, drinks my $10 for a 6pack beer, and refuses to rub my sore legs until I rub his feet. Laughing.
So I just said no, and shoved his fucking feet away and rubbed my own goddamn legs. 
It's a small incident, but a good example of how he is when he's high. Everything's a joke, and he doesn't give a fuck about doing what he says he will do.
I just wanted him to GTFO and go home, and he did. I just can't stand him like that. 

And now he is accusing me of not being supportive, but being critical of him instead. Ugh. What - am I supposed to make him quit smoking and do yoga? WTF. I quit smoking cigarettes, moved to a new city, go to my pilates classes, got a good new job (took 6 months) and changed my whole life this summer - SORRY I WAS BUSY! You want to know what the funny thing is! This is hilarious! He says ""I changed your life."" 
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*tear. haha. wow. 

EDIT UDPDATE: Now we've gotten to the point where I'm fucking pissed off. While trying to help him realize his problems, he's kept on blaming me for not motivating him enough and ""invalidating his feedback"" (which was him blaming me for his problems) therefore; I will be a bad mother. 
Well thank FUCK I won't be having any of his children!
(he and i have no plans to get married or have children, but he knows i've had two pregnancies before now - no kids. so this insult really dug deep)

And I let him have it on the phone - about him blaming his shit on me and personally insulting me. I should just take this chance to dump him. I am tired of this. 
Oh, and he said I'm motivated to bring this up now because I'm turned off by it, not because I care about him. I said it's both, really. And he said ""Well there's all sorts of things I could say about you that would hurt your feelings, but I don't.""

No problem, I thought, they'll leave, and I'll move in in October.
So they had their two months. Then they stayed there another month. By the end of the next month a court date had been set. At the hearing they were given till mid-september to get out by the judge. They didn't. There is now an application in for the baliffs to remove them and they're **still in my fucking house!** What the hell does it take to remove these people?! They've had 6 bloody months.

I don't know that I ever didn't believe that but on this night I realized that these people are probably more happy living in their own sad situations than I ever will be should I achieve the level of success that I feel is the only acceptable, viable living situation.

What I realized is that these 'poorer' people still found ways to enjoy what they had, probably more so. And I mean every age group; riding bikes, playing in sprinklers, walking dogs, dancing, talking...just having a genuinely good time.

She cheats on me with some other guy, and then later on, I figure out that she was also cheating on her REAL boyfriend with me (He was overseas or some shit, and she had two facebooks and two skype accounts, for two different groups of friends to keep us COMPLETELY seperate.)

She has this super nice girl front, I seriously did NOT see it coming - nobody did.  I considered her one of my good friends before we dated, we always hung out together and in groups, etc. for a few years before we dated

She was my 8th girlfriend that I've had in my life, but the first girl I had sex with.

I found out that she **knowingly** gave me herpes.  
She didn't have symptoms (that I could really notice) but you don't need them to pass it on.  She told me she was testedbefore recently and she was clean - I trusted her.  I really, really did and she knew that.  I found out way after i broke up with her that her last boyfriend TOLD her that he got herpes, and that he probably got it from her.  

Now, she's in serious trouble for breaking into her friend's house and stealing $5k worth of shit while she wasn't home - even worse, she walked past like 4 security cameras and posted fucking PICTURES on facebook of her with some shit that she stole, and figured it would be alright if she went into MSpaint and colored over whatever she stole.  I don't know why she did it, she's from a rich family.

I'm dead serious when I say that everybody was shocked.  Nobody saw it coming, she acts like such a nice and quiet girl to everybody here.

Are you FUCKING kidding me?  How do people like this exist?  It's like she did a hit-and-run on my fucking life.

Trust me.). So, if you're a central Illinois (whoo!) redditor, I'll so message you the name of this place so you may shun in solidarity if you so choose.

I graduated (with honors! Whee!) last May with a degree that's only useful if I go to graduate school. While that was (and is) the plan, I wanted a year off to BREATHE, to save money and to plan things with the SO. 

After applying for work for 4 months, I applied to this precious, locally owned/operated gourmet bakery and market. ""Woah!"", said I. This place had AMAZING food, great merchandise, laid back atmosphere, I just loved it. 

...they hired me without even checking my references. I begin working there in late October, things start to pick up and things start to...come to light. Dead baby roaches under freezers, being encouraged to LIE to customers about deli foods' expiration date, their tagline ""Always local, Always Fresh"" evidently meant food from Sams (!) that is in the deli case for 8-10 days.

I ALSO began to see employees drop off like flies. Not DYING, but QUITTING. In mass numbers.

ALso, they embraced the entirely legal (albeit annoying) practice of ""training pay"", where for the first 90 days of employment, you can be paid less than minimum wage. This ""training period"" lasted until Saturday morning.

In addition to all this, it's a locally owned business where the owner/proprietor is the head chef and her DAUGHTER is the payroll/hr person. So no matter how unhappy you were with either of their particular pathologies that leaned toward super-bitch, there was no one you could talk to.

Now for the fun. Due to mass employee exodus, I had agreed to work 3 46 hr. work weeks in a row. I have 2 other jobs...one from home and the other a minor paid internship. I was literally running from uptown to downtown and back again six days a week because I was cheap labor. However, on Saturday, I was unable to come in TWO HOURS EARLY to help with an expected breakfast rush.

I called, left several messages (which I thought was rather thoughtful considering the request come via text at 5:30 AM), and showed up at my regularly scheduled time. I was greeted with ""This is a BULLSHIT WAY TO KEEP A JOB!""...in front of customers, employees and a camera. 

...I left.

And had THIS in my inbox this afternoon:

I doubt you can understand what its like to run a growing business- but its beyond difficult to have paid employees who continually accommodate themselves at the expense of the business + co-workers, you have let the company + your co-workers down today.  

Your final check will be mailed to you Friday. I'm sorry we can no longer support your inability to be a supportive member of the team. As always, we wish you the best of luck.

Signed,

Superbitch.

Transition has been an understatement. Turns out our branch does everything differently than the one she used to work at.

There's literally nothing she's known how to do on her own (not even paperwork that tells you what it's for and how to fill it in). 

On top of starting from square one, she is easily distracted, easily overwhelmed and a bit bullheaded. I tried to show her how to do one aspect of her job (roughly translates to filling in the blanks of an Excel template, updating it periodically and sending to head office). I suggested learning by example, because that's how I learned. Nooo she says, she can't learn that way! I suggest going over it verbally. Nooo she says, she doesn't want to waste her time writing copious notes! She doesn't have time for that!

In the end, she asks me to write a MANUAL on this aspect of her job. A how-to guide with every single detail she'd ever have to know.  Won't be the only one either - she's asked me to write two of them, with the potential for more in the future... as she needs them.

Welcome! You are now chatting with 'Representative 1'

Customer: Hi, Carl.

Representative 1: Hello Bob! Congratulations for getting a new phone! :)

Customer: thank you. It's very nice

Representative 1: Let me check on why this happens whenever you connect online on it.

Representative 1: I am happy to hear that. It's really a nice phone Bob. :)

Customer: This is the first LTE phone on my acccount, and I didn't buy it through AT&amp;T, so it would not shock me if something needed to be changed in my account to support it.

Representative 1: I completely understand you. Let me take a moment to check your account further for this.

Customer: no problem

Representative 1: I did notice that the phone being used on the 617XXXXXXX is not being recognized properly which can be causing you not to have the LTE service work on it.

Customer: Interesting. How do I fix that? Or is it an issue of AT&amp;T not (yet) having a configuration for this particular phone?

Customer: I.e., it's defaulting to HSPA because it doesn't know this phone supports LTE

Representative 1: May I ask for the IMEI of your phone?

Representative 1: You can get this by dialing *#06# on your phone.

Customer: sure, one second

Representative 1: Let me check if your phone is already registered with AT&amp;T.

Representative 1: Sure! :)

Customer: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX / 01

Customer: I had to bring it in to trade my SIM for a microsim

Customer: But I don't know if they did anything beyond switch out which SIM was registered to my account

Representative 1: Thank you!

Representative 1: I understand you Bob, don't worry, I'll check this further for you.

Representative 1: I do see that AT&amp;T does not have the configuration for your phone yet.

Customer: ok

Representative 1: Let me partner with my superior and see what we can do about this.

Representative 1: One moment please.

Customer: sure

Representative 1: Thank you Bob. :)

Representative 1: Thank you for your patience.

Customer: no problem

Representative 1: Mind if I ask where did you got your new phone Bob?

Customer: directly from Google.

Customer: This is the ""google edition"" of the SGS4, with their stock software on it rather than Samsung's modified Android

Representative 1: Thank you. I will partner you with our technical specialist to see what we can do to have the LTE work still on your new phone Bob.

Customer: ok, thanks

Representative 1: You're welcome! What else can I help before I connect you through?

Customer: that's it, I think. Thank you for your time

Representative 1: You're welcome Bob. Thank you for being patient with me about this.

Representative 1: Kindly stay on this chat. Thank you!

One moment while I transfer the chat to a representative that is better skilled to handle your concern.

Welcome! You are now chatting with 'Representative 2 '

Representative 2 : Hi Bob, how are you?

Customer: Very well, thank you.

Representative 2 : Good, I'm reading the notes to get up to speed.  So you're not getting LTE just HSPA?

Customer: That's right. Signal is right now HSPA:10

Customer: I have not gotten LTE at all with this phone (at least not that I've noticed), and I live in areas where LTE is supported

Representative 2 : Let me check coverage in your area--LTE may not be available.

Representative 2 : Is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, MA still you're address?

Customer: yes

Customer: Though I am in downtown Boston right now

Representative 2 : Ok

Representative 2 : I do show LTE coverage in the area.  Do you have call or network restrictions on?

Customer: Nope. ""Data enabled"" is on, ""Use only 2G networks"" is off. I have no other options in the OS.

Customer: APN is ""ATT Phone"". It's the only option.

Representative 2 : Do you have airplane mode and wifi off?

Customer: Yes.

Customer: Just for reference, I have 4 years of experience with android phones and 32 years of experience developing software. :-)

Representative 2 : I understand.  :)   We can troubleshoot if you like.  You're not getting any error messages?

Customer: Nope, everything works fine: I just only get HSPA, not LTE

Representative 2 : We can file a case to get this resolved.

Customer: ok, how do I do that?

Representative 2 : It's on my end--let's try a couple of things before we do that.  Please power off your device and let me know when it's off.

Customer: ok, one second

Representative 2 : Bob, I think I see the problem--it appears you are using a non-AT&amp;T device.

Customer: That's right. It's a device directly from Google: it's the Google Edition Samsung Galaxy S 4.

Customer: As the prior rep said to me, you currently don't have a configuration for this phone, so presumably it's defaulting just to HSPA

Representative 2 : Then, I'm confused--I don't understand your concern?

Customer: The other rep transferred me over to you presumably so you could file some kind of ticket to create a configuration for this phone so it could be activated for LTE. I don't really know, though: perhaps he just transferred me because he had reached the limit of what he could do about this issue.

Customer: Lots of people are going to be activating this phone over the coming weeks, so fixing it now will eliminate the call/support volume you would otherwise get for this issue.

Customer: There are a lot of people talking about it on xda (the mobile developers' website)

Representative 2 : The device you have is not recommended or supported by AT&amp;T, so you won't receive LTE apparently.  Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: You can help by getting it supported for LTE. I should get LTE speeds if the device I'm using supports LTE, which it does. I don't really see why this is a controversial issue.

Representative 2 : Your device is not an AT&amp;T device so we don't guarantee LTE for it.  I apologize for any inconvenience.  :)

Customer: It's not an issue of ""guarantee"". It's an issue of your network refusing LTE access to the device. There is nothing I can do on my end to get it to work: it's entirely a configuration thing on your end. All I'm asking is that you flip the switch that says this phone can connect to the LTE network. I'm paying a premium for the AT&amp;T network, and should have the access I'm paying for.

Representative 2 : You will need to get an AT&amp;T device, then that is compatible with our LTE network.

Customer: It is the same phone you sell as the 1337, only with different software. This is I9505G, yours is the I9505. They both have the same hardware, same radio, same everything. I'm not sure what AT&amp;T's objection to activating LTE support for it is: it would be like Verizon telling me if I connect a Mac to FIOS that I only get 5Mbps instead of 60Mbps, and that I'd have to use Windows to get higher bandwidth. There's no technical justification for the limitation.

Representative 2 : That's company policy--I apologize for any inconvenience.

Customer: Anyway, I won't argue with you further since I know it's not your decision. I would just ask that you escalate this to your superiors because I don't appreciate being told something I know is false, as a technical person. I keep AT&amp;T because you are the only service provider with signal in all the geographies I frequent, but given my customer service experience I would jump to another provider without hesitation should I have the opportunity. There's simply no reason for AT&amp;T to treat their customers like this.

I quickly found a flat tack and pushed it into the shoe to try and keep the strap in place. It worked for a bit but would pop back out after too much strain so I had to walk really slow. At least there were some other straps that allowed me to still use the shoe but the one that broke was one of the main bigger straps. I get through the event and as I'm walking through the parking lot the other main strap pops off on the same shoe. At least it happened as I was leaving though.

I'm sure you already know where this is going. In the interviews they talked about what I would prefer my hours to be, and what I'd like my pay to be. Since I'd received $8 an hour at my last 2 jobs I thought it would be reasonable to request that. And they agreed. Until my first day when my manager said, ""Okay so I was going to start you at $7.25 an hour."" I reminded him that I made $8 an hour at my last job. Then he just stared at me blankly for a few seconds before saying, ""$7.60 it is."" It irked me sure but fine, whatever, I need the job.

But wait there's more! I specifically listed that I wanted to work at least 30 hours a week, and I listed all the days and times that I could and couldn't work. And I can work pretty much everyday except Saturday (which my parents insists I spend with them) and certain weekday evenings because I'm taking summer classes. Sure no problem, we can schedule you at different times. And then the first two schedules I received had me scheduled at the exact times I said I couldn't work. I figured it was a mistake so I told them politely that I couldn't work, and when they said I should've said it in my interview I said I did. They stared at me blankly again and said, ""Oh we'll fix it then."" And now I'm only getting scheduled 1-2 days a week. And several times I've been sent home early because ""They have too many people.""

Oh and this goes with my last point but so far this pisses me off the most. I had to go to a funeral last weekend when, guess what, I was scheduled to work. So I asked one of my coworkers if she'd be willing to switch one of her shifts for mine, which she said was fine. But since our scheduling manager wasn't in, we left a note. I checked back the next day to make sure he got it and I was good to go. And then my manager said that we couldn't switch because ""It wouldn't be an equal trade because she does different things."" To be fair, I mostly work up front while she works drive-thru, but we've both worked the other without too many problems so I don't really see how that was a valid excuse. When I said why I couldn't go to work and that I'd really like to switch shifts or at least pick up another so I don't miss out on money, they insisted it'd be fine if I didn't show up. And then the next day when I came in to check the schedule for the next week, they apparently changed their mind, we could switch shifts after all. Fantastic, so I went off thinking everything was settled. Oh how naive of me. While I was at the funeral reception (which is a good 2 hours away) I received a phone call, from guess who, my manager wondering where I was. ""I'm at a funeral, I switched shifts with X, remember?"" ""Oh yeah. We wanted you guys to both come in."" What? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of switching shifts? ""When did this happen? Today."" Well no wonder I had no clue, I was fucking gone since morning. Not to mention THEY COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO CALL ME TO NOTIFY ME OF THE CHANGE. Hell, even a text would've worked, but seriously, am I supposed to be a goddamned psychic? Well obviously I couldn't drop everything and go to work on a day I was supposed to have off, but I assured them that I'd be there the next day. Come the next day, I'm there...as well as the coworker I switched with. Apparently they told her to come in today anyways. Oh and right after I clocked in they said they had too many people (fortunately they decided to send her home and not me because she'd been working for several days straight and this was supposed to be her day off anyways). Though I guess in the end it didn't matter because a couple hours later they sent me home because we were super slow.

I mean, what the hell is with the management? These people are so mind-boggling incompetent. Is it so hard to write shit down and to keep track of people's schedules? Yeah I realize there's several people that have this as their full time job and they can work any time necessary, but I'm part-time, and a student and I clearly told you when I can't work, but no, apparently unless I have nothing better to do but work I get my hours cut to the point where I make peanuts. And fuck you for lying to me about my pay rate, if you didn't want to pay me that much than say so, don't wait until after I've accepted the fucking job to tell me you're going to pay me less. It's not like that money would've gone to good use, like helping me become financially independent so I wouldn't have my parents breathing down my neck anymore. Nope looks like I get to leech of them longer. So thank you for being an absolutely shitty employer.

1373598152.0,10,self.rant,1i4n7x,10 Reasons why Astrology is stupid.,16,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i4n7x/10_reasons_why_astrology_is_stupid/,"Someone once said that Astrology is about as vacant as the space that it worships. Here are some reasons why:

1. The stars in a constellation are sometimes thousands of light-years apart and the connection between them is arbitrary.

2. When you were born your obstetrician had more gravitational effect on you than any planet or star in the universe. 

3. There are 13 constellations in the Zodiac (not 12). The 13th is Ophiuchus.

4. The Zodiac was established around 2000 years ago. Since then the Zodiac has shifted one sign along, however the traditional dates for each sign haven't changed. i.e. The Zodiac sign that you were born ""under"" is meant to be the constellation that the sun was in front-of during your birth. So if you are a Gemini, the chances are that Cancer was actually behind the sun during your birth (due to the 2000 year shift in the Zodiac).

5. The natal planet alignment is futile since the time-of-birth is often arbitrarily chosen (i.e. the doctor/nurses may get the hour right, but not necessarily the minutes).
6. Are all horoscopes done before the discovery of the outermost planets incorrect? Planets get found, demoted and promoted all the time. Pluto was identified and became a planet in 1930. It was demoted to ""dwarf planet"" in 2006. Ceres was a planet in the 1800s and then demoted to asteroid in the 1850s and has now been promoted to dwarf planet again. Xena was discovered in 2003 and became a planet and in 2006 was demoted to dwarf planet. What's more - Pluto doesn't follow the zodiac path like the other planets (i.e. it will sometimes be in front of non-zodiac constellations.

7. If the planets influence us astrologically why is this influence independent of distance? Mars is sometimes the other side of the sun from us and sometimes it is the same side as us, yet this difference has no astrological effect on us.
8. If distances aren't important in astrology, then where's the astrology of galaxies, quasars, nebulae and black-holes?

9. Why do horoscopes of the same zodiac sign in different newspapers differ so much?

10. Why is the moment of birth, rather than conception, crucial for astrology? Why does a thin layer of flesh and blood protect a baby from the planets/stars/sun/moon...a
nd if not then why do premature babies not have different star-charts than non-prem babies born at the same time on the same day?

Preface: I am 19 years old, currently car-less as mine died a few weeks back, and employed working 25-35 hours a week living at home for the summer.

I am nearing my wit's end. I am nearing explosion. I am nearing just fucking going off, but I don't. Because no one gives a flying shit about how I feel. ""Don't like it? Move out.""

I get that I was lax on the job front the past few years, but I'm working now. I am the reason that you can keep smoking and boozing and still live in the house, even if you aren't paying the mortgage because we're trying to sell it. Would it fucking kill you to show me a little fucking bit of appreciation? 

I don't suppose you get that I was suffering from some really bad anxiety and depression? Was the fact that I did absolutely nothing social wise last summer besides working give it away? or was it the fact that I was holed up in my dorm room for most of my first year of school that gave it away? Or was it the constant screaming at me last summer because I didn't work enough, or the constant nagging about a job. 

Instead of assuming I was being lazy, do you not fucking think that this went deeper and I could have instead used a TINY bit of support from either of my parents? 

It killed me that you didn't even begin to think that something was wrong with me. I told you I needed help the winter of my senior year, and I went to a therapist and promptly stopped. I suppose you thought that I was magically cured but it couldn't be that the fucking guy laughed at me. I have problems enough opening up and I did and the guy laughed at me, saying how 'typical' of a reaction I was having. 

Honestly, typing this is pissing me off far too much.

So I get it. I didn't have a 'real' job until April. You have reminded me on numerous occasions. Let. It. Go. Through all of this I have internalized and you just *assumed* I'm fine. I'm not. I am broken. 

So February of 2013 comes around...

""*You need to make plans for the summer for when we're not around anymore.*""

What. the. FUCK. does that mean? So here I am... I have student loans, albeit only $3,500 at this point, and you tell me that you *won't be around anymore* and I have to find something to do? I understand that I'm 18 and you do not have go be legally responsible for me... You and my father both have reminded me on NUMEROUS occasions but it would be nice if you made it seem like you actually cared. 

So I make plans to move 1,600 miles from home to live with my father. Getting out of Maine might be nice, right?

No. Absolute worst decision, ever.

Multiple times a week I was reminded that I needed a job, that I wouldn't be sitting around playing video games while living there. Multiples times a week. I GET IT. I'M NOT, NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN, FUCKING STUPID. DO YOU THINK I ENJOY MY LIFE? DO YOU THINK I ENJOY NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TO MYSELF, BEGGING MY MOTHER TO PUT MONEY BEHIND MY DEBIT CARD SO I COULD BUY MEDICINE BECAUSE I WAS FUCKING SICK AND HAD NO FUCKING MONEY? DO YOU FUCKING THINK I LIKE THAT?

So this continues for months. IT drove me deeper down into depression, knowing that I had a job hunt and the amount of pressure I was under terrified me. What if I didn't find a job? What if, what if, what if. I suffered physically. I suffered mentally. I suffered emotionally. I suffered academically, but it wouldn't stop. I was applying for jobs, but without much luck. There was only so much I could do from 1600 miles away. I understand that I didn't get a job the summer I lived with you, even though I said I would.

More on that later.

So April rolls around. I've had enough. I'm cracking. I am sobbing every night because of the enormous amount of pressure I was under, and the lack of friends to deal with it. You were also berating me because of the amount I ate while I was at your house in Florida, and told me I needed to see a shrink because of my problems with people and food. You told me for months and months on end that I had an eating problem.

Let's break down my college food schedule.

Wake up 8:30 or 9 a.m., depending on the day, go to class for 9 or 9:30.

Lunch between 11-1, typically. Dinner between 4 and 6. 

Want a snack? Oh just hop over to the cafe in the campus center and pick something up with your $150 flex cash.

8 p.m. and beyond... nothing because I had no money to keep snacks on hand. See job part ^

Go to sleep and do it all over again.

I am a person of the night, always have been. I go to bed late and I wake up late. I get that this isn't compatible with your 'family', with your 'lifestyle' but just because I am spending Christmas with you doesn't mean that I have to be compatible with your lifestyle. The fact that your son that you see, on average, every 6 months is coming to stay with you, should make you happy enough. Guess not.

So yeah. I ate at night because there was food available. You're trying to lose weight and made me feel awkward for eating a decent amount of lunch so I ate about as much as you did, or not a lot. At dinner I ate a little more but still kept it reasonable. 

At school, I am used to 'as much as you care to eat.' Making the adjustment was hard. I didn't do that well, and I ate when food was on hand. You berated me for it. You tried to get me to think that I had an eating disorder and wouldn't believe that I didn't.

So anyway, I finally see the school counselor. I see him 3 times total, once a week.

At this point, your girlfriend, not my mother, starts giving me heaping piles of shit of the same shit you gave me about applying for jobs, not sitting around and playing, we are a family that works, blah fucking blah. I FUCKING GET IT. I FUCKING GOD DAMN FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT I FUCKING NEED A GOD DAMN FUCKING JOB. I GET IT. I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID. I AM ACTUALLY QUITE INTELLIGENT. I FUCKING GET IT. I UNDERSTAND. I COMPREHEND. I GET IT. YOU DO NOT NEED TO TELL ME 6 TIMES A WEEK THAT I NEED A JOB, THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, WE ARE A FAMILY THAT WORKS. I. FUCKING. GET. IT. 

She makes the mistake of telling me something among the lines of, ""I'm not your mother but if I were...""

Hold up. Red flag on the field. Who the FUCK are you to parent me? You're the bimbo that my father started dating when I was 17. You're right. You are not my mother. You need to stay out of this, but the co-dependency. Can't make a decision for yourself, either one of you. 

I get that you're ""in love"" but you aren't my mother. End of story. 

She gives me shit, I start applying for jobs in Maine. Your girlfriend made the decision so much easier for me to not move to Florida with that little stunt she pulled. So I decide to not go, but I don't tell anyone because I need a leg to stand on.

So I call my mother, telling her I am coming home for the weekend. She texts me and asks why. I tell her that I have an interview and she goes off the deep end causing me to panic. Saying that I'll need to move out, get roommates, get 2-3 jobs, etc...

I'm seeing the counselor at this point when the phone call happens and I'm sobbing. I am absolutely crushed. I thought that you'd want me to stay, but I'm wrong. I'm almost 19, I'm legally responsible for myself.

So I am in an absolute panic. I need to find a place to move when school is out, I need to make sure I get a job, and soon. This was mid April, school was done May 9th. 

I spend the rest of the afternoon and part of the evening scouring the internet for roommate ads, for jobs, for anything, absolute panicked. I have such a knot in my stomach, I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't stop being scared, I couldn't stop feeling rejected. I went and sat in the shower stall under the water for 20 minutes and it didn't make me feel any better.

I wasn't going to sleep that night and this was the end of the world for me. Until you sent me that message over facebook. You said that you went off the deepend, that you overreacted, that you can come home, but you'd still need a job and paying for shit. 

I feel literally millions times better. 

So I go for the job interview at McDonald's on Monday, after coming home for the weekend. I feel good about it, but who knows. It's not much, but it's a paycheck. I go back to school that night, and the next morning, the best thing happened.

I got the call saying I got the job. That I could continue to live. That I will survive to see another summer. That I will finally get a leg to stand on, finally be able to be my own person. I am so excited. That Alex has a *job.* *Alex* got a *job.* After so long of not having a job. Happy birthday to me, right?

So the next month goes about as perfect as it could. I make friends at school playing Magic, and I have a job. Sure I'm commuting 50 miles one way on the weekend, but that only lasts so long.

I am on Cloud fucking Nine. I have a job, I have friends. Who is this Alex, and what have you done with the real one? 

You couldn't muster an ounce of excitement for me. ""Good."" 

Whatever.

So the end of school rolls around, and my father and his family are in Maine visiting, originally to take me back with them, but I'm not going. I have a job here and a family that sort of seems like they want me. 

So the visit ends, and they end up at my grandparents (his father) house, and they left just before I got there after coming from work, delivering Mother's day presents. I'm there visiting with my family, seeing my aunt and her family are in town from New Hampshire. 

We get talking and they say this. ""They were on you so hard about getting a job because the last time you were there, you said you would and you didn't.""

Okay. Stop right fucking there.

Have you not figured out by now that I went to live with you that summer because I pitied you? Because I felt bad for you that you were alone with only your dog. Your russian mail order bride (that's a whole other seperate rant) only wanted a greencard so you sent her back? 

I only said I would get a job so you would agree to this, and because I pitied you. I didn't feel like anyone should be alone, especially when it was within my power to fix it. That's why I went, not to get a job. 

Anyway... 

My work fucks up my hours. I get one shift a week for 2 weeks in a row because when I was hired I told the store manager that I was weekends only until the end of school, she was good with that. She told the scheduling manager that I would tell the scheduling manager when I was out of school, but the store manager did not tell me that I had to tell her that I was out of school, so 1 shift a week for 2 weeks. Whatever, I'll live.

I guess...

I am not a physically strong person. I do not like house work or yard work, and tend to avoid it whenever possible. I get that you don't want me sitting around the house when Rob could use help renovating. So you tell me this, whatever. I offer every day. Sometimes I do things, sometimes I don't, but I offer. 

well apparently that's not good enough for you anymore. So you shut off the internet one morning because you were pissy at me.

No one could ever talk to me or anything. It's all passive aggressive bullshit. 

So fast forward a few weeks later, I say I want to get my own phone, I want a smartphone. So I do. I am off my parents cell phone bill, paying for my own. It is important to note that I got my $225 housing deposit refund that day, too.

So normally ed techs at the school district where my mother works can take smaller pay checks during the year to get pay checks during the summer. 

But not this year and you knew it wasn't going to happen, still you made no preparation for the summer.

Your husband, who doesn't drive but still is physically capable of working, knew it was going to happen, and still you made no preparations.

No savings, no job applications until 2 weeks ago. You are working 23~ hours a week, getting paid $170 a week. 

You knew this was going to happen.  

If this had happened to me, you would have been screaming at me daily, hourly even, to go find a job, but I have one. And you don't. 

So I start paying some of the bills, see aforementioned phone bill and internet bill. 

Last Monday, I give you $140 in the span of about 20 minutes so you can have gas in your car, that I need to use as well, and $100 to YOUR cell phone bill so that you can keep your phones on. You ask me to do this and say that you'll give me some of the money from my car that died and is getting junked. 

So I give you $140.

Friday I ask you if had any money from the car, as I was nearly out and you say, ""you know... I said that but then I start to think about how I've paid every phone bill, every insurance bill. So no, quite deliberately I haven't done anything with that check.""

What a fucking cunt shitwad move to pull. You ask me to help you, to put money towards your phone, telling me you'll pay me part of it back, I do and you pull this fucking horseshit on me. You fucking lying sack of shit mother. Who the fuck does that to their kids who are trying to fucking help them. 

I turned down a shift that day because after working 6 days in a row, I needed a break. You give me this look about how I was whining about it or some shit because poor fucking me. I wanted my day off after working 6 days in a row. 

I'm not in physical shape 8 hour shifts are hard. Days are long, and I am physically and mentally tired of working. I want a day off. Excuse fucking me. I worked the 4th of July... What did you do? mow part of the lawn and have a fire. I worked every day before that, all the way up to the Saturday before. You worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of that week. Excuse me for needing a day off.

So I ask you for your car that night, and it was a whole other battle. You're not doing anything, can't afford to go out, I wanted to go out, be social and have a little fun. Finally a little success and I get her car. I go play Magic for 6 hours, it was a good night. 

Oh I forgot to mention that I had to turn $20 into quarters to do laundry and you just help yourself to them don'tcha? not thinking that they might. not. be. yours. Yeah, I left them in your car, but you are capable of putting 2+2 together. 

Thanks.

So today, I take you to work so I can have your car to also go to work, and you ask me to do return the chainsaw we borrowed and do the rest of the dishes that you didn't 'have time' to finish. yeah right. So I return the chainsaw and I forget to do the dishes. I can only imagine what you must think. Of how terrible of a person I am that I forgot to do them.

Don't get me started on your husband who couldn't hold a job for a week because he yelled and swore at the project manager because it was shoddy work. You couldn't just think that you NEED the job, that you can't afford to quit/get fired. But no. He is a leech on the finances, bringing in next to none himself. And I pay for him. And you bitch at me. 

So think on this. You need me. You need my paycheck, as small as it is. Maybe, if you want to keep it, you start treating me a little better, otherwise I will say no. I will let you fall. You might have to quit smoking and drinking. 

But at least I will have my dignity.

I haven't seen her in weeks. We only get to talk for a few minutes a day, and sometimes not at all. I'm 18 and she's 17. There has been one single occasion that was not school/dance for school where I have seen her with out her sister being there. That one occasion was our first date over two years ago. 

So she came over today and of course her sister is there. I opened the door and she gave me a hug and like always her sister is just staring at us. I can't fucking stand it. She is *always* staring. So, we all come up to my room. Her sister wants to play Sims 3 on my Xbox. So I hook that dusty thing up and turn on Sims for her. My girlfriend and I go downstairs and play a board game with my little sister (5), which doesn't last long. We watch Tinkerbell while my sister jumps around and tries to get attention from my girlfriend the whole time. Eventually the girlfriend's sister gets tired of the Sims and my sister wants to play something too. They decide on Minecraft. Great, that's just fine, you two stay up there and I finally get to spend time with my girlfriend. Well, *it won't fucking work right.* I have to sign in to Xbox live to play OFFLINE SPLITSCREEN. I spend a good 30 minutes trying to set up fucking Minecraft, but can't because my account is locked because I don't give a shit about the stupid thing. So I turn on Forza 4 because the box tells me it has split screen. Well can't play that without the update that you can't download. So I make new accounts AND THAT WORKS! Except I have to play the single player race before I can get to the main menu for split screen. So I play this fucking videogame while my girlfriend is waiting downstairs. When I'm through the goddamn game freezes! Jesus fucking christ. I spent more time trying to get that Xbox set up than seeing my girlfriend. I turn on PBS for sister and I head back downstairs...followed by my girlfriends sister. So we just sit there on the couch trying to watch Johnny Bravo on Netflix while her sister stares at us. It was about 4 hours of just being pissed off and feeling like I was fucking everything up. I just want to see her and talk to her. Her eleven year old sister is not my responsibility. I'm sick of trying to entertain her, paying for her meals, and constantly being stared at. I'm tired of her spoiled and rude attitude. We aren't going to fuck in my house with two of my little siblings and my parents here. Stop sending that little shit. Goddammit.

Pitbulls get a bad rep *somewhat* undeservedly.  They're often accused of being dangerous pets to own.  And they are not, at least for the *human* family members.  

My boyfriend and I have a APBT.  She is a sweetheart... with humans.  Great with other people, great with kids.  She even behaves well with cats.  Other dogs?  HA!  We have a harness for her, rather than just a leash and collar, because it's the only way to ensure we can control her when going on walks.  Pitbulls are generally horrible around other dogs if not heavily trained from the get go.  Hell, our dog was raised around another dog (she lived with one when my boyfriend was still living with his old roommates), and she is still very dog aggressive.  We can't even own another dog.

And this is why whenever someone exclaims, ""OH MY GOD, I LOVE PITBULLS, THEY ARE THE BEST DOGS"", I roll my eyes.  You have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  They are far from the best dog breed.  I have owned and been around quite a few breeds of dog in my time, and pitbulls are by far some of the hardest dogs to own.  They are stubborn as shit, and on top of that, they pretty much abhor other dogs.  So, please, get your head out of your ass.  ""THE MEDIA SAYS PITBULLS ARE BAD, SO LOOK AT ME, I'M SUCH A COMPASSIONATE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE I CLAIM I LOVE PITBULLS.  I GO AGAINST THE NORM, LOOK AT ME GUYS.  HEY, HEY LOOK AT ME, I LOVE PITBULLS BECAUSE I'M AN UNDERSTANDING PERSON.  GUYS.  GUYS.  NO, REALLY, LOOK AT ME.""

If you get a pit bull, don't take the responsibility of owning one lightly.  They are a lot of work.  And remember that you are not some noble person for taking the responsibility of owning a very misunderstood (in more ways than one) breed of dog.  You are not the fucking Angelina Jolie of dog owners, so stop acting like it.  

Yes, I have figured you out.  It's the ""in"" thing to look as compassionate and open-minded as possible.  And I'm fucking sick of hearing and reading ""I LOVE PITBULLS!!!!!"" because more than half the time, it's some egotistical asshole trying to further boost his ego by acting like he's the only person in the world that recognizes the media is hard on pitbulls.

Yeah i get it, she is hot and i am nothing compared. Tell me, i totally want to know that she is a hot piece of ass and i am just here. I am generally around guys (with no boundaries on that topic what so ever) a lot, and the way they talk about girls they don't even know just makes me sad, because with so many good looking people out there - why in the world would anyone pick me ever?

His sister is 18. His dad works 2 hours away from their house. His mom works 5 hours away from their house. 

Let's begin. I babysit this kid every fucking day. He is spoiled and rude as fuck sometimes, but I love him. I've known him for 2 and a half years and yes I want to punch him sometimes, but he's really very sweet. His parents are the most disorganized, selfish fuck heads I've ever met. And his sister is on drugs but his parents don't give a fuck. They think she's ""sweet and innocent"". Fucking dickheads. 

Lately, they have been wanting me to pick him up from school, which is in the middle of fucking nowhere. I google mapped that bitch like 7 times and eventually I found it. And guess what. HE FUCKING TOOK THE BUS HOME BECAUSE NOBODY FUCKING TOLD HIM I WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK HIM UP BECAUSE HIS PARENTS SUCK AT TELLING EACH OTHER WHAT THE FUCK IS UP. As I sat there fucking FUMING, his dad called to apologize. ""We'll pay you for your gasoline"" they said. One fucking week later, guess what? NO FUCKING MONEY BECAUSE NO ONE IS HOME. 

Half the fucking time I go over there his fucking parents are sitting there watching fucking tv while I babysit their kid because they don't fucking want to. Where the fuck is his sister? Probably in fucking Timbuktu smoking a joint or some shit. She's never there. FUCKING GO TO WORK AND THEN I'LL WATCH YOUR KID. 

Today, I fucking drove across town in an area I don't ever fucking go to pick up this kid form swimming. I then drive back so he can change his clothes. Then he fucking eats like 2 pierogies for lunch and says he's full (fucking bullshit, he gets hungry as a motherfucker later and I have to fucking buy him a goddamn buffet sized meal). Then I drive him back to the same fucking building to drop him off for golf and his mom told me to pick him up at 4:15. So I fucking drive home and go back at 4:15. 

I fucking get there and this kid is nowhere in sight. In fact no one is there, fucking tumbleweed passed in front of me it's so empty. I text this kid on his iPhone 5 (spoiled brat) and he says his fucking dad picked him up and he's sitting at home. OH HELL NO. I FUCKING USED UP A QUARTER TANK OF GAS DRIVING THIS FUCKING KID AROUND AND HIS MOM FORGOT TO TELL HIS DAD I WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK HIM UP. FUCKING GET IT TOGETHER YOU BITCHES. 

THEY FUCKING TEXT ME ALMOST EVERY FRIDAY NOT TO COME BABYSIT WHICH IS THE DAY I FUCKING GET PAID SO I HAVE NO FUCKING MONEY ALL WEEKEND. 

""Why don't you just quit?"" Well, on the off chance they do remember to fucking pay me, it pays pretty fucking well. And I like this kid when he's not acting like children of the corn. Fuck. I feel better. ",,False,,t5_2qn2b,False,,,True,t3_1glzc4,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1glzc4/i_fucking_hate_disorganized_people_who_lack/,
