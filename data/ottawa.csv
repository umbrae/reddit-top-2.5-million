There are no signs saying that parking is illegal in the section due to an error. The construction company is paying for the tow (cars are being moved to Albert st) but By-Law legally has to give the car a ticket before it is towed.
If you are one of the few effected, or know someone who is, you can very easily fight this ticket and win. The proper signs were not up.

Ohhhhhh boy was I wrong. This festival is as amateur as they come. They sell tons of tickets, take your money, and don't hire any staff for the campsites nor the town proper. I had to skip a line to find out I was supposed to be in another line for will call, and gave up after 3 hours of waiting in the sun with no water (due to the no bags restriction) and being told it would be at least another two. Calling that a line is generous, it was more like a clusterfuck. I showed up at 11am and by 5pm I was back in Ottawa. Waste of money, waste of time. Oh, and I hear the organizer makes small bands sell 50 tickets and if they don't, they pay the difference to play. Scumbag all around.

There are stories on the facebook wall for the event detailing how there was absolutely no security or staff for any of the campsites and parking lots, how people who paid didn't get the things they paid for. Apparently there are 10 port-a-potties for an entire 1000 person campsite and they've been overfilled since last night with no staff to empty them. The campsites and parking lots are impossible to vacate because people parked in the exit lanes, there is trash everywhere. All the staff seem to have abandoned ship due to the chaos of not being able to deal with the number of people this event attracted.

Alex Martel, you should be fucking ashamed of yourself. I will never, ever forget your name. The moment your name is associated with an event is the moment I put my wallet away. Thanks for nothing.

This is practically criminal.

I met you yesterday around 6:30pm walking along Hunt Club away from South Keys and towards Uplands. You had commented on my reading/walking skills after I passed you, and that led to a small chat about what we were both reading (you were reading a psychological book, I was reading Brave New World) and we walked together briefly as you told me of your dislike for Margaret Atwood (who wrote the intro to my copy of BNW). 

We went our separate ways around McCarthy/Downpatrick and though I got your name I was silly and didn't ask for a way to keep in touch with you. I don't know if you'll see this, but I'd like to chat again sometime or at least tell you if I share your dislike for Margaret Atwood (once I've read one of her works, in your words, ""to torture myself"").

These are the whiny commercials re: Verizon Wireless bidding on entry into the Canadian market. 

They go on and on about Canada being a world leader in wireless technology, how Canadian cell phone rates are so much less expensive, blah, blah blah. 

It's frustrating to listen to because their arguments hold no water and are not based on fact. The large 3 Canadian providers have been screwing Canadian clientele for years and it's time for someone to shake them up. For anyone with a discount, fly by night provider...don't worry - your service won't be going away. There will always be discount options.  

I live in Ottawa but work for a US company, so I have a foot in each country. I have been with Verizon Wireless for 3 years now on a North American plan (no roaming). Previously I was with Bell, Rogers, and Telus. 

Long story short, Verizon has been the best Wireless provider I have ever dealt with. Their customer service makes the large 3 Canadian companies look incredibly incompetent. It's embarrassing how awful they are in comparison. Additionally, I am never without coverage.. The quality of service is outstanding. 

Anyways, I just wanted to hear some other opinions on these campaigns and would like to see if they anger anyone else as much as they do for me. It's time for the Canadian market to get shaken up and give Canadian wireless clients a REAL alternative instead of the current monopoly.

BACKGROUND PERFORMERS NEEDED FOR FEATURE FILM ""TPB III: DON'T LEGALIZE""


This is the new Trailer Park Boys adventure, and they're coming to Parliament Hill!


if you are going to be in Ottawa on April 20-21 and you'd like to participate - please read this notice carefully for all the details.


SHOOT DATES: April 20-21
LOCATION: Ottawa
Start Time: TO BE DETERMINED
End Time: TO BE DETERMINED


RATE OF PAY: $11.50 per hour - (ACTRA members = union rate)


PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A 2 DAY EVENT. WE WILL REQUIRE ALL PERFORMERS FOR BOTH DAYS. MUST BE 18+ TO PARTICIPATE


HOW TO APPLY:

Please visit www.hennesseycasting.com and create your own Talent Profile. Please select ""TRAILER PARK BOYS: OTTAWA!"" - (please note: this form cannot be completed on a mobile device).
**If you already have a profile, just login and apply to the project.


IF YOU ARE SELECTED: You will receive an email asking you to confirm that you are still available for the whole 2 days. Once you`ve replied to that email, we will then add your name to our CONFIRMED AVAILABLE list. A couple of days before your first shoot day we will contact you again to BOOK you and provide you with the rest of the details, such as location and calltime and wardrobe notes.


IMPORTANT: Please make sure the photos on your profile are CURRENT and reflect what is really going on with your hair and your weight. Please make sure your clothing sizes are accurate and that your contact info, union status and representation are UP TO DATE.
Some of these roles require wardrobe so do yourself a favor and measure!


YOU MUST BE A CANADIAN RESIDENT


If you are an ACTRA union member you will need your membership number. If you are Non-Union you will need your SIN number. Missing information on your paperwork means you won't get paid when everyone else does.


YOU MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR BOTH OF THE FULL DAYS. WE DO NOT KNOW CALL TIMES IN ADVANCE AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE SET ONCE YOU ARE THERE UNTIL YOU ARE RELEASED BY PRODUCTION.

**EDIT:** If you don't know what some of the criteria mean, you are probably NON-UNION and have no representation because I can safely assume you also don't have an agent. Do not mark yourself as ACTRA unless you know what that is and are actually part of ACTRA (you would definitely know because you'd be paying them union dues). 

Please don't apply for scenes in Nova Scotia unless you're actually going to be in Nova Scotia and available.

**EDIT2**: I've been informed that production switched casting companies for this casting call this morning (April 16). I know you'll all be pissed when you realize Smyth Casting charges $25 to register, but there is nothing I can do - it's out of my control. Really sorry! I can confirm this change is legitimate, so this is not a scam of any sort. If you feel frustrated about this, feel free to share with Smyth Casting. I personally think the fees are BS myself, especially because if you're not selected, you lose 25.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,1366147149.0,,,True,t3_1b6u5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1b6u5g/trailer_park_boys_will_be_shooting_some_scenes_in/,

1358280181.0,101,self.ottawa,16mx15,How interested would you be in a home cooked food delivery service for lunches and dinners at around $5.00 per meal?,117,16,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/16mx15/how_interested_would_you_be_in_a_home_cooked_food/,"edit- Just wanted to thank everyone for their posts. This has been a seed of an idea in my head for a long time, and mostly everyone has been very friendly and helpful, giving me a sense of what I'm looking at here. I have a lot of learning and research to do, and I've got a lot to go on from here. Lots of work to do to get this off the ground ahead of me, so thanks again for the reality check folks!

[After reading this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/16lcfu/is_there_a_place_in_ottawa_that_prepares_meals/) (and doing some research into what is already out there, and how they do things) I have decided that there *may* be room in Ottawa for people (especially young professionals and students) to have this service available to them for a reasonable price. 

I've had this idea kicking around in my head for some time now, and I think it could work. I guess what I'm asking is:

**Would you be interested in a daily meal delivery service that gives you fresh and/or frozen meals with all relevant nutritional, caloric, and ingredient information, for ~$5 per meal, delivered daily/weekly/etc?**

**What would you like to see in a service like this, and what kind of meals/menu would you be most interested in?**

**Under what circumstances would you choose to use it?**

I'd never considered setting up a business myself (any advice on that front would be great, too) until this idea popped up, so I don't really know what I'm doing on that front, but I CAN cook (as several people on this subreddit can attest to), and I love it. So anyway, if people are asking about it, then there may be interest. $5 per meal delivered seems both very reasonable and financially doable, but ",,False,,t5_2qpoo,1358308747.0,,area,True,t3_16mx15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/16mx15/how_interested_would_you_be_in_a_home_cooked_food/,

Prior to today I have been rear ended TWICE while at a complete stop, and also had to quickly jump out of my lane twice on the 417 as people who arent paying attention are simply driving into me. This has all happened in the past year. Worst case if I didn't have the reaction time in those situations would have been a badly beat in and scraped car.

This morning, I had just gotten on the 417W from the 174 split. I am in the far left lane doing 120, along with everyone else. It's 9:30 AM at this point so traffic has cleared up. Someone from the far right doing 90ish switches into the middle, keeps their blinker on. At this point they are maybe a foot to two feet infront of me, going considerably slower. Then, without hesitation, they fly into my lane full force. Thank god (or whoever) that at the St Laurent portion of the 417 there is a full ""lane"" to the side where people can pull over etc. With my cat ninja reflexes I narrowly avoided certain distaster, going 120, he missed me my millimetres.

At these speeds, and with him pulling into my lane with about a foot lead on me, there would have been certain destruction. Worst case (and very likely) I would have been pushed over the median into oncoming traffic on the 417E.

I'm absolutely sick of this shit. What is with people who can't drive for shit getting on the highway in Ottawa? I've had enough merging onto the highway at 50km and enough times of narrowly avoiding major crashes. 

About a KM later we came to a brief full stop (nicholas) because there was sligh traffic there. My only regret was that I didn't get out of my car and made sure this guy was aware that he not only put my life and his life in dire danger, but everyone else's on the higway at the time.

I am going to invest in a dash cam and I plan on starting a Youtube channel for all the would be murderers on Ottawa roads. If anyone has any reccomendations on those, let me know.

Sorry for the rant, but my adrenaline is still going and Ottawa's ratios of terrible, dangerous drivers is far worse than anywhere else in the region.

These guys act like they have the toughest job. Like dealing with customers is solely a bus driver burden. They get payed extremely well to deal with customers as I see it. I take their rude comments and lack of care for their customers lightly and try not to let it bother me. But now they have gone too far.

A late bus driver was driving my pregnant girlfriend to work. She is 8 months now and very big. He was driving recklessly fast as he was late. She pulled the cord to get off at the next stop. The bus driver goes to pass the stop and realizes he has missed it because he is driving too fast. He slams on the break and my girlfriend falls over and hits the side of her belly as she does. Stricken she tells the bus driver that he's was driving too fast and there are people on the bus that could get hurt (even though she is currently hurt). The bus driver loses it on her and as she is leaving the bus honks at her all the way down the street, screaming at her that she is a ""Fucking bitch"" with his doors open.

She is so stricken that I just got the phone call and am on my way to the hospital. She was in hysterics. Balling her eyes out on the phone for fear that her (and my) unborn child may be hurt, and obviously humiliated by the late and irate bus driver cursing her out in public.

He was clearly not having a great day but this is insane! We have called OC Transpo to complain but will that do anything? We've all called. Nothing gets done. These guys are invincible due to their tight knit union. This is absolute madness. Yelling at a pregnant woman for being upset that your driving recklessly? What is the bus system coming to? This has to stop! Something needs to be done and it clearly needs to be drastic as it is clear, if injuring a pregnant woman won't stop them, nothing will stop these bus drivers from bullying people off their bus.

I was laying in the grass next to the RA Centre where there some people playing baseball. I think you saw me try to get up and stumble home. You asked if I was okay. I told you that I hurt my leg while running, but otherwise, I was fine. My speech was very slurred and it was probably difficult t o understand me. You asked me if I hit my head, and if I needed medical attention. I said I was fine. However, you insisted on helping me back to my apartment, and had me hold your bike handlebar as I crossed the street. Once across the street, I wandered off in the wrong direction. You came to get me and pointed me in the right direction. Then, as my made my way into the building you told a girl in the building ""can you make sure my friend here gets home safely?"" .. or something to that affect.

Half an hour after you saw me, I was being diagnosed with a right ICA thrombosis (read: stroke) at The Ottawa Civic Hospital, and today after spending the entire summer in the hospital, I'm doing just fine.

1348173306.0,91,self.ottawa,107m0g,Canal users - a plea,121,30,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/107m0g/canal_users_a_plea/,"This has been bugging me for a while, so I apologise in advance for getting it off my chest here. I'm sure it doesn't apply to anyone on this subreddit, but if you can think of anyone that it does apply to then please pass on the sentiments and try and make this beautiful bit of our city just a little better.

Over the last few years the paths along the canal have been getting increasingly busy, and with that, increasingly discourteous. It doesn't have to be this way.

Cyclists: if you're in a hurry to get to work / get home / win Olympic gold, the road is the place for you, not the canalside path. Weaving in and out of walkers, runners, dogs, skateboards etc at 20mph on your carbon fibre speed machine might seem like fun, but someone's going to get hurt. Badly. 

Also, you might be possessed of a wonderful sense of balance that allows you to cycle happily with your hands operating your iPhone rather than the bicycle, but when a dog suddenly jumps you're going to have no chance to do anything but to crash into it, or its elderly owner, or a bench, or a small child. Think about what you're doing, please.

As well, you are not in Italy. The bell on your bicycle is not a proxy for the horn. It's there to allow you to warn others that you are behind them and not to step into your path, not to force them to get out of theirs. And if you're going to cycle at night, get some lights. They're for others to see you at least as much as you to see others.

Runners: whilst it might be motivational for you to run in large phalanxes along the path, it's ignorant - especially during the afternoon rush hour when people are going home or walking their dogs. If you're doing sprint training, the canal path is not an appropriate place for you to set out your cones. Go and use one of the many fine sporting facilities around the city, please.

Walkers: yes, it's beautiful. There are many fine things along the Canal worth stopping to see. But please, recognise that the yellow line is there for everyone to observe, and don't spread right across the path oblivious to all other users, forcing cyclists onto the grass and runners to have to try and weave through the gaps between your group. It's just basic consideration.

If you have a dog, there are plenty of bins. Putting dog crap in a bag and then leaving it on the side of the path because you don't want to walk a hundred yards with it in your hand is unacceptable, and reflects badly on all dog owners.

Apologies for sounding like a cross between a disgruntled NCC worker and Jack Lemmon, but as a cyclist, runner and dog owner who uses the Canal on a daily basis I really think we're in need of everyone acting with a little bit more consideration to their fellow canal users.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,1348173583.0,,area,True,t3_107m0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/107m0g/canal_users_a_plea/,

Saturday August 25th, 8:00pm to Sunday morning at 9:00am.

Here is what you need to know:

-	You must be 16 or older to attend. Strictly enforced;

-	The cover charge is $10 and will be donated to the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa;

-	The cover charge includes unlimited laser tag, unlimited popcorn, and entrance to the Blanket Fort Party and LAN Party;

-	The LAN party will be setup by Redditors, coordinated by Synergy_of_amazing. Funhaven will supply tables, power and network for 20 stations;

-	The fort party area will have a solid, loosely distributed structure. You will only need to bring blankets and pillows for a roof and to sit on. Please ensure that blankets are clean and smell nice.  You can bring additional structure yourself, but be reasonable. No U-Haul trucks backing up to the doors. You might need a light source;

-	Pajamas and nightwear are encouraged;

-	There are an additional bunch of rooms/areas that can be used for whatever you wish. Want to set up a board game room? Party room 2. Magic tournament? Party room 5. Knitting classes? VIP Room. The sky is the limit; set it up and make it happen.  Funhaven is the stage and Reddit is the show;

-	Alcohol will be available at Funhaven until 2:00am, but will not be allowed in to the Fort Party Area due to the complete lack of visibility;

-	You can bring your own snacks if you like, but absolutely NO NUTS or nut products;

-	No outside alcohol;

-	No open flames. Ever. Don’t even think of fire. Starting two days before the event;

-	Music will be provided;

-	Doors will be open all night for in and out access; and,

-	You must vacate the premises by 9:00am Sunday morning when our usual birthday parties are beginning. Bleary-eyed Redditors would probably scare small children.

It is important that everyone understands the spirit of this event. We are creating a fun night that benefits charity for socialization in a pleasantly awesome environment. I’ve never seen a massive fort party before, and I think it will be a great time. Funhaven is happy to contribute this kind of event to the community and create good times and cheer, but with that contribution comes a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of all guests in our facility at all times. In particular, I want to be absolutely clear that if you’re interested in getting smashed, this is not the place to do it. We will be actively and diligently preventing both underage drinking and excessive consumption throughout the entire night. If you are intoxicated when you arrive, you will be turned away at the door. Drinking responsibly is fine for adults as always.

For this event, you should be envisioning hanging out and chatting with good people, playing both electronic and board/card games, playing some awesome laser tag, dancing to some good tunes, building elaborate fort structures, bowling a few frames, and anything else you can imagine that does not cause grief to those around you.

I would like to recruit a minimum of five volunteer Fort Rangers who will be responsible for patrolling the fort to make sure that it is running smoothly. These individuals will receive free food, a free t-shirt, and the envy of all. Please message Synergy_of_amazing if you wish to be a Fort Ranger.

Sorry for the really long post, but it’s a really complex event. My staff and I (many of whom are Redditors also) are very excited and can’t wait to see it all unfold. If you plan to attend, please post how many people you might bring so we can get a feel for numbers. See you there!

TL;DR Bring a clean blanket.

I would just like to take a second to talk about the shared pathways. Whether you're out there walking your dog, riding your bike, on your roller blades, taking a stroll with a friend, smoking a j - whatever it is you're doing - please remember that you aren't alone on the pathway. Please be conscientious of your surroundings and try to be aware of what is going on around you.

**A few simple tips:**

* Keep to the right, pretend like you're driving on a two-lane highway, unless passing. (Applies to everyone.)
* Cyclists, please use your bells and be mindful when passing. Be extra careful when passing at speed. Look ahead.
* Pedestrians, please yield some space when others wishes to pass.
* Rollerbladers, you often take much of a whole lane, do not be offended when someone wishes to pass.
* People walking two/three/four-abreast: please make way when someone approaches from behind. Shift right.
* Large groups of pedestrians, please try not to take over the entire width of the pathway. Be courteous when others wish to pass.
* If you are wearing headphones, please just assume that you are going to be passed at some point, and keep right.
* Most of all, be excellent to each other. We can all use this space together happily.

I see all sorts of different behaviour and reactions out there, and I think it all stems from the fact that everyone thinks that they are exclusively entitled to the use of the pathways. A little co-operation, on everyone's behalf, would go a very long way. Again, these are the *shared* pathways. Please share cooperatively!

Thanks!

1370705768.0,85,self.ottawa,1fxgzj,If you're looking for a place to rent. AVOID this place!,96,11,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1fxgzj/if_youre_looking_for_a_place_to_rent_avoid_this/,"The large apartment building on the corner of Bell and Gladstone. 201 and 203 Bell street North are the WORST apartment buildings. I'm honestly just trying to save anyone else the hassle of living here. 

* The windows on the west side of the building are nailed shut because balconies are in the middle of construction. So you can't open your window. An A/C unit is now $250 a season (up from $100 last summer) and there are no exemptions/allowances made even though you can't open the windows
* Cockroaches. I don't have any in my unit except one or two I've found in the sink. But they are in the hallways and several other tenants I've spoken with have mentioned them. 
* On site laundry rooms are filthy. Garbage bins are rarely emptied and the amount of soap scum build up is insane. When someone does mop the floors in there (I've seen it once) the water he is using smells worse than the laundry room does. 
* They advertise an on-site fitness centre. Its a $50 deposit for a key. Not bad right? Except that it isn't part of the building that gets cleaned (wtf?) So there are weights scattered everywhere, the floor is dirty and the mirrors are covered in fingerprints. When I asked to see it on first moving in the belts on the stationary bikes were also hanging off the wheels. No mention of ""oh man its really bad in here I'll get someone to clean it up"" or ""we're in the process of fixing it up""
* They have changed building management three times since September 2012. Tells you something right there. As of three weeks ago CLV Group is the management company.
* The automated entry system inside the front doors is constantly broken. So no one can call you to tell you they have arrived and you can't buzz anyone in. 
* Garbage everywhere! I realize this is a problem with the people living here as much as the management but often the chute will get stuck and rather than taking garbage someplace else it piles up blocking the stairwell until someone feels like cleaning it up on Monday. 
* The main stairway is a death trap. Obviously if you live on an upped floor an always take the elevator this isn't a problem. But if you live lower down, there is an emergency, or you just want to take the stairs its an issue. The cement stairs are crumbling and the only lighs are some jerry-rigged flood lights hanging from their extension cords. Every so often someone comes and slathers some cement into the parts of the steps that have fallen off. And then its ""fine"" for like a month. 

Those are things anyone can verify. Now for some personal horror stories. 

* Move in day: We arrived at around noon on the day we were scheduled to move in. Our apartment wasn't ready. We were asked to come back three times before I finally got pissed and said I'd just clean it myself. This was a mistake. There was still loose food in the cupboards, muddy shoe prints on the floor from the painters, mildew in the bathtub and kitchen grease on all the cupboards. Those really nice floor length windows were also just leaning against their frames not in place at all. 
* A Queen sized mattress doesn't fit in any of the elevators. They say they have service elevators. This is a lie. All they do was hang padded fabric inside the regular elevator to protect the glass. 
* When asked for assistance both staff members (on separate occasions) basically said they weren't paid for that. 
* Taking my laundry out of the dryer once when a girl comes in crying hysterically. Someone stole all her stuff out of dryer, when she went to the management office she was told there was nothing they could do. (I know most places aren't responsible for lost or stolen items, not just here) She asked if she could get the police to look at the camera footage b/c she had some really important stuff in the dryer. They told her the camera didn't actually record anything it was just a deterrent. Needless to say I no longer leave anything unattended.
* This winter the power went out. Not much anyone can do to prevent that though. Hydro came and fixed it, except that two of the floors (one of them being mine) didn't get turned back on. No one from the building checked to make sure and since it was a weekend, there was no one to answer the telephones. Our power was off for just under 48 hours. No heat, no lights, -20 something outside and zero communication from management about when it would be back on.
* FFW today: Our internet has been slow so we called our provider. (I've since discovered any one with this provider has been having slow service for a few days) Yesterday they sent out a tech and he couldn't fix it as it was a problem with something as it came into the building, not our router. His supervisor came this morning and calls me on my cell (since we knew the buzzer system probably wouldn't be working... sure enough it isn't) Can't use the buzzer system to call a superintendent/building manager so I call the after hours number. Its not connected. So I ask around until some other guy goes and grabs a sheet of paper they taped to his door a few days ago with a new number. The internet tech calls them. He is told that there is **no emergency person scheduled to work this weekend** so he will have to call back on Monday. Okay, so a guy didn't want to come down because of internet which isn't actually an emergency. My husband calls the same number a little bit later and gets an answering machine saying that his call will be returned during business hours on Monday. Keep in mind this is the after hours *emergency* number. 
* ""Yo, LiquidHoney, why did you move there in the first place"" I moved to Ottawa from out of town so I came up here on a weekend to look for a place to live. I saw an apartment, liked it, it was in my rent range so I signed up! Canada Post tracking system tells me they got my deposit at aprox. 12:14. They called me at 12:15 to tell me the apartment I saw was no longer available but they had another one that was ""just a little bit different"". What other choice do I have? I can't take another ten hour drive back to look at more apartments, and they already have my bank draft. They were completely aware that I was vulnerable and took advantage of it. From the outside of the building I can see the apartment I was show. It was one of few that they said would have a new balcony on it by the time I moved in. It is still the only one with a finished balcony. I'm pretty sure (though can't prove) that they show lots of people that one finished apartment and then tell them the same story they told me. 

I usually wouldn't post something about where I live but thanks to an option they provided the entire building to drop out of their leases without penalty (The construction on the building is now going to be longer than expected) I'll only be in this crap hole another week or so. 

I really needed to rant about this horrible place so thanks for reading. If you didn't read it...

""...it is only a matter of time before blood will be on your hands.""",98,17,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1ewc4i/absolutely_scathing_email_to_opponents_of_a_new/,"Backstory: I am on several email distribution lists for community issues, including several around the interprovincial bridge issue. A couple weeks ago the consultants for the NCC chose a preferred corridor - Kettle Island. This is the third time in about 25 years that this corridor has been chosen during discussions and consultations around choosing a new site for an interprovincial bridge. This last consultative process has lasted about six years. As would be expected, a local, vocal, monied property association (Rockcliffe Park Residents Association - RPRA) has come out in opposition to this decision. A member of the RPRA, wrote an email to the consultants complaining about the timing of the next public meeting (not enough time to prepare) and the location of the next public meeting (Schenkman Center in Orleans). The text below is a response email (wow) from an individual who I assume is associated with the Lowertown Residents Association. (as an fyi - these emails were distributed to easily 100 people on the list, including members of residents associations, NCC representatives, city councillors, provincial politicians and NCC consultants. In no way are these ""private emails"").


""What is inadequate is the comprehension of Rockcliffe Park Residents Association, and other opponents of Kettle Island, that people are dead as a direct result of the current truck route; a death trap which stands to be corrected with a new bridge.  Lives have been lost and will continue to be lost as long as a truck route ploughs through the most densely populated area of Ottawa. 
 
We've had citizens complain to us about witnessing a human body being torn apart on Rideau, with bloody remains strewn for a block.  A trauma that will not happen in a newly design corridor with no 90 degree turns.  A trauma that is entirely preventable! 
 
At this very moment 7 highrise buildings are under construction or are pending construction; thousands more people to add to the already 30,000 pedestrians which cross this truck route daily.  Not only is it unethical for Eastern communities to be advocating for maintaining a downtown truck route, it is self indulgent and damaging to the region as a whole.  The purpose built truck route will mitigate all of the negative impacts that might occur.  The KERWN corridor has never had the luxury of being purpose built to mitigate damaging effects of transport trucks.  The differences between these two corridors will be orders of magnitude.  It is contemptible that Eastern communities ignore the logic of this choice, and the dire situation downtown.
 
It's also rich of RPRA to believe the better part of 7 years by professional engineers, designers, a fairness monitor, and two environmental assessments that the wrong choice was made.  To stop this bridge from being built would be condemning more people to die, and wasting ~20 million dollars of tax payer money.  Not to mention undermine the millions being spent on the Rideau Redevelopment, and the revitalization of the ByWard Market.
 
Perhaps the short time your community had to prepare is irrelevant.  Your opinion that the truck route should go elsewhere is not based on fact, logic, or an honest comparison of the proposed routes; it is solely motivated by the selfish preservation of property value and complete indifference toward the collateral damage caused to Lowertown over the past 48 years.  No solutions will be perfect; it is delusional to attempt to find one.  The Kettle Island crossing represents the best choice for a difficult dilemma, determined by professionals in a strictly mandated federal process.  One thing is for sure, the Kettle Island corridor will in no way be another King Edward.  
 
If this project is cancelled or stalled due to the participation of RPRA, it is only a matter of time before blood will be on your hands.  So continue complaining about driving to the Shenkman Centre, and your gross speculation of “significant community impact”.  I’m confident RPRA has no concept of what significant community impact is.""

1296599055.0,80,self.ottawa,fddwk,r/Ottawa - ANTI-UBB PROTEST THIS SATURDAY! PLEASE READ!,86,6,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/fddwk/rottawa_antiubb_protest_this_saturday_please_read/,"Hi everybody! **Please upvote this to the top so we can make sure everybody has access to the information!**


I set up the [Stop The Meter: Ottawa](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=130673687000309) rally yesterday while at work and just a bit over 24hrs later it's really snowballed. That's awesome and thank to all who have signed, shown your interest and want to be there!


We've run into a problem though. We were emailed by the *Committee on the Use of Parliament Hill* today and were told we're not able to use their grounds as they're already occupied. I feel stupid for not knowing that you had to apply for a permit for a peaceful protest and thought just a heads-up was sufficient. Either way, embarrassment aside, we're dedicated to making this work, Parliament Hill or not.


So, I need ideas from **YOU** guys on what other alternatives there are to Parliament Hill on where we could stage a protest/rally? I need peoples ideas on where else we can go, ASAP!

Thank you for your suggestions!


**QUESTION** - Can Parliament really do anything if we're being peaceful and not stirring shit up? I highly doubt that the Zombie Walk or 4/20 ever have special permits to do this. Any thoughts?

**UPDATE 2/2/11** - So I met up with a few people last night and we threw some ideas around. I'm wondering if there's anybody here willing to help out with a few tasks to simply things?


**ANOTHER UPDATE 2/2/11 - 10:00am** - So, it looks like Metro has said we're going to be on Parliament Hill. I had spoke with the prior to us finding out that Parliament Hill wanted a ""permit"" but right now I'm kind of leaning towards the ""screw it"" approach and us just going there. If RCMP has problems with it, we'll be cool and move it to Wellington and gain some attention there. So far, I think that's our best idea but we still have time.

**YET ANOTHER UPDATE 2/2/11/ - 1:45pm** - So. I've been in contact with Heritage Canada, who take care of events on Parliament Hill. The NDP has given me a contact to get in touch with, whom I've left a message with.

It's looking like we're not going to be able to obtain an actual permit to protest on Parliament Hill though. I know, it sucks.

I'm not sure what our best bet is. I'm not sure if we should all just show up there anyways, or if we should take to the street in front of Parliament Hill. Both are fine we me. I'd love to hear what other people think about this.


-----**WHAT WE NEED SO FAR**-----

• If anybody is able to talk to Ottawa Police/City of Ottawa and let them know that this is planned. Please do and let us know what's going on!

• There's already a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/fdahi/hey_rottawa_lets_talk_about_rally_signs_for_this/) for signs and sign ideas. It'd be great to get a bunch of people idea to craft some signs. We *need* to keep these signs tasteful though. If we overdo the memes and whatnot, nobody will understand and we'll just look like a bunch of idiots. Let's have clear and to the point messages! Also, [AaronInTheForest](http://www.reddit.com/user/AaronInTheForest) has [made some nice signs](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fdq4c/anti_ubb_rally_posters_mcluhan_flavoured/) which get a good message across. Thank you!

• There was talk last night that we need a chant. Something that we can all sing along to. Anybody have any ideas?

• There's still a lot of discussion as to where we can do this. Hopefully by the end of the today we'll have a better idea of where can accommodate us. I'll update accordingly! While I didn't agree with what they were protesting about, [this](http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090414/OTT_tamilprotest_20090414/20090414/?hub=OttawaHome) certainly got A LOT of attention. I like the idea of standing on Wellington.

• If **anybody** has access to speakers or some kind of amplifying device. Please let me know, or please make it known! We've been trying to track something down and it's not easy. While it's not the end of the world, it would make life a lot easier. It also all depends on where we end up and what kind of power facilities they have.

• If you plan on showing up just to be stupid, don't bother. You're going to be wasting your time.

Since we're based in Ottawa, they are sponsoring us.

The competition consists of three parts. 

1) A Beer Judge vote.

2) A public choice vote. Where anyone can come to Vankleek Hill, taste two beers and then vote on which one they prefer. Winner has the most votes/thumbs up.

3) Best of show. Where the top beers from 1 &amp; 2 go head to head for a second round of judging.

So ANYONE can turn up for part 2, in fact, the more people that vote, the better. It's completely free to try. And, the winner gets to make a full batch of beer with Beaus, so you could help get a beer made!

The voting runs all day at Beaus Brewery in Vankleek Hill. So load a car up with people, go for a drive, if you've never tried Beaus before they have free samples, and you can buy some beer you won't find in the LCBO, have a tour, etc...

Update:
Since people have been asking, the brewery opens at 10am for judging. We hope to finish people choice around 4pm for final judging to complete by 6pm.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,True,,,True,t3_runs2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/runs2/free_beer_in_vankleek_hill_saturday_14th_april/,

I'm sure some of you were there. I'm very sorry to anyone else who chose to go to Malone's Lakeside Grill like we did. 

The idea was to go sit on a patio, drink some beers, eat some food and watch as the sky burst into flames. We'd never been to any of the restaurants here before. I've had a lucky streak in Ottawa I guess and didn't even consider that Malone's Floating Crap Shack could be a bad place to eat. 

Anyway we arrived and found a lot of the tables were soaking wet from the rain that had since stopped. We cleaned one near the edge off with a towel (previously planned on sitting on some wet ass grass) and sat ourselves. The place was 4/10 on the busy scale and 8/10 on the 'no one has any food or drink' scale, which I guess should've been a warning. Our waitress came over, asked if we wanted food and drinks. We said yes. She said she'd BRB and mumbled something before scurrying away. Okay cool. We actually had a great view and kinda watched some ducks and thought about beer.

In the next 15-20 a bunch more people sat themselves at tables around us. Many wiped them down themselves. Our waitress came back a couple times too, she looked at every table then asked one of them if they needed anything. They wanted tea. She told them they were out of teapots, so tough luck. Then she vanished. Became pretty clear at this point that this was one of those fend-for-yourself joints.

I wandered around and visited all three bars asking for some beers. Everyone directed me to another bar. At the last one I felt pretty bad bugging the very busy bartender, but she hooked me up and I gave her a nice tip, half because I felt bad that she was the only one working and half because I hoped she'd spread the word that I was willing to pay for things and maybe someone could come take our order. 

We drank and waited for a while longer. The waitress made eyes at us several times and dashed away. I asked my girlfriend if maybe she was intimidated by my shockingly good looks and she said that I didn't look that good and that the waitress was just ignorant. That seemed more accurate. 

Eventually Malone himself came out (note: some large and in charge man, possibly not Malone) and started addressing all the tables in our section, asking if we'd been taken care of. Everyone said no. He said he'd fix that. Then he took everyone's umbrella down and told them that if it rained they would get wet. That was fairly obvious, but I appreciated his forthrightness. I also thought he was coming in as a sort of business consultant, you know, to fix some shit and not take no for an answer. This didn't happen - he eventually vanished but left our umbrella up. What a sweetie.

Our waitress came back again after about another 20 minutes. She waltzed up and said that our umbrella needed to go ASAP and that we'd get wet if it rained. We knew already thanks to her wonderful boss. She folded the umbrella down and hit my head, which didn't hurt really but was just one of those 'really? you can't wait for me to move?' kinda things. Icing on the cake at this point. We asked to order food and she said that was fine, she'd BRB. She addressed a couple other tables around us who were now asking where their food / drink was. One table cancelled their order around now.

Malone came back and asked a small woman sitting by herself why she had taken a four person table to herself. She didn't really answer but did say she didn't need the extra table (Two-two seaters squished together). She came from an earlier, less busy time of night. Malone did not give a single fuck and grabbed the other table and chairs and lifted them above her head, plopping it down beside her and seating a family of 3 next to her. Efficient as fuck. The little lady looked upset and confused. The new family of three placed an order with Malone and never received anything. Their kid was cute as heck and was more amped for the fireworks than we were.

Anyway we had given up on food at this point and mostly found the whole thing funny. Everyone wasn't very happy but stuck around for the fireworks. The view really was nice. The fireworks happened and everyone went apeshit. That was great.

We left immediately after, having never successfully even placed an order, let alone eaten. Those who did manage to get served deserve some kind of Malone-medal, which would probably be made of an old umbrella and some barbed wire.

On the way out we saw a crowd lined up on the stairs to get in. What was keeping them out was a chain across the entrance with no one manning it. We left the restaurant by doing the limbo of shame under the chain. It was a very fitting end.

TLDR - Malone's Lakeside Grill should be renamed to Malone's Ignore-aporium. Malone himself cares very much about umbrellas. They may or may not serve food. They will attempt to serve tea, depending on teapot stock.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,False,,,True,t3_1erunt,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1erunt/malones_lakeside_garbage_grill/,

We've got Parliament Hill so that must count for *something* and I'm hoping with enough organization we could do something awesome. 

Maybe if we plan this out, one of us could create a Facebook event and get as many of our friends/family/pets/whatever to join and maybe get some kind of media coverage, etc.

Like I said, it would be awesome for us to all be firing on the same cylinders and not do some confused protest with people all over the place.

If you're interested, upvote this to the top and let's get our brains together. 

**EDIT** - [I've created a basic Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=130673687000309) - Join it and try to get everybody you know on board, or at least pique their interest! If anybody is interested in helping to maintain the page, PM me and let me know and I'll add your name as an admin account on there.


**EDIT 2 - 6:40pm** - I'm thinking about trying to get the event on perhaps Saturday, February 12th. A weekday is good because there's usually politicians around but more difficult because it's harder to get people out, with work and whatnot. What days work best for people? 


**EDIT 3 - 8:20pm** - [The Liberal Party has had something to say about all this](http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/31/technology-internet-usage-based-billing-clement-garneau.html)!

I just wanted to make everyone aware of two major speed traps that are being heavily watched by cops recently. The one that I drive by every day after work around 3-5pm is the section of Meadowlands Dr between Fisher Ave and Merivale Rd. There is always a cop here (with his motorcycle hidden), pointing his radar gun far down the road. I was on a side street and watched him, he was flagging one person after the other. I believe the speed limit here is 40km/h, so it's pretty easy to go above.
The other which most people know about is on Heron Rd between Bronson Ave and Bank St. This is a fairly long stretch with four lanes, divided. It's a straight drive that isn't very residential, very easy to go over the 60km/h speed limit and cops again tend to hide their vehicles and just flag the driver.
Be aware, watch the speed limits (especially in these areas)!

**Update** Not sure why there's so much hate. I consider a speed trap as a long straight section of road with little traffic where the speed limit is lower than what most drivers would feel comfortable driving at. Not condoning driving recklessly at all.

I pay for my stuff and leave, and as I'm walking out I notice this beat up looking orange sunfire with the engine running stopped on the curb outside the entrance. I glanced inside and noticed a dude in his late 20's wearing a grey bandana over his face looking like he's getting ready to rob the place (he was rummaging around inside the car for something when he looks up and sees me looking at him, aside from his bandana there was just something about his body language that seemed off). Naturally this is pretty suspicious looking but at this point I'm not certain if it's just some kid dressed like a gang banger, or an actual criminal looking to hold up the place and steal drugs from the pharmacy.

So I stay and stand around like I'm waiting for a cab or something (and making a mental note of his license plate number, and cursing myself for not having my phone on me), I figure, if he's just parked on the curb waiting for someone inside theres no way he's going to be there for more than 10 minutes (the main mall was closed, and there was hardly anyone in the store). About 20 - 30 minutes of this go by, with me standing there and him blasting french rap music out of his speakers and glancing at me in his sideview mirror. It was enough for me to decide that something was definitely up, so I went inside again and warned the cashier that there was a suspicious vehicle parked outside and I gave a description of what the guy looked like and the plate numbers. As I walked back out the dude got out of his car and started trying to intimidate me, shouting at me and stuff, I just told him 'have a nice night' and walked off like I was going to a nearby bus stop. He drove off shortly after and then I walked back to my apartment.

**TLDR;** Saw suspicious masked man in car parked outside drug store with the engine running, waited half an hour to see if he would leave, went back in and warned the employees, guy starts shouting all sorts of weird questions at me trying to intimidate me as I walk off. He drives away shortly after.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,False,,,True,t3_11bbiv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/11bbiv/pretty_sure_i_prevented_a_robbery_last_night_over/,

Food was very fresh, not rushed, service was awesome. I had just found a new sushi home.  

To show my appreciation i left what most waiters would consider a hefty tip (30% and maybe because I want these guys to remeber us as they will seeing alot of us in the nejar future) and prepared to leave. 

The waiter blew my mind when he said ""Sir, that is very thoughtdul but may I suggest that you would be better off keeping your tip and spending it on something else because i won't get any of it""

I said ""You mean you have to tip out to other staff? He replied ""No, I mean the lady Manager is watching me right now and as soon as you leave she will come to me and demand that I hand over the tip, I guess she needs to pay for her nice BMW in the parking lot!"" 

Wow! I mean, i loved this place and I'm all for tipping to staff but thats offensive ......

Can this possibly be legal? 
Does the  restaurant have to declarie the gratuities strongarmed from their servers as income? Do you think they do so?
What would you do in this situation? Would you go back?

    Thank-you for joining us this past week in prayer and in action. This has been a difficult time for the Yu family and they have been overwhelmed by all the support and love they have received.

We are ecstatic to let you know that contact has been made with Michelle. She is safe. The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Thank you again for all your help.

On Tuesday April 17th, [Michelle Yu](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/537960_399529360068399_398192830202052_1378154_836722935_n.jpg), a grade 12 Toronto student went missing. She was last seen in person at 2:30pm at York Mills Station and on camera at 6pm in downtown Toronto. She was on her way to meeting a friend and attending a girl guides meeting at 3pm before communication was promptly cut off.

None of her family or friends have heard from her since. Here are the important details:

1. It is uncharacteristic of her to run away. Her family and close friends do not believe this is likely.

2. At 6pm on Tuesday, a camera captured her image at a bank at Bay and Queen St (downtown Toronto), where she had withdrawn money. This was not her usual bank and was out of the way of her planned route.

3. Her phone has been off since 3pm on Tuesday the 17th.

4. She has a heart condition that requires daily medication, which she is currently without because it is at home.

  Considering the circumstances (especially her heart condition), this is a VERY URGENT situation. At the moment, **police are NOT organizing ground searches**, and there are only a few minutes of local news coverage every night about this. This is why we NEED the internet to help spread her image, so that citizens can fill the void and effectively be this constant search party. It has been 5 days, and she could be anywhere in Canada by now if she has been abducted, so we have to inform people in Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Hamilton, Halifax, London, EVERYWHERE, in order to stand a chance. These first few days are crucial and may very well be the difference in a life or death situation.

***What can you do?***

**1. Upvote this, then go on Facebook and ""share"" this page:**

**https://www.facebook.com/FindMichelleYu**

(Press the gear icon on the top right, and it will present to you a menu option to ""Share"" to your timeline)  

Though liking the page will give you updates on the situation, the most important thing you can do to help is **""sharing"" the page on your facebook timeline.** This will spread her image to **new social networks**. Currently, her image is being passed through networks of mutual friends and mutual-mutual friends. However, we need **strangers** - people that are not closely connected to Michelle's friends' networks - to **really spread awareness and have the ""virality"" take off.** **This is why reddit may actually be *the* most important resource right now.** If you have not seen this story in your fb newsfeed recently, you actually have the greatest ability to help her. More degrees of separation = More unique people and more exposure, the better chance we have of finding Michelle.


Please upvote and ""share"" the linked facebook page. Also **consider copy and pasting this message** when publishing the ""Share” to directly provide some context. Thank you for your help.

Yes I found my camera...in spite of Air Canada's 'due process'!  It has been 2 weeks since we landed back in Ottawa and not ready to give up I spoke this morning with Air Canada where I originally had to report the lost camera and provide the many details requested.  I was told that they hadn't found anything and that after 5 days items that were not claimed made their way to Montreal where after another 6 days would be auctioned off for charity.  The 11 day marker had obviously passed.

I decided that it was worth one last effort, so I drove out to the airport this morning and tracked down the lost and found for Air Canada and low and behold in about 30 seconds the attendant came back with the elusive item in his hand.   Other than the flight number and the date no other details were on the tag.  However, I now know who to thank for returning it...this was the last image on my camera!!

A good friend of mine hired them for a move last week and got ripped off, hard. She is not really sure what to do about the whole situation, but she just wanted to warn other people out there.

Here is her story:

&gt;The customer service provided to us by ""Sam's Moving"" was atrocious. Not only were our movers half an hour late they refused us service if we did not agree to a higher rate with 3 movers and 2 trucks, for a 2 bedroom apartment, after almost an hour of deliberation. We had originally agreed to two movers and a truck with a rate of $75/hour which we believed would be more than enough and wouldn't have dreamed it would have taken any longer than 3 hours maximum. I provided them with adequate information and notice and clearly their administrative team did not communicate this information to their staff.
&gt;
&gt;They deemed us as ""disorganized"" despite the fact we were paying for a service. They scratched several of our shelves which were only a year old and virtually flawless previous to the move. Which I suppose is to be expected but  is magnified by the other issues at hand, such as the fact that they could not get our couches into our entranceway and refused to try the back door, which happened after we refused to pay their jacked up rate of over $1600 dollars. I was forced to dispute this fee and they suddenly dropped the rate to $926, which is still astronomical considering we could have hired a set of professional movers for a lesser rate.
I do believe we were highly taken advantage of and I would like to prevent this in the future. Also, when we stated we only had 680 dollars of our total bill, they offered to keep our 50"" flat screen TV overnight as a deposit. I was forced again and threatened into paying an extra rate even though I do believe we should not be penalized for a total lack of communication and professionalism on their part.
&gt;
&gt;A 2 bedroom apartment does not require a 9 hour move with 20 minutes smoke breaks every hour as well as an hour long lunch break. I have moved many times in my life and have never encountered such treatment and I truly find it appalling. I was tempted to get the police involved after the threat was received but was actually concerned for my safety.
The couches which they claimed they could not get up the stairs we were able to get in several hours later with no trouble through the much wider back door, which I don't believe they even bothered to try. I sincerely believe that after we refused to pay the higher rate we were given much poorer service. If anything, I would hope that justice would be served in the future with this kind of experience under their belt.

Since I haven't heard from the owner, perhaps I can say the names from the playlists in case anybody knows them.
Some of the details are:

- Josh, Jess, and Holly have playlists.

- They seem to play hockey and ringette.

- There is also some songs from Bruce Hornsby and the Range(?).  

- They may have recently seen the musical, Mamma Mia (about the group ABBA).

EDIT: [Here's the story of how it came back to my friend!](http://twoblackdogs.tumblr.com/post/27098467268/a-black-dogs-story).

Nothing turned up, but the help was super appreciated. 

Today, things changed. Some loser busking outside of the Bluesfest (on Booth!) had the exact same guitar. 

Long story short, he had the same case and in the case it had the original items that were also stolen.

Cops showed up and weren't really helpful until the guy said he also had a few other items at his house which he later remembered were sold when he ""bought the guitar on Rideau Street"". 

Dude tried scratching off the serial number as best he could and whatnot, but the evidence was damning.

Victory!

1303144200.0,56,self.ottawa,gsurk,"Never eat at Blue Cactus, this is why...",66,10,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/gsurk/never_eat_at_blue_cactus_this_is_why/,"Saturday evening I had plans to meet with some friends at Blue Cactus. We wanted to get nachos and drinks, as well as celebrate my friend's birthday. My boyfriend and I arrived first and were seated quite quickly, as the birthday girl called in advance to save 6 seats.

Our waitress was great and tended to us right away asking if we wanted drinks and let us know that margaritas were 1/2 price tonight. Score. So we waited for the next people to arrive and ordered up some margaritas

Margaritas arrive. Waiting for the other 2 people to arrive I couldn't resist my frosty drink any longer, and stared stirring around the drink. And what do I find in my margarita but... a finger nail. Yes. A finger nail. A whole disgusting and discoloured half moon. In disbelief I pulled it out and examined it. Yes. A finger nail. Waitress returns, and I let her know. She brings me a whole new margarita. I begin stirring...and i sip it. The bartender must have been pissed that I sent back his filthy drink because instead of rimming the glass with salt, he poured it all in the drink. Everyone at the table joked that it tasted like a salt lick. Anyhow, after much deliberation, I felt bad and sent the second margarita back and just ordered a beer.

Everyone is finally there. Waitress comes back with my beer and we all order a plate of nachos, and I order a plain house salad, just so I can have some greens with my nacho meal. Nachos soon arrive at the table and we are all underwhelmed. There was about 2 tbsp of salsa in a dish on the side, a few jalapenos slices, the nachos consisted of colored chips with melted orange cheese and a blob of sour cream on the side. There were no beans, and no guacamole as the menu said there would be. So we essentially paid $14.00 for a few chips, a sprinkle of cheese, 2 tbsp of salsa and shriveled up jalapeno peppers that came from either a can or a jar. When we complained there was no beans and guacamole, our waitress said nachos no longer come with beans, and that she would bring guacamole. The guacamole arrived at the table by the time we were nearly done the nachos.

And to top off my night, my salad. It looked pretty okay. So I'm eating and trying to enjoy this evening, and from my dish I pull this slimy brown leaf. I'm thinking, really? You're even going to fuck up my salad. So I pull it out and as I'm eating I'm realizing the whole damn bowl of salad is brown, old, slimy and disgusting. After pulling out all the brown chunks, there was nothing left, and I just gave up.

The ONLY thing that saved this experience for me was that the waitress brought my friend a complimentary slice of cheesecake for her birthday. This waitress deserves a gold star, she discounted my bill, which I was so thankful for, and she didn't give me a hard time at all. Kudos to you Blue Cactus girl, your great, but your restaurant is awful. Gordon Ramsey would be appalled. I advise everyone, to not eat there. Ever.

I live in Los Angeles and my ex is currently in Ottawa, and we each have one cat from the relationship, but hopefully soon I'm looking to get full custody. Unfortunately, she can't care for the cat (personal medical reasons) and wants to put her in the SPCA. I'm working on saving enough to ship her out (just shipped out my other daughter, so not there yet) but she needs a temporary home until I can get the money together.

She is the most loving cat in the world, and crazy friendly. It's just a temporary situation, so if you can help, it would be a huge, huge kindness. We can provide food, litter box, and some toys, it shouldn't be more than a month, and most likely, even sooner than that. (also have to wait for the temperature to cool, per Air Canada regulations).

(x-post from rescuedogs),67,13,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1hn3ic/found_this_cute_little_guy_on_sunday_owners_have/,"First, to grab your attention: http://imgur.com/aCs3dKH


I'm not particularly good at this whole reddit deal yet, but you all seem to love cute dogs and be very helpful, so hopefully I've posted this correctly. I live in Ottawa, and found this puppy running down a county road in a high-dump area on Sunday afternoon. 


I've reported him to three shelters, went door to door when I found him, and left my number at the only convenience store in the area. He had no tags and does not have a microchip. He's also been posted on a lost/found site and registered at 5 different rescues. All the rescues I've spoken to are full. I've been avoiding actually leaving him at the shelter because he has some abandonment/trust issues that become worse when he's stressed out around strangers. Apparently my estrogen driven maternal instinct is a little bit too strong. 


Unfortunately, I can't keep him because he doesn't like other dogs and my roommates have two. He is high maintenance and needs someone who has experience with dogs, and preferably experience with dogs with fear-bite issues. He needs time to approach you, and you can't push him. Many people don't understand this because he is overwhelmingly cute and everyone wants to cuddle him. He will bond to his ""person"" within a day or two, and will get more comfortable with strangers when his person is there. When I found him, I couldn't touch him without being snapped at, and within two days, he was jumping all over my lap and licking my face.


He's housetrained so long as he's let out every 5 hours or so, as he is still young. Appears to listen to stay well, and sit sometimes. 


So - if anyone remotely close to Ottawa wants an adorable, devoted puppy, who will love you exclusively and dislike everyone else on your behalf, please let me know!


I assume someone will let me know if I've reddited wrong. Also, please avoid recommending taking him to the SPCA or giving any advice in terms of dog care. I've got experience with dogs and I'm aware the SPCA is an option, however it is a last resort. 


Any help finding him a person is VERY appreciated!



Edit 1: Another picture: http://imgur.com/xHSMY36


Edit 2:  It turns out I picked him up near the home of the dog catcher in the area, so it's highly likely he was abandoned. 

**Edit 3: The dog catcher is coming to get him to go through the proper process of finding his owners in the area.  However, there's a very high chance he was abandoned, so if anyone IS interested in adopting him in the future, PM me and I will make sure that it's known he has a potential home**",,False,,t5_2qpoo,1372970506.0,,,True,t3_1hn3ic,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1hn3ic/found_this_cute_little_guy_on_sunday_owners_have/,

My dad got the money! Thanks everyone for your support and interest in my story. After almost 3 weeks, my dad finally cornered my boss and tracked him down. My boss paid him in fresh $50 bills! :)

**EDIT 2**
So my ex-bosses are very, very slippery people and we've had to call them from more than a few different numbers because once they recognize a number we've called them from before, they don't answer. After a shit ton of back and forth calling and threatening, they now say they will meet my dad on Tuesday and pay him the money I'm owed then. I'm leaving to Barrie tomorrow, so I won't be able to be there, but my dad can handle these assholes. That is, if they're true to their word, which so far, they have not been. We contacted the police again to give them an update but they've told us there's nothing they can do for us because it's a ""civil matter"" and they have no way of finding these people since they are most likely using fake names and have no registered home/business address or home phone number. We're on our own. My dad may still hire a P.I if they don't pay him on Tuesday just for the hell of it, even though a P.I will cost a little more than what I'm owed. I'll update again on Tuesday to let you know whether I got the money or not. I really fucking hope so, these people wasted my summer. If I had wanted to volunteer for 4 weeks I would've gone to the humane society or something... Fucking scammers got me so angry. It's nto about the money anymore, it's damn personal.



**EDIT**
Thanks everyone! You had good suggestions and helped me vent some of this frustration. After checking the number with the cops and coming up with no hits, I called my dad for help. First he called and got through right away but after mentioning he was my dad, they hung up on him. He persisted calling and tying up their line and left a message saying he was going to hire a P.I if they didn't get back to him and, lo-and-behold, he got a call back. They are going to (*hopefully*) pay me this Tuesday. If they don't, you can bet my dad will be all over their asses. These guys are clearly up to some shifty shit and were not answering my calls because of my number. We filed a temporary report with local police and with the Labour Board to make sure people don't get ripped off in the future.

So this summer I worked with a company called Clear Thru Windows who offer a window cleaning service. My job was to go door to door and get people signed up for window cleaning.

I looked them up on Canada 4-1-1 and their names don't even exist. They have no home phone, no address. These people scammed me out of over 30 hours of work. They owe me more than $400.

I moved to Ottawa in the summer, and have been biking to work every day on your lovely trails. Yesterday, in the brutal -12 windchill, I decided the bike had to go away for the winter. So today, I took OC Transpo for the very first time. Let me tell you my story.

First, I busted out google maps and used their transit directions to figure out how to get to work. 4.5km, 18 minutes by bus, one transfer. No problem, right? Wrong. 

My bus was slated to come every 10 minutes, so I arrived 5 minutes before the one I wanted was scheduled to come. It didn't show up. Neither did the next one, nor the one after that. It was 35 minutes before my bus showed up. Finally it did. The driver was kind of absent minded, he ignored a couple of stops on the transitway while the ""stop"" light was lit up and some high school students were yelling that they wanted off, but it was on the transit way and didn't really affect me, so I didn't think too much about it. The transfer went find and I was off to work.

End of the day, time for OC Transpo home. Again, I arrive 5 minutes before my bus is slated to arrive. 5 minutes later, it arrives and I breathe a sigh of relief. But it doesn't stop. And neither does the next one, nor the one after that. Frustrated, I walk the 2km to the station where I was about to get my transfer. After waiting 15 minutes, I was told by another passenger the bus probably wouldn't come. What! The last three hadn't shown up. Luckily, the next one, after about 25 minutes did show up. Again, the driver was absent minded and missed someone's stop even though the light was on. This time I felt worse, as the passenger was an elderly man with a walker who would have to walk the 4 blocks or so back. 

Finally made it home. I absolutely cannot believe the hassle that commute was. What was initially supposed to be a 36 minute commute turned into over two hours. How do you native Ottawans deal with this? Is there anyone I can complain to? I feel like just toughing it out on my bike. Anyone have any advice? Certainly wasn't a good first experience.

Sorry for the rant.

**tldr:**  30 minute commute turned into 2+ hour commute, had to hike 2km, bus driver made an old man walk in the cold. OC transpo sucks. ",,False,,t5_2qpoo,False,,,True,t3_mm81o,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/mm81o/my_first_day_with_oc_transpo/,

You were a great crowd, a lot of fun, easy to work with, and all around good people.

We raised $2360 for the YSBO, and that will be delivered to them this week. That is $2360 where before there was nothing, a concept that always tickles me.

While the overall event was very successful, we learned a few good things about how we might run this type of event in the future. I'll just mention some thoughts here, but this is by no means well-considered yet:

- We learned that people are prepared to have fun deep into the night, but most people prefer to be in their own beds by 5:00am. We would probably close at 4:00am next time.
- We learned that our Laser Tag guns are prepared to have fun deep into the night, but prefer to be in their own beds by 5:00am or else they might not feel like working the entire next day.
- We learned that we should probably include all of the activities in the package to provide more capacity for more people to be simultaneously having fun.
- We learned that the LAN party portion needs to be more organized to align computers and software for common play.
- We learned that prompting for organic organization to an online community provides lots of great volunteers, but few people feel empowered to leap in and snatch ownership of an area. Next time I would say ""Who wants to organize a board game room?"" and tag someone directly for each area.
- We learned that Fort Parties are great social constructs that do not necessarily stand up well when competing with lasers, flashing  lights, beer and games. The fort party never built much momentum because there was so many other things going on. People came, set up their forts, and then went to play in the facility for the next 8 hours. I'm not sure how you could address this other than shutting the rest of the facility down at a set time like 2:00am.
- We used wall structures from our haunted house to create the fort structure. I have mixed feelings about how that worked. Some people enjoyed the separate forts, some people wished it was one big mix, and other people thought the walls (spattered with blood and cobwebs in many cases I might add) looked a little dingy. I can't imagine how we could support people bringing their own structures.
- We learned that Reddit is awesome, and that we should continue to support social events for Reddit, and probably support other activities that the community participates in such as Barcraft.

I would encourage you to post your own recommendations on how a similar event should be run in the future. Also, let me know how the price point was. If we asked for a $20 donation for charity and included all of our attractions, would that work for you? What else would you like to see?

Thanks for you help, your participation, your comments, and your patience with the multiple Fort Party posts. I'll return to being a quiet reader after this post.

TL;DR Forty Party went well, next event should be better with your advice.

1309316861.0,49,self.ottawa,ibxtx,Canada Day info!,54,5,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/ibxtx/canada_day_info/,"Hi folks.

I'm not sure how many people plan on being downtown this year. Maybe some of you are reading this and planning on visiting or for others it may be your first time. 

Either way - here's a bit of info which should make things go a bit more smoothly, especially if you're going out to watch fireworks and all that.

**STREET CLOSURES**

If you're coming downtown, don't bring your. Parking will suck. It'll be overpriced and you'll just get frustrated. Bussing is way easier and cheaper, plus [after 10pm they're free](http://www.octranspo1.com/routes/cda_day_service)!

[Here's a map with all the street closures and times if you need it](http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/canadaday/?m=3).


**WHAT TO DO?!**

There's so much to do. I'm a fan of just wandering around and seeing what's what. There's all sorts of street performances going on and chances are if you're downtown, you'll find something that'll keep you entertained at least for a little while. [There's some drop down menus here that'll help you see what's going on, where and when](http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/canadaday/) - I recommend using it, as it'll save you some time if there's some awesome stuff you want to see.

**WHAT'S OPEN?!?!**

Downtown, a lot of things will be open. Most of the shops in the Byward Market will be open and for sure just about every restaurant in that area too. If the lines are too long, I'd recommend moseying down towards [Elgin Street](http://maps.google.ca/maps?saddr=298+Dalhousie+Street,+Ottawa,+ON+K1N+1B4&amp;daddr=Elgin+St%2FRegional+Road+91&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=45.418425,-75.68902&amp;sspn=0.020393,0.045447&amp;geocode=FX0ytQIdTQl9-yEqJskA6KchHQ%3BFab_tAIdnBN9-w&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;z=15) and chances are it may not be as insane, but don't quote me on that.

The Rideau Centre will be open from 10am until 6pm. If you're looking for water or something, I'd say get it there as you can find bottles fair cheap - as opposed to street vendors who will gouge you for it.

**WHERE CAN I WATCH FIREWORKS!!!?!??** 

[I made a map](http://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?msid=200185661632656711945.0004a6d0e3376523861be&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=45.424992,-75.697603&amp;spn=0.020391,0.045447) with some key spots and where they launch them from. Feel free to add to it if you know of other good spots.

Anyways - I hope this helps people get around on Friday. The weather looks promising and it should be a great time.

How about really dumb cats? This cat may as well be an alien with a learning disability. here are some reasons why:

1) He will think he is human and try to converse with you. even after you tell him to shut up because humans don't speak cat.
2) He decides he wants to converse at any hour as well. Going to bed at 2AM and just got settled? He will sing you the song of his people.
3) 6 Toes. Seriously. this cat has 6 toes on every paw. alien!
4) Does not like cat treats. (I know right!?)
5) Does not play with cat toys.
6) I know i said this in point 1 and 2, but he literally meows all the time!
7) He will meow for attention, then run away after you finally turn to pet him. I swear he is playing mind games with me.

Anyways, the cat belongs to my Ex, she moved out but can't have pets where she is now staying. and i can't take care of any pets right now, especially my exes pets. She has tried finding a home for it but is without luck and she is debating putting him down. 
As retarded as this cat is, I still don't want to see him put down. So i am posting this to reddit to see if Reddit likes ""unique"" cats. 

He is free to a good home. Here is a couple photos of the little demon.

After putting the pieces together in my head, I realized that I hadn't seen my total, or even been able to add a tip. I called the general line, talked to an operator, and he called the store.

My girlfriend and I were just walking our dog down Workman Ave, following behind a man walking two dogs. He went inside a house and left one of the dogs outside. As we walked by so did another guy - maybe 30-40 white, wearing dark beat up clothing and a hoody. We turned to go on another street but I looked back and saw him going to the dog. When he saw me he asked, ""Is this your dog?"" I replied no, told him the dog lived at that house and watched him start to walk away. We turned to keep walking but had a bad feeling so we decided to go back and sure enough he had the dog by the collar and was leading it away down another street. 

Thankfully the owner of the dog came out of the house and we were able to tell him that someone was making off with his dog. He chased the guy down, and I think he got his dog back. I hindsight, maybe we should have stayed with him but we walked back by on our way home and no one was in sight.

I just wanted to post this as a reminder to other dog owners that people are shitty, and to keep a good eye on your pup.

Last year during the hail storm, my 4 year old car got hit really bad so I made my very first insurance claim and they suggested me to take my car to Turpin because it was a recommended shop.  I dropped off my car and they assured me that all the repairs were going to be 100% perfect to my satisfaction. They told me I would mostly be getting Paint Less Dent Removal and a replacement hood because it would be cheaper and faster to replace.

I agreed to the repairs and informed the guy I only wanted OEM\new replacement (not used or aftermarket) parts and he assured me again everything would be perfect.  So I signed the form approving the repairs and I was sent on my way.

2 Weeks later I got my car and it looked great on the outside but the repairs were poorly done.  My headliner wasnt on straight and full of oil\dirt, broken\cut trim, clips put back into place with glue instead of replacing them, forgot to replace some weather stripping that was damaged and didnt provide a OEM hood as to what I ask to have.

When I confronted them on all these problems the owner\manager rudely informed me that they subbed the PDR repair and that it wasnt his problem.  After talking with my insurance they called the shop and the shop told me to come in so they can fix the rest of the things (at their expense) minus the hood because ""I signed the approved a aftermarket one"".  Even though I verbally requested OEM (was expecting to pay the difference) they followed my insurance policy to the T without even asking my what I wanted done as options.

After complaining that I didnt want the non-certified hood they went half way and I settled for a certified A\M hood (this helped me later).

I requested a one on one with the manager to talk about the poor job on my car and he really pissed me off when he said ""sir, your car is almost 5 years old.  The repairs we did the first time around should have been accepted judging on the age of the car..."".  My car has low mileage and I really take care of it.  It looks better then some newer models and I want to keep it that way as long as I can.

TL;DR:  Turpin doesnt have any quality assurance, They dont take responsibility of fuck ups from the companies the sub out, they promise you anything you ask for but dont deliver (or hope you dont notice) because they make you sign something different and they cut any corner they can to make that extra buck. Also the manager is a complete rude idiot.",,False,,t5_2qpoo,1372088220.0,,,True,t3_1gyttb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1gyttb/avoid_turpin_collison_for_your_auto_repairs/,

So if anyone knows of any smelly, incompetent, and generally unpleasant people who like to cruise the east end in a big, dark vehicle, hitting awesome people with eggs, just go ahead and beat them up.

They tell you that they have been receiving error reports from your IP address.  Basically their goal is to get you to give them remote access to your computer so they can do a check and show you these errors - and what they actually do is fuck up your computer and then make you pay for them to fix it.

These have been around for a while but they actually called me last night (first time ever) which makes me suspect that they maybe calling around the Ottawa area.

They asked me to get a pen and paper so I didn't miss it, I told them I had that and they said 181. and I interrupted and said that was not my IP and they must have me confused with someone else.  They hung up immediately.  I was hoping they'd have some script for dealing with that and I'd get to jerk them around some more - kind of disappointed.

Shortly after a trip to a friend's in Montreal, I noticed the characteristic bite patterns. I told a few friends who all thought I was paranoid and that I probably didn't have them. This is how they spread, misinformation and denial. Bed bugs are very real and cases of them are skyrocketing in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal.

Now I made a careless mistake. I knew the apartment I was visiting had had them, but it had been sprayed. This brings me to my second point, spraying is often ineffective. The bugs are becoming resistant to the poison and they will run away and infest new areas or rooms. While more expensive, heat treatment is more thorough and as an added bonus you get to keep most of your stuff.

When traveling, especially to apartments, hotels or university dorms, make sure to take proper precautions. Upon entering, put your shoes and bags in sealed garbage bags and leave them in the bath tub. Be on the look out for the three bite pattern and be aware that bites can take 3-14 days to show up. Also, ask any hotels if they've had previous cases and consider staying elsewhere if they have.

I've made a careless and costly mistake but you don't have to. They are spreading like wildfire and while the bites themselves aren't that bad the thought of sleeping in a bed infested with parasites is not fun.

Edit: a few more additions. When traveling, keep all dirty clothes in a separate tied garbage bag and put them in the dryer for an hour ASAP. Also, the bugs aren't always in the bed.

It's a really good deal. It's in IMAX, but the [ticket prices](http://www.civilization.ca/imax/tickets-and-groups/) are cheaper than IMAX at SilverCity, and the same price as a regular showing if you're a student (you can't get student deals right now at the big theatres). You can get a combo deal for a museum visit and a movie ticket, saving even more. I went to the 5 pm show today, and although there was a decent line to get in (they didn't open the doors until 10 minutes before the show), they definitely weren't sold out. Show up at least 30 minutes in advance, like a regular theatre, and you should have great seats. The seats are better than many multiplexes, and you can never have your view blocked by someone in front of you. And you don't have to sit through 10-20 minutes of ads and trailers before the movie starts (which could be a positive or negative thing).

Really, the only negatives are the limited showtimes (just 11 pm and either 5 or 8 pm) and the lack of theatre-quality snacks. However, there's a Second Cup in the museum that sells cold popcorn, so at least there's that.

Today, I am looking for people who have marketing skills, graphic design skills, and social media skills for sporadic contract work as we move towards our opening in December. If you have any of these capabilities, please message me to discuss.

You can stay up to date on our progress by visiting our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/Funhaven. I've also bought a Reddit ad for one day to see how that works. There's so much to do!

1295452424.0,41,self.ottawa,f55q0,The Ottawa Catholic School Board bans Gay-Straight Alliance groups.,42,1,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/f55q0/the_ottawa_catholic_school_board_bans_gaystraight/,"So for those of you who have lived under a rock for the last few weeks, the Halton Catholic District School Board [came under some pretty heavy criticism](http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Halton_Catholic_schools_ban_GayStraight_Alliance_groups-9611.aspx) when it was publicized that they banned Gay-Straight Alliances. These clubs provide a safe space for LGBT students and their allies where they can discuss and hang out. Still, board trustees compared them to Nazi clubs, sex clubs, and said some not very flattering things. The ban [was lifted yesterday](http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/GSA_ban_lifted_by_Halton_Catholic_school_board-9661.aspx) in a vote that sadly wasn't unanimous.

The Ottawa Catholic School Board still has their ban in place. Learning from the PR mistakes of Halton, however, they didn't compare their gay students to Nazis. The [headline from the Citizen](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Catholic+board+pledges+inclusive+climate/4095972/story.html) reads ""Superintendent doesn't want homosexual youth marginalized"". Yet, the same article says:

&gt; Here in Ottawa, D'Amico said the English Catholic school board doesn't use the name ""gay-straight alliance"" because the Assembly of Ontario Bishops -- to whom school boards look for spiritual guidance -- prefer a name that reflects a more general focus on equity and social justice.

These clubs are still banned. They spin it as a move for equity and social justice, but the truth is that it's a move fueled by bigotry. You wouldn't see them banning a chess club, or an anime fan club because of their ""focus."" And the Assembly of Ontario Bishops? They're not to keen on their gay/lesbian/bi/trans students either. To [quote them](http://www.xtra.ca/blog/national/post/2011/01/10/Why-is-Ontario-funding-an-anti-gay-school-system.aspx):

&gt; Teachers must consult the following: Section 2357 and 2358 (always together) of the Catechism of the Catholic Church 1997. Letter to All Involved in Catholic Education – Church Teaching on Sexual Maturity (Document 370303 Assembly of Catholic Bishops); and any other relevant document fully and entirely consistent with the Doctrine of the Catholic Church following: “…as reference and resource”

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, Section 2357 reads:

&gt; ...tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."" They are contrary to the natural law. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

More from the Assembly of Ontario Bishops:

&gt; For most young people, romantic attachments and behaviour are part and parcel of their blossoming sexuality and their growth toward the commitment of marriage. Romantic attachments and behaviour are fully expected of heterosexual couples. Behaviour such as holding hands, embracing, kissing, dating and dancing that are romantically intended are all acceptable within appropriate limits.

&gt; It will be especially difficult for young persons who are experiencing homosexual romantic yearnings to understand and accept this teaching of the Church since it discourages romantic behaviour that would be acceptable in a heterosexual context.

I'm sure the Assembly of Ontario Bishops do care about equity and social justice. But it's pretty clear that that doesn't extend to the students under their care that have a different orientation or gender identity. It's homophobia with a nice face.

We shouldn't tolerate this crap here in Ottawa. Young LGBT students already have lots of shit to deal with, the last thing they need is a bunch of adults who are supposed to take care of them validating how worthless everyone else thinks they are.

I was trying to buy an amplifier from for my car. I found one for a good price on kijiji and emailed the guy. We agreed to meet up in a parkinglot at Baseline and Greenbank. I should have noticed when the guy parked his car away from mine that something was fishy. 

They guy showed me that it was ""working"" on his weak ass subwoofer, but I wanted to test it on my own BEFORE I bought it obviously, but he didnt want me to blow it while I was testing it. So I said he could hold onto the money while I tested it, and if I blew it then he could keep it. As I was setting it up, he was disconnecting some stuff on his car. Then when I finished the connections, I looked up and he was in his car with his buddy and they were trying to leave but were blocked by traffic! When I approached his car he did a burn-out and took off! I chased him but he got away because of traffic!! I had a text convo with him afterwards. I said that I'd find him and that he'd get what was comin etc. and he said that the deal was done and that he'd done nothing wrong even though he also said ""Tell you what. You blow me and I'll give your money back. How's that sound, cupcake?"" lol it was only $50, but I am PISSED to say the least...

I have a long-time friend who is relocating across the country and cannot take her fur babies with her. Her family has refused to take them in for her, and my home can only accommodate one more kitty. I hate to split them up, but if I have to, I'd like to know that their lovin' is going to someone awesome. 

[These are the boys](http://imgur.com/a/1Lumf) 

Both are good with other cats, and have been with her daughter since she was born. They are used to being manipulated and man-handled. They are also used to many people being in and out of the house, so they're not too skittish. They have both been indoor/outdoor kitties and as far as I know have all of their vaccinations. Both are neutered, but not declawed. 

* Fluffer-Nutter is about 6 years old and a small bundle of fluff. He is grey and white, and soft as hell. He can be a bit of an introvert until he falls madly in love with you; after that, affection is the name of the game, and he'll follow you everywhere. With practice, Fluff has also been known to shake a paw, sit, and stay. 

* Strider (LOTR) is a 5 year old huge black cat with a tiny patch of white on his chest. He is an extrovert and comes from a great bloodline (I knew his mom and grand-mom) and is a huge ham. When you pick him up he gives kisses. He can be incredibly goofy, and is a super chatterer when bird watching. He really loves the company of adult males, so he'd be a great wing-man. 

If you are digging the free karma thing, shoot me a message. I am taking them both on until we can rehome one of them. Don't let this awesome chance to take home a love-machine!

Arrived about 7:45, show was to start at 8. Was really pissed at having to spend 12 BUCKS on parking, when they have ample space to store more than enough cars at the complex as is, without having to gouge customers more cash.

The stage was covered on all 4 sides, and the 3 visible ones were a light gauze type of material. Around 8, the lights dimmed and one sole person appeared behind the gauze and, obscured, played about 20 mins of some (live?) ambient music. Then the lights went back up, and a single ambient loop played for another 20-ish minutes, while the band did a bit of a sound check. I've never gone to a show that started this oddly.

Finally about 12 people filed into this gauze cube, and the music began.. the lights inside the cube lit the various musicians, and projectors shone various visuals inside it, pretty cool..

About 20 minutes into the show, during an intense swell, the curtain dropped and the stage revealed.

From then on, Sigur Ros took us on a staggering 2 hour extravaganza (including their 20+ minute encore) of amazing sound and visuals.

If you are even casual fans and you missed this, you should be kicking yourself. This was a breathtaking experience

I managed to get a couple videos on my phone (including -accidentally- when the curtain dropped) and will post them up when they finish uploading. I'll say now that the sound quality on them is horrible.. turn your speakers way down or even off.. the vids are mostly to see the amazing visuals

I used [TreyGarcia](http://www.reddit.com/user/TreyGarcia) (a fellow redditor who [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/12q51p/first_time_home_buyer_can_anyone_recommend_a_real/c6xdg7e) in my post), and he's been great. I admittedly had no idea what the hell I was doing (being my first home), and he had no problem at all taking care of things for me like booking the home inspection, finding me a Real Estate lawyer close to me then coordinating with them, etc etc.

I currently have a medically suspended license (long story), so he's been great with meeting up anywhere I want, coming to my work if something needs to be signed, etc. Today he even brought me a bottle of champagne so me and my girlfriend can celebrate, which I thought was pretty awesome. 

Anyway, I couldn't be more happy with how things turned out, and I can't recommend him enough if you're looking for a good agent.

www.chillsforcheo.com

As you may know, Chills for CHEO is an adult oriented haunted house at Funhaven. We will be running every night from tonight until Halloween night from 6-10pm. We also have two additional shifts on Sat and Sun afternoon from 1-4pm.

We are in great need of volunteers to work in the haunt to scare the will to live out of people. We provide the gadgets, training, makeup and costumes, and you supply the evil sense of humour.

There is absolutely no acting experience required, and we have all ages from 18 to 60 working inside. You must be 18 years old. There is everything from hissing in the darkness, to standing next to an animatronic that does all the work, and operating the controls of a giant pnuematic spectre.

We provide dinner and drinks. Trust me when I say that if you choose to volunteer, you will be telling people about your experience for weeks; there's nothing else like it. If you can arrange to have your friends come through while you're in the haunt, even better.

This wasn't the first time. A few weeks ago, some young man came trying to sell me a new energy reader which would save me money. I told him I wasn't interested and he went off with ""how could we be so stupid to not want to save money?"" (he actually said that) He then also left with annoyed attitude, as if I wasted his time by saying no.

2.  Bring a flask.  They hired some catering company which was woefully unprepared for Ottawa's crushing desire to get drunk.  And really, who doesn't want to sip a flask while chilling with dinosaurs?  Alternately, someone should tell them to set up another bar.

Hi guys. My cat managed to escape from house last night. I just moved from Westboro to Barrhaven about 2 weeks ago, and he's been having a hard time adjusting. Here are some facts about the cat and the whole situation.

His name is Tron, and he'll usually come when called by name.
He's 2.5
He's only been an indoor cat, though I have taken him outside on the occasional walk.
He's very calm and laid back. Running away is entirely out of character for him.
I live on Crestway Drive in Barrhaven next to St. Andrew school.
[Here are some photos of him for reference.](http://imgur.com/a/RQ9Gn)

If you see him, please let me know. I've been a wreck all day. I just want my kitty back. Thank you so much.

Edit: I want to thank everyone here for being so helpful and kind with their well wishes. He hasn't come home yet, but we're keeping hope. We had some posters printed today and will be posting them tomorrow in Barrhaven and in Westboro just in case. Again, thank you all so much for the words of comfort. They are all greatly appreciated.

Here's my story:

I woke up Sunday with swollen tonsils with white patches on them. I figured it to be a throat infection so I went to the nearest open Appletree clinic for a diagnosis. The wait wasn't too long, but the doctor probably saw me for all of 1 minute. He basically walked in, looked at my mouth, and gave me a prescription for clarithromycin. Standard stuff, thought nothing of it, so I'm probably partially to blame for not inquiring further.

Anyway, fast-forward to Wednesday (3 days on antibiotics) and the swelling hasn't gone down at all. I visited a local Activecare clinic instead for a second opinion, and not only did the doctor check me more thoroughly, but she diagnosed and confirmed with a blood test that I have mono, and gave me a few days worth of prednisone to help with the swelling.

My experiences with Appletree have been less than stellar, and this recent issue just harms their reputation with me. If you go to an Appletree clinic and it works for you, then by all means keep using it. I just want to get the word out those who don't know about Appletree or have considered using it at some point.

Why would I leave the comforting womb of the Rocky Mountains you ask?  So I can pursue a degree in Journalism at Canada's top Journalism school of course!!

Everything is, for the most part, wonderful!  Good city, good people, good program, but I still haven't been able to find a job bartending at a decent place.  

One afternoon (today actually) while out dropping of resumes, I pop into Pier 21.  And as my luck would have it, they are having a job fair!  

So, after waiting around for an hour, and being forced to dance on a the bar to get the next interview, I finally got to sit down with one of the guys.   As it turns out they are looking to completely replace their Wednesday night staff in hopes of gaining some new customers.

So, even though I have 6 years experience as a bartender (with very solid references to boot) I still have to show them that I can bring in people.  Unfortunately, having never lived in Ottawa, I'm having a hard time with this.

This is where you come in Reddit.  Go down to Pier 21 tomorrow night.  Tell them JD sent you and you can skip the lineup.  Highballs are only $3.00 and drop-shots are $3.50.  This is a win-win for everyone!!

**TL;DR**:I need people to say that I sent them to Pier 21 on Wednesday so I can get a job.  Mixed drinks are 3.00, Drop-shots are $3.50, and if you say JD sent you (you must say JD sent you so I get recognition) you can skip the line.

My name's Lindsay (a guy's name where I'm from) and I'm coming over to uOttawa on exchange next semester (which would be fall semester for you guys I think? It starts in September.). I'm from the University of Western Australia in Perth, Australia. I study Chemistry and Law, and I'm 23 years old.

Basically, I'd like to live with locals if it's at all possible. I figure if I'm coming over, may as well throw myself in the deep end. I think I'm a good housemate. I've lived out of home for the past four years, and I've paid the ridiculous rents that Perth charges, so I'll be able to handle most of what Ottawa can throw at me. I'm a very good cook (my Thai is boss, my Italian is good), and I keep things clean - I fucking hate not being comfortable in my own space, and do my best to make it comfortable for everyone. With that said, I love having a drink or six if you're down. I'm a very outgoing type.

Personally, I have lots of interests that you may also find interesting, I guess. I'm big into music, everything from ridiculous prog metal to hip-hop to ambient. For a bit of a feel: I'm listening to the new The Knife album as I write this, I'm really digging that they're pretty much saying 'fuck you' to expectations. I play drums in a band in Perth. Some people think we're pretty good, you may agree. Other than that, I'm into travel, science, history, architecture, whiskey, and football (which I guess is soccer for you guys). Have a stalk through my reddit profile if you like, I don't have anything to hide.

Anyway, I know it's a huge commitment to live with someone that you only know off the internet, and I understand that. But still, I'd really appreciate if anyone interested would give me a chance. I'd much prefer to live with with someone who knows the city, and who can give me a more 'authentic' experience, I guess. I know that sounds a bit pretentious, sorry. I'd also enjoy living with a Redditor, as you a clearly an individual of high class and learnings. Or something.

Anyway, if you have room for a vagrant Australian, I can be reached on this reddit account, email at lindsaydick.aus@gmail.com , or facebook at facebook.com/lindsaydick . I have a skype account but the computer I'm currently on doesn't have a microphone or webcam, so it's not much use. I can get it working if you want to talk to me though.

Cheers guys! I'm really looking forward to coming to Ottawa!
