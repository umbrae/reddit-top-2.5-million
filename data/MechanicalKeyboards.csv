Upvote if you feel this is something that's worth being visible to all.**


The reason that I visit this subreddit daily is because I feel like we have a really close-knit community. I know many of you by username, and have gotten (and hopefully given) lots of helpful advice over the past year. I've seen your keyboards grow and change caps, and its been amazing. This is truly my favorite place on reddit, and I hope it's yours too. 

As mechanical keyboards are becoming a much more popular peripheral, we're seeing an increase in traffic. This is good, because the subreddit is growing wonderfully. Of course, this also brings floods of people that ask for the same or similar advice almost daily. 

The issue that I would like to address is the seemingly ruthless downvoting of new people. I have seen several newer members scared away because they posted a picture of their new QFR, proudly proclaiming the fact that they were now part of /r/mechanicalkeyboards, only to have their post downvoted to the negatives. They did not post or comment again after their first posts. 

Lets be clear, I'm talking about people that are posting their new keyboards, or asking a legitimate question that isn't ""Which keyboard do I buy wat do?"". ( if you're a new member, the first thing you should do is READ THE WIKI. ALWAYS READ THE WIKI BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS)

I think we all can remember when we posted our first keyboard, with a shoe. And I bet that most of us were greeted with open, upvoting arms, as well as proclamations of welcome. I think that first shoe post is an important step towards building a solid community. If we push away those people, we will surely meet the same fate as /r/keyboards. The reason this subreddit has thrived is because it's *personal* and *interactive*, not just articles about keyboards or news clips. This subreddit is about YOU and YOUR KEYBOARD(s). 

We have seen a flood of QFR posts, and lately the Poker II has been quite popular. These are safe, popular choices that people have made, based on YOUR advice and comments! You should be proud to see these people with their cherished new peripheral, because YOU had a hand in helping them decide! Give them an upvote, or drop them a comment. 

It's our job as a community to push good content to the top, and unwanted content down. I feel that we've done a good job of this in the past. Remember that the best content might just come from that guy that just bought the QFR, stock keycaps and all. 

So could we try a little harder to be the positive, uplifting community that we can be?! Your thoughts are welcome. Keep on clicking and clacking. 


EDIT: Thanks for your thoughts so far. Here are some things I'd like to point out:

1. When I mentioned QFR, I meant any keyboard. Don't downvote people just because they didn't get something that you haven't seen in a while. They spent a lot of money on that board, most likely.

2. It's our job to direct people to the wiki when they ask questions that can easily be found with a little poking around. Be friendly and courteous. These people are our guests, and might eventually put down roots and help others because of your advice and contribution.

3. Finally, I don't want this to be one of those things where everybody upvotes the crap out of every new post for a week, and then it goes back to how it was before. 

4. Don't be afraid to post fun and new things. This subreddit could use some more stuff to give us a laugh (just no adviceanimals, please) or to get us excited. 

5. There is no such thing as an ""entry-level"" mechanical keyboard. They're all damn expensive and they all have features and aesthetics that appeal to different people.

6. There are also many people that visit us that don't even own a keyboard. Reach out to them!

YOU can win a CM Quickfire TK White Limited Edition keyboard.  Be sure to head over and check out and subscribe to the new Cooler Master sub-reddit over at /r/coolermaster and follow the [Cooler Master Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/coolermasterNA).

OR a Filco MiniLA (UK Layout - Cherry MX Black ONLY). Check out [The Keyboard Company's website](http://www.keyboardco.com/) and [like their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/keyboardco).

----

IN ADDITION CM's Raj has put together a special **REDDIT COUPON** for the USA Store.
 
Promo code: **“redditpromo”** will give 15% off everything in the www.CMStore-usa.com site
This is a great opportunity for mechanical enthusiasts to purchase new QFR Top panels for modding, new mouse surfaces, or other upgrades to their systems.
The code will also work for the limited remaining QuickFire TK White models we have. There are only a handful left, so it’s first come-first serve.  Note: code limited to USA residents 

----
 
**Contest**

**Entry Form**

To enter the contest fill out this Google docs form with your username, name, and Zip code, city, and state.

**[CONTEST FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11fjwdMzzJUsXjfTv7hD48h-UmQte2elFIZGAmsaXC0Y/viewform)**

These details are being collected and will be verified to prevent duplicate entries and people gaming the system. If your information does not match the information provided to us, you will be disqualified and a new winner chosen. This data goes no further than the mods and will be deleted upon the completion of the contest.

Winners will be randomly drawn from the spreadsheet using random.org to generate numbers.

THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEST!   Details follow.

**Prizes**

**Contest Rules**

- Contest begins June 1st at Noon 12:00 PM PST and closes June 30, 2013 at 10:00PM PST.

- This is a ""random winner"" contest BUT you must have be a subscriber to /r/MechanicalKeyboards and have accumulated some minimum Karma. Specifically your Reddit account must have been created May 1, 2013 or earlier and to WIN you must have 10 LINK karma within the sub /r/MechanicalKeyboards by the time the contest concludes. If you WIN you will be asked to provide your /u/RedditUsername  links to your submissions at /r/MechanicalKeyboards proving this.  Any accounts that do not meet this minimum requirement will be disqualified.

SelfPosts and comment karma does not count to the 10 minimum. Don't have a keyboard (or shoes)

*The goal of this subreddit is to provide daily links to interesting keyboard content in a friendly, loosely moderated setting.*


To get to 10 try posting keyboard related: 

- News Stories
- Modification Links
- Keyboard Reviews
- Memes (cloud of booooooobs....)
- keyboard art

Note that you can accumulate 10 Link Karma in ANY of our affiliated subs:

/r/MouseReview

/r/Trackballs 

 /r/PussiesOnKeyboards  

 /r/KeyboardsGW (NSFW).....hell you post there and the moderator is liable to give 10 chances to win!

-  The Filco MiniLA is ISO layout and ONLY available to EU Subscribers.  In addition to win the ISO layout keyboard you need to live in a EU country served normally by the Keyboard Company since they will be doing fulfillment.  You CAN always arrange your own transhipment using a friends address in a country  they normally serve.

- If you are an international subscriber OUTSIDE of europe, want the CM Storm White TK (ANSI only keyboard) and not from some place that requires sled dogs and parachute drops the Moderator team has decided to pitch in shipping costs (normally $50-$60) and will ship you the CM Storm White TK...well...because THAT'S the kind of moderator team we are ... some of us even LIKE French Canadians.

- One entry per person. Alt accounts will result in disqualification from the contest. Moderators MAY be giving SOME of you the ability to enter MULTIPLE times if we spot excellent content/comments.  Or if you happen to be female...HAH I KEEEEEED!

- Rules are subject to the whim of the Moderators since we are not qualified to enter this contest. 

Please upvote for visibility, as this is a self post, no karma will be gained.

And stay tuned for more random contests....it's the /r/MechanicalKeyboards **SUMMER OF GIVEAWAYS**

I'm tired of the usual descriptions, so I wrote some better ones.",146,19,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/16h7sz/cherry_mx_and_buckling_spring_how_do_these/,";""Which switch is best for typing?"" ""Which switch is best for gaming?"" ""Why are we talking about clouds and boobs on a keyboard forum?"" These questions are asked day in and day out, and the same, tired answers are given. You can make flowcharts based on gaming genre and show all the force diagrams you want, but in the end, these are MEANINGLESS to someone who has never experienced the clicky, clacky world of mechanical keyboards.

This is my attempt to REALLY explain how switches feel and what the magic really is. I'll only touch on the 4 most common Cherry switches and buckling springs. This is where my personal experience lies. I'm not even going to TRY and cover all the ALPS switches out there, and I'm not a part of the almighty Topre elite super-race. Warning: this is a long post, if you don't have time to read about mechanical keyboard switches then you've already lost the game. Let's begin!

* **Cherry MX Red**

Cloud. Of. Boobs. We've all heard it, and it's a damn fine description. But you can really only understand this phrase once you've tried the switch. So what about the rest of us? Well, this is a LIGHT switch. You need to be accurate and experienced. Inexperienced, fumbling typists need NOT apply. Would you send a punk-ass college student to please a fine, sophisticated older woman? HELL NO! You send someone who knows what they're doing.

Being so damn light, Reds are not forgiving for sloppy typists. Typos will happen. But! What makes them difficult makes them so pleasant once you get the hang of it. You can float over the keys in a typing frenzy with little effort. These are EASY switches, once you get the hang of them. I could see these being preferable for gamers who don't want to exert much force during gaming, but BEWARE of mis-presses!


* **Cherry MX Brown**

The so-called ""all around"" switch. Although, they are so damn similar to Reds, I'm surprised they exist honestly. The only difference between Browns and Reds is Browns have a SLIGHT tactile bump. Imagine running over an acorn while doing 80mph, that's about the impact the bump has. 

BUT, in the world of typing, the slightest change makes a big difference. This seemingly insignificant bump means these switches are more forgiving for your typical bumbling typist. They need just a little more oomph to get over that bump. Oddly enough, that bump is just enough to make floating over the keys easy enough for any damn scrub to do it. Because these are simple, relatively forgiving switches, they are often recommended for newcomers and those who do both gaming and typing.


* **Cherry MX Blue**

The so-called ""typist's"" switch. THESE babies are what you imagine when you think of sweet, sweet mechanical keyboards. They have the click AND the clack. With a nice big tactile bump and a satisfying click, there is a lot going on with these switches. 

In one word, I'd describe these switches as **complicated**. NOT because of contruction, but because there is a lot going on under your fingers. If you're used to the super boring, mundane, and ultimately unsatisfying laptop keyboards that are so pervasive, you MIGHT be overwhelmed by these switches. But, if you can get over yourself, then prepare for a VERY satisfying typing experience. General concensus on how these switches perform in gaming is split. Back against the wall with a gun to my head, I would pick one of the other 3 Cherry switches for gaming, but in reality, I'm not that good for it to make a difference and you probably aren't either.


* **Cherry MX Black**

Stiff Reds. That pretty much sums up Blacks. That's really the only difference between the two: actuation force. But like I said earlier, small changes make a BIG difference in typing, DAMMIT! If you're worried about fumbling over your keyboard because you don't have the finesse for Reds, then your clumsy ass might like Blacks. You need to be deliberate in your keystrokes with these switches. But DON'T complain about ""finger fatigue."" You bought the switches, live with your decision! 

These switches, in my experience, are ever-so-slightly quieter than other switches. More force means your wimpy fingers give up before smacking against the bottoming-out platform. But you didn't buy a mechanical keyboard to be quiet did you? What nonsense is that? If you can take it, I'd imagine these are quite nice for gaming.

* **Buckling Springs**

The Original. The Godfather. The Maker of Men. The Slayer of Boys. The Panty Dropper. Take your pick. Are you ready for this switch? If you have to ask, you're not ready. Sorry, I don't make the rules. If you thought you knew what it meant to type on a mechanical keyboard, you have no idea. Until now. THIS switch will tell you something about yourself.

But enough build up. WHY is this switch so damn satisfying? Well, its name tells it all. There is a god-damned heavy metal spring under each key that undergoes CATOSTROPHIC structural breakdown, violently buckles, and SLAMS against the triggering mechanism saying, ""Activate this key. NOW!"" You press a buckling spring key and you can consider yourself a destroyer of worlds. You just caused a literal catastrophe with your PINKY. 

Terms for other switches aren't even applicable to the buckling spring. ""Tactile bump?"" There isn't just a slight bulge in the plastic stem that is so delicately tip-toed over. There is a thunderous CLASH as the spring slams into the barrel that rattles your not-worthy finger. ""Audible click?"" Is the voice of Thor simply ""audible?"" Nay! And neither is the oh-so-satisfying KA-CHUNK of the buckling spring. ""Activation force?"" If they replaced a jackhammer with an IBM Model M and a competent user, we would have no need for jackhammers.

These are about as stiff, deliberate, satisfying, and ""mechanical"" as you get in the world of keyboard switches. You WILL be rewarded if you can conquer them. If you want the finger strength of a mountain climbing Jazz pianist (thank you Scrubs!), then these are the only switches that exist to you. Sure, they are terrible for gaming, and you won't win any typing speed contests, but they WILL moisten the undergarments of even the most modest women. [Haters gonna hate](http://i.imgur.com/5OkAv.jpg).

Edit: Ok I wanted to address a few things. First, I know this write up is completely geared toward males, especially the buckling spring part. For this I apologize to all our female readers. If I was talented enough to make something funny that didn't resort to dick jokes, I would. Unfortunately I'm not that talented. I'll have to think on this some more and try to come up with some gender neutral descriptions so they are useful for everyone. This was the product of some late night rambling on little sleep.

Second, I'll have to think about doing other switch types. I don't have a lot of experience with them which is why I left them out. In the end these descriptions are actually meant to be useful by not focusing on activation force numbers and industry lingo. Whether or not that it's actually true remains to bee seen hah.",,False,self,t5_2ugo7,1358088239.0,,topre,True,t3_16h7sz,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/16h7sz/cherry_mx_and_buckling_spring_how_do_these/,

The main reason is Ripster's attitude. I love the dude for his keyboard knowledge but his constant childish spamming of ""GEEKWHACK HURRHURR!"" and other annoying b/s kills this subreddit for me. I love the info posted here, but I just can't deal with that clown acting like he's God's gift to keyboards. I agree with all his bans from other forums for spamming stuff and pretty much shit talking everyone. If this is what being into keyboards is about, then I want no part of it. 

tl;dr- When Ripster stops acting like a 10 year old elitist child, I and probably a lot of others will come back. It's petty, and makes him look jealous of all other sites by constantly putting them down. Just stop being a total prick and spread knowledge. Don't mock and spew crap about other sites. 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've just discovered in my bag of key caps and bits, that I have 3x Clickey keyrings that I developed a while back with E22 (www.e22.biz). These are the second revision of our design, which holds the switches in place very securely. They will come with a K type Power key cap and a Cherry MX Blue switch (which can be removed with some effort).

Anyone can enter the giveaway - so open worldwide, I will select the 3 winners on Friday 9th August (9PM GMT). All you have to do to enter is just drop a comment in here.

Whilst I'm doing this solely on Reddit, and have no requirements for entry, I would greatly appreciate your support in this giveaway, by dropping my page a like - although you don't have to if you don't want to:

Thanks for entering, and good luck! Hopefully I'll be able to run a contest for a Ducky Shine 3 soon!

[Mod Squad ](http://www.retroland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mod_squad_650x300_a01_12042.jpg).


Our team's comments:

- ""seems like a nice guy and posts good content""
- ""Is it possible to send the invitation with a message that says ""Welcome to the Dark Side""?""
- ""He's well-known, has a good reputation, is active and has a great keyboard blog.""
- ""what a hunk"" (oh WAIT...that was my WIFE that said that....ಠ_ಠ)

Now at a loosely moderated subforum our typical workday consists of this:

http://i.imgur.com/HZP2N.gif

But behind the scenes the moderator team does work hard on everything from the CSS (TransistorRevolt and DrSchlock TAG TEAM!) to helping provide content and the occassional MeKeyBoBuck.  And DanGWanG's energy, creativity and passion he brings to this hobby will be a nice additon to the team.

Sometimes people wonder WHY people care about their keyboards so much?   I  mean they are just hunks of plastic, metal, and some old 8 bit microcontrollers.  But as a hobby keyboards allow us to express ourselves and our uniqueness in the computer device we touch daily.  The diversity of keyboards (and shoes..lolololo) that get posted here continues to astound me and reflects how different people's tastes are.  But more importantly /r/MechanicalKeyboards as we grow has the challenge of continually being a friendly place for both noobs, the Keyboard Geek,  the snarky Redditor.  DanGWanG is one of the nicest guys I know and I am glad he has decided to spend more time here.  I think he brings an awesome vibe!

* What is your actual list of keyboards? I've looked and it doesn't seem like you have a definite list online. If you don't want to list it, why not?

* Where are you from, and what do you do? Are you in the keyboard industry or is it just your hobby?

* Naturally, what do you find is your favorite? What do you use from day to day? What's your computer setup? I'm just picturing tens of keyboards connected to a usb hub and rotating them with whatever you feel like.

* How did you learn about the more obscure switches and keyboards?

* Do you do any gaming?

Many of these people dont have/cant afford nice clicky keyboards like the rest of us privileged enough to have them. 
Many of these posts get a very harsh, unwelcoming greeting into our community and I personally find it disgusting. 

These people come here from other subreddits because they have a fondness for keyboards just like you or me, but dont have or prefer a mechanical. 

All I'm trying to say is that we could greatly improve this community and probably gain a few new members just by being a little nicer to those without mechs. 

Thanks for reading, you can downvote me off to the left.

Oh boy, was I WRONG. so wrong.

I've had my first mechanical keyboard for four freaking days, and already, I can't stand the rubber domes i use at work, its like typing on oatmeal, its so mushy...
If you haven't got a mechanical and you're kinda skeptical about whether or not they're worth the money, trust me, they are worth every freaking penny you put down. Personally, I got a CM Storm Quickfire Pro with Browns. the Tactile bump is so nice, you know exactly when the keystroke has been registered (i think its a little over half way down). The Crisp feel and sound of the switches is just something else, I actually love using my keyboard now, it's amazing.

Anyway, this is just a big thank you to this sub, without you, I'd be stuck in the dark age that is rubber dome mush.

So here's what the moderator team is discussing based on the feedback:

- the basic philosophy and structure of the sub is currently working but some tweaks will keep it so...

- volunteers work on a Mechanical Keyboard Buying Guide and we link to it using the submission CSS

- TransistorRevolt will put out a bot post - with some suggestions and what is possible for filtering etc

- Moderators will all check in periodically on the ""what keyboard do I get"" posts to gently nudge senior members to not harass noobs.  Really, if you are burnt out on /r/MechanicalKeyboards go vent in another sub please...Reddit has thousands of them.

- Subscribers please don't be dicks.

And **thanks** for all the feedback.  I'll try and continue to do this monthly.

I SELDOM selfpost so I suggest you read this Cautionary Tale, ESPECIALLY if you are just starting out in Mechanical Keyboards.

Who is Pygmalion? You MAY have forgotten your Greek History.  Well, this is one of those things Wikipedia is not bad at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_%28mythology%29

A keyboard Pygmallion is someone that tries to look for perfection in inanimate objects.  ESPECIALLY one that searches high and low, sometimes carving from stone their own view of perfection.    You see this in ANY hobby.   Frequent HeadFi or DPReview and you'll see what I mean.  They are the dudes that have 100 cameras/lenses/headphones, no money, and seem to be bitter about the whole thing and take it out on noobs.

Well, the SAME thing happens with keyboards.  So I will tell a tale of THREE keyboard hobbyists. They are taken from the TOP posters in terms of volume at Geekhack.org.

http://geekhack.org/index.php?&amp;action=stats

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CIZSH)

**Ch_123** (who ironically goes by Daedalus at Deskthority - ANOTHER Pygmallion in Greek Myth) was/is the premier IBM expert at Geekhack.  Left to become a cofounder of Deskthority with Sixty, Webwit, et. al.  He went through dozens of keyboards, wrote the DEFINITIVE IBM set of Wikis (since r00tw0rmed at Geekhack) and had nice collection of keyboards.  His collection ranged far and wide including Model Ms to Beam Spring keyboard.  The keyboard he types on most now: Apple Aluminum.

**Wellington1869** was one of the Original Geekhackers.  I had never SEEN a guy buy/sell so many keyboards (well, until the next guy in the list).  Became the Geekhack Expert on ALPS for a while until I showed up ಠ_ರೃ.  He was the only person I know blacklisted by Elitekeyboards, Ebay Seller Brian, and I think maybe even ClickyKeyboards (my memory is fuzzy on that last one) for trying to buy and then RMA every keyboard he bought.  He now types on a rubber dome (I think a HP).

**Dante** (Don't fall into Dante's Inferno) was a Geekhacker who I think went though over 20 Mechanical Keyboards.  Eventually giving up on the quest and left the site stating ""self protection"" as the reason.

So...like Greek Mythology I won't tell you what it all MEANS.  I'm sure there is a lesson to be learned there:

**Know what you want from your hobby and you'll be happier**

For me it's always been...FOR KEYBOARD SCIENCE!

1365613186.0,54,self.MechanicalKeyboards,1c2n96,QFR Stealth Update + EU Availability,57,3,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1c2n96/qfr_stealth_update_eu_availability/,"Hi everyone,

Just a few things I wanted to mention about the QuickFire Stealth.  We're really glad to see all the excitement around this product so I felt it was only fair to share these two frequently asked questions with you all.

NA Availability
-----------------------------
We did originally have the launch set for tomorrow (4/11), but unfortunately due to a union strike at one of the loading ports in Asia, we got set back two days for our shipment, which is now listed for Monday 4/15. There is no 100% guarantee it can arrive on time, but we are fighting for it.  

Nobody is more upset than our local team since we've prepared all the materials, worked on educating customers, and preparing our sales team to be ready for tomorrow. Ultimately, it is out of our control. The second our stock is available to purchase, you will see it listed on /r/mechanicalkeyboards.

EU Availability
-------------------------------
Many people have expressed their displeasure at the CM Storm team in EU for not carrying the Stealth model for various reasons, and up until now they weren't allowed to say why for legal reasons. 

The truth is that Filco holds the patent for front printed keycaps in EU ONLY, so it has held up their ability to sell it. Up until today, they were actively trying to find a solution but it looks like there was no way around it.  

I'll be glad to answer any questions you have and appreciate your patience and excitement for this product.",news,False,self,t5_2ugo7,False,news,vendorcm,True,t3_1c2n96,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1c2n96/qfr_stealth_update_eu_availability/,

Earlier ~~today~~Friday, I found out that WASD Keyboards offers something called a ""Sampler Kit"", which basically has one each of a Cherry Brown, Black, Red, and Blue, O-rings of varying durometers and thicknesses, and keycaps of various colors that were either laser-etched and/or printed. Naturally, as the saying goes, I was all over that shit ""like white on rice in a glass of milk on a paper plate in a snowstorm."" When checking out, I noticed they had a Will-Call option. And that they were located in Milpitas, California.

Now, this last part was of particular interest to me. I was aware that they were an American company, but I wasn't aware that they were so close, or that they did all their customization and shipping operations literally just over the county line. So, since I had a delivery to make for work, I opted to just get it Will-Call, and pick it up on my way back home.

(Side note: You may mock me for buying American, but goddamnit, it is important to me. I am a proud American who buys American whenever possible, doubly so if it's a local business, and triply so if it's a union shop. Anyways.)

It was a little hard to find the place, since Google Maps didn't quite want to give me directions to the exact address, but directions to the same office park was good enough. And then I went in.

I honestly hadn't expected to talk keyboards as long as I did to Weyman Kwong, the head honcho. Must have spent close to an hour-and-a-half of me bothering them and taking up their time. =P but long story short, not only was he able to produce a crap-ton of competitors' keyboards to show how their product was superior, as well has a few looks at upcoming products that I will not go into here. Sorry, but you know how industry secrets are. =) Not only that, but when I asked, he was also able to bring out an array of their own keyboards with the various colors of Cherry switches for me to try. I basically wound up just buying a barebones TK with Cherry Reds right there, and they were gracious enough to refund my sampler kit since, y'know, upgraded purchase. =)

So. To Weyman and everyone over at WASD Keyboards, (I'm sorry I didn't get your names!) a great thank you, and a wholehearted endorsement of their customer service.",,False,self,t5_2ugo7,1353159902.0,,red,True,t3_13civs,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/13civs/thank_you_wasd_keyboards/,

The user claimed to have spilled a ""little bit"" of Tang on his keyboard one day and tried to do some repairs. I took it off his hands because I knew that mechanical keyboards don't die very easily. 

The initial damage seemed pretty severe. The previous owner had tried to get under the switches by prying them open and decided to try it first on the ""page down"" key. You can see in the pictures that he had pried the switch housing off on one side. 

I followed ripster55's guide on how to deal with spills. I soaked it in water with a few drops dish soap, used denture cleaner to clean the rest of the keys, dried them over the weekend, and then repaired the broken switch. After the switch was in I tested the board to make sure it worked and I was very happy that it did! 

I finished up by lubing all the switches with the DeoxIT contact cleaner and Finish Line Teflon Grease on the stabilizers. The keyboard works and sounds like a dream. Coming from browns, the Cherry MX blues are just clicky heaven. 

Things didn't go all that smoothly though. No matter how much contact cleaner I use, some keys don't click anymore. Should I give it another bath or just try the cleaner over and over again?

We got our shipment in over the weekend and I'm happy to say that we have secured a limited quantity at the CM-Store.  For you early adopters, we have it up and ready to go!

http://www.cmstore-usa.com/quickfire-stealth-mechanical-gaming-keyboard/

For Amazon/NewEgg - their shipment leaves the warehouse today and based on their internal logistics, it could take anywhere from 3-10 days to be fully available in their systems.  Since NewEgg is local, I would anticipate they get it sooner.  Once the sales teams let me know, I'll update this post.

Canada I have no definitive date because the shipment is leaving the warehouse today to respective channels of business, but will update when I get confirmation.
