1264868460.0,58,self.Learnmusic,aw2o6,IAMA Voice teacher continuation - Vocal warm ups and exercises.,65,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/aw2o6/iama_voice_teacher_continuation_vocal_warm_ups/,"*Protip* – These exercises are best done in front of a mirror so you can check out all the physiological happenings as you do it. **Singing is first and foremost a physical activity.**

**Breathing -**

Stand against a wall. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, heels against the wall. The back of your head should also be against the wall. Breathe in. The first thing you should notice is your stomach expanding. Your diaphragm is pulling your internal organs downwards to make space for your lungs to expand.

Your ribcage will then rise and move outwards. This is creating additional room for your lungs to expand. Don't confuse this with your shoulder. They'll come up a little naturally just because of your ribs, but they should not come up very high. This cuts off the top of your chest and doesn't allow your lungs to expand fully.

When all is said and done, you should feel expansion all around your abdomen, front sides and back. Your ribcage should feel lifted, and your posture should be akin to someone pulling your head up by a string attached right at the top.

Now that you have air in your lungs, exhale in four short busts with a hissing noise. On the fourth one, sustain the hiss for four counts, then exhale completely. If you do this right, once you push all of your air out, you shouldn't have to do anything to inhale. The vacuum created in your lungs will just fill with air.

Repeat the process, increasing the count by four every time until you can't possibly go for any longer.

*Tips:* When you inhale, you shouldn't be making any noise. Imagine that you're sipping air through a straw, so that you feel cool air on the back of your throat. This also helps to lift the soft palate which we'll talk more about in our next exercise. Your throat should be nice and open.

**Yawn Sirens -**

Force yourself to yawn. You feel that giant space in the back of your mouth? That's your soft palate stretching. If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth, you'll feel where your hard palate ends, and the soft begins. By stretching, you create a big space for your voice to resonate.

With that big space in back in mind, start at the bottom of your range and slide all the way up to the top, and then come all the way back down. Consider this the “big loop”. You can also do several “small loops” where you start at the bottom, come up a little, then back down, then up a little higher, then back down a little less, then a little higher, etc. until you reach the top.

**Other non-pitch specific warm ups -**

Two words: Nada and Hey

Inhale just like we were doing before, and say both of them at different pitch ranges in your voice, you can start low and go higher, or start high and go lower, or just do it randomly.

When you say “Hey”, make a big deal out of the H. Because its an aspirate consonant, it requires a good burst of air to really come out. You should see your stomach immediately come back in as your diaphragm releases.

When you say “Nada”, really focus on bringing that N forward. Don't bring it into your nose, feel it more in your eyes and the bottom of your forehead. This brings your tone forward and helps you project.

**Range Work -**

Okay, were going to need to work on some assumptions now. If I say, Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do, I assume you know I'm referring to a major scale, and that you know what it sounds like. I'm going to start talking actual pitches, and some more musical stuff.

If I have assumed too much for you, you may have to wait until I have time to record some examples of these exercises.

American's suck at vowels. Hard. So the biggest challenge I have when working with kids in choir is getting them to use singing vowels, and not American ones. I will use International Phonetic Alphabet symbols to represent the vowel sound.

[a] as in F**a**ther, [e] as in w**a**y, [i] as in h**e**, [o] as in h**o**pe, [u] as in sp**oo**n

Americans suck because we don't pronounce any of these vowels singularly. For most, we naturally use dipthongs, or two vowel sounds. Say “Way”. Hear that trailing long E sound after the first vowel. Don't do that. You just want the first vowel sound. Say “Hope”. Hear how first you say oh, and then close to an oo sound? Don't do that either. For these vocal exercises we want only pure vowels.

**Lower range extension** -

Start in the middle of your range on a random pitch (I usually start on the Eb below middle C for a baritone). Start on Sol and sing down five notes, so it sounds like Sol, Fa, Mi, Re, Do. Sing this line on an [i] vowel. Repeat again, going down by half steps every time until it stops sounding like singing and more like burping.

The vowel has a forward placement, so as you go lower, it will help to bring your sound forward. For most, especially guys, going lower in your range will cause your placement to fall back into your throat. That create a very dark and swallowed sound. It also creates jaw tension which doesn't allow for free and easy singing.

**Upper range extension** - 

Start again in the middle of your range, this time more towards the top (I usually start on the D just above middle C). The tune goes up and down with the following melody, Do Mi Sol (Do) Sol Mi Do. The (Do) means one octave up from the original. 

Try and find a constant rhythm to do it in. The best way I can really explain it is using some basic theory. In 6/8, all the pitches should be 8th notes. Don't slow down on the approach to the top. You will psych yourself out. 

On the first three notes, sing on an [e] vowel. Then when you reach the top, switch to [a] and sing that vowel the rest of the way down. The higher you go, the more air it will require to make the notes come out. When it starts to feel really high, bend your knees when you hit the top note and visualize the sound exploding out of the top of your head.

-----

Alright, there is no tl;dr I can really do for this subject. You may have to read this a couple times to understand, and feel free to ask clarifying questions. This is the first time I've tried to write all this stuff down, and I'm sure some of it is confusing. I will try and get the microphone out and record some examples this weekend.

Unfortunately, this is not the case and while the two are closely related it's important to know the difference.

I invite all of you to pick a song you are currently working on and think about how you are approaching it.  What do you do with it every day?  Do you play from beginning to end a couple of times and then move on to another song?  It's very easy to sit down day after day and play the same song the same way.  You go from beginning to end, stumbling over a few spots, making a few mistakes here and there.  Then you get to the end and you say to yourself, ""Oh that sounded pretty good.""  How many of you have done that?

**The secret to effective practicing is in finding all of your trouble spots and working through them until they aren't trouble spots anymore.**  It sounds very simple and it is, but are you doing it?  Here are some steps for effective practicing:

* Play through the song.  Mark any place you have any trouble. 
* Play through the song again with a metronome.  Listen carefully and mark any places where the rhythm fluctuates. 
* Play through the song again and record yourself.  Play back the recording and find out if you are really hearing what you think you're hearing.  Mark down any trouble spots. 
* Have someone else listen to you play the song and point out trouble spots.

Now, pick one trouble spot to focus on.  What you want to do is slow down the tempo and focus on just this one measure.  Analyze every bit of the measure.  What is causing you trouble?  Is it the rhythm? The notes? Fingering? Articulations? Pinpoint what the problem is and then start practicing it slowly the correct way.  Aim for 10 - 20 perfect repetitions.  Now up the tempo a bit and repeat it again.  Does a change in tempo throw you off?  Are you still repeating it perfectly?

Once you have locked down the trouble measure and have been practicing it perfectly up to tempo, take a look at the surrounding measures.  Add them into your repetition and make sure that you can get into and out of the trouble measure without any problems.  Start at a tempo that is comfortable and gradually increase the speed to secure the passage.

Set goals each day for which trouble spots you want to work out.  **It's not the amount of time you spend practicing that matters, it's the amount of focus and attention to detail while practicing that matters.**",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_ddrba,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/ddrba/effective_practice_practicing_versus_playing/,

I'm no virtuoso, but as a hobby the blues have kept me playing and enjoying music. My favorite part about blues piano is that it doesn't need to be organized. In fact, it is more fun if you mix it up!

I played classical music for 6 months and was bored to tears until I found this **awesome beginner blues tutorial:**

In my lessons, I emphasize correct technique and other things, but one of those rather ""elusive"" areas of teaching music can be sight reading. I've been experimenting with various pedagogical approaches to sight reading, but the best results seem to be coming from an approach I thought had absolutely no chance of working at all...

Most method books procede in gradual increments of difficulty. So, the beginning of the book will have easier examples while the back of the book will have more advanced material. I've already tried ""procedural"" methods (look at the key signature, skim the piece for the tough spots, look for patterns, etc.). This is pretty helpful, but it isn't producing ""success"" in sight reading - and by success, I mean accurate performance of material the very first time. 

So, I've begun taking my students to the end of the book and have them ""sight read"" an advanced piece. The goal of this isn't for them to achieve success with this piece - part of success is failure, I'm realizing more and more with teaching this concept - but rather building up the mental capacity of students to recognize patterns faster by introducing the most challenging material first. It works, because we flip a few pages back in the book and try another excerpt of material. Still there are mistakes but far fewer mistakes than before. We flip a few more pages back, and boom! Success! First reading, perfectly performed.

And so I'm posting this here to offer some advice to DIY's learning music and how to sight read. Shoot for difficult material first, do the best you can and shed your fear of failure. Go ahead, fall flat on your face and get it over with, because you need to do this and get it out of the way. Go to something a little easier, again, do your best and read your way through it without stopping. Continue this process until you start nailing your material the first time without mistakes. 

Of course, this helps when you have a teacher there that can give you advice on how to play things more accurately, but you might be surprised just how little someone like me has to say to a student who is sight reading material. There's not a whole lot to say but, ""Here, let's try this one now."" Again, I never thought this approach would work for my students, but I'm finding more success with this than anything else I've tried so far. Good luck!

tl;dr - For solid results in sight reading, I recommend reading harder stuff first, then gradually move to easier material until you achieve an accurate read the very first time.

(as a ""game"" and a learning tool)",26,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/mvxbj/so_rocksmith_is_fucking_awesome_as_a_game_and_a/,"Ok so if you hadn't heard, Rocksmith is Ubisofts entry into the rhythm music game genre, it's main difference being you use a 1/4"" plug-USB cable to plug a real guitar into your Xbox 360/PS3/PC (depending on which version of the game you buy, the cable is platform-agnostic)

Here's the [list of songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksmith)

[GiantBomb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=o5UQf4iyVv8#t=371s) does a great hour-long QuickLook at it.

Anyway, my thoughts from the point of view of an complete beginner at guitar. (I have about 11 years of piano experience besides that so I am decently musical)

Now I also have the [Rock band 3 pro fender midi guitar](http://www.rockband.com/blog/rb3-features-pro-guitar) but the thing Rocksmith has over that is the actual note charts/tabs. Rocksmith's is a lot easier to make sense of than RB3's. That is much better for a beginner like me. Plus since your console is acting like an amp/DSP thingy, you are actually hearing the real output of your guitar, out of tune notes and everything. RB3 Pro's is MIDI based, and I had some issues since it was more of a fight of plucking just right and making sure you had the exact finger positions to make contact with the MIDI guitar's electronic fretboard. 

The other advantage is there is no difficulty selection. The songs are chopped into sections/riffs ala RB/GH, and as you perfect each measure/section/riff, it will start dropping in more notes as you play the song. If you do worse it will pull it back for that section a bit till you perfect it again. It's fantastic, and I was playing [Queens of the Stoneage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xYY-GbjEduE) and it was so fun and rewarding watching the game add more notes to each measure as it got good at the song. See the blue and orange boxes at the top of the screen? they start out as empty boxes that fill up as you correctly play the song. It starts with just one note/pluck per measure (or every other measure) and soon after a few tries at the song, you're playing all 16th's with the chords in there too. That looks daunting but I can't find any videos of people playing beginner level stuff.

There's also little arcade games that help you with basic techniques that make stuff like [scales](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=jYzUMdxzzaw) and [chords](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dv9gFyC-00s) fun to work on.

It also doesn't punish you (that I could tell) for playing wrong notes, just for missing the notes you were supposed to hit. Well I shouldn't say punish. You can't ""fail"", it just pulls back on the notes it's sending you if you're doing bad. There's a scoring system, so there is a way to track your progress and gamify your practice at a song. My roommate has played guitar for a long time, and knows [House of the Rising Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pt8vZIIrfmg), and he's pumping out the chords and stuff even though the game is just sending him a few notes. By the end of the song he was getting chords thrown at him so the game adjusts very well to your skill. (there is also an option in the settings to reset the difficulty of all songs to minimum, or set it to maximum if you are already a pro heh)

Similar to RB3, there are technique practices, like bends, HOPOS and such, with bronze/silver/gold medals for you to unlock pedals and amps with and stuff.

Annoyances:

* You can select a song and see it's basic chord structure, and you can then choose a chord to practice. My issue is that loading the game takes too long and you only practice that one chord you chose, not all 3. And each chord practice session is just a handful of strums, not long enough to justify the load time. There's a chord book in the game you can look at however.  

* I wish the song selection was a little more varied. Half seems to be California indie rock by bands I've never heard of. A quarter is classic rock and the other quarter is alt rock. There is no metal, however Megadeth is getting 3 of it's songs as DLC in the few weeks coming which will be nice (Yes, including Hangar 18 lol). The song selectins is still acceptable for a beginner guitarist like me though.

* It comes with a little poster saying you shouldn't play with HDMI audio since it introduces a delay. This was fixable in RB3 and such, but I believe the way the game works with the guitar audio, there isn't a real way to correct the lag since you are playing realtime. If you had issues with your RB3 freestyle drumming being way off you know what I'm talking about. It does suggest you get [Xbox HDMI converter cable](http://www.amazon.com/Hdmi-Cable-Adapter-Xbox-360/dp/B001S5CCF2), so your audio isn't delayed (video can still be HDMI, and ingame is a video lag compensator like RB/GH)



That's about it. Here I am 2am blabbing about this game I just spent 3 or 4 hours with (It just arrived today) and all this time I could have played Skyrim! ;)

Retail is $79 for game and cable but on Black Friday I was able to get it for $49 from Gamestop. Still totally worth it. There's even a 200$ bundle that includes a guitar, but I heard it's a JR guitar so you're probably better off in the long run borrowing a buddies or buyind a decent guitar.

I dunno what's making me want to keep playing this. I think it's the *actual* audio feedback that helps, and the intuitive charting method. Plus there's [Ducks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Rn-TUeNmFNU#t=56s)

**Some history**

I have been playing guitar now for 5 years or somewhat without any understanding of music theory and in those years I learned to play songs with TABS and also jammed a lot with trial and error. I can say I have a decent feel for music and my hand dexterity is pretty good.

**What I have done so far**

So this year I set a goal to be able to produce music and to be able to enjoy the whole process of it effortlessly, which I know will take a lot of work.

**1)** I bought myself a MIDI piano and learned to play some songs through memorising. This is my preferred learning way and I've been able to pick up quickly.


**2)** Starting hitting the books and gained insight on general music theory (notation, scales, chords, basic song structures). I have a pretty solid understanding of what they 
mean, but find it hard to actually apply this set of knowledge.


**3)** Considering that I want to produce electronic music, I thought it would be a good idea to explore synthesizers. The past few weeks, I have been reading up on FM synthesis, oscillators and whatnot and starting playing around with a copy of Native Instruments' FM8 I purchased.

**4)** I have explored the ins and outs of Logic Pro, a DAW I decided to pick since I also recently made a switch from PC to Mac and also because it was on sale in the app store. I have watched tutorials exploring all the virtual instruments I I have gained an understanding on how to go through the software itself.

**Problems I have run into**

**1)** I can't seem to finish any song I work on. I am always dissatisfied in the end and flip everything around leaving a mess. I seem to look for something and the problem is that I have no clue what it is.

**1a)** So okay, I make a decent melody over a chord progression I randomly create from a key (my understanding of chord progressions is not top notch, would like some insight on that too), but the song in itself sounds too static and I have no clue how to bring dynamic into play. Basically, I'm struggling to finish a song into a whole piece. 

**1b)** It seems that all the instruments don't sound right when put them together but when played individually, I love them. As of now, I feel that I should deepen myself in the art of drum programming because the sound I have now, I'm just not satisfied.

**2)** Mastering.. I just have no clue, at this point I feel it is all too much for me. When I hear everything all together, it keeps sounding worse the more I work on it to the point that I can't listen to it as music. This demotivates me

Now I know music basically has no rules but I feel there is a common skill that can be learned (perhaps I'm all wrong). I hope I am not coming across too whiny (sorry for the long post!!), but no one around me does anything with music so basically the internet and books are my only source of knowledge and inspiration, this is my first time reaching out for help.


My mind is too scattered, I try to learn anything of everything but am yet unable to produce a piece I can be proud of.


I think I'm too ignorant but I am very willing to learn! please give me some helpful insights so I can go back to work confidently!


(Sorry if this post doesn't seem like a coherent piece, there are probably some more points I can't come up with right now.)

I have been using the functional ear trainer from miles.be to try to learn to hear the scale degrees of notes.

My goal is to be able to listen to a piece of music and be able to determine which notes and chords are being played so that I can play whatever I hear in my head on the piano.

I have quickly gotten to the point where I am able to get 100% on functional ear trainer (it plays a cadence and then a note) but it takes me a 'moment' (maybe like a second) to think of the answer. When I listen to a simple melody playback I can't figure out the notes. I believe that this might be because I don't know where 'do' is or maybe because it's too fast. If I hum the melody to myself tone by tone I can sometimes figure it out.

Can you please suggest the next step for me or recount how you gained your enhanced hearing?

I'm 15, my whole immediate family are musicians(Mom piano, dad guitar, sister voice). They've always had me try a little of this and that, but I never found my niche.

I realize I'm a bit older than the usual beginner, but I don't have any intentions of making anything but a hobby out of this.

My dad can make his way around a violin decently(he has a masters degree in guitar, which doesn't translate over perfectly but I digress), so he can help me out a bit, but he travels with work quite a bit so when he's home on weekends we don't exactly have much time together for him to teach me.

Now, onto the main part. I have no idea how to read music. Do I just begin similar to how one would learn another language? Is it mostly memorizing everything or are there some tricks to it? Is there a good online course for learning? Also, all the different note shapes and if they're shaded in or empty just confuse the hell out of me.

I realize I could just ask my parents these things, but... I don't know, for whatever reason it feels a bit awkward when they try to teach me things. Oh well.

Anyways, Say i have Someone playing a C chord, someone playing an E chord, and someone playing a G chord at the exact same time. Will we all be playing a C chord together? 

Just curious as to how this would work out, as I under stand you would be hearing the notes C, E, G from the C, E G# B from the E, and G, B, D from the G.
This would be together; C D E G Ab(G#) B
so this is where Im stuck, would it still be a C chord because its those chords in the same order as the notes or would it be some weird chord that you need 6 fingers to play?

I'm good enough that I got a scholarship to study music, but there's one thing that really frustrates me:

I suck at sight reading! The level of piano music I play, it can take up through half an hour to get through one page. I have to sit there and pick out each individual note of a chord, go through each run a note at a time, really slowly. On the cello, it's a bit easier since it's usually just one note at a time, but I still sound terrible as my bow slows down irregularly and I crunch my way through the music. 

I have to memorize the music pretty much to play it. I just don't read it fast enough to play it by sight, which makes accompanying on the piano a frustrating venture. To play something at tempo from the music, I'll already have it 80%-90% memorized already.

On the plus side, I do memorize pretty quickly. Piano music has never been about difficulty in technique, it's always been difficulty getting the notes correct. 

Anything I can do to help this, or should I just take it as a plus that I can memorize it and memorize away?",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_j568s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/j568s/i_suck_at_sight_reading/,

The idea is that you play e.g.  a polyrhythm like 3:2, to take a simple example - but emphasie every 2nd beat in the 3 beats per measure, and every 3rd beat in the 2 beats per measure, it's harder to do than you'd think!

For the first video in the play list, be sure to hit three different surfaces (or notes or instruments) with right hand, and two surfaces with left hand - following this pattern of bounces. That's what makes it tricky, otherwise it is just a simple 3:2 polyrhythm.

As the rhythm gradually gets faster - how far can you get before you get confused about which surface to hit, or drop a beat? Can you get all the way to the end?

This play list also includes versions with the parts going silent - can you keep going through the silences? Also a polyrhythm morph - can you morph from one polyrhythm to another?

These are exercises to help you develop a steady beat in all the parts, and with rhythmic independence in all the parts.

You can apply the same approach to any polyrhythms, many examples here

So I guess my real question is, of these 3, which would be the best for an absolute noob? What kind of sound card would I need for a novice MIDI controller set up?

I have seen some M-AUDIO USB - MIDI adapters but have read mixed reviews, what are your opinions on these? Would they work well for a noob using FL10 and Win7?

Anything she can do?",18,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/reqzf/girlfriend_is_struggling_in_college_yet_the/,"My girlfriend and I are freshman in college. She is pursuing a degree in music education but is having immense difficulty with the courses. The music department puts many classes onto the students and as such, my girlfriend has to pass about six to seven music courses a semester. She's having difficulty passing her classes due to a couple of problems:

1) she just isn't a natural at music. She loves music to death, but she was never a prodigy. Unfortunately this lacking initial ability seems to be an issue in her classes as she is unable to pick up a new idea or musical instrument easily without lots of practice. For example Ear Training, where she needs to hear a song played on a piano and write it down in on a musical staff. This is one of her most difficult classes. 

2) She doesn't have time to perfect her musical knowledge. With the amount of work that is placed on her by the musical department, she just isn't able to spend enough time on each subject to learn the subject adequately before the examination period. My girlfriend is a very hard worker and she spends her time wisely. Yet she does not have enough time to spend practicing on her different courses as needed.

3) The professors *aren't helping her*! This particular issue annoys me the most. My girlfriend literally goes to the professors, lets them know directly that she doesn't understand the course material and needs *help*, and then they don't help her. Her professors have office hours that conflict with her schedule, and are not willing to make appointments to help her learn the course material. 

*Her Ear Training professor told her he would get her a tutor before the first exam. The first exam passed and she failed. The second exam is in a week and just now is the professor assigning her a tutor. 

*Her percussion professor simply stated that he did not have time to help her and that was that. Now she is failing percussion. 

In short, the professors are just telling her that she needs to work on the course material on her own and improve, *but isn't the whole point of paying for college so that you have instructors who help you?!?*
This in particular is outraging me. But I don't know what I can do for her. So any advice on possible actions to improve my girlfriend's education? Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: My girlfriend isn't very good at music.
My girlfriend doesn't have time to perfect all the music courses put onto her by the university.
The professors aren't willing to help my girlfriend learn the course material to passing standards.

Need suggestions on sequence of study.,13,0,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/10rm9n/wanting_to_learn_to_improvise_need_suggestions_on/,"I play clarinet, and for some time I've wanted to be able to create music, not just play it. I've looked around for materials to learn improvising and found three broad categories of stuff:

1) Music theory-based: modes and scales and intervals and strange jazz chords. Basically, learn the scales and music magically comes out.

2) Example-based: Here's a blues backing track, and a couple of riffs. Now, it's your turn. Play!

3) Technique-based: Here's a jazz swing rhythm. Here's a line of music where you can practice this rhythm. Now here's a basic 12-bar blues. Play simple phrases with a swing rhythm.  We can add different chords to the blues, and throw in blue notes for interest. Here's a blues scale, but don't stress about it, just play whatever notes you want. Try using different accents, to play with the syncopation. Here's a bend and a dropoff. Now start learning riffs, mix and match, and music will magically appear.


I feel lost trying to work with any of these materials. I want something more systematic, but not so heavy on the music theory.  Someone recently turned me on to some of the guitar approaches out there, which begin with the pentatonic scale. I got really excited, because this approach is kind of in-between the theory-heavy stuff and the example-based stuff.  But then, clarinet is not guitar... I don't know how to create melodic lines in a clarinet idiom using the guitar resources I've found.

So I feel like I'm flailing, and because I don't have much confidence that I'm doing the right thing, I haven't been practicing as much, and so I don't know what I'm doing.

I don't really want to be able to play modern jazz, so much, as just to be able to jam. So the complex music theory is really not what I'm looking for. Just, you know, be able to play a ""Horse with no name"" backing track and jam with it, but in an interesting way. Or play over a boogie woogie piano. Or create a dixieland line over ""Saints"".

This is a long-winded way to ask: I need a curriculum, a step 1, step 2, etc, set of exercises, or skill goals, or whatever, that I know will allow me to be able to create music on my clarinet. The clarinet is similar enough to the sax that maybe a sax approach will be useful as well.

Anyone out there with suggestions?

**EDIT:**
I play piano for fun (I can play the first movement of Moonlight Sonata, but I can't play any Chopin. I can play Maple Leaf Rag with some mistakes, and I can stumble my way through Bach's Invention in C and the one in F). I've been tinkering with flute the last couple of years, learning mostly to play Irish music and Bach's Flute Partita. I was first chair clarinet in high school and played some chamber music in college. Mostly I play for fun now, though I'm in a local marching band that plays at parades and community events. 

So I'm pretty good at reading music, good enough that I'm bad at memorizing and listening to what's in my head. I don't have much formal music theory, though I know the basics, and understand the idea of modes, and how chords fit into a key signature, though not the more complex stuff you get in jazz with 9 chords and dim flat 6 chords, or whatever. So far, playing scales has seemed pointless (but some of you say that it's important, so I'll revise my opinion and go back and practice scales some more!).",,False,,t5_2rgto,1349145233.0,,,True,t3_10rm9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/10rm9n/wanting_to_learn_to_improvise_need_suggestions_on/,

the top number is the number of beats in the bar, and the bottom number is what kind of note a beat is.

what i don't get:
are some time signatures basically the same?
so, if the song has a 12 beat repeating pattern, does playing it in 3/4 sound different than 4/4? does 2/4 sound the same as 4/4?

and if they do not sound the same, what makes them different?

I was never very good at it and I never played in a group or took lessons, so when I got to high school, the bass fell by the wayside as the saxophone took over for marching and jazz band. During college I took a break from music altogether, and recently I got hired at a music instrument store. It's brought me back to the sax, but there are difficulties finding a group to play with, so I decided that I want to learn guitar or relearn bass. 

Here's the problem: I've spent extensive amounts of time over the past month or two playing both of these instruments, even taking guitar lessons at work, and I enjoy playing both of them. I would say that I enjoy bass more at this point because barre chords on the guitar are a nightmare at this point, but I can say that I would be upset if I had to stop doing either one of them. 

I can afford to get decent examples of both, especially because of where I work (though I'd be spending more than I'd like). However, I'm more concerned about time investment. I don't want to split my time so much that instead of becoming good at one thing I become mediocre at two or three things, but I simply can't decide which instrument to focus on. 

For what it's worth, I listen to pretty much all genres of music (rap to heavy metal to jazz to blues to funk) but jazz and blues are what I seem to be drawn to playing.

I am in a tough situation.  Let me set the scene.

I am a first year music teacher in an inner city elementary school.  I teach general music stuff to grades kindergarten through sixth grade.  These sixth graders are *rough.*  They remind me of high school juniors.  Many are having sex, or close to it.  Their parents are not very proactive or, in many cases, educated.  They often have responsibility over many other siblings.  

Most importantly, they don't give a fuck.  Not about music, not about school.  They do give a fuck about social standing, and getting out of more traditional schoolwork.  Many of them come into my class with these ""Fuck you, bitch"" looks on their faces. 

So, besides letting them listen to ""I'm Sexy and I Know It"" a million times and flirt with their friends, what should I teach them?  What would you want to learn about in music class if you could learn anything?

I have tried:

1. Recorders.
2. Piano.
3. Orff-like instrumentation.
4. Drum circle / improv.
5. Traditional music history.
6. Contemporary music history / current events.
7.  Exploring musical tastes.
8. Opera. 
9. Sound physics labs.

I will only have this group of students for eight more weeks, but I don't want to give up on them.   I really want to think of another cool project or two to do with them, but I'm running out of ideas fast.  And I don't want to be that teacher that gives them bullshit to do for 45 minutes, nor do I want to dread this particular 45 minute period of my day for the rest of the year.  

So, lay it on me.  What would you have wanted to learn if you could learn anything in music class?

It's a really cool new way of notating music. You open the program and start playing, you don't have to setup anything like key, tempo or play to a clicktrack or anything like that. Just play. Then print (or export).

The program uses very advanced research on human music cognition to recognize phrases, tempo changes, time signature changes, key changes and a lot of cool stuff that no other program can do, and there are really cool editing features (like, re-play one phrase or bar), so you actually don't even have to be that good at playing.

You can even play several voices at once, and the program will know what is melody, what is second voice etc, and separate into staffs.

Right now you need to play on a midi instrument, but an audio recognition version is in the pipeline (imagine that!!).

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IlOL1IOnHk)'s a vid.

I am a voice teacher, I have done an AMA on this sub-reddit before. I am looking to take on one, maybe two, online voice students, completely free of charge just as an experiment to see the feasibility and the effectiveness of private lessons done online.

I am hoping that there will be a flood of respondents to such an ad, so let me set out a few prerequisites.

* First, if you are currently taking private voice lessons, I would prefer not to conflict with your teacher's methods.
* You must have a decent quality webcam, and be familiar with its use for video conferencing.
* You must have a piano/keyboard. I don't care if it's dinky or small, but you need some kind of keyboard instrument to be able to play melodic examples for yourself that I may give you. ABILITY TO PLAY PIANO NOT NECESSARY, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NOTE NAMES OF THE KEYS.
* You must be at least 16 years of age. (This is not to discriminate. There are too many factors and variables associated with a rapidly changing voice. For experimental purposes, I would like to limit the number of variables I am dealing with in a lesson.)

If you meet all the above requirements, please **send me a message** responding to the following questions.

* Name:
* Age:
* Voice part (if known):
* Singing experience (if any):
* Previous vocal instruction (if any):
* Three convenient days of the week and general times you would be available for lessons:
* Additional info you'd like to share:

I'll choose one or two students based mainly on a first come first serve basis depending on whose schedule can align best with mine for lessons.

**UPDATE**

Wow! Thank you for the overwhelming response. Please understand I would take on more students if I could, but there are only so many hours in the day and they need to line up with my schedule too. I am starting with just one student for now. After Christmas, if I find it's working well and I have time, I will continue down my original list for a second student.

new material",16,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/deoxr/tip_using_guitar_herorock_band_tracks_for/,"**Warning:** *legal/licensing issues should prevent you from actually following this advice*

As you probably know, ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band"" series of games have a nice collection of popular rock songs that have separate tracks for different instruments. Some of these are actual masters, some were re-recorded by WaveGroup Sound company. All in-game songs were later converted to Frets on Fire clone game, and that means they are available in OGG music format.

So, by [downloading Frets on Fire song packs](http://thepiratebay.org/search/frets%20on%20fire%20songs/0/5/0) via torrents, you get:

 -  isolated track for lead guitar and bass guitar for easier song transposition

 - tracks for the rest of song, which can be mixed in [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) and used as backing track

The useful files inside song directory:

**guitar.ogg** - lead/solo guitar

**rhythm.ogg** - bass/rhythm guitar track (not present in Guitar Hero 1 songs)

**drums.ogg** - drums/percussions (only in Rock Band songs)

**song.ogg** - remaining tracks (vocals, keyboards)

Here's few tips for effective learning:

 - use your ear to transpose music

 - isolate problematic sections and practice them with slower tempo

 - record yourself playing, and mix your version in place of original track

 - improvise with variations and different arrangements",,False,,t5_2rgto,True,,,True,t3_deoxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/deoxr/tip_using_guitar_herorock_band_tracks_for/,

chords of those keys, but I have some more advanced questions.

I'm slightly confused about harmonizing a scale in intervals.  Lets say A minor in thirds, for example. A would be matched with C, correct?  Now, for the B note, is it the third of B, or the third scale degree from B in the A minor scale?  This confuses me slightly.

Also is it possible to harmonize a major scale in minor intervals?  What would this sound like?  I just thought of this today, and I cant get near an instrument for a while.

Finally, I was curious if it is possible to harmonize the modes into chords in a similar manner to that of the regular major and minor scale.  Can this be accomplished through basic third stacking as well?  Thanks!

I've been playing piano on and off for about 3-4 years, and I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for a musicianship class (ear training and dictation skills) just for my own personal musical growth. I took the class 8 years ago back when I wanted to be a music major, so I didn't take the class seriously, just did it to advance.

 I petitioned for the class and came home to learn that the books cost $240 for both books plus $92 for the class! That seems like a ton of money for one course at a Jr. College. I understand you can rent the books, but why bother if I'll use them in the future for more practice?

My question is, do you think its worth all that money? I currently am taking 1-on-1 piano lessons and am enrolled in intermediate piano.

Some of these questions may be fairly complicated, and they are quite widespread in subject matter, but any answers would be greatly appreciated. Background info: I play the sax, guitar, cello, and I'm currently trying to teach myself the piano. I know an average amount of music theory.

1. How does one create a sweet melody in jazz improvisation on the saxophone? I have mostly been taught patterns to apply to different keys, but I know there's much more than that. When I pointed this out to my teacher, he said that I should just listen to more jazz and I would understand. This sounds like a good idea and I have been listening more, but are there any other tips?

2. For guitar, I'm mostly just reading tabs and chords to songs; this feels pretty empty musically. To combat this, I've started learning how to read sheet music on guitar and I'm going to buy The Advancing Guitarist by Mick Goodrick (which my sister's boyfriend recommended to me). Any other ideas? I want to learn how to improvise on the guitar as well.

3. How does one harmonize on the piano?

4. Why are the 1st, 4th, and 5th intervals perfect?

5. What makes music ""good?"" I've been thinking about this a lot when I listen to music, and I can't really put into words why I like a certain song/artist/album over another. Sorry this is such a general question.

(3 stanzas that slowly build)

(The hook/""power"" part of the song - Chorus?)

(couple more stanzas to tie it together)

(Outro, which is essentially the intro but with a minor change)

Now, assuming any of that made sense, my point is that it doesn't fit a normal structure, especially since the chorus doesn't repeat... it sort of just builds to it from a soft acoustic.

I have a slight problem that another post made me realize you kind folks might be able to help with.

I need advice on learning techniques/materials. I play several other instruments (trombone, piano, and the basics of guitar) but all I've ever wanted was to play the violin. One day I'd like to play with an orchestra or something similar - even if its just a community thing for fun (though I must admit my dream has always been the Indianapolis Philharmonic Orchestra,) but my best is trombone and I just don't like playing the super bass-ey classics. My favorites like Paganini, Beethoven and Tartini's music doesn't have much for a trombonist. And yes, I know there is quite a bit of Beethoven piano music, but my piano wouldn't be with me for at least another year so... I fear I'll have to re-teach it all to myself again.

I have a reasonable grasp on the basics -cleaning, pizzicato, proper technique- and a basic Carlo Robelli violin, but have never had a single lesson. I have several books, watch a couple of youtube channels on the basics, and sometimes call a family friend with questions. Sadly he lives on the other side of the country, so he can't personally teach me.

Can it be done? Many people have told me the violin is the hardest instrument to pick up, and that you can't do it alone. I don't plan to do it alone forever; just until I can scrap together the cash to pay for lessons. Are there any resources for beginners that would help? Trusted videos or podcasts? Plain old words of advice? I can't describe how much I'd appreciate it!

Example: A# as opposed to Bb

Anyway, while learning the circle of fifths most charts I've seen have had the counter-clockwise note progression as flats instead of sharps (the notes that rise on the perfect 4ths). This causes problems when transcribing the scales because I'm left with notes that are flat which I would normally refer to as sharp (the scales are essentially a jumbled mess of sharps and flats). I could just deal with it and make an acception for those notes, remembering that they're the special acception... Or I could change the flattened notes on the circle of 5ths chart to sharpened notes so it makes sense after transcribing. But by doing that I'm altering the circle of 5ths and  I don't feel like I should be doing that.

My brother left to teach english abroad and left behind his [2 turntables](http://imgur.com/kxKHl). I think he got them used and barely used them. Its just the 2 turntables, no speakers (I have ones that will work for now), and no mixer.

I know this probably sounds lame, but I'm still in HS but I want to start taking the steps to be a DJ. I love hip hop and I love electronic music (house, techno, d n b, trance). At some point in the future I'd like to be able to produce my own tracks, but I have no idea what equipment/software I would need. I feel like I have half a starters set and no instructions.

So when I found my brother's turntables and asked if it would be alright to take them out of storage and give them some use, I decided that this would be a good time to start. College is a little ways off for me, and I'm pretty sure my mom wont let me study music (strict traditional family). She wasn't too thrilled when my brother brought the turntables home and I think she had something to do with him never really getting in to it.

So my main question is: where do I start? What else do I need to get the turntables working ([close up](http://imgur.com/T8o7s))? Where can I find tutorials and instructions on how to use them? What do I need to have a complete (or basic working) setup? I'm interested in trying my hand at remixing existing songs (mostly from electronic music) so what type of programs should I look for? I mess around with music making programs (mostly audiotool app on google chrome) and I kind of have an idea on basic back beats. Where I get stuck is trying to lay down any sort of bass or synth. I asked a friend about it and all he told me was to get a keyboard. Plus I kind of feel like I'm cheating cause I'm using other people's samples and loops. I really want to be able to make my own.

I have a part-time job at minimum wage, but I don't have anything to use my money for except hanging out with friends. I'm willing to save stop spending and save up for whatever I need (or recommended). If some of you could just give me a push in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.

Does anybody have advice for how we can get from *messy* to *tight* as a group?  Practice recommendations as well as ways to couch this within the group are welcome.  (I'm not the guy in charge, but everybody knows we have this problem)

So when I was in my 15s I started playing guitar, probably spent like 20 years, played in a few bands, with friends, mostly metal.
For example Dimmu Borgir, Children of Bodom, Metallica, Megadeth, Opeth, etc.

Even if I was rhythm sometimes I would do some solos and of course in metal the rhythm guitar is quiet challenging so I don't think I played too bad.

So after I started working and going out with my gf, they closed the only bar where you could listen and potentially play metal, band just fell apart and I stopped. Then my guitar just got old, the ""arm"" was a bit twisted, paid someone to repair it but didn't work at the end.

After I broke up with my girlfriend and I am quiet tired from work, all this dreams I had about playing guitar came back to my mind and I kinda regret it, I want to start again.

Even if I feel motivated, just thinking I am in my early 30s and no band or any musician friends anymore (close to me), it just depress me.
I am rusty but still remember, just yesterday I played along with my iPod Nothing Else Matters.


Has anyone experienced this? How did you return to music?
Is it worth it when you are so old?

I wish I had the money to pursue Music instead of Computer Science back in my 20s but no school for that and not enough money to move :|

1. Basic Diatonic theory
2. CAGED positions, Minor Pentatonic Scale positions
3. Some of the arpeggio positions
4. A fair few chords here and there and when/where to play them
5. I know enough rhythmic drum stuff to get by

Basically, what I can do right now, is if I know you're playing chords in A Major, I can play the A Major scale all over the neck till the cows come home. I can switch to the relative minor (F#) and play the pentatonic scale all over the neck.

I'd like to also apologize in advance if this is in the wrong sub-reddit.

I played a semester of guitar back in 7th grade, and from what little I can remember, I did pretty decently.  But it was never my first choice of instrument.  Since then, I haven't touched a musical instrument for fear of being terrible at it, or not having enough time to dedicate to it, and other worries like that.  But I think it's time, honestly - I absolutely love classical music and instruments, and the violin and cello are some of my favorites to listen to.

Now, that begs the question of which would be easier on such a neophyte as myself to learn.  If anyone has any input, I'd sincerely appreciate it, whether it's input on my question, or input on starter instruments, how to learn, etc.

I've had my first music theory lesson and watched several hours of youtube cello lessons, but not signed up with any particular cello teacher yet.

I am looking to buy a Cello on somewhat of a budget, I'm starting a new college course this September and will have little income, but any reasonable amount is achievable in time (though the less it costs, the faster I'd be able to afford it and start lessons / playing).

I definitely want to buy one rather than rent one, as I'm determined to learn and keep at it, and wish to get used to my own cello.

So I've had several thoughts about buying the cheapest I could on Amazon ([This](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0012IK4SM/), £175 / $290~) - Though it wouldn't be a well known make / brand of instrument and so I'm hesitant to buy it.

Alternatively as far as branded instruments are concerned, I could pick up [this Stentor Student 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stentor-Student-Cello-Outfit-set/dp/B002IDF2NC/) for £360 / $595~

- I believe I'd need a 4/4 size (I'm over 6ft tall)
- Is there anything else I need? - I'll be buying a music stand and hard case, but a friend mentioned a device used to hold the tail spike in place (attached to your chair) so it doesn't fall over - what're these called, are they needed?
- Somebody on gumtree (uk version of craiglist) was selling a cello that included a humidity monitor, are they important?

It's started to bother me a lot lately when I am hearing these pieces and they stay locked in my head with no way out.

So that has led me here to ask for advice what to do in my position. I'd love to pick up an instrument or learn about music theory (if it is necessary), but going to a music school is out of the question as I am pursuing an engineering degree so I have very little time in my hands (and resources aswell). What would you do in my position and what would be a cheap and easy way to start learning music?

I have what could be viewed as a simple question but I feel it requires a bit of back story first.

I've been playing drums for about 7 years. With regards writing / coming up with new beats and fills, I've always been an advocate of sitting in front of the drum kit and playing to your hearts content. What I mean by this is that I would start with a simple beat, whatever beat my body started to play and work from there. This usually leads to a new type of beat that I would keep in my head until a melody the guitarist in whatever band i'm playing with comes out with. Some of my proudest creations have come from this method and i'm happy out with it. I do jam openly also, working from whatever instrument takes centre stage at the time.

I started playing guitar about 2 years ago and I feel the methodology that I use is not translating with it. I have come up with a few songs but mostly they start on what I would consider identical progressions and melodies from the ones before them. 

My practice lately has been focusing on basic music theory while trying to expand my pallet of chords. I have a working knowledge of open chords, bar chords, chord inversions, alternate tunings paired with finger picking and plectrum technique. Learning covers has helped this in a huge way from getting more comfortable with all mentioned above along with how songs are actually structured.

The question I have is, where can I go next? I may be trying to force ideas out which I know is no good. So on that vein, someone may be able to suggest a relaxation technique. Any help and suggestions at all would be hugely appreciated.

performing-Advice/Tips?",6,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/otojo/hard_of_hearing_and_passionate_about_music/,"I've always loved to perform in any way in front of people. I was in Theatre Arts in high school, and I'd submit my stories and poetry to the school newspaper and such. I'm creative. I can write, draw, and act.It's my passion. However, I've always wanted to really learn the piano, guitar, and fiddle (I'm an East Coast Canadian-It's a thing here). I had a guitar in high school, but I got too frustrated with never being able to be SURE that the guitar was in tune without an electronic tuner, and it's hard to read tabs that are meant for a right-handed player(I'm left-handed), so I eventually ended up selling it to a guy who already was skilled at guitar so it would be used. He still uses it to this day, thankfully.

For me, it seems to be more challenging since I am hard of hearing. I've been told that you're never too old to learn and get good at playing an instrument, so I'd like to get a guitar or something soon and try again, if I can. I know the ear can be trained to detect and identify different pitches and chords by ear, just as an artist's eyes can be trained to see light and shadow in a way which an untrained eye cannot. Also, deeper pitches are harder to pick up than higher pitches. Vocalists with deep voices are harder to hear, and high pitched vocalists are much easier. 

I am deaf in my right ear and I wear a hearing aid in my left, which has a moderate to severe hearing loss (about 50% of my hearing remains in that side), and with the hearing aid in, I can hear almost perfectly-about 85-90% (80&amp; of 100% with 100% being an ear with perfect hearing), but for some reason, with it in, I can't hear bass in music or television and without it I can hear the bass easily. It added a new dimension to music that I hadn't heard before, since I always used to wear it, and now I only wear it when I go out in public. The first time I heard bass on tv I thought the room was growling at me. It was kind of terrifying, lol. I can speak, communicate and read just like a hearing person, having lost my hearing at about four due to a virus called Cytomegalovirus. Usually, without the aid in, I can hear music and videos just fine as long as I turn the volume up a bit, but hearing the lyrics in most songs is almost always impossible, even with the volume all the way up. I think the music interferes with the vocals and I usually can't distinguish one from the other. Soft folksy songs are easier, though.

With all of this in mind, can I ever really be able to play an instrument at all? I can play piano already (although I put tape on the keys and mark each key-A,B,C,etc) but I love the guitar, violin and fiddle. Will I ever be able to play by ear? Reading sheet music or learning chords isn't too difficult, but tuning a guitar on my own is hard, especially since I never know if I'm hearing ""correctly"". I constantly second guess myself when it comes to playing entirely by ear.

Dominant 7's, diminished/augmented chords. Basically Jazz/Blues chord progressions. I'm so lost on this one. It seems to violate everything I know about staying in the key. 

The way I understand is a bit basic though. Basically avoid notes outside of the key unless it's in the root/relative minor's blues scale. I usually see pieces or songs trying to ""fit in"" the scale. So if a song is in the key of C, all of the chords in it should have all white keys. But in jazz, this doesn't seem to be the case.

Jazz chord progressions are so messy with all those dominant 7's and diminished chords. How does this stuff work? How do you improvise on this?",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_o2x94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/o2x94/dominant7_diminishedaugmented_chords_how_do_they/,

So, what methods have you guys used to increase your chances at sticking to it? Obviously it will all come down to motivation and willpower at the end of the day, but surely there are some pointers those that are beyond the beginners stage could share?

Edit:

Thanks a bunch for the responses so far, they're really helpful. So, from what I can tell, it looks like there are 2 general ""rules"" to follow:

1. Establish practice as a *habit*. Sound obvious, but I guess the key is consistency; make it so ingrained to practice that you do it automatically, and feel lazy when you don't. Just like brushing your teeth or any other ""automatic"" behavior.

2. Small, reasonable goals. Don't beat yourself up for not being Jemi Hendrix after a week. Again, obvious, but the main thing here is that it takes enough time to learn an instrument that it's easy to not realize you're making any progress at all. So force yourself into realizing that you *are* learning something by picking a small measurement.

Again, these things should almost go without asking, but it's helpful to know these are some common approaches/problems, and that we're not living in a vacuum.

I'm looking for a good practice program for keyboards. I've never taken lessons but I've played synths for about 10 years off and on. I generally pick a scale and learn some chords and experiment for awhile but I want to take it to the next level through a more pragmatic approach.

I think finger positioning and technique is more valuable than music theory at this point (which I have a basic grasp of).

For what it's worth, I like synthesizers a lot, and electric pianos, so traditional classical piano is pretty uninspiring to me. So anything relating more to jazz/rock/blues would be probably interest me more.

I'm guessing that means that every time I see an *F* I should play *F sharp*? However that just doesn't sound right. To me it seems like the first three notes the violin plays should be *F, A, F sharp*.

I've played guitar for about 6 months before and had a teacher, but I was pretty slow to pick up on it so I didn't learn much, and what I've learned I've already forgotten. My fingers never even developed a slight hint of callouses and it was very painful for me to hold down the strings.

I played clarinet back in elementary school, did pretty well with it from what I remember but had to give up after my cancer interrupting much of grade 6.

So while I like the sounds of guitar, I can't really handle the pain in the fingers thing - is that normal or do I have magical callous resistant skin?

I like woodwind instruments too but I don't know which would be easiest to pick up on.

I also like pianos, but they're a pretty hefty investment, right?

When I was younger I couldn't tell you if it was a major or a minor chord I was hearing (when other people seemed to be fully able to), and very recently I didn't do much better than a dice at telling wether the interval I was hearing was an octave, a perfect fifth or a major third\*. I'm also terrible at remembering how songs go.

I have trouble recognising consonance and dissonance, so most of the music making I've done so far is by strictly following the few theoretical ""rules"" I know, but that doesn't help much when it comes to impromptu playing.

Despite all this, I love music, and I would love to be able to play it on my own. I used to play the piano while reading sheet music, but I never were able to develop my ear then. Now that I'm older and playing around with my guitar (and recently a harmonica) I feel like my lack of relative pitch is severely limiting me.

I don't like to think I'm tone deaf in the medical sense, but I sure am darn close. What are the things I could do to improve this situation? I feel like a graphical designer with colour blindness and it's been haunting me since I was very young. Every music learning material seems to assume a normal relative pitch, i.e. they assume you can hear when things are dissonant and correct yourself based on that.

I understand I might not have said everything I should say, so ask any questions if you need clarification.

So I've known for a while now that I should get into transcribing but I just can't seem to get myself to do it. I know of the benefits, but so far trying to convince myself of this has gotten me nowhere.

My musical background: started off learning some classical tunes on keyboard, then videogame tunes and then more classical and videogame stuff. By and large everything is written down so there was no need to learn by ear. But now the habits of yesteryear is really stunting my musical growth, and I would love a way out of this quandary.

So to those of you who transcribe regularly/semi-regularly, what do you think helps? How can I ease myself into making this a regular habit without feeling that it's going to be too hard? (I can already feel the tension in my neck)

As I mentioned, I'm a COMPLETE noob/beginner. I don't even think I count as a beginner because I've yet to begin anything. I *really* want to learn an instrument though. I'm leaning towards keyboard/synth. I love electronic music (dubstep, minimal, electro house, progressive trance) and I hope that doesn't get me yelled at. 

As far as I understand, a synthesizer actually creates the sound you program while a keyboard is basically... a thin piano? If that's true, although i've undoubtedly made it sound simplistic and stupid, I think I'd like to learn how to play the synth. Please feel free to rip me a new one regarding synth vs. piano though; there's no better way for me to learn. 

Also, a few questions:

What is the best way to go about learning how to play for a total beginner?

Where are synths nowadays on the music scene?

I can handle the piano, and I wish to tackle the melodica to fill my need for an inexpensive, portable acoustic keyboard. But, I can't find a teacher or any source material and am struggling on my own.

One thing I notice is that I sound awful playing with two hands, because the way the air splits between the reeds makes the harmonic accompaniment drown out the melody. Also, chords in general sound monotone and there's some interference between the reeds.

So, my questions are:

1. Is it possible (feasible?) to play the melodica with two hands at all?
2. Is it possible (feasible?) to play intervals at all? 
3. Following from #1 and #2, does sustain have a place in melodica playing?
4. What are other expressive devices to explore on the melodica? 

Thank you so much in advance.

Due to this, it is often potentially easy to get lost for a rhythm section member, as nearly all his eyes can follow is a staff full of slashes - this rings especially true for pieces with few chord changes or somewhat static harmony, and nearly always for almost-fully improvised drum set parts (in some cases, I've actually decided to include chord symbols in the drum set part to help out the poor drummer). 

Would a dedicated cue staff for parts with this problem be a bad idea? What do you think? Perhaps I'm being ignorant while this actually is a common solution? Also, music of the classical tradition is not necessarily excepted from this problem. For instance: I can't imagine how it'd be to play the snare drum part of Ravel's Bolero without some kind of cue staff or written-in cues along the way (I can't find the percussion parts of this piece on imslp, making me unwillingly ignorant of how this problem was solved - or not solved).",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_146bng,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/146bng/scoring_including_a_dedicated_cue_staff_in_parts/,

- I don't really intend to be in a band, being 35 and married and all that, but there is always a chance for an old boys hobby band, and given that singing, guitar and drums is something I don't want, keyboards can always be used

- We plan kids and all that, in a fairly small apartment, I can't drum up the place or something, but playing something soft, soothing on a keyboard on low volume is something that is rarely disturbing others, right?

- I have heard it is not hard, it is individual songs that are easy or hard. That matters because I am not very good at sustaining effort if I am not rewarded by intermediate successes. I have heard that there are really easy songs (maybe nursery rhymes or something) any beginner can learn in a few hours and have an instant sense of accomplishing something which fuels us to go on.

- As far as I have heard, the keyboard and the piano is basically musical theory embodied. So it will make me get musical theory, because I don't get it.

- I am a really good typist. Does that help?

Are these good reasons?

Reservations: we don't have much space. Can I learn on a small one I can put in my lap or put on the dinner table then put away when we eat?

So what I would like to ask is:

- Recommendation for a lap-top instrument. Small, lightweight, cheap, good for learning, focus modern music, rock, electronica. Something Amazon is willing to deliver to Central Europe, being on amazon.de would be a huge bonus. Something with ""automatic rythms"" and ""single-finger chords"", whatever that means, because the book below demands that. Maybe something a pro would describe as a ""compact travel keyboard""?

- A good book that gets motivation and motivates you with instant successes. Like learning a nursery rhyme fast. A book that also gets modern music, that people today like rock and electronica, and learning Auld Lang Syne is not really interesting anymore. A book that Amazon will deliver to Central Europe. (Austria).

So I'm new. Like, very new. I have almost no background in music at all, other than an intense love of it from a listener perspective and a little background in guitar. I also have a background in circuit bending, so I have a good idea of how both analogue and digital synths work.

BUT I WANT TO MAKE SOME MUSIC SO HERE'S MY IDEA.

I want to stick to completely (or almost completely) to a hardware set-up for live performances. I realize that that is difficult, but I'd like live shows to be primarily improvised. The project is going to take influence from noise/industrial (merzbow, boredoms, front 242, skuppy), breakbeat (Altern8, Prodigy), and experimental/chill (808 State, **** Buttons). Other buzzwords could include loops, samples, glitch, ambiance, trap, quiet-loud dynamics.

This is my first endeavor into live sound, so bear with me and feel free to snicker, but this is how I visualize a live set-up:

[circuitbent sk-1]+[Monotron]+[TR-808 clone]+[one other synth] ----&gt; [mixer] ----&gt; [loop pedal] ----&gt; [PA]

The things explicitly mentioned are the pieces I'm already rocking. I have a bunch of other circuitbent things that can and will be used from time to time.

So does this work? Essentially I would have preset patches and rhythm sequences stored, ready to go whenevs. I'd layer things in and out via the mixer and looper.

My second question regards the [one other synth]. In my price range [which does not include true analogue :P] I have narrowed it down to the Roland Jx 305, the Roland Gaia, Roland SH-32, or the trustworthy micoKORG. Perhaps even the Realistic Concertmate MG-1? What are general experiences like? After listening to sound reviews, I still can't decide. Are any of these better than the others for the sound I'm trying to achieve?

I'm sorry for the lengthy post, and thank you for reading! ",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_19ho47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/19ho47/newbie_synthesist_looking_for_advise_regarding/,

***********************************************

Hey guys,

 I'm a guitarist and a web developer and created this to scratch my own itch. I hope you guys find it useful too. My primary problems/wishes that Gitori solves are:

1) Improving on the metronome. The most popular piece of advice I've gotten for improving technique is to use a metronome and start slowly, gradually increasing tempo. 
   I did this for many months and found the constant Metronome-tweaking to be annoying. I wanted an auto-pilot Metronome. Gitori is my attempt at an autopilot metronome.

2) I find practicing exercises/scales to be a bit boring. Especially taking the extra effort to practice everything in multiple keys

3) I lack the discipline to fix a minimum warmup period before trying to play faster. Having the whole practice workout laid out in front of me forces me to adhere.

4) My exercises and practice material are not organized in the same place. I have an ad-hoc collection of bookmarks/emails/books/CDs/PDFs  Gitori allows me to create my own exercises and put all of them in one place.

5) I would like to track my progress by looking at data. I wanna know how long I practiced last week/month. Was I able to consistently practice 5 days a week last month? Can I play faster than I could a month ago?

The app works best in Chrome but it is functional in FF and Safari. I have no idea if it works in IE. 
I'm looking forward to your feedback.

My problem is that it's just soooo boring. I want to transcribe songs and chords and orchestral concerts and sweet synthesizer patterns, but I just can't bear to learn intervals ad nauseam.

How did you do it? What was your learning process? When could you hear melodies and chords?

----

Here are my failed attempts so far.

1. I have done a few computer exercises on recognizing single intervals and get to a 60% recognition rate, but it doesn't seem to be very effective. I have the suspicion that learning individual intervals doesn't actually help me, because real music is too fast to pick out individual intervals anyway. It is easier to recognize the overall sound of the pentatonic than to recognize its individual intervals.
2. If anything, it seems to be more useful to memorize common melodic patterns, like C E G, C D Eb and so on. I found a nice book that contains a CD with basic folk songs. My task is to sing them along and transcribe them. This works much better for me, but the problem is that I'm a bad singer. I stopped doing these transcriptions for now, because I end up trying everything at the piano anyway, which is very exhausting and probably defeats the point.
3. Hence, I'm learning to sing. (My first instrument is the piano.) Actually, I'm learning guitar first, because I need a source of correct pitches, but the piano is ""too precise"" for me to sing along to. Singing to guitar chords is better for me as I can hear when I'm not on pitch, but I still have to imagine the correct pitch myself.


There you have it. I'm learning guitar in the hope of getting better at ear training, but while this is useful and fun, my whole approach seems a little ""roundabout"", to say the least. How did you do it?

Because of this experience today, I've decided to buy a 3 string Mountain Dulcimer tomorrow.

My question is, when tuning to GCG, how do I do it? Do I tune the first string up or down? I'm pretty sure the second and third strings get tuned up one step, but that first string seems like such a big jump from D to G and I don't want to break a string the first day I have it. Also, I could be wrong on the tuning. I tuned my guitar to open c to try and play the song I played today and it sounds very similar.

I took a video of me playing it so I could remember the little song. If it helps someone figure out the exact tuning, I could upload the video and post a link.

However, now that the training is getting harder, I'm noticing that I can't really identify a certain note with a particular note in the pentagram, or at least not outside the boundaries of those 14 first keys.

My problem is: I'm still picking songs at a good rate, but that's because I'm learning how to play by heart - I use the stave at first to see which notes should I play (this is a painfully slow process, in which I usually go note by note until I find the right one), but after enough practice I don't need the notes anymore (but if you show me a random part of the song and say ""play this"", I'd have to stop and think a long time about what I'm reading).

Now, my question is: is this the regular way of learning? Or am I ""cheating"", as I'm playing songs without really making the association between note and key? On one hand, I think that maybe I'll eventually learn all notes (as I'm still relatively new), but OTOH I'm not really sure about how that would happen if I'm not really thinking about the notes. Could you tell me about your experience, redditors?

Here's the kicker... 


I got into music as a drummer(took a few years of lessons), so before taking these theory courses I only knew of the very basics such as note names and enharmonic equivalents, duration &amp; time sig etc... 


After completing this 2 year program, I feel very confident in my theory skills and have been putting a lot of time into applying the techniques to the piano &amp; other instruments. I really want to start applying what I've learned and start teaching students.  My problem is that I'm not a superb piano player...

I'm just not a fluid player that has the ability to sight read that great(I can do it, it just takes time).

I'm a compostion student/violinist/redditor/aspiring teacher who has become much too familiar with expensive and overly dense music theory textbooks, from the basic books about notation to University-level texts on counterpoint/harmony/ear-training. I have read and absorbed many university textbooks on the same subjects. I'm also involved with the relatively new subreddit, /r/sightsinging .

To cut to the chase, I have recently been planning out a textbook covering basic ear training, and building a repertoire of original exercices, melodies and examples to support the text. The book covers basic theory - ranging from treble/bass clef reading to common-practice chord construction and identification.

I also will be covering sight-reading melodies, from simple scales to complex, modulatory affairs (I will not be venturing into atonal melodies). I also was thinking of building a youtube channel with tutorials on basic sight-reading and aural training which could accompany the book.

All in all, I'm preparing to write a textbook, as close as I can get to the professional University-level books.

I would be publishing the book via web, for an estimated 10-20 $. My goal is to offer high-quality material at a very low price compared to the published texts such as the Berkowitz, Schacter and the like. I am also trying to gear the material towards a very large audience, from casual musicians that want to know a bit more about the music to which they listen to the aspiring professional who wants to self-teach.

I am in the beginning stages of this project (planning stage) - this is why I'm turning to as many people as I can for opinions on whether the demand exists for such a product. Does this project sound interesting? Do you have any suggestions or questions relating to the material, distribution or design? Any comments? Encouragement/hatemail? I would like to know everyone's opinion on the viability of my endeavour. I was thinking of also starting work on the project, and coming back when I have something to show for my efforts. Would that be a good idea?

Thank for your opinion,

TP (wonderful initials.)

I've recently acquired about 2 spare hours a day, give or take, and I'd like to finally learn.

I'm sure it's been asked a thousand times before, so I'll try to keep things short and sweet.

My older brother is a long-time guitar player. He plays mostly older tunes like Cash, Nirvana, Zeppelin, and writes his own. I'd like to be able to play with him... but at the same time I want to avoid playing the guitar. I understand it may be the most efficient instrument choice for my interests, but I just do not want a guitar. Hands down. No contest. (Other stringed instruments are definitely up for grabs)

----------------

About me:
I'm 22, Male, have long skinny fingers, and what you might call ""Left Hand Stupid"" -- I just don't know what to do with it. My one experience with Piano left me staring at it wondering if it was even attached to my body. Oh, but on the bright side I've had several musical friends, as well as two music professors tell me I have something called *Perfect Pitch*. Whatever that means.

---------------------

This is what I'm looking for in an instrument

* Not a Guitar

* Time to become proficient not an eternity and a half (I'm looking at you, Sitar)

* Doesn't sound like a quartet of dying felines after months of play

* Can be played alongside a guitar easily (I'm guessing something in the key of C)

* Portable -- Something I can take down to the park, or maybe even a street corner on a lazy day and just share my music.

* Can easily play music like Cash, Zeppelin, Nirvana, Celtic/Irish, Sea Shanties, Classical (Beethoven, Bach, Grieg) 
and the like... (I'll link a couple of my favorite songs that I'd like to be able to play parts of)

* Can be sung along with, or can sing while playing it (though I'm not completely closed to the idea of something like a flute)

* Can be self taught (though I intend to take lessons, I'd like to be able to progress at home as well)

* Can be commercially purchased (So no ""by-order-only"" instruments like a lute)

Sorry for such a long list... I figure, the more specific I am, the more accurate and relevant advice that can be given.

I'm not gonna just go out and buy the first instrument I see. I want to play around with several before committing to anything. That's why I've come here to narrow down my options...

As promised, here are a few links to songs I'd like to be able to learn/play

* [Float, Flogging Molly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PmyAfQ5xY&amp;ob=av2n)

* [The Goblin's Riddle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSdJjNzzBUk)

It consists of a Root, Perfect 5th, and a Major 7th.

It's like a Major 7th chord minus the Major third.

It has no octaves and it takes the power chord shape if your root is on the 4th string.

I'm a music teacher who has always focused on wind instruments and piano.  I majored in saxophone, have played piano for over 25 years, and am decent to good on all wind instruments.  I took classes in college on how to play/teach string instruments, and I own a violin that was my grandfathers.

As I mentioned, I'm a music teacher and went through a music conservatory, so my skills are top notch -- I just have a specific question regarding shifting and positions.

For some reason I can't wrap my head around the concept.  Are there any resources or websites you would recommend to help learning the concept behind shifting?  Or is it as simple as just memorizing the notes for each string?  I have a couple books on shifting, but it still eludes me a bit.

So I was playing my junky violin (open A) and I started to notice extra higher pitch notes being generated. So I muted the D string with a free finger, and one of them went away, and then I muted the E with another free finger and the other went away, now the A plays nice and clean.

What would cause this problem, just the harmonics of A causing the D and E to resonate? Could it be crappy strings? Crappy wood? A combination of crappiness? It is a cheap violin after all.

Anyways, I temporarily solved the problem by tying a sock around the very top and it touches the strings just below the top nut. Seems to have cleaned the sound up quite nice, except the sock sorta smells (it is an old sock), lol.

Anyways, I believe the the strings are solid core strings, I think I might get some new strings, there is a local music store that has D'Addario Prelude Violin Strings (medium tension) for $20. Although I have a feeling that they won't really help, it doesn't hurt to try.

Edit: Also, I thought about getting a new bridge, I measured mine, and from the violin surface to the top of the bridge is 37mm. That seems kinda high, so I guess this would be a high bridge, and I have been doing a lot of reading about these cheap violins and most people suggest getting a medium bridge instead (as well as new strings).

I started playing the saxophone in high school. I loved band and jazz band, but I'm not sure if it was because of the horn that I was playing or just the sense of camaraderie and belonging that came along with it. My sophomore year I got a new band director and I couldn't stand him, so after two years of band I quit. Music never left my side, but it was usually more on the listening end than on the playing end. Jazz, metal, funk, rock... I'd listen to anything, but most of it had horns in it.


After college I decided that I wanted to get back into music. About a year and a half ago I saved up big for my own saxophone and put a big effort into it. I took lessons for an hour a week, I practiced every day for 45 minutes to an hour and a half, and I joined the community band. 

That lasted about six or seven months. 

In February, a guitar player friend of mine let me play his bass for a little while and I loved it. I bought one, and now I'm picking up the bass all the time just to play around with it. Even when I have the sax and the bass both on stands next to each other, 19/20 times I'll pick up the bass. And I realized that most of the music that I listen to has both a cool horn line and a cool bass line.

I'm considering selling the saxophone and using the money to a) help move in the next few months and b) save for an upright bass. In fact, I've had an offer for $2500 for it. Here's my concern: Saxes, especially baritones (which is what I play), are not cheap. Mine was about $4500 new*, which makes the problem twofold: first, the offer that I've been given is a LOT less than what I paid for it, and I'd hate to lose that much money in such a short time; secondly, I know that if I do change my mind again later down the road, there's no way that I could afford another baritone. A tenor, maybe, but there's something about the baritone that's just so full of power that a tenor just can't replicate.

So I have a question for you, reddit. When do you know that an instrument just isn't for you, even if you want it to be? Do you think this is a case of me romanticizing the saxophone because it was my first instrument?

first of, I started learning music theory like 4 days ago when I asked for help because my (computer) production sucks so much and I was uninspired. People recommended learning music theory and I quite frankly am having a blast so far.

So now I was playing around on my tiny keyboard and I discovered a scale by trial and error that just sounded right:

C D Eb F G Ab Bb

I suspected this to be a minor scale because it just sounds like one so I asked Google and sure enough, this is C minor, or C melodic minor to be precise.

I also found that melodic minors are played differently when played in descending order.

Now my question: Do you have to do it? Why do you do it at all? I played ""my"" scale up and down and it sounded pretty cool (use a patch with reverb, very somber and disctreet), but I didn't feel the need to play the sixth and seventh in their natural form.

So yeah, why do you do that. What is that scale called if I don't care about the playing order?",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_1epbhy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/1epbhy/i_seem_to_have_discovered_a_melodic_minor_and_i/,

I'd like to know if it's ""just me"", or if anyone else has gone through this, and successfully gotten past it and experienced the flash of enlightenment when it suddenly all makes sense.

The problem, in a nutshell, is that I'm finding myself involuntarily, but quite violently, rejecting what I'm studying, like a failed organ transplant. I just can't get it to go in, when what I read so starkly contradicts everything I already know, or think I know. And these contradictions seem so obvious to me, that I'm left mystified that no one seems to talk about them.

If it helps, I come from a computer science background, and while I could never claim to be an expert or even noteably talented at software, or logic or mathematics, my education and experiences have fostered a certain understanding of the world that seems, at least at this point, to be fundamentally incompatible with music theory. If I want to continue, it looks like I'm just going to have to force myself to swallow a choking gob of cognitive dissonance, and accept things as true that just outright defy logic.

A couple examples.

I crack open a book about music theory, and amid the beginner's tedium about clefs and staffs, there's always the gloss over what seems to me to be the huge elephant in the corner -- why on earth does an *oct*ave bear no relation to the number eight? An octave has an even logarithmic division of **twelve** notes, and out of those, **seven** (why not six, or an even divisor of twelve?) have for some reason been arbitrarily chosen as more important than the other five, and have been given letter names. How it's possible to simply blow past this without addressing how crazy it obviously would seem to the uninitiated and explaining how it is supposed to make sense ... I automatically and reflexively lose respect for what I'm reading, that this isn't even discussed.

I then almost invariably read that a note ""sounds the same"" as a note of the same letter in octaves above or below it. Incredibly, many texts will even go so far as to refer to these as the *same note*. Now we've progressed from nonsense to actual falsehood. Two different ""A""s don't sound the same; they don't even sound similar. If they did, **a piano would only need twelve keys.** One A might be 440Hz, the other 880Hz -- how can they be said to sound the same? Of course because one is an even multiple of the other's frequency, they do combine in a manner different from other pairs of notes, and so they do have a special relationship with each other, and could be said to be compatible or interchangeable in certain passages. But to claim that they sound the same without immediately following with how and why you've chosen to redefine the word ""same"" for your own purposes -- this isn't just crazy, it's saying something that *simply isn't true*.

""Officer, 88 miles per hour is the same as 44 miles per hour; my engine was making the same sound at double the RPM. So you see, I was actually obeying the 45mph speed limit here.""

Generally, music theory seems rife with a very common flaw in human reasoning that in computer science is called the **off-by-one error**. If music really is an ""arithmetic exercise of the soul"" as Leibniz suggested, it's the primitive, crippled proto-arithmetic with which humanity suffered before the invention of the zero.

Are there any books or other learning resources out there for people who are stuck at the beginning like I am, and won't accept weird ideas with a handwave? Any tips for those who have the peculiar demand that in order to learn about something, the things we're told about it have to make sense, and actually be true?

It has helped calming me down when things got too hectic in life, and it actually convinced me of relearning the piano. The problem is, I can't find sheet music for it anywhere, and I'm not very good at playing by the ear.

Got no response other than a single downvote there so I guess this type of question is better suited for here? I hope?  Anyway..

Hi ~~r/musictheory~~ r/learnmusic!  I'm an amateur piano player and I'm trying to learn [This Will Be Our Year by The Zombies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf7wRe4AUtU).

The chords for most of the song are listed online, and I have all of those down.  The bridge (""and I won't forget""...) seems to be tabbed incorrectly everywhere I've checked.  It's listed as ""B Dm A B Dm D E"", but I feel like the Dm should be Bdim.  At least, I play Bdim and it sounds right. 

 But my bigger issue is later on in the song.  There is a piano solo about 50 seconds in with some chords that I can't pick out.  I can play single notes along with it but it doesn't sound quite right.  Can anyone identify the chords? Or am I hearing things?

Also I'd be interested to know some of the theory behind the chord progressions in this song - they seem pretty unique, but I don't know enough music theory to really analyze them.  This is actually one of my favorite songs ever so the more I know about it the better :) 

---

---


The other question I had was about a chord progression I came up with. I don't know the notation for the last 2 chords (which is partially why I'm asking about it):

C Fm CDF FGB

I actually got the idea to use the ""CDF"" and ""FGB"" chords from a section of [Mozart's Piano Sonata in F about 1:15 in](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grVHXLY5cM8).

Any insight as to why this progression works? (or at least, why I think it works?)  And what are these mysterious chords?

I've been told that, for an absolute beginner, the two things to pay attention to when buying your first keyboard are how many keys (61) and whether or not the keys are touch-sensitive.

I've also been told that Yamaha generally makes quality keyboards. So these are the two that I am looking to order at the moment.

As for my current interests, I've been playing around with software like Adobe Audition and Fruity Loops Studio, so I'll potentially want a MIDI device down the road (I don't think either of these actually have that capability), but at the moment I just want to learn the instrument as a total novice.

Anything under $250 or so is within my range.

Any advice very appreciated.

Edit: After asking around, I'm now somewhat worried that neither of these models have a pitch-modulation wheel.

The more I read, the more I'm confused. Are all electronic keyboards with USB capability essentially MIDI controllers? Or is there a division, because I keep reading the the great majority of MIDI controllers can't produce sound themselves?

It takes a lot of time and practice to get it sounding perfect like that (and did a mention patience?). Well the reason why I'm writing this tutorial is cause I want everyone to know how to make that perfect beat. You need a program that can at least go up to 5000bpm (you don't want to go over 5000bpm cause that will crash your computer) You need a gabba kick sample pack, a few good snares and claps, a delay vst, a chorus vst, a reverb vst, and lots of distortion. the trick behind creating those hard beats is setting your main mixer channel up with your distortion vst. Use 3 tracks for the gabba kicks, 1 with chorus, 1 with reverb and 1 with delay. then mix it up with a WTF BOOM sample to amaze your audience. I'm currently making an album for reddit to show everyone how awesome splittercore can be. Artists like me deserve to be heard. Also you can download breakbeats and play them in reverse, and you can use popular tv theme songs and mix them up with some crazy claps. I always have a fun time when making splittercore, and it really shows, when I play my splittercore music at clubs people know I had fun making these tracks, and they dance to it. I wish I could share everything here, I will though, this is just my 2nd lesson, It will take some time to teach you everything there is to know about splittercore. So keep following my lessons and become a great splittercore producer.

Listen to some of my tracks, play them in slowmotion to hear how the rhythm works: [Bill Splitter Preston - Dramamine Lovecore](http://soundcloud.com/bsplitterp/bill-splitter-preston-dramamine-lovecore), [Mirror](http://www.ourstage.com/tracks/GNXLTFFMAXYO).

Once you're done with that experiment with various speeds. (if the gabber kicks start sounding like a drill use variation of the Wilhelm scream followed by wtf boom)
You can adjust the pitch of your kicks to create melody and you can add delay to make it more epic.

Tell me if this was helpful and if you want to know more I'm willing to answer questions.

My friend has always wanted to learn to play an instrument, but has always hated the idea of being classified as a musician (our school has more than a few extremely bad guitar players who won't admit it).  He had only really thought about guitar until now, but while going through his basement he found his answer: the accordion!  He decided to start learning this summer, and appears to be serious about it.

Now, I decided to learn an instrument parallel to him, so we could both go through those floundering stages (where the instrument is still ""too"" hard to play but you've already put in alot of time) together.  But in order to play with an accordion, I decided that I would need something equally outlandish.  I was originally going to learn to play the ukelele (not quite as rare as an accordion but that's besides the point), but in the closet of our music room I found a baritone ukelele.  The music teacher said he had forgotten it was even there: I could have it!

So now I come to you, /r/Learnmusic: any advice? Fun songs to play? Difference between normal uke and bari-uke? Difficulty of playing? I admit that I have not done much research.

Thanks in advance!",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_buwee,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/buwee/tips_for_learning_baritone_ukelele/,

If there is a book or online source, please leave me your suggestions. Sources on music in general and those specifically for the piano are equally important, as I need to gain knowledge about both. I figured it would be easier on me and my future instructor if I learned how to read music and had a basic understanding of it so I'm not paying to be taught the extreme basics.


Lastly, I would like to purchase a electronic keyboard to get started so I can practice in my apartment. Any suggestions on a good brand or model that is around (or less than) $150. I'm up for using Craigslist or eBay for a used version of a good keyboard.

I was going to buy one from a friend, but his cousin got precedent over me.

I have almost no money to buy one, $120 ($160 at most if I can sell my backup camera). So I decided to hit up eBay to find an chinese el cheapo and I found a brand being sold by various people called ViolinSmart, reviews weren't all that bad, usually saying they are good for beginners, and that is it, which is fine with me. 

So I find one particular seller who isn't in china or south-east asia, and he/she is selling one model of ViolinSmart which looks really nice, so I decide hey I should just get one of those, they have multiple colours and I am browsing them, when I notice something strange.

They essentially have 4 colours for the style of Violin that I am going to buy: White, Pink, Baby Blue, and Black. The shitty thing is that the Black violin is 30% more simply because it is black! I mean wtf! That really pisses me off, and if I was Johnny 5, Oscar would be a dead man!

I just needed to vent. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2rgto,False,,,True,t3_bljjf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Learnmusic/comments/bljjf/a_premium_on_black/,
