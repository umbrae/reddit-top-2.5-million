You guys have been such a supportive community for me, and I'm proud to be an /r/longboarding member, so I figured you guys deserved it first.  I was completely taken aback by the amount of positive feedback and attention the video received, all your compliments made me unbelievably happy, and proud of the work I've put in to skate at the level I am. So thanks guys and gals, seriously you guys made my day, week, month, year. 

But sadly, I, in my finals addled mush brain state, posted the video to the wrong youtube channel.  It was meant to go on Blue Sky Longboards new youtube channel, I posted it to the old one.  **It racked up *2k views in the first 24 hours*, way more than I ever thought possible.** Sadly I had to take it down and re-upload it to  Blue Sky's New Channel, plumeting those views into the depths of the internet graveyard, and making the link I posted completely void. 

**So, I figured I'd do a self post, post the new link for people that haven't seen it yet/want to watch it again.**

So here it is:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA209oJGzsw&amp;feature=youtu.be

Thanks for all your support guys, I'm still in shock from yesterday.  I couldn't do it without you guys.  /r/longboarding forever.

edit: Holy shit Reddit. You guys seriously are amazing. Beyond words right now..

All i can say is thanks, and keep it fast and fakie!

Much love,

Double edit: I keep checking back on this periodically from my paper, and I just don't know what to say.  I know these edits sound babbled and shit, but seriously this outpouring of support is so awesome, i just can't thank you guys enough.  I'm dumbfounded.  Thank you all so so much. 

**Triple dog edit:  I've been getting alot of PMs and some comments with questions about tricks, skating, the video production and life in general.  I'm incredibly busy with a 15 page paper (the life of an english major) and can't properly answer them now.  *Would there be any interest in an AMA at a later date that I could answer all these questions fully?* I don't want to short change anyone with brief/incomplete answers to questions cause I'm busy.  If there is, I'll gladly do one.

As I write this, we have 1664 lines of code making /r/longboarding the way it is today. That's 592 more than it was yesterday. It's been a dreadfully slow process, but I really hope those 600 or so lines make a marked difference!

The mod team been working over the past few months to make a few major changes to the way /r/longboarding works, with the aim of improving the experience for everyone - and we sincerely hope this does so!

For our mobile app users - sorry, but very little of this is going to apply to you. We can't change your experience at all - so if you'd like to see the changes, feel free to jump onto a computer sometime and check it out!

In this post, I'm going to go through most of the features that have been changed/added - as always, if you'd like to look at the code, it's always available [HERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/about/stylesheet)

***
***
***

####***1. Sidebar buttons***

This has undergone some major changes in the past while - from the previous wall of text, to some icon-based boxes, all the way through the current iteration. With a small icon and then text, it's a lot easier to see what each button is for - especially when browsing on touch devices!

Our entire sidebar has been moved over to the wiki - which means that we have a lot more characters to play with, as well as some cool organisational stuff. Have a click through the buttons and see what you can find!

Also new are the ***""Newbie""*** and ***""Rules""*** Buttons. We're hoping that placing these front and centre will aid in reducing the number of frustratingly basic questions we get - as well as providing an resource easily accessible resource for you to show others who might need help!

The wiki is going to be an ever-changing collection of pages - so check back every now and then to see what's been added!

***
***

####***2. Flairs***

This might not come into effect for a few days yet (see section below for more) but eventually, you'll see a number of coloured lines popping up at the side of posts. Hover over the line and a popup will appear, telling you the type of post that each one is!

Check out /r/longboardingcsstest if you'd like to see the system in action!

***
***

####***3. Flair Filtering and the Robot Apocalypse***

In [THE SURVEY](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1dmo28/meta_rlongboarding_problems_solutions_and/) that was conducted 2 months ago, we got a whole lot of *very* interesting information about /r/longboarding's likes and dislikes, and came to the conclusion that there's a *really* wide range of opinions on most topics.

Because of this, I've implemented a small filtering system that users who dislike a certain kind of post can use to 'filter' out. It's based on flairs, so it may take a few days to get into action - but hopefully it'll be useful for those of you wish to get rid of some of those posts. It's not a fantastic solution, but it's the best one I've been able to find so far!

Oh, and the Robot Apocalypse? Well, we've enlisted the help of the very talented /u/Automoderator, who's going to be lessening our workload by automatically flairing some posts. Want to help him do his job? Here's a few tips...

* Include the word *""HELP""* in all help posts
* Include the words *""QUIVER,"" ""BOARD,""* or *""DECK""* in all quiver/gear posts

This is really just a test, and if it's not working out, our bot friend may be relegated to a different job - but I'm hoping that it works out!

***
***

####***4. Rules***

Rules. They're not much fun, but they are necessary! We've tried to make them as friendly as possible, so check them out! These will serve as a resource for us moderators when deciding whether posts should be deleted or not.

That said, please remember that the moderators of /r/longboarding reserve the right to moderate posts and comments at our own discretion - sometimes, situations arise that are not covered by the rules, and we need to make executive judgements. Hopefully this won't happen too often!

***
***

####***5. ""READ THE SIDEBAR"" Reminders***

In v2.0, we had a number of reminders throughout the subreddit - all of which were fairly intrusive, none of which I was particularly happy with. With our new-and-improved sidebar, I think that we can safely say that those are no longer necessary - so I've removed them all, save for one simple reminder on the [submit page](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/submit?selftext=true).

***
***

####***6. Link Info***

Normally, the box at the right of any post that displays upvotes, downvotes and a shortlink looks like [THIS.](http://i.imgur.com/8pe1qDz.png) Check out the new version!

Disclaimer: I didn't code this - it was stolen almost in its entirety from the CSS template, ['Edurne'](/r/Edurne)

***
***

####***7. Selection***

Not really important, but a bit of fun - try selecting some text!

###^^GREEEEEN!

***
***
***

The rest of that code was a whole lot of backend stuff that's gonna help *us* out as moderators - but together, I'm hoping it makes up a package that makes /r/longboarding a better place for everyone!

Feel free to give your feedback in the comments below ([previous feedback session](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1ferwt/rlongboarding_v30_we_need_you_upvote_for/)) - this is *your* subreddit, after all!

1370016102.0,271,self.longboarding,1ferwt,/r/longboarding v3.0 - WE NEED YOU! (Upvote for Visibility),299,28,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1ferwt/rlongboarding_v30_we_need_you_upvote_for/,"Hello!

Over the past little while, we've been working to mitigate a few of the problems /r/longboarding has been facing. With a [vast range of opinions](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1dmo28/meta_rlongboarding_problems_solutions_and/)  on help posts, memes and quiver posts, it's always impossible to keep *everyone* happy.

That said, we'd like to try our best to get pretty close to that!
***
With that, I'd like to announce what *could* be /r/longboarding's new direction!

###/r/longboardingcsstest

Here's some of the changes that we're considering.

Please note that the reason we're posting this is because we'd love some feedback! This is *your* subreddit, after all!

***

####**1. Sidebar**

*Woah, dude.*

The most instantly noticeable change, I've completely recoded the sidebar to an icon/wiki-based system. What does this mean? Well, hopefully, it's a much more appealing sidebar than the current one! 

With a new section aimed *entirely* at beginners (and its own dedicated, big fat green button), we're hoping that newbies to this subreddit can check those helpful guides out before posting questions!

The wiki-based system also means that when users ask questions, you can link them straight to the relevant sections!

&gt;&gt; wat wheeels r best 4 a begginner? i want 2 slide

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboardingcsstest/wiki/beginnerguide#wiki_wheels) handy guide to slide wheels! Hope that helps you out!

***
The wiki system also means that it's *really* easy to change and add bits (unlike reddit's 6-month limit on editing/replying to posts), so this isn't a static resource at all. I'll be updated accordingly as each years' new gear is released!
***
***
####**2. Flairs**
See those coloured things at the front of many of the posts? Try hovering over one of them. Cool!

This is a system that's gonna help us to categorise more posts, but, more importantly, it's necessary for the next change you may have noticed...
***
***
####**3. Post Filtering**
See those little icons in the sidebar, above the 'Newbiew' button? They're not just for decoration. By clicking on them, you'll be able to filter out certain kinds of posts! At the moment, we have filters to hide...

* Memes
* Help Posts
* Quiver Posts

We can always add or remove options later on, but those seemed to be the primary complaints! 

While this solution isn't perfect, and the posts will still show up on [your front page,](http://reddit.com/) hopefully it'll allow those users who *really* disliked certain content to avoid it.

***
***
####**4. Rules**
Ah, rules. No one really likes them, but they're a necessary evil! We've tried to be fair with these, but we're open to input! Feel free to have a read through, by clicking on the dedicated button in the sidebar of /r/longboardingcsstest.
***
***

That's it for now. While there's a whole lot of other changes, they're mainly within the wiki (plus a whole lot of behind-the-scenes shenanigans.) I'll let you guys have a click through those little icons, and figure out the rest!

***
***
***

**Got some opinions?** 

**Ideas?**

**Found a spelling mistake, or a coding glitch?**

**Do you have a really delicious recipe that I should cook  for dinner tomorrow evening?**

####***Stick it all down in the comments below!***

1367786954.0,257,self.longboarding,1dr0hz,Yesterday I lost a dear friend of mine.,309,52,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1dr0hz/yesterday_i_lost_a_dear_friend_of_mine/,"Yesterday I was heading to my friend's house. I was skating from the lightrail station, and was about halfway there when it happened. I was crossing the street and BAM i got hit by a truck. I get up, furious at the careless and the wreckless driver when I notice my longboard. The asshole busted it in half. Honestly, I haven't felt such a strong wave of emotion at one time. This was my first and only longboard, I've had it for almost 2 years now. It is one of my most used and prized possessions. The driver sped away before I could get his information or anything. I'm not too injured, I rolled my ankle and am a bit bruised up. I would post a picture of the dearly departed but my phone also broke when I got hit. So now I'm out of my 2 most used possessions with no money to replace  them (poor college student). Thanks for reading my story, I just really needed to get this off my chest and this seemed to be the best medium.

Update: Wow, I made this post and have been gone for about 7 hours and I'm on top of the /r/longboarding front page. I didn't expect to get this much attention so the least I can do is clarify the situation. I was skating along the street and was in the crosswalk as I got hit. It was at a stop sign, the truck was waiting to turn onto the street I was skating down and started to turn as soon as it was clear of the car that was passing towards me. Unfortunately I was still in the way so he hit me and ran over my board. My glasses were knocked off and both lenses popped out so I could not see the license plate. The only description I could give was that it was a big white truck. There were no cameras and the only witness was one person who came a few moments later as I was looking for my lenses in the street. As I stated above, I am not really physically injured. He wasn't going too fast when he hit me. ",,False,self,t5_2qvgw,1367823233.0,,,True,t3_1dr0hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1dr0hz/yesterday_i_lost_a_dear_friend_of_mine/,

I had good weather for the first time in a long time so a couple friends and I decided to skate. We started at around 11 in the morning and skated till 7:30, with no water or local markets to provide it. It can be easy to forget when you're having so much fun you can forget to drink water. 

WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY, IT'S TOO LATE. 

At that point you're pretty much dehydrated. Now back to the story, well it was about seven and most of us were tired and feeling a bit sick and decided its time to head home, on the way back home I started feeling a bit light headed and feeling like I was going to pass out. I stopped and went to a sprinkler head and drank all the water I could from it and then Started dry heaving several times. I went to the doctor and he just said it was severe dehydration and that I should pack water with me or take breaks to drink water as a group. 

No matter how far it is remember to pack some water for the road. Shred safe and drink water!

A little background: I've been on reddit for 2.5 years, and on /r/longboarding since it had about 500 subscribers.  

I'm 24, I have a degree in mechanical engineering. I started making boards in 2008, started with custom boards for the first two years developing my skills, then shifted the focus to developing some solid production models. 

Besides designing and building boards, I do a lot of skating, I film and edit videos, I designed and coded the Nelson website and designed most of the board graphics. I generally don't have much time for sleep, but I love all of it. The longboard community is awesome and I've met so many cool people in the last few years.  

I'm currently stuck at home, hoping hurricane sandy isn't flooding the Nelson shop. Bring on the questions!

When I was driving through Boulder today, some kid on a longboard basically skated out in the middle of traffic to cross the road; causing me and others to slam on our brakes. When he looked me, I gave him a ""WTF are you doing?!?"" look, and he just flipped me off and kept skating. 

Whenever I take a nice cruise through town with my pals (or by myself), I always try take extra precautions to be a courteous skater.  So let's all not be like that dude that I almost hit, because people like that are why skaters/longboarders have a bad rep.

I was skating last week and pushing my limits. I was finally breaking 50 ft standies. So here i am, fucking hauling down a hill like ive done a hundred times before, and go to throw a heelside but nope, i highside. So I stand up and walk it off, got a nasty scrape on my hip, shoulder, and elbow. So i decide to pack up and go home. So im at home about an hour later, and it starts hurting to breath so im like ""fuck, i broke a rib"". This isnt too bad, ive bruised ribs before so whatever. So i take a shower and start feeling dizzy and shit. So i get out quickly and then boom, i wake up naked on my floor in my room. So i get my mum to take me to the hospital, and they give me a little sonogram and find that i lacerated my spleen and im bleeding really quickly into my stomach. So i get rushed via ambulance to another hospital and they drug me to shit and give me some xrays and mris. And as if fucking bleeding in my tummy isnt enough, i fractured 2 vertabrae in my spine. So yeah. I spent 5 days in the hospital and the next 5 weeks in a back brace. The worst part is that my parents are selling my boards and refuse to let me skate after im healed. Skating is like all i have. So fuck. And the worst part is that i know that i cant skate anymore. So just fuck. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to tell you guys. Be safe out there!!! And have fun!

Self posts don't give karma.,213,19,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/17k8ph/new_mods_and_other_important_information_please/,"The short explanation is that /r/longboarding has 4 new mods who would like to tell you about themselves in an AMA style format. but isnt  *this* thread. That's going to happen on 2/1/13 at 3:30am/pm US Central time. Weve made some updates, and have a few more lined up.

This thread is to welcome in no particular order /u/Xuis, /u/osborn2shred11, /u/QuitoPR and /u/Broken_S_Key to the moderation team and to discuss... things.

Things like the new logo. its about time. Also, the updated side bar.

The Side Bar
---

The new sidebar has been reorganized to help new users learn a bit about us, the basics, then more in depth information and features a section titled 'Tools and Resources' which is helpful to new and old members alike. New additions include a revamped Helmet section, ""Racing Lines"", the much loved post about cheap replacement hardware, commuter tips, a video about making your own slide gloves, application and removal of grip tape a new coupon for redditors and a 'last updated' so you know when some thing has changed.

Our aim was to make the side bar as idiot proof as possible. Thats why when you hover over a link you will get a brief summary of what it leads to.

We do ask that when you point someone to the sidebar you either name the bit that will help them most or link to it.

Now and Tomorrow
---

Part of the reason the new mods were appointed was because you all spoke out, some of us were recommended by other users, and because we are known to be active. What does this mean? A lot, but hopefully its stuff you wont actually see. Things controlling the flow of spam, Removing insulting comments that provide nothing to discussion and staying on top of the spam filter.

This means that if your post got stuck in the filter you can not only message the mods but now they'll actually respond! The same applies to the report buttons.

We plan on updating the board selection guide with links, updated prices and rephrased explanations. That way it can also be added to the 'Basic' section as well as where it stands now in the Tools and resources section.

But lets talk about what you will see. These Ideas are in the early stages but we want to do a weekly question thread where you can ask about any topic (longboarding related) and have a straight answer. We also want to do a weekly 'Gear Thread'. This give everyone to talk about new purchases, post their quiver pictures and talk about gear they plan on buying.

since yesterday a couple of other topics have been brought up that we will also discuss.

AMA
---

Now, regarding the AMA. At the above mentioned date we will be posting a bit about ourselves and give you all the opportunity to speak to us directly. You can ask about us personally, voice your opinion on the changes and throw in your own suggestions.

Speaking of AMAs, one of our goals is to get more going. So suggest some people you want to hear from and we'll try our best.",Mod update,False,self,t5_2qvgw,False,,,True,t3_17k8ph,http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/17k8ph/new_mods_and_other_important_information_please/,moderator

I was skating down my street this morning at 7:45AM peacefully on my way to the train station/ work when a white VW Golf spots me and throws on it's hazards and veers towards me into my lane. (he was driving the opposite way). Everytime I tried to adjust out of it's path it moved to intercept me. However I did slalom my ass around it after a second. I turn around in disgust of what an asshole driver this is and then the car goes in FULL REVERSE as fast as I've ever seen a golf go in reverse after me. I don't stop until I see a car about to park and I'm boxed in so I hop off. At this point a cop hops out of the passenger seat (this is the first inkling I had that it was a cop and not just your average aggressive asshole) and he's screaming at me about how dangerous and illegal that I'm skating in the street. All I could think was, wait I'm the dangerous one after you've been swerving and speeding in reverse on a residential street- in an unmarked cop car?? I'm an ex pat in Berlin who speaks german but I played dumb and gave him my US ID and pretended to just be a tourist so I don't think I'll actually get the fine he was telling me about but it drives me fucking insane that my choice of transportation can be discriminated against and that cops could be incredibly irresponsible on the road just because I'm skating by. There's got to be some more organization by the longboarding community to get recognized and respect. /rant

Remember to follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and to pass the stoke!

Gonna try something new this week, some good questions asked in the previous week:

[What kind of gloves to get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1f9vso/welcome_to_rlongboardings_weekly_question_thread/ca86xm9)

[How to get more serious with DH?](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1f9vso/welcome_to_rlongboardings_weekly_question_thread/ca8ec0o)

[What should I learn as a beginner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1f9vso/welcome_to_rlongboardings_weekly_question_thread/ca8cqho)

* **RULE:** Do not threadjack. This means don't post your question in a higher upvoted post to get reponses. Your question will be deleted.

* **SUGGESTION:** If you are coming into the thread later in the day, please sort by **new** so **new** questions can get love too.
