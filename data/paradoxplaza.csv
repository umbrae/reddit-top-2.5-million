If you have questions, ^^^hacks , and other nonsense to share, put it in this thread. We don't want to have an overflow of silly posts :D

This page will be stickied for a day or two. 

---

###Some useful things that I've noticed so far:

 * Right clicking opens up diplomatic menu for the nation you right clicked on

 * Demo ends in 1520.

 * I'm in love with this game. I've put 1500+ hours into EU3 and I endorse EU4. Shit is fantastic, I can tell from the demo. 

 * S key splits troops in half, while G groups them into one. A loads units onto a ship, and D detaches a siege.  Very handy. 

 * &gt; *That feel when you put 40 hours into a demo*

---

###Challenges

So, I've come up with some challenges for you guys. These must be done within the demo's timeframe. Some might be too hard to do in the timespan given, but try it anyways.  Post back with your results either in the comments or in a separate thread.

 * As Venice, form Italy. (I was very close to accomplishing this myself. If I had 2 more years I would have done it)

 * As the Ottomans, take over all of Italy, Croatia, Bosnia, Wallachia, and Moldova. 

 * As Portugal, annex Castille. 

 * As Austria, annex Hungary and Bohemia.

It brought in many new players and breathed new life into Paradox Interactive. It does not however really do much to prepare the players for what comes next. The main Paradox franchise is Europa Universalis, and most of their grand strategy genre games are subtitled as being 'A Europa Universalis Game'. From Crusader Kings to Hearts of Iron, they share certain basic features but are all mechanically different in order to reflect the nature of the time period they are designed to represent. As such, if you got into the series with Crusader Kings 2, you may find yourself at a loss with Europa Universalis 4.

As such, I am writing this guide as years long veteran of the franchise, but this guide is written deliberately for people who are new to the series, and are utterly unfamiliar with EU3. If you have played other games in this franchise, this may still be helpful in some ways to introduce key differences between EU3 and 4, but my focus will be largely on how the game relates, or does not relate to Crusader Kings 2.

To begin, we will start with the Demo. Our options contain one Great Power, the Ottoman Empire, one Trade Republic, Venice, the leader of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, and one fledgling colonial power, Portugal. Each of these will showcase key elements of the game by their inherent focuses; Expansion, Trade, Diplomacy, and Exploration.

**Part One: Nobody's Business but the Turks**

Begin the game with The Ottoman Empire. The first thing to notice after the game begins is the map. The Ottoman Empire, sitting half in Asia and Half in Europe, has much different knowledge of the map than it's European counterparts. While it's knowledge of northern Europe and Russia is lacking, it is aware of the whole of India and much of the coastline of Indochina and Indonesia. As such, it can engage with diplomatic relations with these powers far before Europeans can.

The second thing to notice is that you are at War. This is not conveyed in a much different way than in Crusader Kings 2, there is a shield bearing a coat of arms in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, to the left of the map, that shows the current war with Moldovia. If you click it, you should see a familiar display showing the status of the war, battles won and lost, and accrued war score.

Presuming you have zoomed into the map close enough, you will see your armies marked in green, and your enemy's armies marked in red. If you've played CK2, these numbers may seem frightfully small. In EU4, all armies are standing armies akin to retinues in CK2, and similarly, cost money to support. They are composed of subunits called brigades, consisting of 1000 men each. You can hire as many brigades as you want to, provided you can pay for them, however if you exceed a certain limit the support cost will increase by a large percentage for each unit over that limit.

To see your support limit, click your country's shield in the top left corner, which will bring up a menu similar to what you may see in Crusader Kings 2. From the tabs along the top of this menu, click the military tab represented by the helmet overlaid atop a sword.  This will reveal your country's military status. There is a great deal of information presented here, but right now just focus on one number, the Force Limit. There are two Force Limit numbers, one for Land and one for Navy, they both work in the same way. For the Ottomans, you will have a limit of 60 land brigades, but currently only have 50 deployed. Being at the top of the food chain as you are, it isn't necessarily important to consistently have your armies filled to the force limit.

 You will see on the Moldovian border, two of your armies of 16 thousand men each conveniently waiting for you to give them the order to move in and annihilate the pathetically small Moldovian defenders. I'm sure I don't have to tell you what to do. Take one, move it in, be sure to appoint a leader to the attacking army to minimize your losses. To do this, simply select the army and click the area reading No Leader, and select a general from the list. Different values for their Fire, Shock, Manuver and Siege scores are represented by pips. Having more pips in everything is obviously better. Mouse over them to get tool tips for more details on what each does, but it's not important right now. 

One of the generals will have an Icon that has a crown. This is your nations leader, in this case, Sultan Bayezid II. You can specifically recruit your nation's leader to serve as a general, but this is not often advised. As in CK2, it is very possible for your leader to die on the campaign. On the other hand, this is not nearly as crippling as it can be in CK2. In this age of centralized states, you won't have any disgruntled dukes seeking to usurp your throne or declare independence at the first sign of weakness.

As you move your army into Moldovia, your army will swiftly crush the Moldovian resistance and begin occupying. Rather than a simple timer ticking down, you will see a percentage score next to the occupying army. This represents the probability that the province will become occupied at the start of the next siege phase. The siege phases are time pulses that occur every time the progress bar to the left of the percentage score fills. This percentage score will begin in the negatives and slowly progress into the positives. There is a chance for the province to become occupied after ANY siege phase in the positive, even if it's at 1 percent. As a practical matter, it will often take longer. If the percentage ever reaches 100, it will always reach occupation in the next siege phase.

You may encounter random events and pop ups I do not receive during this waiting period, so treat them as you see fit, and wait for the end of the siege. When the occupation is complete a few things will happen quite suddenly. Along the notification bar at the top, a flag will drop down reading Call of Peace, informing you that the war has been won, and the people want you to sue for peace, and if you don't you will gain War Exhaustion at an increased rate. War Exhaustion is a percentage score that grows as you send men to their deaths in wars abroad. This is a mechanic of issuing war exhaustion if you don't sue for peace after winning the war is designed to punish certain gamey aspects people could abuse in EU3. War Exhaustion is quite punishing if the score rises too high, sparking mass revolts, which can raise it further when your armies fight the rebels, as well as generally reducing income.

In order to sue for peace, click Moldovia's only province, to bring up the provincial menu. After taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the information presented here, click the diplomacy button. Here you will see a variety of different diplomatic actions that you can take arranged by type in easy to navigate drop down menus. Sue For Peace, however, is highlighted in red, and right at the top. Click this, click full annexation from the demands menu, and send the demand. They should immediately accept, having no other choice, and immediately, they will be annexed whole.  

At this point, notice two of your neighbors have their armies indicated as allies by their blue highlight. Wallachia and the Crimean Khanate begin as vassal states to the Ottoman Empire. Vassal states do not function like they do in Crusader Kings 2, and instead represent complete political domination of one independent country over another. They pay 50 percent of their taxes directly to you, and you are responsible for protecting them from outside threats. Though they will fight as your allies, their smaller budget makes them individually weaker than they would be independent. 

Finally, since we've just won this opening war, it's time to pause and assess our situation on the whole. Displayed along the top left, little hanging tabs display urgent information in much the same way as they did in CK2. Their urgency is shown by color, green being least urgent.

To the far left there's probably a yellow one notifying you of possible revolts. Others are more simple notifications and reminders, truce with the Mamlukes expiring, free adviser slots, can build buildings, no current mission, etc. To start with, hire some advisers by clicking the notification button. They come in administrative, diplomatic, and military flavors. You can hire one of each. They come in many varieties boosting different specific stats, but importantly, give a boost to administrative, diplomatic, and military power, by one, two, or three points. The country starts with a base of 3 points, your ruler adds his stats on top of these, and your advisers add to that to get a final total. Your Ruler has a max of six in each stat, and as such, the stats max out at a score of 12. As a practical matter, this is almost impossible to reach, particularly in the early game.

Your current ruler has a score of 3 across the board, and advisers in any department with a score of 3 are few and far between, not to mention ridiculously expensive to hire maintain. Even advisers with a score of 2 can be quite costly. Anyway, at the end of every month, your final stats from your ruler and your advisers are added to pools of administrative, diplomatic, and military power points, that function as currencies for almost every important action you take, in fact, if we paid attention earlier, you'd have seen even demanding the annexation of Moldovia required a number of Diplomatic power points. They are also used to invest in new technologies, hire generals, improve stability, reduce war exhaustion, and many other things that will come up as you play.

For now, my letter count is approaching 10000, so I end with this; take some time to sort out how to reduce revolt risk and improve relations with the Mamlukes as an assignment.",EU4,False,self,t5_2su3h,1376070539.0,eu4,,True,t3_1jzszx,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1jzszx/europa_universalis_4_a_guide_for_those_unfamiliar/,

I'm Bethlen on the forums and I'm one of the ""Support Gurus"" of Paradox Interactive.

I started working at Paradox Interactive in the middle of May, 2013 and have been lurking reddit (and this subreddit) for quite a while as a morning routine (some have their newspapers, I have my Google Currents-stream and reddit-subscriptions). I figured that I might as well let you know that I'm here, should you need me.

Most of the support is (and still will be) done through the forums and the support-ticket system we have, so if you need more thorough help, use those channels instead please. Easier for both me and you. Also, this is just since I'm here anyway and not as part of my employment. So don't consider this as an official support-channel please, else I might get flooded by extra work =)

I'll be available through PMs and lurking topics so if you need support, I'm here.

Lastly, if you have any questions, fire away. Although I might not be able to answer them all, I will do my best.

(This isn't an AMA, but more an announcement of my presence in the subreddit).

So we start out with Ulm on stage, under a single stage-light, illuminating his sad face. He sits sullenly and laments his poor condition and how we will never amount to anything (""Alone in the Empire""). He is then interrupted by his friend Brandenburg, which informs him about France's recent war with Burgundy, and how France gained a lot of provinces.

We then switch over to triumphant France, who celebrates her victory (""Fleur De Lis"") until the party is crashed by Austria, who threatens France saying he, as the new HRE emperor, will soon make her regret attacking the HRE (""It's not over yet""). Austria storms off the party angrily and bumps into Ulm, who then sneaks into the party, sees France in all her beauty and falls in love (""Huge Tracts of Land"").

Next scene, Brandenburg is trying to talk Ulm out of his love for France until he is called off-stage when Poland-Lithuania attacks Teutonic Order, his junior partner personal union (""Hussars! Hurrah!""). Ulm laments he will never take part in such a great war, until, out of nowhere, comes France and asks him for an alliance. France tells him that she wants to take some more HRE territories, and needs someone to keep Austria distracted (""So long Vienna"").

Next scene, we hear about the war from England and Spain, who sit comfortably in America while France and Ulm duke it out with Austria. They are then replaced by the victorius France and Ulm, who inform us of their victory and how Ulm grabbed a couple of provinces from Austria and is now a major HRE player (""Fleur De Lis""/""Alone in the Empire (Reprise)""). High on provinces, Ulm kisses France and the two embrace.

Meanwhile, we see Austria talking with Prussia, who used to be Brandenburg/TO but grew formidably. They are talking about how Ulm surprised them as England bursts to the scene and informs them that Ulm attacked Venice and took over their trade ports with his merchants (""La Serenissima""). Prussia says something must be done, and Austria suggests allying and taking back their territories from Ulm.

Ulm and France are arguing. France says Ulm is expanding too rapidly, while Ulm says she's one to talk, look at what she's been doing in her American colonies, and anyway she only wanted this union because she was looking for strategic allies and she doesn't truly love him. France slaps Ulm and he storms off-stage to war against Tuscany. France bursts into tears but is comforted by Spain, who tells her not to worry, Austria and Prussia will take care of Ulm. Stricken, France laments Ulm's impending doom (""Prestige"").

Switch to Prussia and Austria, who are prepared to launch their invasion against Ulm (""Time to March (to the sound of cannons)"") but are waiting for a proper Casus Belli. England enters and informs them of Ulm's actions against Tuscany, and they finally declare war against Ulm, summoning all of their old alliances and friends (""Casus Belli"").

We then see Ulm as he realizes his mistakes as rebels swarm his Italian provinces and the Austrians and Prussians are closing in (""Attrition""). France, in the same stage but under another spotlight, laments how she doesn't want to go to war against Ulm, but must honor her alliance to Prussia (as a result of a brief fling they had when it was still Brandenburg). Their voices merge and we get the centerpiece of the musical, ""Empire Borders"".

We then have a showdown - Prussia, Austria, Ulm and France duke it out in a grand finale of four voices (""Dishonorable Scum (Give Me Back My Cores)""). As news of a series of unfortunate events cripple the French economy (""Comet Sighted""), Prussia and Austria try to talk France out of supporting Ulm, but she persists, telling them sometimes love is more important (""Love is Better than Provinces""). The two strike France down, and Ulm realizes how arrogant and power hungry he was and agrees to hand over most of his territory (""Under these Conditions"").

As Austria and Prussia leave the stage, Ulm whispers to France she didn't have to do this for him and that he could have found another way (""Save Scumming"") but France tells him that love is sacrifice, and that she truly loves him. As the two kiss and embrace (""In Nomine Amore""), Spain bursts in telling them of a huge revolt in the Austrian Netherlands, and that this is France's chance of reclaiming some of her prestige by breaking the truce and claiming some of her cores from the HRE while they are distracted. France smiles and says to Spain that maybe she should just let this one go, since she has better things to attend to like maybe colonizing Indochina. Ulm and France kiss again (""Empire borders (reprise)""), curtains down, fade to black.

After that, the Empress of Byzantium and my vassal decided it would be a good idea to declare war on me for the throne of England, hoping to enlist her husband to help. He declined, not being an asshole to me, and instead stayed neutral. After I crushed her I decided to be merciful and let her keep her titles since she was the link I had to my friend's empire.

Showing gratitude for my mercy, compounded by the distance she lived from Constantinople, we began an affair. When she gave birth and my friend realized it wasn't his child, we started laughing historically (hysterically) in teamspeak and I started bragging about how I fucked his wife.

The strategy is not complete nor perfect, but it is possible to beat the Ottomans with it. All games I have played as the Byzantines are in Ironman mode.

---

These are the steps you must take to beat the Ottomans

On Day One:

 1. Ally with Serbia (9 times out of 10 will accept)*

 2. Set your rival to the Ottomans*

 3. Convert your king to a general, and attach the army he leads to your navy. Send the navy to the sea province outside of Athens.

 4. Build one regiment of infantry in your southernmost province (Morea?) 

 5. NEVER stop building galleys. Take loans if you have to.


On Day Two:

1. Check Albania to see if he is allied with Athens (9 times out of 10 he will be)

2. Declare war on Albania to take your cores. Make sure to bring Serbia into the war (very important).* 

Later: 

 1. Land troops waiting in the Aegean onto Athens. Athens will have moved their army. 

 2. Leave one troop in Athens, and follow the Athenian army to Achaea. 

 3. Once contact is made in Achaea, move your one regiment in Morea north to help. 

 4. Once you win the battle, ship one regiment over to Albania. Serbia *should* control the siege (9 times out of 10).

 5. Wait for Serbia to peace out with Albania, and your unit there should gain control of the next siege. Fuck you Ottomans, Albania is ours!

 6. Don't get too hasty, do not annex Albania before Athens. Annex Athens first, and then Albania.

 7. NEVER STOP BUILDING GALLEYS

 8. (Optional) Set sail for Trebizond and annex them. However, they will be occupied by the Ottomans and will probably cause you to have high War Exhaustion in the future. The extra money / forcelimits is helpful though.

 By now you should have 20-30 galleys. Wait for Ottoman troops in Greece to move to Anatolia for whatever reason. Declare war when the Ottomans have no troops in Greece.

THE WAR : 

 1. Do not, under any circumstances, move your navy away from the sea of Marmara. 

 2. Siege the Balkans to your heart's content. 

 3. This war should be fought without a single land battle. Will give you the 'Cold War' acheivement. 

 4. Take as many provinces as you can. It is recommended that you wait for the Ottomans to have very high War Exhaustion before peacing, plus you might get some ticking war score which can get you an extra province. 

 5. It might be wise to take back any provinces held by Catholics if you have 40+ galleys. The Knights and Cyprus should be easy pickings. Venice can be taken on if he doesn't have many naval allies.

[[An imgur album of my exploits. Ignore the first image.]](http://imgur.com/a/Gvt1R)



*Here are some reasons behind the beginning statements. If you take a look at your surroundings, you will notice that the Ottomans start out at war with Albania. They also start with their troops nearby. However, Albania has a small set of troops of their own. Our goal is to siege this province before the Ottomans do. Ships won't work, because they are too slow. However, Serbia can move their troops into place fast enough to become leader of the siege. We will let Serbia take Albania's money, and then we let our single set of infantry take the land. This allows us to take over two of our cores (which offer decent ship building capabilities) with relative ease. All we need to do to win a war with the Ottomans is to have more ships than they, and to not have their armies in Europe. 

Edit: Athens and Albania merely help you *a lot*. You can theoretically win the war with the Ottomans without them. Try to grab one if you can't grab the other. If you can't grab either, try to pick up Trebizond, Kaffa, Ragusa or Bosnia.

There are two options to vote for: either removing the score hiding, or not removing it.

Please do not downvote either. It will not benefit you in any way, and might even make it appear that more people have voted *for* the option due to how vote fuzzing works.

Please do upvote this post so as many people as possible can see it.

The votes will be tallied sometime tomorrow, and that will decide whether the vote hiding stays or goes.

Comment feedback is appreciated, but only the votes for the two comments matter. Vote on [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1eyuee/final_vote_on_score_hiding/ca53cxf) if you **don't want** score hiding. Vote on [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1eyuee/final_vote_on_score_hiding/ca53d2h) if you **want** score hiding.

The fate of the experiment will be determined by a simple majority. The choice with the most votes in favor will be put in action once the vote has concluded in somewhere around 24 hours.

I will detail some of the ideas that I and the other mods have had. 

---

###Events

 * **We will be setting up a Game Giveaway Megathread.**
 
Let's get down to specifics:

We don't want the thread to be boring to look through for random people, so we want all the people who will be giving away keys to ask a question. This question can be any sort of question, but try to keep it civil. Whoever answers the question the best (in the asker's opinion) will get the key for the game they are giving away. 

Another idea for this is that we hold a trivia session on our [teamspeak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/wiki/teamspeak)  Basically, the person giving away a key asks a question that is very specific and the person who wants the key has to answer very quickly and correctly in order to get the key. 

---

 * **An EU4 Release Megathread will be created.**

This thread will be similar to the demo megathread. Feel free to talk about anything relating to EU4 and the release in that thread. Try to keep questions in that thread as well, because we will probably get hundreds of questions like in the demo megathread. 

---

 * **An EU4 multiplayer server will be set up ASAP.**

As soon as we get information on how to set up a sever, we will. Specifics of the server like its name, password, and settings will be detailed in a separate post on /r/paradoxplaza and on /r/eu4multi. 

---

If you guys have any comments, ideas, or drama then please let us know ;). Tomorrow will probably be the most active the subreddit will be for the next couple of months, so now is the time to voice opinions.

**DISCLAIMER:** *I have been playing this game for months. It was done without the Republic and Sunset Invasion DLCs. It was done without any reloads - I even turned off the autosaves and game would be saved only when I was done for the day. This resulted in about 120 years of gametime lost due to game crushes, so some screenshots may not match the time line.*



Ever since SOI came out I have been eagerly anticipating the pagan DLC, but with paganless LoR announced I decided its time to take the matter into my own hands. 


I wasn't planning on becoming the [Tri-Emperor of half the world](http://i.imgur.com/bz7U48V.jpg). My goal for the game was pretty straight forward - to paint the name of my religion across the Europe in [big fat letters](http://i.imgur.com/n9QEIja.jpg).


I started off as a small count of Värmland. I decided to go with a custom ruler, and made a smart dwarf who really likes to drink. I married a Swedish Norse lady who educated my son to become pagan. Unfortunately, he did not inherit my dwarf genes. I sided with Eric the Heathen, and eventually, through marriage and intrigue, my grandson became the King of Sweden. 

I did this all in one day and did not save the game, because I knew I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of reloading when something bad happened (like my son not inheriting dwarf genes). And this is when my game decided to crush, undoing ~80 years of work. I was pretty demoralized and didn't play for a while. About a week later I decided to start over, but this time as a King. The dwarf genes didn't pass on once again....


As a pagan King I quickly learnt that nobody liked me, and I was forced to helplessly watch as my only friends in the entire world disappeared one by one as they got roflstomped by the HRE and their Christian friends. I also learnt that I had pretty much **no CB on anyone** whatsoever. Pagans don't get the Holy War CB, nobody wants to join my court or marry me. I only got the Conquest CB on neighboring provinces and the Fabricate Claim CB. This means that [every county that is a part of my glorious Empire was conquered one at a time](http://i.imgur.com/I9xlQSZ.png).


After a 120 years of carefully picking my fights I have finally [formed Scandinavia](http://i.imgur.com/jfWgvFb.jpg). Despite being a fierce Viking I was shaking like a little girl at the thought of HRE declaring a holy war on me. I was so scared I even built a bunch of forts in Denmark. Few years later I noticed something interesting - during one of the civil wars the Kaiser [got into jail](http://i.imgur.com/EQMEu9c.jpg) and a bunch of his vassals won their independence. Later on even more became independent, without having to fight a war against him at all. I took advantage of that and conquered their lands in the name of Thor! Meanwhile in Spain there was a [new sultan in town](http://i.imgur.com/p8sPtWi.jpg). 


One thing that my almost-fearless Vikings were scared of more than HRE blob was the Mongol invasion. By the late 1230s we [became neighbors](http://i.imgur.com/xFsUW0Z.jpg). I waited for the invasion. Then I waited some more. Nothing happened. I guess the Mongols just didn't have the balls to wage war against the sons of Odin. [30 years later we were best buddies](http://i.imgur.com/OeOG3W0.jpg), helping each other destroy HRE and France.


Mongols conquered Germany, I took over most of France. At this point game became very easy. I didn't even have to raise levies. I would just invite my Mongol allies over and they would do all the work. There was nobody who could oppose the collective might of the Horde and the Norse pagans. Up until the moment when Mongols [decided to convert](http://i.imgur.com/oNMABB2.jpg). Thanks to all my marriages that helped me forge and alliance with the Horde, they now had a weak claim on my entire freaking Empire.... and my ruler was a woman! The Mongols had already [reduced three great dynasties to almost nothing](http://i.imgur.com/T3H4uHY.jpg) and I didn't want that to happen to me. Luckily they did not use their claim. Meanwhile in Greece there was a [new Emperor in town](http://i.imgur.com/fzuL0Zf.jpg). 


At the beginning of 14th century, due to the occupation of France,  the [Capets moved over to the Africa](http://i.imgur.com/RlR84Mo.jpg). I wish I could too, because the Mongols have finally summoned up their courage and declared a holy war on me. [Here is the Horde at the peak of their strength](http://i.imgur.com/gH7V3Wu.jpg). At this point I thought the game was over for me because their army was at least twice bigger than mine. At a desperate attempt to save my lands I raised my doomstacks right on the border and quickly assaulted some counties. Turns out the Mongols aren't so good at mobilizing their armies and I ended up winning the war. For some reason Khan had only 5 vassals, and [king of Bohemia held most of the lands within the Empire](http://i.imgur.com/i6NQV1F.jpg). 


The Horde has been around for so long they even acquired some de jure territory! It took me [a little over 100 years to destroy them](http://i.imgur.com/6tRyzbg.jpg). After that I had to break a [few truces](http://i.imgur.com/fYHTjsI.jpg) while conquering Byzantium. The game ended a month after I managed to take Jerusalem.


Here are some interesting screenshots:

I was watching the Lion King with my niece the other day (she isn't the heir to my kingdom, but she does have me wrapped around her finger. My spymaster is watching for plots, no worries) and I got to thinking...

We're made to think that the story of the Lion King is tragic, but I can't relate. First of all, didn't Mustafa realize that he had a -30 modifier to his relationship with Scar based on the fact that Scar had a claim to the throne? And Zazu may have had a high stewardship rating, but  as for the rest of Mustafa's council... that gopher spymaster could report on hyena movements, but not the fact that Scar was plotting to seize the title for Pride Rock? What, did he have an intrigue rating of 4? Did Mustafa have him trying to steal technology from the elephant graveyard? 

So Simba goes into exile, and Scar does what? Make Ed his spymaster? Those hyenas must have the inbred trait, because they all suck.

Okay, I get that Simba and Nala were both lions, but what did Mustafa's dynasty have to gain from marrying his only son off to Nala? Was there a lack of better political alliances Mustafa could have made by betrothing Simba to some other lioness? No wonder Scar came along with his hyenas and messed things up. Pride Rock was a house of cards waiting to fall. 

The whole damned movie is flawed, and that dynasty needed to fail. I hope during Simba's reign the wildebeests put forth their claim to the kingdom and seize that shit for the betterment of the circle of life.

-------------------------------
**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**



**Wait, you're done?**

We said soon, didn't we?

**For real this time?**

Yes.

**What is this?**

A Game of Thrones is a total conversion mod for Crusader Kings II, based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series, A Song of Ice and Fire.

**Who can I play?**

You can play as any landed feudal noble in Westeros, as well as the Night's Watch.

**You can play as a holy order?**

Yes. Although they're not that interesting at the moment. No wildlings yet.

**What are some of the new features?**

Knights, Maesters, our new ""Megawar"" system for handling civil wars, the Night's Watch, and a new system for plotting your assassinations are just a few among many.

**What scenarios are available?**

At the moment, our only available scenario is Robert's Rebellion, when Robert Baratheon, Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn, Hoster Tully, and Tywin Lannister overthrew the Mad King and brought the Targaryen dynasty to an end. We are looking into other scenarios for future releases.

**Is Essos in the mod?**

No, and it won't be until Paradox makes republics playable and interesting.

**I haven't read all the books. Is it safe for me to play this mod?**
The current scenario is set roughly sixteen years before the events of the books, so you should be fine. The mod's text files themselves, however, do contain spoilers through to A Dance With Dragons, especially the character history files.

**I have a copy of the HBO show's opening theme what I acquired completely legitimately. How can I use it as my main menu music?**

Convert it to .ogg format, move it to your Crusader Kings II\mod\A Game of Thrones\music folder, and rename it crusaderkings2_maintitle

**Hey, I noticed some missing county shields...**

This is technically a beta release.

**Hodor?**

Hodor.

**Known Crashes &amp; Issues:**

Don't send all your councilors (your Castellan, your Master of Laws, your Master-at-Arms, your Master of Whisperers, your Master of Coin, and your Maester) to do missions in the same province. Game cannot handle 6 sprites in 1 province.

1356649091.0,69,self.paradoxplaza,15jiv0,[EU3] Spanish Standard,78,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/15jiv0/eu3_spanish_standard/,"[This standard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Pend%C3%B3n_her%C3%A1ldico_de_los_Reyes_Catolicos_de_1475-1492.svg) is used in game by Spain. I've just spent the last 20 minutes researching, curious as to the origins of the particular parts of the flag.

From the top left clockwise are:

Quarter 1 and 4 is split into a further four quarters. The castle is the part of the standard for the Kingdom of Castille and the crowned lion is the Kingdom of Leon, these form the royal standard for the Kingdom of Castille and Leon, or Castille as it's known in game.

Quarter 2 and 3 are split in half. The half on the left is the royal standard for the Kingdom of Aragon. It was the half on the right that stumped me for a while. It's origin comes from a rebellion against French rule in the [War of The Sicilian Vespers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Sicilian_Vespers). 

It reads like a CK2 plot but the basics are that a French duke invaded the Kingdom of Sicily, with blessing from the Pope after long wars against the Papal states. Once the French duke was on the throne he did quite well for himself, crowning himself as the King of Albania and even tried to conquer Constantinople. 

Eventually the Sicilians revolted against French rule, with help from agents of Aragon and the Byzantine Empire triggered by, [according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Vespers), a French sergeant who pestered a young married woman, dragging her from the crowd. He was stabbed by her husband. The other French tried to avenge his death when the Sicilian crowd fell upon them, killing them all. This all happened whilst people were drinking, in a church. The standard slaughtering of people happened and within six weeks, three thousand French men and women were killed.

The islanders then asked the pope for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune but the (French) pope refused telling them that Charles was their rightful king and to listen to him etc. etc.. After this the islanders went to their second choice, Pedro III of Aragon whose wife was, in a complex CK2 way, the sole surviving heir of Frederick II, a Holy Roman Emperor and ex king of Sicily (he was excommunicated four times and Pope Gregor IX called him the Antichrist because he was frequently at war with the papal states). 

Pedro III (King of Aragon) was handily killing Muslims at the time in North Africa when he received the request for help from the Sicilians he was, conveniently, only two hundred miles from the island, so, after an appropriate amount of paying attention to the pope's opinion, he ordered his fleet at Sicily and landed.

Charles (the French duke at the start of this what was supposed to be a brief summary) then counter attacked but was repulsed. 

Finally the island of Sicily was taken by Pedro III whilst the mainland territories (called the Kingdom of Naples by modern historians but contemporaneously known as the Kingdom of Sicily) remained with Charles (the French Duke). Also there was a crusade because of this, a French king died, lot's of Frenchmen died and Pedro's brother, the King of Majorca revolted against Pedro in the war.

And that, ladies and gentleman, is a brief (it was supposed to be) history of the composition of Spanish royal standard between, historically 1475-1506. All we need now is some incest and we have a complete CK2 game.",,False,self,t5_2su3h,False,,,True,t3_15jiv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/15jiv0/eu3_spanish_standard/,

1360223150.0,71,self.paradoxplaza,181zh2,I was bored today. So I made a simple. yet game changing mod. (Victoria II),85,14,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/181zh2/i_was_bored_today_so_i_made_a_simple_yet_game/,"Dislike Western Civilization?
Tired of having to compete with Europe and the United States?
Enjoy playing countries like Burma but hate having to westernize first?

Then this is the mod for you!

Basically, it takes all of the uncivilized countries civilized, and civilized countries uncivilized, except China. China's already broken enough.

[Download link](http://www.mediafire.com/?aykfukidwakbqmt)

Its honestly a pretty rough transfer.  I don't think there are many variations, technology wise. Formerly civilized countries should all be primitive. 

I did adjust literacy levels, however. For the most part, if a western country had a literacy level over 30, I dropped it to at most 30. If an unciv had a literacy level under .01, I brought it up.
So the now uncivilized countries aren't out for the count permanently, but you will get the drop on them.

Most decisions and events SHOULD still be valid (with exceptions such as the Commodore Perry NNM decision.)

I also gave specific countries prestige so that they'd start as Great Powers, but its likely they'll drop from grace soon enough.

This mod is compatible with Vanilla and NNM. You can run it with other mods, but there may be countries unaffected by the mod, such as the French Empire in Napoleon's Legacy.

That's all, and I hope you guys find it fun and interesting. Any and all suggestions are appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2su3h,False,,,True,t3_181zh2,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/181zh2/i_was_bored_today_so_i_made_a_simple_yet_game/,

1376168614.0,67,self.paradoxplaza,1k3wni,Announcing the EU4 to V2 Converter Project,74,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1k3wni/announcing_the_eu4_to_v2_converter_project/,"Yes, it's me again, kicking off another converter project. This converter will allow you to to continue a EU4 save in V2. Including games started back in CK2.  

It'll be a bit before I can get started programming. In addition to needing to wait for EU4 to be released, I intend to do one more release of the CK2 to EU3 converter and one more release of the EU3 to V2 converter.  

In the meanwhile, I want to open some discussions on the overall methods of this project.  

**Discussion**  
Traditionally, the converter projects create a save, writing everything from scratch, and are programmed in C++. But we have a little bit of space to question these traditions.  

I've found that including a mod for the converter gives a better result, and the CK2 to EU3 converter now makes a mod in addition to a save. I'm not familiar enough with V2 modding to know what we might lose by not also having a save, nor how difficult it would be to create a mod programmatically (flags and political parties seem like possible pitfalls).  

Now, if we were to create a save in the process, I like to have to converter write a new one from scratch. However, we have some unused code that would allow us to modify an existing V2 save instead. This allows converted saves to be more stable and feature-complete from the beginning, but is more complex and masks the features we need to have in place.  

Finally, C++ has been the language used thus far. But not everyone knows C++. This may be a good time to change (to perhaps C# or python), which may allow for more programmers to help. But if we stick with C++, there's a considerable amount of code we could take from the EU3 to V2 converter and reuse.  

What are your thoughts?  

**Helping Out**  
If you want to help, here are some things we need:  
Modders - let me know the advantages/disadvantages of creating a mod versus a save  
Programmers - weigh in on languages, give me your Sourceforge username so I can give you access to the repository  
Everyone -  

* Help start mapping things. I'll have details in a few posts.  
* Do some thread archeology to find the details of the EU4 to V2 Converter (and why we did things how we did)  
* Discuss various conversion mechanics  
* Invite as many programmers as you know to help out

It's the triad of 

1) **desire,**

2) **promise and**

3) **fulfillment of promise.**

At this moment, characters back your plots and agree to your proposals based only on *current* situtation: their current relationships, titles, etc. But what if you could **promise them a situation that they desire?**

For example, a spymaster who is in good relations with their liege usually can't be persuaded to join a plot against him. What if, however, you promised this spymaster a duchy after the plot is executed? This might change his point of view entirely. However you'd then have a traitorous and probably ambitious duke in your realm who has a high Intrigue. (Of course, should his relations with his liege be really high, only huge promises would make him change sides, e.g. a kingdom or an incredible sum of money).

Another example: you want to ask the Pope for an invasion, but don't have enough piety. But what if you promise the Pope a bishopric or changing the Investiture laws in the realm? This hypothetical situation might benefit you both, and he might consider allowing the invasion.

What if you break a promise? First of all, your reputation is pretty much ruined for a long time. Secondly, wronged party gets a Cassus Belli which would allow it to get what was promised initially.

What it boils down to technically **(skip this list if you don't care about the technicalities):**

1) Characters should have Desires. They currently have ambitions and desire titles (also there are 'Political concerns', which remain a mystery to me). This should be expanded to Base Desires (desire for any title, noble marriage, money, etc.). The Desires should be weighted based on their relevance and current situation.

2) When proposing a deal or inviting to a plot, the player (or AI) should be able to make a Promise. The Promise is described by a situation that should be present after the goal has been attained. This is very similar to how diplomatic actions requirements look like now, e.g. 'Character A has the title X' or 'Character B is married to character C', 'Character D has been given a sum of N by character E'. The Promise should affect the character's disposition toward the current deal. However, he or she should consider whether the required goal is attainable.

3) After the goal that required the Promise is attained, there is a period during which the situation described in the Promise should occur. If it does, the character who made the Promise gets a relationship and a prestige boost.

4) If the situation doesn't occur, the Promise is broken, and the wronged side gets a Cassus Belli to restore justice. The character who made the Promise gets a relationship and prestige penalty.

5) If the goal isn't attained, Promises are anulled.

I realize that this system may not be easy to implement or mod in, but it doesn't require fundamental changes to the game's structure. It does sound like something that would be a bitch to program the AI for. It will also require a coherent UI. 

But think of the possibilities! **For example:**

* Playing as William the Conqueror and promising riches and titles to English nobles who turn to your side. 

* Dividing a weak HRE among France, Hungary, Poland and the Pope. 

* Getting the crown of Rus by backstabbing your brothers.

* Inviting spymasters to plots by promising them untold riches, then murdering them (that's not going to be easy, considering their Intrigue).

* Playing as Iberain muslims, dividing the Jimenas and gobbling them up one by one. 

* Playing as a Russian duke under Golden Horde and creating an alliance to overthrow the Mongols. (By promising other strong dukes large parts of territory; also, by promising territory to ERE?)

* On that note: inviting foreigners to your rebellion against your liege by promising them land. How much of your homeland are you willing to sacrifice to get the desired title?

* Also, while revolting against liege, you may promise independence to his other vassals if they support you.

* Recruit councillors from abroad by promising them positions in the council (thanks to /u/justamathnerd)

* Etc., etc.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. Feel free to comment and criticize this idea. 

**TL;DR:** As a king of France, you should be able to promise an excommunicated king of Scotland the English crown for allying with you in an invasion against England, grant him the title after the victory, and then watch England disintegrate and gobble it's dukes one by one.

1360717989.0,64,self.paradoxplaza,18ex7y,EU3 Tips for Beginners,67,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/18ex7y/eu3_tips_for_beginners/,"Here are a few tips and tricks for beginners to utilize. As always, if something is wrong, please point it out. If you feel your own strategy works better, please feel free to give suggestions.

**Economy:**

Your income profit is divided among research, stability improvement, and minting. Minting is what gives you gold, but it can potentially give you inflation. Inflation makes everything more expensive. It's perfectly fine to have a little bit of inflation to fight off a deficit (lawl US economy), but be sure to balance your minting afterwards so that you are lowering your inflation while still making money.

The number by your minting bar is how many ducats you get MONTHLY. These are your taxes. The amount you get at the end of the year are your census taxes. You get 100% census tax in provinces that are your cores, and only 10% for non-cored provinces. This is why cores are awesome. It is perfectly reasonable to have negatives in your minting, but still make a profit due to census tax.

Marketplaces, and by extension most other trade buildings, are worthless unless that province is connected to a Center of Trade that your traders are trading in (check the Trade minimap mode). Your treasury gets NOTHING from trade value. Not a single thing. It all goes to adding value to that particular Center of Trade, and you get a portion of that value when you have active traders there. If you have no active traders in that particular Center of Trade, you are actually helping the other nations and hindering yourself by having marketplaces.

If a Center of Trade is in a province you own, you get what's called Harbor Fees or Trade Tariffs for every merchant that trades there.

Nations receive a penalty to their research cost and stability improvement cost for every province they own. This is why One Province Minors can reach ludicrous levels in research, because they don't have to spend that much. However, building things like Churches can reduce stability improvement costs and a crazy huge economy can easily trivialize the research costs. In other words, if you want to expand and still maintain research domination, work on getting more income.

**War:**

The land force limits are based not only on manpower (modified primarily by barrack buildings) but also on tax income, base tax (mouseover the province's tax rating) and some modifiers. If you want a huge army, you will need a huge economy. If you are stuck as a One Province Minor, go colonizing and trading to gain income. That way, you can field much more troops than a normal OPM, giving you a clear advantage. Remember that there is no real cap on how many troops you can field, except for the manpower; going over the force limit will simply make military maintenance much more costly.

Before going to war, check the target's allies. Then their allies' allies. And so on. Allies can call in allies, and their allies can call in allies, and so on and so forth until you have almost the entirety of Europe breathing down your neck.

When you declare a war against someone, you get the casus belli bonuses against that nation ONLY (not allies) with that casus belli ONLY. Example: going to war as France against Nevers with a Subjugation casus belli. Nevers calls in Burgundy and Flanders as allies. You will ONLY get the reduced infamy and war cost against Nevers for vassalization. If you want to vassalize Flanders or Burgundy, you will have to pay the same amount as if you started a war against them with no casus belli. Even if you have a proper Reconquest casus belli against Burgundy, you will still have to pay out the nose to gain the province. You will have to declare a second war if you want to exploit the bonuses of the Reconquest casus belli. To fully exploit both casus belli at the same time, then pause the game, declare war for Subjugation on Nevers and then declare war on Burgundy for Reconquest. You will have two separate wars with two separate goals.

Organization is what other games refer to as morale. It's that green bar that determines how likely your troops will break and run. Morale is a modifier that gives various bonuses. Discipline determines how many troops your armies will kill in battle (a Discipline rating of 115% will mean they will kill 15% more troops than a normal unit would).

Avoid going into important battles without a general. Even a crappy general with only 1 Shock will still add +1 to the dice rolls in battle during the Shock phase, and could mean the difference between defeat and victory. If both armies have a general, the difference will be used on the better side. For example, your general has 2 Shock and the enemy general has 5 Shock. You will get no bonus while the enemy will get +3 to the dice rolls during the Shock phase. If there are multiple armies with multiple generals in the same battle, only the ""best"" (determined by the computer) general will support each side.

If you are fighting on a province where the only exit is a straight (Example: Venice, Rhodes, etc), move a fleet into those waters. The straight is now blockaded, and if the enemy breaks and runs, they will be entirely annihilated because there's nowhere to go.

If there's a huge army coming to gank your small army that's left out in the open on your territory and there's no way to prevent it from happening, select the army and choose Scorch the Land. This will drastically reduce income and population growth for 2 years, but it will also drastically increase the attrition and reduce the supply limit. If the enemy chooses to stay there to capture the province, they will be facing HEAVY attrition. Building forts in bad terrains like mountains can also add to this attrition factor, since they will be taking more attrition (mountains) for much longer (forts). Playing a defensive Switzerland means playing an intelligent waiting game.

Vassals are good. Vassals are very good. You want them. You need them. Not only do they give you half their income and prevent you from increasing your research/stability costs (because they are semi-independent), but they will NEVER decline a call to arms against an enemy if they are in an alliance with you. But the problem here is that vassals do tend to get overrun quickly enough if they are small. Vassalize nations that have around 3-4 provinces and then offer a military alliance. If you can release vassal nations with ~8 provinces (Guyenne from France), then you're in a position to just go on autopilot and let your vassals clean house without your input. To further buff vassals up, ""sell"" them their core provinces you own for 0 ducats.

You can disembark units from your fleet during a naval battle, but not embark them. Example: If you want to go to war with England as France, load up your troops BEFORE declaring war. If you don't, all it will take for you to ragequit is for the English fleet to engage your transport fleet before the troops had time to be loaded on.

**Colonizing:**

You can only colonize an inland province if you have a neighboring owned province, and said inland province is within your colonizing range. Why is this important to know? Say you're England/Great Britain and you want to prevent France from gaining a foothold on North America. You can cockblock them by colonizing each coastal province, preventing the French from gaining access to the inland provinces.

In a war with a nation that isn't fully explored (such as Mali) and you have no conquistadors? No problem! The game allows you to fully explore Terra Incognita provinces without a conquistador as long as they are owned by an enemy. Simply select a unit and click around the Terra Incognita until you get the standard red arrow. Your unit will move as normal and uncover the province, though it will take as much time to explore as a normal TI province with a conquistador.

Tobacco, Sugar, Furs, and Chinaware are all extremely valuable tradegoods, and provinces containing these will be a huge asset to your Centers of Trade. Prioritize colonizing these provinces.

Remember, colonizing will add to your research/stability costs the same as capturing an enemy province will. If you plan on going all out on colonies, keep your income strong to balance out the costs.

See an enemy province that is a colony? You will immediately capture it if you move a unit there. From that point, you can either choose to Burn the Colony to remove it from existence, or Seize the Colony to make it your own for very little infamy. If you seized the colony, send a colonist of your own to that region. As long as the colony wont grow to a full city by the time the colonist arrives, or wont grow to a full city because of the colonist, the entire culture and religion of the colony will change to yours once the colonist arrives. Why should you burn the colony? It takes a very long time for a province to convert culture and religion if you use a missionary, and if the enemy colony is already at 900 population or more, there is no chance of easily converting the culture or religion. You may as well just start over from scratch.

If you start colonizing Africa or the Americas, you might run into some filthy, unwashed ""nations"". You might even engage in skirmishes with these pathetic excuses for savages, resulting in their total annexation. But whatever you do, do not ignore them. They will gain HUGE neighbor bonuses in their research, and you may just find yourself facing the same nation later on that has been properly westernized because you bordered them and didn't do a single thing about it.

Why do you think Austria, Poland, and Novgorod blobs out nearly every game? They have colonists and are bordering a Horde nation. Conquering a Horde nation (Golden Horde for example) is as simple as capturing a province they own, holding it, and then sending a colonist there. Just like normal colonization, once the colony reaches 1000, you now own the province, infamy free. Try to avoid making peace with the enemy before that happens.

**User Interface:**

Always keep the side menu and text log open. The text log can be opened by pressing the + button at the very bottom of the screen, and the side menu can be opened by clicking the menu buttom at the top right of the screen.

Unless you want to look at something specific, stay on Political Mapmode. Not only does the game look nicer and cleaner, but it will REALLY help in war.

Missed something important because you didn't pause the game quick enough? You can set windows or messages to pop up as a window and automatically pause the game. Right click the window in question and choose ""Popup and Pause"", or right click the message in the text log and do the same. Some messages I have set to automatically pause include someone declaring war on me, an enemy ally joining the war, rebellions, colonist results, and battle/siege results. To really make sure you're on top of your game, have the message Popup and Pause whenever an enemy unit starts sieging your territory, otherwise you might just miss out on a stack of rebels that wandered into your lands from somewhere else. You can also set these messages from the options screen.

**Misc:**

When you first start a game, select from the options Lucky Nations to None. Lucky Nations will get several bonuses, and if you are not playing said Lucky Nation (historically, it's the big boys; England, France, Castille, etc), you're only making the game harder for yourself. Once you get a firm grasp on the mechanics of the game, go ahead and make a new game with Lucky Nations.

There's only one firm goal in EU3: Do not get annexed. That's it. Every other goal in the game is self-imposed. Before you start a new game, think to yourself what you want to do with that game. Do you want to have historically accurate borders in North America as England? Do you want to form the Holy Roman Empire as France? Do you just want to blob out everywhere you can as a OPM? Do you want to convert Japan into a Protestant nation? Setting these goals can make for a fun, yet challenging, game. You are not restricted in anything you want to do. You have over 400 years worth of self goals to achieve. Make the game as fun as you want it to be.",,False,self,t5_2su3h,False,,,True,t3_18ex7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/18ex7y/eu3_tips_for_beginners/,

I was participating in the Great War that the USA couldn't join because of truces. So while my massive armies and navy (except for one rather large army in Tennessee) they decided to declare war on me for like the sixth time in the damn game--always for Oklahoma.

I saved and tried to send back a contingent to the mainland while mobilizing, but they were just throwing massive armies at me. I got so annoyed I reloaded the save, clicked on the USA to play, and deleted their entire goddamn military out of rage.

Unfortunately karma came back to bite me in the ass. When you play as another nation even if you keep it paused, your nation will make AI moves regardless. I went back to the CSA and a massive portion of my supreme navy had been disbanded. Despite winning the Confederate-American war I became useless in the Great War that we ended up losing (thankfully with nothing too punishing on me).

In my defense I get super discouraged with Paradox games when I get blindsided on things I should've been prepared for to the point that I want to play much less in the future.

Yesterday I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/ps535/ckii_the_feudal_system_and_its_implications/) on the feudal system featured in Crusader Kings II. Today, my topic will be construction. If you want a summary without any of the thought behind it, just scroll to the end. If not, read on.

In Crusader Kings II you can construct buildings in your county capitals, and in any holdings in the county that belong to your direct vassals.

Construction is a long-time prospect, as it will take very long for most buildings to pay off. As it works on such a large timescale, quite a bit of thought should be put into what you build, where, and when.

**Where**

When constructing buildings, your first priority should be your capital. The reasons for this are two-fold.  
First, your capital will almost always be inherited by your heir, even if you're using Gavelkind succession. This is important, as buildings often won't pay back the investment within a single character's reign.  
Second, your capital will generally have the highest tech level of your holdings, and many technologies enhance the output of your buildings, thus buildings in your capital will repay your investment faster.

Second, you should focus on your own holdings, not your vassal bishoprics and cities. Your own holdings give you their entire income, while vassals will only give you a percentage. In addition, the benefit you get from your vassals is also subject to change in the long term due to changes in opinion, while your own holdings are unaffected.

**What**

Your focus should be on improving your economic situation. The higher your income, the faster you can construct or upgrade your buildings, so while at first you'll lag behind on the military front you will quickly catch up once your economic buildings repay their cost.

After you have reached decent economic capital, with at least Castle Villages in all your holdings, you should go onto upgrading your military capabilities. At this point you should have a pretty high income, so this should be relatively quick to do. As before, concentrate on your capital holding first, then go onto other holdings.

For each military building you construct, your personal military capacity increases, and this capacity will be there for you even in times of crisis, and as such gives you a base military capacity at all times, thus vastly improving your capabilities during civil wars and also helping you in both defensive and offensive wars.

**When**

In general, you want to upgrade your holdings as fast as you can. The quicker you build the sooner your investment is repaid, and the more you can construct in the future as well.

However, you should always keep a reserve. How large this reserve should be depends on your size. Essentially you should imagine the worst possible economic scenario that could happen to your realm, and keep that much money or more in reserve at all times. As a small realm like say, Scotland, having 50 gold in reserve at all times would likely be enough most of the time, but it wouldn't be enough if you suddenly needed to hire mercenaries. As such I would recommend a reserve of 100g at the very least for any realm, as then you'll be able to recruit a band of mercenaries and pay their upkeep for almost four months through your reserve alone.

**The Math**

For the economical buildings, the return on investment is easily calculated.

For the castle town buildings, you get these numbers:

* Level 1, cost 100, income 1.5 - 67 years
* Level 2, cost 120, income 2.0 - 60 years
* Level 3, cost 200, income 2.5 - 80 years
* Level 4, cost 300, income 3.0 - 100 years
* Level 5, cost 400, income 3.5 - 114 years

As you can see, level 2 pays of faster than level 1, but more slowly than level 3. As such, your first goal should be level 2 in all holdings before you upgrade any further.

For the castle wall buildings, you get these numbers:

* Level 1, cost 50, income 0.2 - 250 years
* Level 2, cost 50, income 0.2 - 250 years
* Level 3, cost 100, income 0.2 - 500 years
* Level 4, cost 150, income 0.2 - 750 years
* Level 5, cost 150, income 0.5 - 300 years

On an economical level, only the first two levels will pay of during the duration of a single campaign, so any level beyond that is not worth it on just an economic level, but their other benefits do of course make them worth it.

Now, what also has to be taken into account is that for any town level after 1, you need a certain level of wall, thus giving you these numbers:

* Level 1 town, level 0 wall, cost 100, income 1.5 - 67 years
* Level 2 town, level 1 wall, cost 170, income 2.2 - 77 years
* Level 3 town, level 2 wall, cost 250, income 2.7 - 93 years
* Level 4 town, level 0 wall, cost 300, income 3.0 - 100 years
* Level 5 town, level 0 wall, cost 400, income 3.5 - 114 years

Note that the last two levels of towns do not need further wall upgrades. With wall upgrades taken into account we now get a gradual progression for how long it takes to get a return on your investment, which thus shows us that aiming for level 1 first in all your holdings, then going to the next level and so on, makes the most sense.

**Vassal holdings**

Due to you only getting a percentage of your vassal's income and levies, your own holdings should usually be prioritized. For castles, your own holdings are always higher priority, as they give the exact same benefits except in full. 

While cities give higher revenue per town building than castles, you'll still get less overall due to only getting a percentage of the income.  
Churches and cities however have one building each that can be useful: the monastic school and the university. The monastic school increases your tech growth in the province by 10% at level 1, and 20% at level 2, for a total of 30%, while the university increases tech growth by 20% at level 1 and 30% at level 2, but level 2 comes quite late in the game. This can make a major difference in the long run, so if you favor a tech-based approach to the game, investing in this building can be a good idea.

**A Few Notes**

As long as you have good stewardship, the break-even point for construction will be considerably sooner, as you get 2% more demesne income for every point of state stewardship beyond 5. Thus, at 30 state stewardship, you'll get 50% higher income, reducing the time to reach break-even by one third.

If your succession laws are gavelkind, try to keep your buildings concentrated in your capital duchy, as any other duchy could end up getting inherited by someone other than your heir. Building up a county and then losing it 20 years later due to gavelkind isn't too great an idea.

You can also build new holdings in a county if there are free holding slots. Doing so costs 400 gold, plus 100 gold per holding already in the county. Thus, the lowest possible cost is 500 gold. Cities can bring in quite a bit of money, at a base rate of 12 gold per year. However, even on harsh taxes this will take 75 years to repay itself, and is thus seldom worth it for the gold alone. However, constructing cities or temples does bring the added benefit of more tech growth slots, letting you speed up tech growth even more.
Castles will repay themselves in 166 years, and are as such not worth it for the money alone. Build new castles only if you've maxed out all your other holdings.

**Summary**

* Build in your capital first
* Don't build anything in your vassal holdings, except for monastic schools as long as you have places left to build elsewhere
* For any specific building type, get it to the same level in all your holdings before going to the next
* Prioritize economic buildings over military buildings
* Always keep a reserve of at least 100g, and preferably more
* If you're under gavelkind succession laws, keep your construction within your capital duchy as much as possible",,False,self,t5_2su3h,True,,moderator,True,t3_ptvxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/ptvxl/ckii_construction_where_when_and_what/,

[**Original Thread**](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?678233-Crusader-Kings-II-1.092-PATCH-RELEASED-Checksum-ICBN-NOT-for-problem-reports!)

**CHECKSUM: ICBN**

This patch rebalances Merchant Republics: There is now a limit to how many Trade Posts you can have, based on palace upgrades and the number of adult male dynasty members in your court. ""Family Dues"" are now paid only to adult male dynasty members in your court, and they all receive the same share. Also, the Seize Trade Post plot has been nerfed in several ways (see the change log below.)

NOTE: Due to various unexpected problems in the engine, there are still known issues with multi-player on Mac and Linux. We will solve these for patch v1.10.

There's a well-known tactic to warfare: If you defeat an enemy army, and all available paths are blocked by your own (or allied) armies, the enemy will be completely eradicated.

Because China has a few provinces that has only one way out, you can completely destroy an army with only two of your own armies, without having to deal with the hassle of chasing down the bastards.

Things you need: 2 (or more, if things go horribly wrong) armies strong or balanced enough to take on a 100+ deathstack of levied Infantry, enough Supply techs so one of your two armies in either Qingdao or Weiheiwei will not take attrition, armies guarding all of your own provinces that neighbor China, and a bit of courage.

[Step 1](http://i.imgur.com/xTnMj.jpg): Capture Qingdao AND Weihaiwei, off the coast of Korea. One will act as bait for the enemy army, the other will act as your designated reinforcement point for downtime.

[Step 2](http://i.imgur.com/UAEVM.jpg): Keep one army in your designated reinforcement province. This will be the army that slaughters any enemy that takes the bait. Move your other army to Qingzhou or Yizhou (doesn't matter which). It will be close enough for your standby army to come help if the enemy doesn't take the bait, but far enough that it *can* allow the enemy to take the bait.

[Step 3](http://i.imgur.com/JSjY2.jpg): When an enemy army moves into the bait province, move the army from your designated reinforcement province to attack the enemy, and the other army to Laizhou to cover the escape. When you win the battle, the enemy will be completely eradicated, even if there were survivors, simply because Laizhou has a friendly army and is the only exit.

[Step 4](http://i.imgur.com/L4TYM.jpg): Move your armies back into position and wait for the next victim.

If all goes well, you will have a nice 25% warscore from just the battles alone, enough to take a small region for your own, or free one of their puppet states.

This strategy can also be used in Port Arthur or Hainan (using one army to attack and a fleet to block the straight).",,False,self,t5_2su3h,False,,,True,t3_148vhs,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/148vhs/v2_the_chinese_deathtrap/,

An ambitious liege without patience or genius traits might try to expand too much and start a war they can't win. A just king might do things that will piss off his vassals in the name of justice. And arbitrary rulers will basically ensure a generation of chaos for your realm. Also marriages are not about getting genius children but about political gains and so on. You don't educate your children from the ""best"" guy but rather by the guy you *trust* most (highest relations/matching traits). No ""gaming"" the system.

Has anyone ever done that? How did it turn out? I was considering ireland because they're rather secluded on their island but I'd have to read up a bit because if I decide to roleplay I'd want to adjust for the culture (and religion) of the character too and I don't know much about irish history at all.

Emperor of the not-so-Holy British Empire.",56,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/yl0oj/ck2_miniaar_from_a_humble_welsh_count_to_the/,"At first I wanted to post this on paradox forums, but after reading a few AARs there I figured mine is too small, so I decided to post it here.


Lately theres been a lot of posts bragging about massive empires, and [mine isn't really that big](http://i.imgur.com/dkY1f.jpg) (compared to the [House of Godwin](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/xgdpr/your_largest_empire_in_ck2_screenshot_bragging/c5m6zny)), however, I find my game to be [very special](http://i.imgur.com/nsvM3.jpg).


This was my first game as a Christian ruler since SOI came out, and I picked a small Welsh count. I was really excited to form the new British Empire. Things were going really smooth, and I was King of Wales in no time. Duchy of Brittany and half the Ireland were part of my realm too.


About 100 years into the game I was bashing small counts and dukes in Ireland left and right, when suddenly, I received a message from my court chaplain - he was really impressed with the Fraticelli teachings and wanted me to convert too!


Now, I get a message like that every game I played, but I never had the balls and experience to convert. This time I decided I got what it takes and pressed ""Yes"". Oddly, I became Waldensian instead of Fraticelli. Oh well...

First thing I did as a heretic King was a small research to find out more about Waldensian beliefs. I never really cared about heresies, and I had a very vague idea about who they were and what they did. In my eyes heretics wore black robes with hoods, sacrificed virgins and had ritual intercourses with goats, all in the name of Satan! I mean, why else would the church hunt them down? They must be the bad guys, right? 


Wrong! [Here is a nice read](http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/waldensians) if you are interested. Turns out, heretics are the good guys!


Back to the game - the transition to heresy went pretty smooth. There were no rebellions, and third of the vassals converted on the first day. It slowed my expansion a little, but after ~20 years I was back in business. Now I had a new goal - to destroy Catholics and convert the Europe to one true faith - the Waldensian faith!


Soon I realized that now I have CB on **every piece of land** in the game, what an easy mode! But that was far from the truth. 


After I was done conquering Ireland I set my eyes on Scotland. I quickly learnt that I have no friends and everybody hates me. Even the catholic Queen of England would rather side with filthy Scottish dogs than help her own half-brother! I got completely steamrolled during my first holy war on Scottish lands. Not only England, but the  all Scandinavia kings joined the gang bang too.


I changed my strategy and took the opportunities while England was at war, and pretty soon most of Scottish lands were under my banner. And this is where I hit the brick wall. There were no Catholic kingdom I could attack without them getting help from HRE, England or France. Even if those big boys were busy fighting elsewhere, a single Holy Order was almost as big as my entire army. 


The century of wars was over, and it was time to do some diplomacy. During the next 50 years I installed Waldensian rules in the following kingdoms:


* Denmark


* Norway


* Hungry


* France


* Russia (my dynasty)


* Byzantium (my dynasty)



At first I was a little disappointed because it was rather easy. But then the heretic king of Russia and his entire family were murdered. Oh well, no big deal. The only reason I put the guy there was because *I could*. 

Then the Byzantium Emperor somehow converted back to Catholicism. Hmmm... he is still my kinsman and his descendants will surely help me challenge HRE (spoiler: they never did), so I wasn't too worried about it either.


But then my plans started to fall apart, as Hungry, Denmark and Norway went through bloody civil wars and overthrew my puppets. I thought ""Whatever, I will try again in a few years"". ""No you won't, piss off"" said AI and changed succession laws to Agnatic Elective in all 3 kingdoms. Great.


And France.. France was a cornerstone in my crafty plan. And they were doing great! With my help the French king won a  few civil wars, and reigned for a couple of years. Frenchies were meant to be a fat layer between me and the rest of Catholics. They were supposed to keep HRE at bay while I conquer England and form my Empire. I was already [rubbing my hands](http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/514/003/original/saupload_emperor_palpatine.jpg?1333180850) as I envisaged my bright future, when [this happened](http://i.imgur.com/cVFUw.jpg). And the [aftermath a few years later](http://i.imgur.com/KgQ1b.jpg). I managed to make something good out of it, and took some duchies in France. 

As years went by I took my opportunities and waged holy wars on English infidels while most of the catholic kingdoms were trying to stop Muslims in Iberia (spoilers: they failed). Holy Orders were a big pain the ass, but manageable if I caught them right as they popped with no morale. 


Things were looking great until Pope decided to call another crusade on France. I quickly put my boys on boats and [set sail to capture Rome](http://i.imgur.com/8GIgd.jpg) before HRE would join the war. By the time the German doomstacks reached my lands I already had most of Papacy captured and managed to squeeze in a white peace. PHEW!


My Emperor never forgets and never forgives, so I [took Rome and made Pope Ted my bitch](http://i.imgur.com/XTbme.jpg). Unlike the Pope, Patriarch was a reasonable man and [voluntarily converted to one true faith](http://i.imgur.com/lko7p.jpg)


Now was the time to face the Holy Roman Empire. They were the bastion of Catholicism in Europe, and I wanted them gone. But I couldn't face them in the field, so resorted to a more sneaky approach. First of all I put heretics in charge of a few duchies. Then I picked a loyal Waldensian with very high intrigue and married him matrilinealy to one of the Kaiser's courtiers. He immediately became the spymaster. HAHA! How could the Kaiser be so foolish? This allowed me to assassinate 5 HRE Emperors in 6 years until there was a really bad one in charge. While the civil wars were raging across the realm, I took some lands. But soon my spymaster got kicked out and I run out of gold to hire thugs. 


And then, a miracle happened! As you can see, HRE won a crusade for Jerusalem and [had quite a lot of land in middle east](http://i.imgur.com/p2J7o.jpg). Kaiser got double penetrated by both Shia and Sunny! They called Jihads on Jerusalem at the same time. While breaking all truces, it took me about 60 years of constant Holy wars [to usurp the title](http://i.imgur.com/9xlo1.jpg), which I immediately destroyed, because changing the laws from Elective would have taken too much time. 


After that nothing exciting happened, apart from a [random Sunni Jihad on my lands in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/fvjbi.jpg). I guess the mongrels forgot to [check the ledger](http://i.imgur.com/WLQrt.jpg) before calling it.


Interesting stuff happens when you allow your vassals to pick wifes for themselves. Like [King Bjorn I](http://i.imgur.com/Xtr6s.jpg) of France or [King Cynfyn I](http://i.imgur.com/ylGWz.jpg) of Bavaria. 


I stopped playing because getting my [doomstacks](http://i.imgur.com/cYulj.jpg) together and putting them on boats took longer than the actual fighting, and I was not enjoying it one bit.


**TLDR:** Next time you get an offer to go heretic, accept! It will make your game a lot more challenging and fun!


Thank you for reading.

Of any games on the market, I believe Paradox's are the closest we have to this ideal. 

On this topic, I have chosen to write a paper about Crusader Kings II.

Obviously Crusader Kings II is not inherently designed to teach you anything about history. The primary aim is entertainment. That being said, I think it teaches players quite a lot about medieval politics, geography, and social structures. 

I was wondering if you guys could fill out a quick survey (10 questions) I created for my class. I would love to have some data on the importance of historicity to the community - as well as if this game has impacted your knowledge of Medieval politics/history. 

I've already posted this on the paradox forums but I figure I can get more varied data by posting this here as well. 

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7GQ2KTD

Thanks

---------------

**Edit:**

In response to those interested in the results and the final paper:

Here are the [results](https://www.dropbox.com/s/266mc2nmkz5mug6/CK%20II_Results_Reddit.pdf) so far on Reddit (close to 300 respondents). 

This by no means indicates that the survey is closed; the more data the better!

Also, to clarify, I have already finished the paper for my class on CK II around 1 month ago. I did fairly well, and there is a chance for me to get published.  

This survey is meant to help expand on my prior paper - and hopefully push it along to getting published. If that were to happen, I will certainly post the link here.

In CK2 I was King of Wales and Ireland and my perennially annoying neighbour, the King of Britanny, assassinated my heir. There I sat at a fork in the road. Do I commit the unholy act of savescumming or do I carry on and take terrible vengeance against the Breton King?


I chose the latter.


I started off by killing the heir to Brittany with help from a pissed off spymaster (this was pre-1.05? where all you needed to assassinate someone was 100% plot power and to activate a decision with 90% chance of success). I still didn't feel justified, so I killed his next heir. I rested. 

Not long after this I learnt of a Breton plot to kill me. I went into a fit of rage and proceeded to murder every single person who was of House Crovan that day, even the 2 year old distant relative of the ex-King. That was the day I learnt that I am a terrible person.

1348066098.0,49,self.paradoxplaza,104ypm,5 De Jure Empire in 150 years; A Heretic's Story [x-post from /r/CrusaderKings],53,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/104ypm/5_de_jure_empire_in_150_years_a_heretics_story/,"Greetings, fellow Dukes and Duchesses.

After reading [this mini-AAR] (http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/yl0oj/ck2_miniaar_from_a_humble_welsh_count_to_the/) about a month ago, I was inspired to try my own hand at playing heretic. So far it's been a blast, so I'm writing this partly as a mini-AAR of my own, and partly to help other aspiring heretics out there who might want to overthrow the Pope's cruel yoke (and gain access to the [holy war CB on all Catholic lands](http://imgur.com/HIAyi)).

I used the ruler designer, and I used the console to create culture-restricted kingdoms, but other than that everything is 100% legit. 

Anyhow, I started as [King of Scotland](http://i.imgur.com/Eht3D.jpg), with a demesne limit of 11 but only 1 measly county to my name. The first order of business was obviously to take most of Scotland for myself, so I started by pressing my de jure claims and uniting all of Scotland, whilst punishing any of my unruly vassals (who I had, admittedly, provoked myself) and taking their lands. 

By 1086, [the whole of Scotland was mine](http://i.imgur.com/frpj2.jpg), with three duchies in my personal demesne. Albion, however, wasn't created, so I didn't get an opinion penalty with my vassals.

Meanwhile, I had created an [Antipope](http://imgur.com/a5qdR) as soon as I could. I knew I was going heretic, so I wanted the Antipope to slowly erode Catholicism's authority and give me an opportunity to go heretic as soon as possible. 

While I waited to become a heretic, I waged several wars in Ireland and Wales (by inviting claimants and pressing their claims). My first ruler died, but succession was painless since my heir was also a genius. By roughly 1105, all of both Ireland and Wales were mine, and one of my provinces had become Lollard! I immediately moved my capital there, to better my chances of becoming a heretic. I also considered inviting heretics to court and having one of them educate my heir, but this would prove to be unnecessary as in 1109 I finally got my chance and became a [Lollard](http://imgur.com/ZWjWE). The Pope had lost a Crusade and my Antipope had been buzzing in the faithful's ears for about 20 years at that point, so Catholicism's moral authority was actually at roughly [25%](http://imgur.com/nmO4C) when it happened. 

My first few years as a heretic were rough. I tried to wage war against England, but I was pretty badly outnumbered (even with mercenaries) and quickly had to sue for a white peace. I then tried to take Orkney, but Denmark and Sweden both joined in the war and I had to sue for a white peace again.

Thankfully though, in 1011 there was a [huge revolt](http://i.imgur.com/k0NsP.jpg) in England. I was very scared of France, so before attacking the various English dukes, I cunningly betrothed my heir to the king of France, which I do believe prevented him from joining his coreligionists in their battle against the heretics from the north. 

In any event, I was able to take quite a few duchies, and in 1124 I declared myself [Emperor of Britannia](http://imgur.com/chRcp). I had to break a couple of truces on the way, but it hardly mattered because my character had been maimed in battle and I thought he would die soon. Also notable: I mainly used 'shock and awe' tactics in all these wars; hardly any sieges, only assaults. As a heretic, ending a war early is the best thing you can do.

The next big test of my mettle was in 1127, when the Pope decided he'd had enough of my shenanigans and declared a Crusade against England. I sort of panicked, but it turns out my fears were unfounded; both France and the HRE were busy elsewhere, so the Pope's strongest allies were the [Knights Hospitaller and the King of Poland](http://i.imgur.com/4Mnn9.jpg). Despite my character dying mid-war, I was able to sack Rome and force the Pope to surrender, which reduced his moral authority to almost nothing.

The next step was taking France, which at first I thought would be difficult, since its big neighbor could join in the war at any time. However, I quickly noticed that if the HRE was engaged in a war of its own, it usually wouldn't join any other wars at the same time. So, for the next 30 years, I was very opportunistic; if the HRE wasn't at war, I took land in Iberia or Scandinavia (I was strong enough to fight the various alliances in both areas, although not at the same time). If the opposite was true and the HRE was at war, I took duchies in France.

I was eventually able to take Normandy, Orleans, Anjou, and Valois by 1157, and usurp the Kingdom of France, leading to [this](http://i.imgur.com/jRjcK.jpg) situation. During the mop-up, I realized that Europe had become a real [cesspit of heresy,](http://i.imgur.com/ndjOZ.jpg) so I actually had to press de jure ducal and monarchical claims in some cases, and even fabricate claims in others. 

This proved to be Empress Marjorie's undoing. I noticed that the Duke of Aragon's heir was Catholic while he was not, so I foolishly tried to assassinate him despite his high Intrigue score. He soon got his [revenge](http://imgur.com/oiw2T). 

Anyways, it was pretty smooth sailing from there. Marjorie's heir, Ingram I, has ruled from 1173 to 1215, and is now 61 years old. He waged near-constant holy war all over Christendom, and is now the ruler of [five de jure empires](http://imgur.com/xmvlD), as well as Poland and Lithuania, only 150 years after his great-great granfather Guillaume I first ascended to the throne of Scotland. Moral of the story: why be a good Christian and listen to that silly Pope down in Rome, when you could be a mighty [Lollard](http://imgur.com/zZATQ)?

So that's my story! I've you've made it this far, give yourself a pat on the back, you're a trooper.

I'd love to hear from others who have played as heretics, or who have 
any tips/tricks for playing as a heretic character. It seems to me that starting off is definitely the hardest part; once you become Emperor, the game becomes a little too easy, especially with the Holy War CB. Looking forward to the next patch to hopefully make things a little more interesting for our august purple-wearing personages.

Anyways, I'll end with a nice pic of the [current lands of the de Belley dynasty](http://imgur.com/npVje). Thanks for reading!

To me this seemed a good opportunity to undertake a survey regarding our beloved community. 

The survey will ask about gaming habits, where are we from and also gather a general overview about the community's opinion regarding the current state of the subreddit.

This survey is officially sanctioned by the moderators. I'm the one to collect the information as to keep an impartial and secular bias on the matter.

[You can do the survey here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFV4M0x5YWVNcTZKWVZBWUZVd1dVN2c6MQ)

I will submit the results in exactly one week from today, on **20 May 2013**.

The people you have to keep happy changes, from fellow dukes and kings, to politicians, to men on the street.

Everybody is encouraged to enter for a chance to win a free game. To enter all you do is leave a comment with the name of the game you wish to enter the drawing for. You may only enter the drawing for **one game**. Each game has 2 copies for me to hand out though if you want to have a better chance of winning find a game you like with fewer entries.

I will place all the names in a hat and draw them to determine the winners on Saturday June 16th. You may edit your entry at any time if you change your mind so don't worry about posting early as only the name you have posted on the 16th when I do the drawing will count.

**List of Games you can enter to win:**

*Crusader Kings II*

*Warlock: Master of the Arcane*

*Naval War Arctic Circle*

*King Arthur II*

*Salem Beta Key*

All of these keys (minus Salem) activate on Steam. See you all on the 16th.

**EDIT: I'm gonna need a bigger hat...**

**EDIT 2: Thanks to r0manz we now have 3 beta keys for Salem, everything else is still 2 keys.**

The moderators of /r/ParadoxPlaza are giving away keys to CK2's next expansion, *The Old Gods*. These keys were given to us by Paradox Interactive. 

So, what is the contest about?

You will be designing a header for our subreddit in order to win the competition. The header you design must be aesthetically pleasing, and safe for work. 

---

Here are some basic requirements.

 * Height can be in the range of 84-100px.
 * Width should be scale-able to 1280px and above. 
 * SFW

Note: this is *not* for our Reddit logo. It is to fill in the blue space behind the logo. However, you can get some bonus points if you make a logo and a header that work well together. 

---

The winner will be decided upon by the moderators of /r/ParadoxPlaza.

Essentially, from now on all new comments will have their score hidden for a period of 60 minutes. This should help improve discussions, as it helps prevent votes in the first few minutes from having as large an effect on future votes. People are generally more likely to upvote or downvote a comment based on its current score, so by hiding this for a limited amount of time the initial votes should be based more on quality rather than luck.

The hope is that this will help keep discussions open to all viewpoints, and help reduce the factor time of posting has on comment ranking, without being an obstruction to the use of the subreddit.

Edit: In a week, there'll be another thread where everyone can say how, if at all, this has affected their browsing experience.

I play CK2 and record it almost every day and I have quite a few videos on the game so far (400+).

1363244868.0,40,self.paradoxplaza,1a9tif,[/r/paradoxplaza] Official Discussion: What kind of content do we as a sub-reddit find acceptable and where do we go from here?,48,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1a9tif/rparadoxplaza_official_discussion_what_kind_of/,"I feel its time we as a community sat down and had a chat. /r/paradoxplaza has grown greatly in the time it has been around and I am happy to say that we are one of the larger Paradox communities on the web. I have seen many people introduced to these kind of games while here and even veterans getting their questions answered.

Recently though there seems to be fewer and fewer posts about official Paradox related news/discussions and more image posts. I enjoy the occasional history joke as much as the next guy and there are some great After-Action-Reports that are put up as a mixture of image galleries/written stories however the number of random image posts has grown greatly and they are starting to occupy a majority of the front page for the subreddit. 

Now the question I pose to all of you is as such: *What content do you find appropriate for /r/paradoxplaza and why? Do you wish there were more or less of certain kinds of post?*

Let's keep this discussion nice and civil as I want everybody's opinion on this so we can lay down some new ground rules if the community feels we need them. We have so far been mature enough to self moderate but if we need a list of rules displayed on the sidebar ---&gt; then we can get those put up as well.

**Edit: It seems the general consesus so far is that we don't need to worry about anything yet. The community is capable of controlling itself and gives it the content it demands. Sorry if I appeared so negative about the whole thing I just wanted to address any concerns and make sure we plan for the future. The only real rule out of this is no random non-paradox content/memes which was really already an unofficial rule. How do you guys feel about people discussing games that are similar to Paradox games but not done by Paradox? Does that fly, should we suggest a different subreddit for that, or do we take it on a case-by-case basis?**

**I am glad to see everybody enjoys the community we have here and you all ensure that it stays a healthy community. The hardest thing I have to do as a moderator around here is checking the damn spam filter after it gobbles up some appropriate post.**",,False,self,t5_2su3h,1363288474.0,,moderator,True,t3_1a9tif,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1a9tif/rparadoxplaza_official_discussion_what_kind_of/,

If you don't have a casus belli against an independent realm, you cannot go to war against it. If you do have one you can go to war, but what happens upon winning, losing, or stalemating the war depends upon the casus belli you are pushing. In any single war you can only push a single casus belli, so you should make sure to push whichever casus belli benefits you the most. With the exception of the Tribal Invasion CB, all CBs incur a 10-year truce. Do note that truces only apply to a specific character, and only the attacker is restricted. So if the attacker or defender dies, the truce is moot, and the defender can attack back at any time.

**The Basics**

If you don't have a casus belli against an independent realm, you cannot go to war against it. If you do have one you can go to war, but what happens upon winning, losing, or stalemating the war depends upon the casus  belli you are pushing. In any single war you can only push a single casus belli, so you should make sure to push whichever casus belli benefits you the most. With the exception of the Tribal Invasion CB, all CBs incur a 10-year truce.

**Claim CBs**

Most casus belli, if one discounts rebellion CBs, are based around claims. If you or one of your vassals have a claim upon a title in a realm, you can push this claim through war. If you have multiple personal claims upon a single realm you can push all of them at once, but you can only push a single claim for any other character per war.

If you have a claim upon a title you have a certain 'right' to this title. Upon winning a claim war you, or the person you were pushing the claim for, will gain this title, and if you were pushing it for someone their opinion of you will increase by 100, and you'll gain 100 prestige. If it ends in a stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if it ends in loss, the claim will be lost in addition to 200 prestige. When pushing a vassal's claim and losing you'll have to pay concessions.

**De Jure CBs**

If you or a vassal hold a duchy, where part of this duchy is owned by another independent realm, you can push a de jure claim upon one of the counties held by the other realm. Even if the other realm holds more than one county you can only push a single de jure CB at once.

Unlike regular claims, de jure claims cannot be lost unless you lose control of the duchy. Losing a war merely means a loss of 200 prestige, while you'll still keep the de jure CB. If you win you'll gain the county as a vassal, or if you were pushing the de jure claim for someone else they'll gain the county as a vassal, have their opinion of you increased by 100, and you'll gain 100 prestige. When pushing a vassal's claim and losing you'll have to pay concessions.

**Change Law CBs**

There are several CBs based around changing realm laws, both crown and succession law. In total there are five, changing to Gavelkind, Elective, Seniority, or Primogeniture, and lowering crown authority.

The first four can be used on your liege as long as they don't have the succession type in question. The lower crown authority CB can be used on your liege if he's a king or emperor. You cannot use these CBs more than one step up the chain, so if for example you're a vassal of the King of Bohemia you cannot try to lower crown authority in the Holy Roman Empire.

If you win the war, the law in question will be instituted. If you stalemate or lose you'll lose 100/200 prestige.

**Independence CB**

As long as you're someone's vassal, you can try to achieve independence through war. If you win you'll be independent and if the liege you're rebelling from is a king or emperor, crown authority will be lowered one step. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll be imprisoned and lose 200 prestige. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Depose Liege CB**

As long as no one else is trying to depose your liege, and your liege is not attempting to depose someone else or declaring independence, you can attempt to depose your liege. Upon victory crown authority will be lowered by one step (if the deposed liege is a king or emperor), and your liege will depose to the eligible heir you like the most. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll be imprisoned and lose 200 prestige. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Overthrow Ruler CB**

As long as you're someone's vassal, you can try to overthrow him and take the title for yourself. Upon victory you'll gain the title and some prestige, and if the ruler you overthrew was a king or emperor, crown authority will go down one step. In addition, if your liege held any other titles, he'll be forced to abdicate them to his heir. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll lose 200 prestige and be imprisoned. Like with changing law, you cannot use this CB more than one step up the chain.

**Dispute Succession CB**

If you're a pretender to your liege's throne, or someone in your realm is a pretender to any throne, you can dispute the succession. Upon victory you (or the person you disputed the succession for) will gain the throne, and if it was a kingdom or empire crown authority will be reduced by one. White peace is impossible. If you lose, you'll be imprisoned, lose 200 prestige, and lose the claim.

**Invasion CB**

If you have a claim upon a throne or you're smaller than the realm in question (that is, you have fewer holdings in your realm), and the Pope condones your invasion (costing you 500 piety), you can use the invasion CB. Upon victory you'll get the throne in question, 400 prestige, and every occupied holding. As such, you should occupy every holding before enforcing demands, as then you can install your own nobles. If you stalemate you'll lose 100 prestige. If you lose you'll lose 200 prestige, and have to pay concessions, and you'll lose your claim upon the throne.


**Tribal Invasion CB**

You'll never get to use this CB unless you mod the game. It essentially just lets tribes like the Golden Horde and the Timurids attack anyone they neighbor, and take their lands. It works the same as the invasion CB for the most part. Any outcome incurs a mere 1-year truce.

**Crusade CB**

If the Pope has called a crusade, you can declare war upon the target. Upon victory you will gain all holdings (as long as they're occupied by you, or unoccupied) in the targeted duchy and 100 piety. If you stalemate you'll lose 50 piety and 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll lose 150 piety and 200 prestige.

**Religious War CB**

If you're in a different religious group than your target, your target is heretic, or you are heretic, you can declare a religious war. Upon victory you'll gain 50 prestige and all holdings (as long as they're occupied by you, or unoccupied) in the targeted duchy. If you stalemate you'll lose 50 piety and 100 prestige, and if you lose you'll lose 150 piety, 200 prestige, and be forced to pay concessions.

**Religious Assistance CB**

If another realm in your religion is being targeted by a Religious War CB, you can declare war upon the aggressor. The point of this is merely to prevent your own religion from shrinking. Winning the war will give you 50 piety and prestige, stalemating will lose you 50 piety and 100 prestige, and losing will losing will lose you 150 piety, 200 prestige, and you'll be forced to pay concessions.

**Excommunicated Ruler CB**

If someone has the same head of religion as you, and has been excommunicated, you can declare war upon them. Victory will give you 10 to 70 piety and 50 to 400 prestige depending on the excommunicated ruler's rank, and the target will be re-communicated and forced to abdicate. A white peace will lose you 50 piety and 100 prestige. Losing will lose you 100 piety, 200 prestige, and you'll be forced to pay concessions.",,False,self,t5_2su3h,True,,moderator,True,t3_q2qwb,http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/q2qwb/ckii_claims_and_casus_belli_expanding_your_realm/,

For me, I always establish a protectorate over Abu Dhabi during the mid-game before oil is discovered, guaranteeing me access to at least some oil for my fuel factories before synthetic oil tech is unlocked. 

During colonization I focus first on Warri and its two neighboring provinces as these always seem to change to rubber later and will use as many colonial points as I can reasonably use to ensure I get those provinces.  Late game rubber is a key to military superiority and getting this as opposed to wool/grain/cattle areas of Africa pays dividends later.

I always try, if possible, to grab one or two Chinese provinces before they westernize to encourage soldiers there to keep my army as large as possible by shipping most of these troops back to fight in the homeland.

I have never signed the Geneva Convention, the tiny infamy reduction isn't worth the hit to military spending for the rest of the game in my opinion.  (Side note: National Banking Act is the most useless decision of them all)

I try to colonize the Pacific territories purely to release them later for the -5 infamy.

Going for most/all of Sokoto pre-1870 to set myself up to quickly colonize most of Africa.

I always try to help the South win the Civil War. (pre-HoD you could intervene if you influenced them to friendly, now that HoD changed that, the only way is through war subsidies and declaring war on USA and chasing down and destroying all their armies allowing the South a chance, then peace out with whatever I can get).
