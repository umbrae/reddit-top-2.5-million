1376578839.0,151,self.sanantonio,1kf6pm,Corruption in San Antonio,198,47,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1kf6pm/corruption_in_san_antonio/,"In 1982 the City of San Antonio created a monthly billing account (commonly known as the variable) to consolidate and pay monthly department phone bills received from SBC (the phone company). 


Corrupt City employees and officials discovered that the unaudited account provided unlimited clandestine access to City Department, State grant and Federal grant telecommunications budgets. They discovered that they could spend money on anything they wished (including criminal schemes) and the Finance Department would simply transfer the funds to the IT Department- no questions asked.
 
They circumvented the law, the City Charter, the Texas Local Government Code, OMB regulations, etc. when they submitted fraudulent requests to the Finance Department under the guise of paying the monthly phone bills when in fact they were obtaining funds with no competitive bidding, no Council approval, no public review, no vote, no ordinance, no audit, no accountability, etc. that they spent on anything they wished having nothing to do with telephones, grants, 911, etc. The “variable” account grew with every illegal transaction until it totaled about $ 5.2 million annually.
 
 
As the City’s new Telecommunications Manager I discovered that the IT department had over 240 employees BUT the “telephone/pager/cell phone/voice group had just 5 employees and almost no money. Months of research exposed the illegal scheme to drain telephone budgets across the board over the past decades. Every report, audit, ledger, etc. I touched was false. I reported the fraud and theft that crippled my ability to support the City’s phone- 911 systems. The City immediately began to hide the crimes rather than investigate and expose the long term theft and fraud. They have been lying ever since (many times under oath in court and in sworn depositions/affidavits) to hide the massive fraud. The City removed my civil service protection in February 2006 and terminated me with no reason and no public hearing. They needed to keep the fraud/theft secret.
 
Three years later the City conspired to defraud our courts in a February 2009 whistleblower trial when city attorney Deborah Klein and attorney Mark Kosanovich coached numerous City witnesses to lie under oath to hide the three decades of criminal activity and ongoing illegal cover-up. I learned that as I reported the crimes to DA Reed her office was sending my information over to the City. Corrupt City Attorney Bernard and his staff took every crime and fabricated a CYA story to justify or hide the illegal act. The whistleblower trial was a series of soap opera/novella performances by City employees involved in the fraud/cover-up orchestrated for the court by corrupt city attorney Deborah Klein. CIO Richard Varn told the critical lies and others followed in his footsteps. Super Lawyer Malinda Gaul sat by and allowed the fraud to continue, never objected, never called for a mistrial, and refused to call for a new/fair trial. Gaul, Klein, Kosanovich, City Attorney Bernard, Judge Antonia Arteaga, Police Chief William McManus, City Manager Sheryl Sculley and many others have proof of the subornation of perjury, aggravated perjury, and obstruction BUT ignore it and continue the illegal cover-up. They must keep the crimes secret.
 
 
My appeal was denied as Super lawyer Malinda Gaul purposefully refused to preserve the error and never objected to anything. If there was no objection than the appeals court cannot even look at anything. We filed the appeal to preserve our right to ask for a review once the corruption is exposed and the lying within our local government and law enforcement community is halted.
 
DA Reed, Police Chief McManus, Sheriff Ortiz, etc. have proof of the fraud and ongoing criminal cover-up but refuse to reply to calls, letters, etc. They stall in an effort to allow the statute of limitations to expire as in the case of Watergate – the illegal cover-up has snared too many top level crooks. They must keepm the crimes/cover-up secret.
 
 
In June I filed police reports with SAPD and BCSO and delivered documents to City Hall proving the crimes and cover-up. My wife and I delivered the documents and set up meetings with Councilpersons with no problem, no disturbance, nothing. Within days on July 1, 2009 two SAPD officers came to my home and served me with a criminal trespass warning baring entry into City Hall and Council Meetings. Chief McManus and City Attorney Bernard signed the illegal/unconstitutional ban BUT will provide no reason, time limit, due process hearing, etc. Bernard has lied and stalled any effort by Attorney Edward Pina to get the ban lifted. He can't afford to have the crimes, the cover-up, his role in the criminal conspiracy, etc. made public.
 
On the night of July 4, 2011 – Independence Day- after 10pm two SAPD officers with the Mental Health Division came to my home to perform a mental health assessment. They routed my wife and me along with my neighbors from our beds. My wife and I spoke to the officers for almost two hours. Once Officer Ned Bandoske realized that he was being used to harass and intimidate a law-abiding citizen who had committed no crime, caused no disturbance, threatened no one, etc. he apologized and said that he was embarrassed. He published a factual report on July 5, 2011 stating that there was evidence of no mental problems and that the allegations I discussed with him were backed up with documentation and that I was credible. SAPD has this report - SAPD 11167835/SAPD-2011-0702097 – on file since July 5 BUT still refuses to acknowledge the fraud/theft and cover-up. We believe that the City was attempting to fabricate some justification for the 25 month illegal ban making ALL Council meetings since July 1, 2009 illegal and ALL city business voidable. Officer Bandoske refused to participate in the criminal cover-up and told the truth - a first for the SAPD !
 
SAPD and the City ignore letters asking why Mental Health Division officers are available to harass law-abiding citizens who report public/police corruption BUT couldn’t assist mentally ill citizen Pierre Abernathy who recently died at the hands of the SAPD on August 4, 2011.
 
 
Editor Elaine Wolff with the SA Current wrote a few very informative articles BUT when she left any support from the Current evaporated.
 
The Express News refuses to cover the story, routinely erases any comments and bans anyone posting this information. Editor Rivard personally blocked emails containing information proving the crimes and cover-up.
 
KSAT and WOAI refuse to cover the story and sometimes censor comments.
 
The public/police corruption should have been exposed six years ago. The criminals inside the City should have been terminated and prosecuted. Efforts should have been made to locate and recover our money.
 
Instead, the corruption, fraud, theft, cover-up continues. The list of criminal conspirators grows.

1314158408.0,95,self.sanantonio,jsi9p,Things I like about San Antonio,103,8,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/jsi9p/things_i_like_about_san_antonio/,"It seems like the most common comments in r/sanantonio are ""San Antonio Sucks!"" and ""Austin Rules!"" I enjoy Austin as much as I enjoy any other city. However, I live in San Antonio and there is a lot to enjoy, you just might have to look a little harder because SA is kind of big. That being said, I have compiled a list of things and places to share. I have tried to focus on local establishment, whenever possible, in SA and surrounding areas. The items on this list are my opinions, and I am in no way affiliate with any of the establishments listed below.

For news junkies, SA has the best [public radio station](http://www.tpr.org/). I feel smarter every time I turn on the radio.

For you moviegoers, there are [Three Alamo Drafthouses](http://drafthouse.com/san_antonio), There is also the [Santikos Bijou](http://www.santikos.com/bijouex.php) for independent and art house films.

For people who want something to do Saturday morning, [Pearl](http://www.atpearl.com/), has a huge farmer’s market. Pearl also has other activities throughout the year.

For museum lovers, there is [the McNay](http://www.mcnayart.org/), [the Witte](http://www.wittemuseum.org/), and [SAMA](http://www.samuseum.org/) just to name a few.

For a nice stroll, there is [the Botanical Garden](http://www.sabot.org/), [the Japanese Tea Garden](http://www.sanantonio.gov/parksandrec/directory_japanese.aspx), and the newly opened extended [River Walk](http://www.sanantonioriver.org/) now with less tourists.

For your coffee fix, there is [Local Coffee](http://www.localcoffeesa.com/), [Olmos Perk](http://www.olmosperk.com/), [Mad Hatter’s](http://www.madhatterstea.com/), and [The Foundry](http://www.thefoundry-sa.org/) just to start the list.

If you like a large beer selection you might want to check out [the Friendly Spot](http://www.thefriendlyspot.com/index.html), [the Flying Saucer](http://www.beerknurd.com/stores/sanantonio/), [the Tap Exchange](http://www.thetapexchange.com/), or [the Esquire Tavern](http://www.esquiretavern-sa.com/).

If micro-brews are more your thing, then [Freetail](http://www.freetailbrewing.com/), [Blue Star](http://www.bluestarbrewing.com/index.html), or if you don’t mind a drive [the Dodging Duck](http://www.dodgingduck.com/) might be up your alley.

For music [Backstage Live](http://backstagelivesa.com/), [the White Rabbit](http://sawhiterabbit.com/), [Olmos Bharmacy](http://www.olmosbharmacy.com/), [Sam’s Burger Joint](http://samsburgerjoint.com/), and [Cowboys Dancehall](http://www.cowboysdancehall.com/San-Antonio/) to round out the list.

If it is breakfast you want, there is [Twin Sisters](http://twinsistersbakeryandcafe.com/), [Candlelight](http://www.candlelightsa.com/) , [Guenther House](http://www.guentherhouse.com/), or [Magnolia](http://www.magnoliapancakehaus.com/).

If you are the outdoorsy type, stop by [Good Sports and Good Sports Outlet](http://www.goodsports.com/), or [Whole Earth](http://www.wholeearthprovision.com/locations.php?loc=sanantonio) before you head out to one of the many [Texas State parks ](http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/parkguide/) that are only a short drive away. 

Not included on this list are the millions of places that everyone knows about, like, you know, the River Walk, the Alamo and other missions, Sea World, Six Flags, etc. 

Here are some more links to help guide you.
[SA Current](http://sacurrent.com/),
[SA Arts](http://www.sahearts.com/),
[SA Parks and Rec](http://www.ci.sat.tx.us/parksandrec/), and
[SA Visitor’s Guide](http://visitsanantonio.com/visitors/play/history-heritage/historic-sites/index.aspx)

Just some food for thought, if you are one of the [28.9% Non-Hispanic Whites in San Antonio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio), chances are some [Austin hipster is jealous of you.]( http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/02/20/71-being-the-only-white-person-around/) (This is a joke because nobody from Austin could ever be jealous of someone in San Antonio.)



Edit 1: Since people looking at r/sanantonio are probably going to see this, I am going to try and include some of  the places you mention on this list. Thanks for the positive response.

UPDATE: This response is amazing to see, wow, thank you guys for any assistance to this. A friend reached out, and I offered to help.  she had mentioned that her friend who is a cop said that the family had been receiving threats. She doesn't use reddit and thought to reach out even more. If they don't show, it would be even better for the family. Just reaching out.

What I see there leads me to believe that a slightly larger than small percentage of parents have absolutely no intelligence whatsoever when it comes to keeping their kids safe. Sunday, a pedophile was removed from Six Flags. Two weeks ago, one was removed from Sea World. When you let your 8 year old run around unsupervised, this is what you're exposing him or her to.

Aside from that, there are so many idiot teenagers it's ridiculous. Yesterday I had to fish a little boy, about 5, from the wave pool at Six Flags where he was drowning. His genius mother had dumped him in while she sat sunning herself, without a life vest, and three moronic teens were throwing each other in the water on top of him and other children. The lifeguards, by the way, were too busy bobbing their heads and socializing to do their jobs.

Seriously, if you can't watch 'em, don't have 'em. I'm a stranger--I shouldn't have to babysit your offspring. &lt;/vent&gt;

A lot of people are behind this issue. But as many people have pointed out in the comments section, the easiest way to get rid of Lamar Smith would be to vote him out of office. It's an election year after all.

However, we still need to raise awareness and get people to vote. 

The guys featured in the operation video are shown putting up a bunch of stickers. That will appeal to a certain demographic, but I think we should aslo shoot wider. Obviously, we're not going to convince most San Antonians to vote against Lamar Smith, but we only need to convince more to vote against him than for him.  

I think as a first step, we should coordinate some event or display that is creative and funny to gather the attention of local news stations. In San Antonio, they're always hungry for new stories and they'll cover us if it's good enough.

Is anyone with me or am I alone in my desire to vote out Lamar Smith?

Does anyone have any ideas as to what we should coordinate?

EDIT: As one of the few democrats who live in his district, it pains me to say it, but badalchemist is right, the best chance we have is to vote for a different Republican in the primary.

Truthfully, we probably won't be able to vote him out, but I think we should still try. Worst case scenario, we raise awareness and maybe shame him.

So again, any ideas?",,False,self,t5_2qqch,True,,,True,t3_p9aa9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/p9aa9/lets_organize_a_serious_effort_to_vote_out_lamar/,

Please take the time to read.,93,25,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1ftxz1/the_girl_with_the_billy_bobs_beds_post_wants_one/,"I posted the story of Billy Bob confronting my father about his service dog in the store. Most of you took the story how it was meant to be perceived. Most of you understand the wrong doing in that situation. 

But to be honest, I was absolutely shocked to realize how many of you just have not learned what it means to have, no, NEED a service dog. It's not your fault you haven't had the reason to know a service dog personally and that's a lucky thing. 

Part of me thinks this is none of your fucking business, but part of me thinks about some of you running into my dad and his dog at the local San Antonio HEB, post office, whatever, and it makes me sad for him. I would like to know that, as his daughter, I tried to help at least some of you understand his situation and others like him. I would really appreciate it if you would read what I have written for you, and I welcome any further questions.

My father broke his neck in 2006. His spinal cord is permanently damaged at his C5 vertebrae making him what they call a ""super quad"". The link below will give you an idea of what his body is capable of. It's not much. He is put in a motorized wheelchair every morning but since he cannot keep himself sitting up, he has seat belts across his chest. This makes it impossible for him to bend over to pick anything up off the floor. His chair is pretty tall anyways, so even if he had any control over his core, he still probably wouldn't be able to reach it.

His hands remain open and flat. Try to carry out your everyday activities with flat hands and not drop one thing. It is not possible and it sucks.

All of that being said, he can thankfully still power his wheelchair by himself and drive a very expensive, very modified minivan. If he were to drop his keys inside his minivan, with his ramp still up (which has happened probably more times than he's admitted to, he would have to wait for someone to walk close enough to his van and hope to get their attention. We all know it gets pretty fucking hot in parking lots around this time of the year....and all the other times too I guess.

Quadriplegics cannot regulate their own body temperature and if they get too hot or too cold, they can go into Autonomic Dysreflexia, a life threatening condition that requires immediate care. I've included a link for this as well.

This dog is necessary. We are not abusing the system, nor do we condone those that do. We are completely covered by the ADA, but due to pure ignorance, we get harassed everyday. I do not blame you for being ignorant on an issue you have not been a part of personally. But please, learn something from this.

Not all service dogs are large breeds. If my dad's dog was a large breed, he would not be able to jump up in his lab to set things in his hands.

Not all small dogs are ""comfort dogs"". This schnauzer went to school for almost a year and works his fucking ass off.

That dog IS the reason my dad doesn't need a nurses aid with him at all times. He is the reason my dad has what little independence is left in his life.

I was planning on asking my girlfriend to marry me. 

The restaurant was extremely hot inside, at least 85 degrees if not hotter. It was packed, and for what is obviously supposed to be a dressy place, there were loads of people in flip flops and t-shirts. It took at least 10 minutes for the waiter to get us much-needed water, and by the time we got our cocktails I had already proposed and we had figured out our entrees. 

Fortunately a family was sitting next to us and were kind enough to take our picture right after I proposed to her and she said yes.

When the waiter finally after another 20 minutes came by with our appetizer and got the WRONG ORDER, my fiance was so upset she insisted we complained to the manager, got comped and left. At least the manager was kind enough to let us walk for free. 

We went to our favorite restaurant, J. Alexander's, and realized we should have gone there in the first place. I was wanting to go for something over-the-top wonderful, and Charter House is not that place. Extremely disappointed, do not go, but at least I got a fiance out of the deal!

It is not at all in the interest of neighborly politeness to leave carts wherever or push them in between two cars when you could easily just put it away. A run-away cart can do a surprising amount of non-deductible damage.  Cart left in spaces between cars can cause sudden braking accidents in parking lots (same goes for motorcycles parked too far back).

Its not the job of the cart people to do a total round-up of random carts around the lot.  Go try that once when you have some time.  Its freakin' impossible!  Its their job to go to the corral and push them up to the front because that is hard enough.   

I went back North for Christmas and noticed the farther south I went the less organized the carts in the parking lots and Wal-Mart on 410 in San Antonio is absolutely the worst I saw in 12 states.

I have been a stay at home father since March of this year because my girlfriend had a better paying job, and she started having health problems. So we agreed that it would be best if I stay home and take of the kids and the house and things of that nature. I am also a full time college student and Hallmark College in the evenings. I will have my CCNA certification along with my associates degree in applied science in august of 2014. The problem is that my girlfriend has decided to pack up and move to Utah with her father at the end of this month (july) leaving myself and my 2 children homeless. I have been looking for a job since may of this year and have found nothing at all. I just need 1. a place for myself and my children to stay for maybe a couple of months until I can get some sort of job going and get us back on our feet, and a job. I will be more than happy to payback any kind of kindness that we receive after I finish school and can get a much better job than anything out there for me at this point. My children are 10 and 9 years old and very well behaved. They are both in Gifted classes in school. They both love to help around the house in any way that they can. I am scared. I don't know what else to do. Is there anyone that can help us out? If there is anyone out there that can help us out in any way please let me know.

Any of you interested in sharing some of them that you know about?  Here are a few that I know.  Anyway, I was thinking that it could make for a fun date to check out these kind of odd places around town, but much of the things listed around the interwebs are vague, out of date, or inaccessible without some sort of permission.  If y'all know of any more, please post!

**Places I Know Exist and have been to.**

1.  The Ghost Tracks

Located near the intersection of [Villamain and Shane Road](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=&amp;daddr=29.317227,-98.443423&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=mift&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=18&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=29.319089,-98.443422&amp;spn=0.010196,0.01929&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=ddw1&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all).  Legend has it that a bus got stuck on these train tracks and all of the kids died as a train hit the bus.  The streets in the neighborhood near the tracks has street names that are named after the kids that died.  If you park your car on the edge of the tracks, put it in neutral and even turn the car off, the ghosts of the kids will push you across the tracks to keep you safe.  It's kind of creepy because the tracks actually rise up and your car is pushed up hill and over the tracks.

2.  Ed Clark's Place (Crazy Christmas Guy)

Located at [14106 Short Horn Street](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=14106+Short+Horn+Street&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=29.569837,-98.38495&amp;spn=0.010171,0.01929&amp;sll=29.570008,-98.385158&amp;sspn=0.00064,0.001206&amp;hnear=14106+Short+Horn+St,+San+Antonio,+Bexar,+Texas+78247&amp;t=m&amp;z=16).  From what I understand, Ed Clark's wife died and she loved Christmas.  In her memory, he keeps the whole yard decorated for Christmas year round.  Ed can be seen around the area, like HEB and stuff, wearing a white fur trimmed red sombrero.  I have heard that if you are brave enough to knock on the door and ask, he will turn on the lights for you.  While I have been there several times, I have never asked though, so that may not be true.  (you can get a good look with google street view)

3.  Peacock Subdivision

I went here back in the 90's, but don't remember where it is.  I think somewhere over by the medical center or maybe near Ingram park mall?  (If you know, PLEASE POST, I have been looking for this place for years)  Anyway, there is a subdivision that is literally crawling with real peacocks that the residents feed and keep around.  The story that I heard is that there used to be a small ranch across from the subdivision but the owner died, leaving the peacocks to fend for themselves.  They eventually left the ranch and took up roost in the neighborhood.  I did not know this, but peacocks are freaking loud and they actually roost in trees.  I really thought that they were just lawn decorations until I saw one jump into a tree.

**Places that I have heard of, but have not been or cannot verify**

1.  Toy Tree Lady

Rumor has it that there is some crazy lady, I think on the west or southwest side, that has a bunch of kids toys hung from the tree in her front yard.  Apparently kids say that they are the toys that other kids were playing with when they wandered into her yard and were killed by the lady.  I suppose that the toys in the tree are supposed to be a warning to other kids.

2.  TRO Bridge

Located [here](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.976735,-98.845995&amp;ll=29.967427,-98.75267&amp;spn=0.324191,0.617294&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=0x865bf34b316176c7:0xb90eb2db6d69febf,29.976735,-98.845995&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=11).  It is well outside of San Antonio, but it sounds pretty scary and cool enough to be included.  Supposedly if you walk across the bridge and look down, you feel hands grabbing at your ankles.  Creepy!

3.  Old Mental Hospital

* **Reason for Take In:**  Routine Oil Change

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 196474

* **Details of Take In:**  Took vehicle in for a routine oil change

* **Result:** Was informed that there was an oil leak.  Suggested Oil Pan Gasket and Valve Cover Gasket replacement.


2nd Visit:
* **Date:**  12/11/2012

* **Reason for Take In:**  Routine Oil Change 

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201009

* **Details of Take In:** Took a vehicle in for an oil change. Was informed car barely had any oil due to a MAJOR oil leak that needed attention ASAP or the engine would go out (at this time was told it was leaking at oil pan gasket and valve cover gasket).  *This is the ONLY issue with my car notated at this point.*

* **Result:** Paid for parts upfront to ensure I would be back to get work completed.


3rd Visit:
* **Date:** 12/13/2012

* **Reason for Take In:** To Complete work to fix leak at oil pan gasket and valve cover gasket

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202000  (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 202000 would indicate that I had driven almost 1000 miles within two days---a Tues-Thurs, in which I work 8am-5pm M-F---Where did I drive 1000 miles within less than 2 days?)

* **Details of Take In:**  Take car in, in the morning to get work done, pick up in the afternoon after work.

* **Result:** Mention now of air intake hose needs replacement. *(No mention of this notated the two previous times vehicle was in shop)*



4th Visit:
* **Date:** 12/26/2012

* **Reason for Take In:**Car is leaking considerate amounts of oil onto driveway and street

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201963 (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 201963 now shows that I lost 37 miles from the last Mileage recorded?  This concerns me when they are offering a warranty.)

* **Details of Take In:** Was informed correcting initial problem caused more pressure throughout the engine and because of that, blew out more gaskets including rear main seal gasket. I notice there is STILL oil leaking (in fact, a little more than originally) so I took it back only to be told that since I corrected the first problem, by replacing those gaskets, it created more oil pressure and caused another two gaskets to blow (including Rear Main Seal). The original estimate given to me for the second job was well over $600 dollars.  One of the managers named DANIEL (Argenal) suggested I replaced my oil pump because it wasn't working.  When I had him repeat the exact same things to my husband (as I knew I couldn't repeat all of it word for word), and my husband inquired as to if the oil pump was working, Daniel changed his story and then said to him, ""Well it works, but it's not as smooth as it should be."" (ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?!)  He JUST told me it wasn't working, but then tells my husband something completely different when he inquires about it?  I honestly feel because I am a woman he figured I wouldn't know anything.  My husband tells him to just do the work we had agreed on in the first place, and just get it out of there (because at this point, we do not trust them anymore). 

* **Result:** Paid additional $440.03 to repair newly blown gaskets (including Rear Main Seal gasket)


5th Visit:
* **Date:** 01/04/2013

* **Reason for Take In:** Car is now leaking massive amounts of oil onto driveway and street. Except this time, it's MUCH worse than it was when I first initially took it in!

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 201963 (&lt;---This Mileage recorded at 201963 AGAIN, would indicate that I did not drive ONE mile between the dates of 12/26/2013 – 01/04/2013 --- NOT possible.)

* **Details of Take In:**  I take it back, this time, a different manager named MATT (Crain) takes over.  I have no problems leaving it over night, I just want the problem FIXED.  After not receiving a call the next day after they'd been open for 5 hours, I finally call them to inquire about the status of it, only to be asked by Matt, **""Did you add more oil to the car?""**  ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?!  NO!!!! THE ONLY PEOPLE TO REMOTELY TOUCH MY CAR AND IT'S ENGINE PARTS WERE YOU GUYS!!!  So he explains there was an extra quart of oil in the car and that's what was causing the re-leak.  **How the heck do I know those ""mechanics"" there didn't put in an extra ½ quart the FIRST time and that's what caused the other gaskets to fail/blow?!**   

* **Result:** Was told that correct amount of oil was replaced and no other issues were found at that time.  


6th Visit: 
* **Date:** 01/05/2013

* **Reason for Take In:**  Went in because car was now smoking and makes whistling sound while driving or in idle. 

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202198  

* **Details of Take In:** When I picked up the vehicle the day before, I did not receive any paper work.  I asked for the paperwork for the day prior for my own records.  This was when I was now informed that it was just left over oil drippings from replacing the valve cover gasket the day before, which was defected--which in turn, caused the leak (this is the first time I am learning that any repair work was done to my car the day before other than the replacement of the correct amount of oil---If this is the case why wasn’t my correct mileage updated to reset the warranty?).
  
* **Result:**  Cleaned the bottom of the car thoroughly to stop the smoking.  Was informed whistling sound came from Air Intake Hose that needed replacement (although it needed replacement prior to this, it had not started whistling until now). 




At this time, learning of the valve cover gasket replacement due to it being defected, I confronted the manager about it.  I asked him again, WHY/WHAT was the cause of the leak, and he repeated that it was a faulty Valve Cover Gasket.  **When I asked him why this was the first time I was hearing about the faulty replacement he goes, (and I quote), “Oh, that’s my bad mam, I should’ve told you about that.”  When I just stared at him in disbelief, he provided the excuse, “But I’ve been really, really busy!”  When I share my concern that how the heck do I know his mechanics there didn't put in an extra ½ quart the FIRST time and that's what caused the other gaskets to fail/blow, he retorted with, “Well mam, how do I know YOU didn’t go and add more oil to it?”  Appalled, I asked him, “What makes you think I want to spend $500 the week BEFORE Christmas, and another $500 the week AFTER Christmas?!”** I then went on asking him how they could offer any type of warranty without the correct mileage stated on their paperwork.  At this time, he went out to my car, got the correct mileage, and back to their computer systems to enter in the correct mileage. When I inquired about how I felt the most recent payment I had given them (the $440.03) may not have been justified, he looked me straight in the eye and said, “Look mam, I’m not giving you back any money. Period.”




After I left, I discovered that night after driving around a little bit that my car was STILL leaking oil!!!!  These were not small amounts either, but considerable amounts (please see attached pictures—you can tell by the spots that they are accumulated over different periods of times).  I decide to call Midas’ Customer Service and give them the whole story.  They get me in contact with the District Manager, Marc Lascano, who initially tries to get me to go back to the store to check out the vehicle yet again.  I inform him I do not trust those mechanics, but agree to let him attempt to fix whatever the problem might be. I agree to drop off my car at another location further away and offer to leave it yet again overnight.  Mr. Lascano, called me later the next day after I dropped my vehicle off, to inform me that there was indeed still a leak and it was coming from the Oil Pan Gasket and the same Valve Cover gasket that had been “replaced” by them before.  **He admitted that “it was a botched job” by his mechanics and would be replacing/redoing those items personally himself.**  He then said that a Rear Main Seal may be leaking but he wasn’t 100% sure (the Rear Main Seal was supposed to have been replaced the SECOND time, but according to Mr. Lascano, he couldn’t verify that there was a problem there to begin with because the whole time the oil leaks were coming from the initial problem: the Oil Pan Gasket and Valve Cover Gasket).  When I expressed the same concern to Mr. Lascano, about how the heck do I know if his mechanics at the initial location didn't put in an extra ½ quart the FIRST time and that's what caused the other gaskets to fail/blow, he simply apologized and went on to explain that Midas, as a company, always refuses to refund any type of work done because of the massive amounts of paperwork it comes with.  Any type of refunding at this point was out of his hands.


7th Visit: 

* **Date:** 01/10/2013

* **Reason for Take In:** Car STILL leaking (took into another location other than initial location)

* **Mileage According to Midas Records:** 202302

* **Details of Take In:** Took in AGAIN to get same initial problem corrected. 

* **Result:** Replaced BOTH valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket.  



The District Manager, Mr. Lascano, could not be at the second location when I picked up my vehicle the next day.  Instead, I dealt with the manager at that location named Louis Yarborough, a very nice gentleman.  Interestingly enough, Mr. Yarborough informed me that the day before after seeing the work done on my car, Mr. Lascano called a mandatory surprise safety meeting, in which he showcased my car and the work that was done to it, saying the work done was a big “NO-NO” for the company.



Personal Statement:  I don’t believe there was ever a need for the second job (at a cost of $440.03).  I honestly feel, this company’s particular location, tried to pull the wool over my eyes because I am a woman/female.  The District Manager himself, upon inspection of my vehicle, could not confirm any work had been done, but could confirm that there was a possible Rear Main Seal leak (which was supposed to have been one of the newly replaced gaskets the second time around).  

If I was trying to screw this company over the way they did me, I would be asking for ALL of my money back, but I am not.  I didn’t feel that I was being unreasonable in asking for a refund for the second go around (the amount for $440.03), as I do not believe there was any other problem with the vehicle other than the initial problem (as stated by their own District Manager), however, I am not having much luck in getting that back.  In addition, I don’t even think the second time around job was completed considering the fact that the District Manager could NOT confirm any work had been done, but could confirm a possible leak at the Rear Main Seal.  


If anyone has any comments/concerns/questions, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO REACH OUT TO ME!

Thank you



***TL;DR: DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO MIDAS off I-10, between Wurzbach &amp; Huebner.  They will screw up your car, and then try to blame you for their mistakes.***

My friends and I headed out to Wurzbach Icehouse near Wurzbach and I-10 last night to watch the game, drink some buds, and down some grub.  Unfortunately their parking lot is nowhere near large enough to accommodate the amount of fans who descended upon the locale for Game 1.  And while the first set of overflow folks were able to nab some juicy street parking nearby, many others looked to the vast SEA OF EMPTY PARKING LOTS in the vicinity (Across the street at OfficeMax, down the street at the Texas MedClinic and Fudruckers area).  Sadly, last night, and I suspect every game night for the rest of this series, the Tow Vultures were out in force, and stole people's vehicles to the tune of $220 in ransom.

LOOK FOR TOWING ENFORCEMENT SIGNS IN ALL PARKING LOTS.  They WILL be watching people leave their cars to see where they go.  They WILL tow you.  If you see a huge empty parking lot next to your venue, IT'S A TRAP.

I had to drive my good friend across town (from Wurzbach/I10 to 410/35) after the game so she could pay her ransom and release her car.

So, remember, LOOK FOR TOWING SIGNS!  They're often only posted at the entrances to the lots, instead of within the lots themselves.  ASK YOUR FRIENDS where they parked when they show up.  I feel slightly guilty for not thinking of this last night :(  It'll save everyone a lot of time, money, and frustration.

That is relevant; I'm not just putting it out there to get free shit.

My daughter has a crappy fleece blanket that she earned with her H-E-Buddy Bucks. We have been working on getting her to show affection and attachment, as well as keeping things consistant for her. This blanket has helped a lot. For some reason she loves the cheap little thing and it goes everywhere we do- especially to bed. 

Like the overwhelmed idiot parents that my husband and I are, we left it at a family Christmas gathering today. The party was at a vacation house and the family has already left. They have the blanket and plan to mail it later but it should be a couple of weeks before we see it again. 

We would just go ""buy"" another one but this prize cycle ends at the end of this month and we only have about 250 of the 500 points needed. 

We would be ecstatic if anyone could hook us up with a new one really, really soon or maybe get us a shit ton of Buddy Bucks. We will trade our 250 points for the blanket. 

The closest H-E-Bs are in Kerrville and NW San Antonio but we can drive a little further than that. The blanket is blue and pictures a personified grocery bag in winter attire. 

**TL;DR-** Stupid parents lose kid's comfort object- blue fleece H-E-Buddy blanket. Mom begs for replacement in Kerrville or north San Antonio. 

**Edit-** Thanks a million for the offers, everyone. Some of you seem to think going up to the store and explaining then offering to pay for a new one will work. I didn't want to do that and look like an asshole, but for the kid, right? It's Christmas Eve and the nearest one is ~35 miles away, so I hope they have one there and don't mind! I'll update when we get home. We may have to take some one up on one of these offers. 

**Update-** We drove over 30 minutes to the nearest store and I explained the situation to the busy middle-aged lady at the service desk. She looked down at my 240 out of 500 points, back up at me, down, up... She then gave a sigh of reluctantcy, threw our points away (I'm tense at this point), and from under the counter dug out a new folded blanket in crisp plastic wrapping. Through her tough act I saw her eyes misting. I cried and told her I was happy, she cracked a smile, I got out of her space ASAP. 

The kid was sleeping in the car so I draped it over her lap. You shoulda seen dem eyes light up when she found it. 

Thanks again for all of the offers as well as giving me the balls (ovaries?) to just ask the store politely for a new one. Lesson learned and mission accomplished.  

**Second TL;DR-** Begged and traded less than half of the points required for a new blanket. Teared up like a wimp. Kid was happy. Thanks. ",,False,self,t5_2qqch,1356383483.0,,,True,t3_15ctfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/15ctfx/anyone_work_at_heb_my_family_needs_a_favor_xpost/,

1328554599.0,38,self.sanantonio,pdhfm,My grandpa (who has been in commercial real estate for 20 years) wrote a Facebook note about the new Walmart at Blanco and Wurzbach Parkway. I'm reposting it here with his permission.,45,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/pdhfm/my_grandpa_who_has_been_in_commercial_real_estate/,"It's the front page story in today's Express News: Walmart has plans to build a 180,000 (almost 4 acres) store, not including the 10-15 acres of asphalt paving for parking, at the corner of Blanco and Wurzbach Pkwy. .........right across from the Phil Hardberger Park........ and I think it is sinful. 

 
This issue is bigger than ""does Walmart have the right""? It is really a quality of life issue that affects us all, even those of us who don't live close and are seldom in that area. For too long San Antonio has ""whored"" itself out to any business that wants to do just about anything.....anywhere. I realize that is strong language but it's true. 

 
Walmart is not a convenience store and does not need to be right in the middle of any residential area, especially next to a beautifully done park that the citizens paid $60 million for. Before long we will have one on every corner if they have their way. 

 
Folks, if you haven't noticed, San Antonio is becoming less green and uglier by the minute. That's not just me talking, I have heard it from a multitude of people at the local level and from many business executives considering San Antonio for possible corporate relocations. When I am looking at aerial photographs it is very apparent that we are trading green space for ugly concrete and asphalt. Our ""inferiority complex"" is evident as you drive the City and see the ill conceived and badly located commercial projects that are encroaching on the residential neighborhoods, projects that the City and it's people should not have approved. To think that we would approve of a Walmart at this location, right next to a beautifully done park, a real ""sanctuary"" for a lot of people, is beyond my comprehension. Most quality, major metropolitan areas would not allow this to happen and for sure it will reflect poorly on San Antonio. 

 
Walmart says ""it will create jobs"". I contend that if we keep allowing the ugliness created by unbridled development to go on, we will lose many more jobs, many of which are higher paying jobs, than Walmart can ever hope to create. On many occasions, at the end of a tour of SA, when I've asked corporate executives considering relocation for their honest opinion of what they think of San Antonio, their response has been ""well, it's nice but outside of the River Walk, it sure is ugly"". As a side note, often, they comment on the amount of trash on the streets as well. Walmart, or for that matter any big box, should locate on the arterial highways with all of the other ugly development and stay out of the residential neighborhoods. They are ""destination"" type stores, not convenience stores and we don't need them in our backyard. We really need to get over our ""inferiority complex"", put our foot down and take a stand if we hope to become known as a ""quality city"". 

 
Let's not confuse ""business friendly"" with ""sure, do whatever you want. We didn't notice and don't care"". We need to get active on this and other issues facing San Antonio.

As you might imagine, January is a big month for music lessons (everyone and their mom gets an instrument for Christmas), so we wanted to put this out there before then.

* Half off your first month, plus
* $10 off every month after

**How to redeem:** 

* When you book lessons online, type ""reddit"" and your username in the ""special requests"" box

***or***

* Just shoot me a message with the last name of the student signing up.

I felt terrible thinking about this, so, I suggest we follow suit and have our posts with time/date info in the title instead of just ""TONIGHT"". Something like:

&gt;""(AMAZINGLY FUN THING YOU JUST HAD TO SHARE) at (place) tonight, (MONTH/DAY), at (TIME)!"" 
&gt;

or for those looking for something, perhaps: 

&gt;""Anyone want to do anything tonight, (MONTH/DAY HERE)?"" 
&gt;

for requests on what to do. I know people don't post as many things going on in San Antonio as those Austin users do, mainly because they are (INSERT AN OPINION FAVORABLE OF YOUR OWN VIEWS ABOUT SAN ANTONIO IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PLACES IN EXISTENCE HERE), but figured for anyone visiting it may be helpful to do so from now on? 

In fact, this subreddit not having that much activity may be a reason *to* do so, as posts that are days old remain on the front page for some time. 

Feel free to share your thoughts (especially if it's to tell me to fuck off and that I am absolutely wrong and the cancer of not only /r/sanantonio, but the entire state of Texas)!

San Antonio harbors a major installation of the NSA, the ""Cryptology Center"", located near 410 and West Military Drive.

I am not really sure exactly what I hope to accomplish with this post, but here are a few things I'd like to do:

* 1) Facilitate a local discussion about the recent revelations of the NSA's operations

* 2) Gauge interest in this community about the feasibility of conducting a demonstration/protest

* 3) Assess what resources we have amongst us (particularly legal council, a.k.a. lawyers)

Personally, I am unsure about how to make the biggest impact.

There have been discussions elsewhere on this site about a nationwide protest on July 4th, but I don't really see that taking off, for several reasons which I won't include here in the interest of succinctness.

*Thoughts?*

P.S. If there have been any previous discussions on this topic in the San Antonio subreddit, I was unable to find them, and would appreciate someone pointing me in that direction.

P.P.S. I am not constantly on reddit, but will be checking in on this post periodically.

Case against assistant DA's son dismissed
By Brian Chasnoff

June 2, 2013 12:20 AM

Shortly after midnight, during a Fiesta weekend last year, two Terrell Hills police officers pulled over an SUV for speeding.

Behind the wheel was Truman Biggs, the 18-year-old son of Adriana Biggs, chief of the white-collar-crimes division of the Bexar County district attorney's office.


At first, things did not go well for Truman.

He told the officers he hadn't been drinking, but according to a police report, evidence disproved this: They smelled alcohol on his breath, found a fake ID in his wallet and saw an open, half-emptied beer can on the front passenger floorboard.

After struggling through a field sobriety test, Truman blew into a Breathalyzer and twice registered a blood alcohol content of 0.17 — more than twice the legal limit.

He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated.

From there, however, things went well for Truman.

Eight months later, his charge was dismissed in the “interest of justice.” In fact, Truman's charge never made it to court at all because the prosecutor never even filed a complaint.

That prosecutor was not Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed or anyone in her office. Sensitive to the conflict of interest, Reed recused herself from the case two days after Truman's arrest.

That same day, Bexar County Judge Wayne Christian appointed a special prosecutor: local defense attorney Charles Bunk, a former prosecutor who had worked under Reed for 10 years and who now regularly defends DWI cases. In December, Bunk filed a motion to dismiss the case, scrawling “interest of justice” as the reason, and Christian signed it.

In Bexar County, where drunken driving is a deadly epidemic, Reed has assumed a tough-as-nails stance against the crime, mandating blood draws for anyone who refuses a Breathalyzer test. And it's virtually impossible to get a charge dismissed if a suspect blows above a 0.15 — particularly when witnesses are available and no motion to suppress evidence is filed.

First Assistant District Attorney Cliff Herberg acknowledged this reality.

“I think that's accurate,” Herberg told me. “We're very tough on DWIs.”

In Truman's case, neither arresting officer was called as a witness. And John Kuntz, Truman's defense attorney, never filed any motion to suppress.

So I called Bunk last week to ask why, in this case, he had sought a dismissal — and what, exactly, was the “interest of justice.”

Bunk, however, refused to talk about it.

“I'm really not at liberty to talk about any of my investigation that I did on that,” Bunk said.

Christian, the judge, told me he couldn't recall Truman's case. But any dismissal, he said, is the prerogative of the prosecutor.

“It's not my interest to question why the special prosecutor is dismissing stuff,” Christian said.

When I told him Bunk wouldn't discuss his rationale, the judge said: “That makes no sense. That doesn't smell right if the prosecutor won't talk to you.”

For her part, Reed said she steered clear of the case.

“I have absolutely no knowledge of it,” she said. “I didn't even know (the charge) was dismissed. When I recuse myself, I haven't touched it.”

Biggs “is my chief and I work closely with her,” Reed continued, “and I said, 'I'm not going to handle this.' I haven't even spoken to her about it. I haven't spoken to Charles Bunk probably — I don't even know when the last time I saw Charles was — oh, ages ago. It's been a long time.”

Bunk began working as a Bexar County prosecutor in the mid-'90s, before Reed was elected in 1998. He left in June 2008. (Biggs joined the district attorney's office in the mid-'90s.)

Reed said Bunk should've filed the complaint against Truman.

“That would've been his responsibility,” Reed said. “That's how a defendant is given notice of what he's charged with. That's what starts the jurisdiction of the court.”

I asked Biggs if she thought her position had enabled her son to skip the charge.

“I'm not going to comment on that,” Biggs said. “On this one, I'm a mother and not a prosecutor or a representative of the district attorney's office.

“I did not talk to Bunk once about this,” she added, “nor did I ever have any words with Judge Christian. I don't think I even looked at the case. I certainly did not look at the case while in my office. And I let John Kuntz handle it.”

On Friday, Kuntz played for me the video of Truman's arrest.

“This is a video that does not comport with the breath test,” he said.

Asked to step out of the SUV, Truman did not appear belligerent. He had some trouble with the field sobriety test. The officers noted 11 clues of intoxication, including difficulty keeping balance and “lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes.”

At one point, the officers can be heard conversing.

“So, what do you see?” one asked.

“I'll be honest,” the other replied. “I think it's a stretch. But that's just me.”

“What would you do?”

“I would have him call somebody to come pick him up and take him home because I can smell alcohol on him.”

“I'll tell you what I'm going to do,” the other officer said. “I'm going to do a DWI.”

Kuntz cited this exchange as a reason the case was not “makeable” for a prosecutor. Yet, according to a knowledgeable source, the officer who was apprehensive about arresting Truman had little experience in DWI arrests, and the other officer was far more experienced. Had the court summoned the officers as witnesses, a jury could have considered this interplay.

Instead, for nebulous reasons, Bunk sought to dismiss the charge.

Another case in which Reed recused herself came to a similar conclusion.

In 2008, Reed's own son was headed to Las Vegas with a friend, Christopher J. Mueller, when airport screeners reported finding a gun in Mueller's backpack. Mueller was arrested and charged with a felony.

But within hours of his arrest, Reed's son called the district attorney, who made a call to the magistrate's office. Mueller's bond was reduced and he was released from jail a short time later.

Reed later turned the case over to a special prosecutor, local attorney Therese Huntzinger, who dismissed Mueller's charge in 2010, calling it a “reckless act” by someone with no previous criminal record.

On Friday, Huntzinger said Bunk should explain his own dismissal.

“Stand up and say why you're doing it,” she told me. “In the case of Mueller, I was very vocal about why I did it.

“To dismiss a charge 'in the interest of justice,' it's not a recognized legal tool for dismissal. It's an end-run for justifying the dismissal. Otherwise, I could've done the same thing.”

The murderer is still not behind bars. In fact, I just came from court where all he had to do is show that he was there and then went back home. There isn't even a trial date set yet. My question for you is: The day before the trial (when ever that should be) we would like to have a candle light vigil in front of the courthouse ( In San Antonio, TX). We are trying to bring awareness to this case so I was hoping I could invite some Redditors to join us. True, I don't know when it will be but I wanted to find out if people would be interested in supporting us (call it a hand count). I will of course let you guys know when the candle light vigil will be held. I just wanted to know if I can count on you when the time comes. Please let me know how many San Antonians would be willing to spare some time to make people aware of hoe long a hate crime can go unpunished. (Unfortunately I will not be able to provide all the candles) Also, if anyone has any other ideas on how we can make people more aware of the slow justice system, I am all ears. Thank you.

EDIT: We could make that day a sad Reddit meet up

Additional request: I would like to put this pic on a t-shirt fr when I am in court. I want that bastard to see Troys face when he walks by us. Anyone here that is good with photo-shop that could make this pic t-shirt worthy http://i.imgur.com/YblHI.jpg

* **Marital Status:** Married with a 10 month old baby
* **Interests:** Recently, I've been into running and strength training as well as reading comics (mostly sci-fi, fantasy, horror). I also enjoy reading novels, boardgaming, and brewing beer, though I haven't made a batch in a very long time, mostly due to not having a good place for fermentation.

We live in Texas, there's no excuse to eat feedlot beef.",40,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1hfyg9/anyone_is_san_antonio_want_a_share_of_a_local/,"In the past, we successfully crowdsourced a couple of hogs and an Angus steer. Due to the heat, I want to avoid raising anymore hogs until the fall. Just to clarify, we raise the hogs ourselves in Lockhart, Texas. The steer will be raised in Wharton, Texas (roughly 2 hours outside of Austin) by the Mangum family, who have been raising cattle since 1908. Last month We sold 3 share of beef and have 7 remaining. This will be the second steer share. 

I have had a long history with small scale agricultural projects, but this is my first foray into raising high grade beef. I plan to keep you updated regularly by snapping pictures and maintaining posts on the development of the steer, which should be ready for slaughter around Nov. 2013.

We will use underutilized land and pay the landowner up front for the use of his land. This way, the rancher gets more money than he would selling at auction and the consumer gets high quality meat at a great price. its a win-win situation. Because we are paying the farmer directly, we can demand high animal welfare standards. Stressed animals produce hormones that negatively impact the flavor, so we obviously want happy animals.

My mission is to create a web platform that connects farmers, ranchers, and landowners directly to consumers. Something along the lines of airbnb, but for farmers and ranchers. Our goal is to provide ‘Whole Food's' quality meat at an HEB price. By avoiding distributors and retailers, we can eliminate the middleman and save a lot of money. This project is the first step towards fulfilling that goal.

All Natural, Pasture Raised, Grass Fed, Antibiotic and Hormone Free Beef

 The price is $200 for a 10% share. That is roughly 40 lbs of meat. The meat will be ready around November 2013. I will begin collecting money this week. Payment can be made via cash, check, or Dwolla. 

For sanitary reasons we will be using a professional butcher to slaughter, cut, and package the meat. It costs between $0.25 to $0.50 a pound to butcher the animal. I am still looking for a butcher and will update you closer to the date. Obviously I won't know how much this will cost until the steer has been slaughtered, but I estimate it will be roughly $50 /share for butchering and packaging costs. The butchering cost will be due when you take delivery of the meat. 

The steer will be butchered at around 1000-1200lbs, which should result in 400-450lbs of meat. Of that 150-170lbs are  steaks. The various cuts will be divided as equally as possible. Let me know if there are any cuts that you would rather have more of, or any that you don't like. This is how we divided up the pig that we crowdsourced two months ago. Everyone was satisfied, however, I do welcome any suggestions on how to divide the meat equitably.  

We will purchase a steer and keep him to 1000-1200lbs in weight, leaving it to the rancher's discretion as to when we should slaughter. Due to the nature of how animals grow, I cannot give an exact date for when the meat will be ready, but again, it will be around Nov.
The ranchers who will be raising the animal will be helping me source a quality animal. 

The steer will be grass fed only, with ZERO grain. I will also be able to dry age the meat. If you want some of your cuts dry aged, we can discuss that when the time comes. There will be a minimal fee for this (whatever it costs me to do it.)
When the meat is ready, I will deliver it to your home or business, or we can meet at a central location.

About me: I’m 30 originally from Brownsville, TX and have lived in Austin for 1.5 yrs. I have a varied experience in different forms of agriculture. I spent a year in Brazil studying organic agriculture while traveling around the country having a blast. It was there that I first raised pigs. Currently, I work in sales. I also have a hound dog to keep the animals company, his name is Chester. He’s pretty cool.

I am ecstatic to see how far this project goes. If you have any questions/comments/concerns/suggestions, please feel free to send me an email or call 214.755.0507.  If this sounds like a project you want to be a part of email me. If you are in San Antonio or Austin, I can meet you after normal business hours and we can arrange payment in person.

A couple of years ago I was hitchiking in South America learning Spanish when I was introduced to a a social language group in Bogotá called Gringo Tuesdays. They met every Tuesday from 6-7 in a bar and would practice different languages until 10 where it turned into to full-scale party. The bar was small, but they had 5-6 tables, each with a different flag on it representing the language being spoken. Each table also had one native speaker or someone fluent in the language to help facilitate the conversation and correct people when they made a mistake.

I've always wanted to try doing this here in San Antonio and think it would be a lot of fun. I'd like to start off with Spanish and make it a regular thing, then possible see if we can add another language if there is enough interest in the group. I've already appealed to the local Couch Surfing community groups and about 10 or so people are interested in starting off with meeting to speak Spanish. Would any native and non-native speakers be interested in attending something like this and try to make it a regular thing?

Some of you may have heard that Rep. Lamar Smith (TX-21) is being challenged in the GOP Primary by Sheriff Richard Mack. Lamar Smith is the big sponsor behind SOPA and other bills that are going to be used to regulation and possibly tax the internet. One of the things I will mention is from the currents maps proposed, TX 21 will probably be 75% GOP. So the chances of a Democrat winning are very slim.

My big question for this community is one thing. What would you like from Sheriff Mack and the campaign? More Meet and Greets, more explanation on issues, more requests for money (kidding)?

We've been back in her hometown now for 12 years and we'll never move.  There are lots of things that make SA a wonderful, magical place for us.  Things like...

- Our uniqueness. SA doesn't try to be anything/anyone else.  We're a proudly unique city.

- Our multicultural city...a place that (after living all over the place in my military days) is the least racially divided city.  Everyone is welcome in SA.

- Our incredible history that goes well beyond the Alamo.  Missions anyone?

- Our amazing food.  Sure, it's pretty heavy on the TexMex side...but it's the best TexMex in the world.

- The fact that many of us here are bilingual to at least some degree.  Uncommon...and very cool.

I'd like to ask you...what is it that makes SA special for you?

Don't forget about this weekend's meteor shower! Personally, I will be making my way out to Enchanted Rock to watch the shower from the top of the hill.

A description from EarthSky.com:

The Perseid meteor shower is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. The shower builds gradually to a peak, often produces 50 to 100 meteors per hour in a dark sky at the peak, and, for us in the Northern Hemisphere, this shower comes when the weather is warm. The Perseids tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into midnight, and typically produce the most meteors in the wee hours before dawn. They radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus the Hero, but, as with all meteor shower radiant points, you don’t need to know Perseus to watch the shower; instead, the meteors appear in all parts of the sky. They are typically fast and bright meteors. They frequently leave persistent trains. Every year, you can look for the Perseids around August 10-13. They combine with the Delta Aquarid shower (above) to produce the year’s most dazzling display of shooting stars. In 2013, the Perseid meteors will streak across the short summer nights – August 10-13 – from late night until dawn, with little to no interference from the waxing crescent moon. Plus the moon will be near the planet Saturn in the evening hours, giving a colorful prelude to late-night Perseid show. Best mornings to look: August 11, 12 and 13.

Dough Pizzeria - As we were walking up to the restaurant, I told my date about how Neopolitan pizza was a regionally protected food that they actually have to get certifications for in Italy. When we arrived, there was a 45 minute wait, which I hadn't been expecting. We sat at a table outside and shared a bottle of wine and some appetizers while we waited.

We were finally shown to our table and our server asked if we had ever been there before, to which we both replied no. He then informed us that Neopolitan pizza was a regionally protected food for which there are certifications, and they THEY WERE CERTIFIED. I didn't even know that was possible in the United States. I had a bit of a geek moment when I started rambling off the requirements for certification, like using tomatoes from the San Marzano valley region.

The wait at the pizzeria meant I had to cancel my reservations for the Ghost Tour, and instead headed directly to what I had planned for later in the night...

Ocho Lounge - In the basement of the Havana Hotel. This place was exactly as described. Creepy, red lit elevator to the basement, a dim, quiet, fairly swanky bar with two very friendly bartenders. There was also a staircase that led back up to a seating area by the river with large chandeliers and generally a fantastic atmosphere. We enjoyed this bar very much and I definitely recommend it for dates.

Saturday we hit the Farmers Market, tried samples from anyone who was offering, then we bought a loaf of fresh sourdough, some goat cheese, and head to Brackenridge park and sat, ate, and read on our kindles. ;)

Saturday day we watched movies on netflix, relaxed, and then saturday night head to a bar named Me and CA. I love Karaoke, she loves Pool, this place had both. It was already busy and only got busier. The clientele that night was primarily black, which I really enjoyed, being from the very white Austin. Now, I'm white, and so is my date, but that doesn't faze either of us (hooray she isn't a xenophobe). I also sing SOUL music, so when I saw my audience would be mostly young, friendly black folk, I got simultaneously excited to sing soul, and scared to sing soul.

We had plenty of drinks and after 2 hours or so (it was very busy) I got to get up and sing James Brown - It's A Man's World. The people I had met that night and had been chatting/dancing with lost their shit when this little white kid got up and belted out some James Brown.

Sunday we slept in til 11, and when we woke up, she mentioned, for some reason, quiche. I love to cook so we went to the grocery store, picked up supplies, and I made a quiche for her from scratch, crust and all. More TV watching and reading followed, then for dinner I cooked her my well practiced steak in a cast iron skillet, mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus.

I left Sunday night, texted her when I got home, we said our goodnights and that was that.

Overall, a fantastic weekend. Thank you all for your help!

If you plan on going, let me know in advanced so I can try and get you guys a table sooner &amp;coupons to get extra points on your cards. :D
we have tons of rules on getting tables and are quite hard to get around, but if you let me know I might be able to work with my managers for stuff. :3
And if you guys are still there I'd like to go back and join you if y'all plan on being there after midnight. :D

I'm also sorry on behalf of D&amp;B, today was not the best day for anyone at our restaurant. That concert parking was causing a LOT of issues for managers, employees, and customers. I'm sorry. I hope y'all would still be willing to come back.

**EDIT 2:** Our dog is safely home after a long day. The mom and daughter that found her were awesome folks and help get stray dogs off the street so they can find the owners with no expectation of a reward whatsoever. They find her wandering near Rittiman along the highway where all those 18 wheelers are--it's scary to imagine what could've happened to her if they didn't take the time to get her. They said she was very timid and frightened. They found her with a makeshift rope noose around her next, attached to what might've been a metal part for a fence... Looks like someone else found her first and who knows for how long they had her or what they did to her. They found her starving and super skinny with conjunctivitis in her eyes and the start of an ear infection. She has a lot of hair loss on her legs and belly which I kind of expected since her allergies were taking a turn for the worse before she got lost. Poor girl was covered in burrs and had diarrhea and stool stuck to the fur on her rear end. I got her cleaned up and was able to remove everything without shaving her down, and just like that she was acting like herself again (by rolling in the grass and dirt after working so hard to clean her :P). She had only been gone for 2 &amp; 1/2 weeks, but it feels like it's been forever! F

Thank you SA reddit for your support and being on the look out! Just goes to show no matter where you go, there are awesome people everywhere willing go out of their way to help you out.

Yes, your dog was nice. But allowing him/her to run off leash is a nuisance to others. Your dog almost knocked a young lady over near UTSA Blvd when he /she ran over to greet the runner. Also, there are several blind corners on the northern end of the trail. People on bikes could very well hit your dog. Then you'd be mad. 

2. Even though your dog was nice, other people's dogs aren't. That's why they keep them on leash so they can control them. Then you let your dog run wild. Now what's gonna happen when your dog, who is nice, runs up to an aggressive dog that's on-leash? The on-leash aggressive dog is going to think your dog is a threat, and very likely attack. Then you'd be mad.

3. Your dog was exhausted trying to keep up with you. Yes, you're in great shape. I understand why you have your shirt off. But your little collie's legs are about a 1/4 the size of yours. He /she was clearly trying to keep up and please you, but the dog was about to fall down. Your dog was panting heavily, slobbering at the mouth, and his/her rear legs and hips were clearly hurting. The dog was lagging, and you were mad.

1369426799.0,24,self.sanantonio,1ezprd,"Anyone is San Antonio want a share of a local grass fed steer? We live in Texas, there's no excuse to eat feedlot beef.",35,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1ezprd/anyone_is_san_antonio_want_a_share_of_a_local/,"We recently organized the shared purchase of a couple of heritage breed hog and one steer  here on reddit . Its been a great success, we've been raising a happy pig and at the same time recycling of A LOT of food waste into fresh bacon.

We live in a place that produces what is arguably the best beef in the world. We should have the best of it on our tables. 
We raise the hogs ourselves in Lockhart, Texas. The steer will be raised in Wharton, Texas (roughly 2 hours outside of Austin) by the Mangum family, who have been raising beef since 1908. 

I explained my goal of finding better uses for under-utilized land and creating humanely raised yet affordable grass fed beef, the landowners were immediately on board. Rather than raising an animal and selling it to a feedlot after a year, they will keep it and raise it on a strict grass only diet. No hormones, no corn or anything GMO, no antibiotics, and a diet of fresh grass and hay.

Animals should not be confined in feedlots and fed corn. Pasture raised grassfed steer, are happier and happy animals make for tasty meat.

A 1,000 pound choice steer will dress out at 61.5% (615 pounds). Of that 183 will be fat, bone and other loss. That leaves 432 pounds of beef.

We are selling 10% shares of the animal which should give you around 40lbs of meat. A 10% share is $200.

All Natural, Pasture Raised, Grass Fed, Antibiotic and Hormone Free Beef

 The price is $200 for a 10% share. That is roughly 40 lbs of meat. The meat will be ready around Oct. 2013. I will begin collecting money this week so that we can pay the landowners next week and get the ball rolling quickly. Payment can be made via cash, a mailed check, or Dwolla. 

For sanitary reasons we will be using a professional butcher to slaughter, cut, and package the meat. It costs between $0.25 to $0.50 a pound to butcher the animal. I am still looking for a butcher and will update you closer to the date. Obviously I won't know how much this will cost until the steer has been slaughtered, but I estimate it will be roughly $50 /share for butchering and packaging costs. The butchering cost will be due when you take delivery of the meat. 

The steer will be butchered at around 1000-1200lbs, which should result in 400-450lbs of meat. Of that 150-170lbs are  steaks. The various cuts will be divided as equally as possible. Let me know if there are any cuts that you would rather have more of, or any that you don't like. This is how we divided up the pig that we crowdsourced two months ago. Everyone was satisified, however, I do welcome any suggestions on how to divide the meat equitably.  

We will purchase a steer and keep him to 1000-1200lbs in weight, leaving it to the rancher's discretion as to when we should slaughter. Due to the nature of how animals grow, I cannot give an exact date for when the meat will be ready, but again, it will be around September.

Pigs have large litters, it is very easy to buy piglets with quality genetics. Purchasing cattle on the other hand, is difficult. Many of the animals for sale are inferior, sick, or already large enough for slaughter. It makes sense; anyone who is selling cattle before they are ready for slaughter will sell you the worst animals of his herd. He will keep the best on his ranch. Because of the difficulty in finding the right animal, I can’t tell you what breed will be bought at this time. I really have my heart set on either Angus or Hereford. (The best beef I ever had was from a grass fed Argentine Hereford.) I can guarantee that it will be a great animal with premium/heritage genetics. The ranchers who will be raising the animal will be helping me source a quality animal. 

The steer will be grass fed only, with ZERO grain. I will also be able to dry age the meat. If you want some of your cuts dry aged, we can discuss that when the time comes. There will be a minimal fee for this (whatever it costs me to do it.)

When the meat is ready, I will deliver it to your home or business, or we can meet at a central location.  

All Natural Hormone Free Pork 

Officer Dan is the hog currently living on my land in Lockhart. This heritage breed from the UK is a Berkshire, male hog who is absolutely spoiled. It is the exact same hog meat your grandfather ate. We crowdsourced his purchase two months ago and I have been raising him since. He eats a lot of human food waste. I call it recycling food. I have a network of friends who all save thier food scraps and waste for our pig, so he eats GOOD (better than some people I know.) He loves yoghurt, stale bread, fruit, and spent grains from homebrewers. He also eats GMO-free corn and hog feed. I used to let him run wild and eat grass, but now he is too big. Chasing after a hog gone wild is surprisingly fun, but not something you want to do more than once.  He lives in a pen now, but has plenty of room and is able to root in the ground, as is his nature. 


Each share is 20% and costs $150. A share gets you roughly 28 lbs of meat. There will be lots of lard for the taking if anyone wants it. The hog will be ready to eat in around five months. If you want me to make bacon for you please let me know, it’s included in the price. I can also leave the pork belly raw if you don’t want bacon.

There will be a butchering fee due upon delivery of the meat. It is around $0.50/lb. Again, I don’t know exactly what the total cost will be, but it will be broken down by exactly what the butcher charges me divided between each shareholder.

Please email me at Tacosauruscoopfarm@gmail.com so I have your contact info. I will send out an email on Saturday with all the details.

I had no clue there was a subreddit for SA! Doh. Looks like I found a new place to read.. I literally spent 3 months on and off in San Antonio at the beginning of this year...
I really wish I had found this place to change the pace!

Anyhow, I'm a full service mechanic / custom fabrication guy. I do everything from ss turbo kits to bumpers to drivetrain and engine rebuilds. I also do mobile tig welding on SS/AL, mostly restaurant repairs! I have been known to get conned by friends and family to go fix burglar bars, fences, or bbq pits. Although I currently have an order for 3 6' tall stainless steel vertical smokers! I just took possession of the tanks yesterday.. should be a fun job!

This is a non-smoking restaurant even on the patio (where we will be meeting). Smoking heaven is just a stone throw away, so it should not be a concern. 

For a number of reasons, I am suggesting we start around 5. Largely because they have half price appetizers till 7. They have a drink special that last all day for the late comers. I will also get some appetizers for everyone to share 

The place had AWESOME food when it was Bravo and from my understanding Brio is a little better quality than they were. My friend hosting the event who is the GM of Brio calls it ""upscale affordable"". 

EDIT: I was able to get us discounts on the beer. so there will be a special price for us on the beer. :D 

EDIT: So I decided to check out the place yesterday and finalize the plans. Unfortunately my friend was unable to secure discounts on the beer. sorry for getting your hopes up. However, he did try to compensate by getting us free [appetizers](http://i.imgur.com/pNsff.jpg) for the people who show up at 5. The appetizers are only 3 dollars from 3-7 and 9-close and the [burger](http://i.imgur.com/WBvLT.jpg) was one of the best ones.  Additionally, they have **awesome** [martinis](http://i.imgur.com/Enhsl.jpg) that are made from scratch. These are 5 dollars all day. We had the [watermelon](http://i.imgur.com/6emWd.jpg) and [cucumber](http://i.imgur.com/qeHrA.jpg) which was to die for. seriously good.

* Time: 9:00PM
* Location: NW San Antonio, 1604/Culebra kinda?

Hello again! Extending an invite to the Reddit community, once more, that there will be another party at sca1pel's house. If you haven't seen the pictures ([my terrible potato ones](http://imgur.com/a/Vte61/all#0) and [khana521's much better pictures](http://imgur.com/a/kisYh)), it was a pretty decent turnout last time.

The host himself would love to have more so if you came last time, same place. If you're new to the party or are bringing a guest, please contact [sca1pel](http://www.reddit.com/user/sca1pel) first! If you're bringing something, post it here!

**EDIT**: There's been a couple of questions/concern about underage Redditors attending the party, given the presence of alcohol. No one in our group actively promotes or encourages underage drinking. If you're underage and coming, know the law and be smart about your actions. Do not put your safety or the safety of others at risk.

For everyone else, if you do not feel safe to drive after the festivities have ended, please talk to someone about arranging a ride or plan to stay the night on a couch. I'm sure we'll all get along great and nothing is better than having another meetup after this one with all of us there. Again: be smart.

So we decided, we're gonna try to move from online only hosting to hosting some local area tournaments, but we're still having trouble getting some things taken care of.

The two things that are stopping us are a place to host the tournament (Where we can bring in a good number of awesome gamers and they can all relax and enjoy themselves without it being too crowded) and planning the budget in a way where we don't go broke and we can still award our winners and provide snacks and such for the participants (And if I'm being honest here, a way to pay our team as well for helping).

The budget is still being worked out though and it's getting better and if you have any ideas on that feel free to leave them, but the part about where to host such a tournament is still up there as well as some ideas for games to play (Some of us were thinking things from Smash Bros to Street Fighter and I think one of us said Halo if I recall correctly).

Also, we wanted to hear any ideas you guys had on games that can be played, prizes that could be given out, ways to keep everyone entertained (especially if these tournaments take a few hours), or any other ways to make the whole experience better.

We'll come back to this periodically, so please, feel free to post your ideas or comments, We really want to hear what you think.

Thanks for reading.

I need some advice and I'm really hoping reddit can help.  
  
I am writing this on the behalf of a young man from San Antonio, TX. I know of him through my little brother, who is his boss at a local car wash.  
  
This young man may or may not have a learning disability, but my little brother assures me he is the hardest working employee he has. He shows up on time, asks to work extra hours, and puts everything into his time on the job. He is married, and his $200 a week paycheck goes entirely to the $200 a week cost of living at a Homewood Inn in San Antonio. I will try to clear this up, but I do believe his wife has a job as well, but it provides only enough to enable them to eat. A hamburger is treated like a steak at Ruth's Chris.  
  
About a week ago, this young man (I'm not using names yet) learned that his mother was ill in Pueblo, CO, so he and his wife spent every dime they had to take a bus to check on her. His mom has also been taking care of her eldest son's (who is apparently not the greatest father in the world) two daughters, so the young man I'm writing about knew that his presence would be beneficial.  
  
Unfortunately, the mother died. :( In addition, she was already behind on the rent for her apartment, so the young man and his bride could not stay there after she passed away. With his two nieces and his wife to take care of, in the midst of grieving the loss of his mother, he had nowhere to turn. They have been living in a wooded area with no shelter for a few days now. That's right: No car, no tent, no food, no money.  
  
He called my little brother and told him the situation, adding that they had no way to get home and that he was trying to find a job to earn some money so that they could eat and perhaps eventually return home. I think through a lack of education he just doesn't understand the possible resources that are available to him, though he isn't a CO resident, so I don't know what limits he might face. He asked my little brother for a job reference and of course, my brother obliged wholeheartedly. But this young man might not understand that it's near impossible to get a job without an address.  
  
This is tearing at our heartstrings. Neither of us have the financial resources to help him, but I know that there *must* be a way to get him some help. I strongly believe in the ""Today you, tomorrow me"" mentality and I also believe in the kindness of strangers. I have seen reddit do some amazing things. I have been here for four years (another username); I've been a contributor to /r/RandomActsOfPizza, I've helped Lucas, I've helped Karen the bus driver in New York, and cried along with each of you at many other posts that showed how fragile life can be.  
  
I am asking you for your advice on how to help this kid. I am considering cross-posting this to /r/Assistance, /r/sanantonio, and /r/Colorado. Would that be a good idea?  
  
Thank you in advance. If I am leaving out pertinent information, please let me know. I can provide any kind of proof that moderators might need, with the help of my brother.

A good friend of mine is in a band called Again, For the Win and had their instruments stolen from them over last weekend. Below is a list of what was taken:


All of these things were stolen from us.
Please be on the lookout for them:

* a custom P.Ellis drum kit
* a Roland Juno-D
* A peavey bandit 112 guitar amp. (Spray painted white)
* Effects pedals: boss re-20 space echo, electroharmonix cathedral reverb with an external switch mod, t.c. Electronics flashback delay, danelectro fab tone, custom made over drive pedal by King Electric Pedal company and the flight case that all of the pedals were kept in.

* And Wayne's empty backpack.

All of this stuff is pretty custom so if it shows up, it would be very recognizable. The cops have been notified, but they don't have much hope. 

These guys are great, really just starting off their careers. Recently signed, doing local shows, etc. This loss would pretty much tank them musically as they don't have the liquid assets to replace the missing stuff.

If anyone sees any of this come up on craigslist, at a local pawn shop, or is approached to have it sold to you, I would REALLY appreciate an orangered or you can get to Wayne directly on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/againforthewin",,False,self,t5_2qqch,False,,,True,t3_17vgwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/17vgwq/instruments_stolen_from_local_band/,

Tell me everything about San Antonio!,26,7,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/138zyg/just_got_an_offer_from_usaa_tell_me_everything/,"Alright folks, I just got an offer from USAA, but I can't accept an offer before I know where I'm moving. They flew me down as part of the interview process, but I didn't get to see much of the city while I was there. So, help sell me on SA! I've looked into the city, and I've seen a lot of pessimistic things floating around the web, from Hispanics discriminating against Whites (""If you're white, make sure you find a white doctor"" being one of the more disturbing trends) to San Antonio being a ""one trick pony"" (the Riverwalk being the only area with anything resembling culture and nightlife).

Obviously, this can't be the whole story, so here's what I'm looking for: 

1) What's there to do around there? Museums, theater, music venues, etc. What does the entertainment scene look like? Night life? How about the music scene? (And saying that Austin has an awesome music scene and is only an hour away is cheating!)

2) How bicycle friendly is the city? I picked up bicycling as a hobby in the past year, and would like to keep that up. If the city isn't that bicycle friendly, I can live with driving, but bike trails and parks I can go to are essential. I hear the hill country outside the city is great for outdoorsy stuff, too, so feel free to mention your favorite sights/camping spots/whatever.

3) Where should I live? I looked into some older posts, and it sounds like there are some good (and free) apartment finding services, so is there one you recommend over another? I'd like to live within a 10-20 minute drive of USAA, and would be looking to spend $700 (give or take about $200) per month on a one bedroom apartment.

And of course, if there's anything you want to mention that I didn't specifically ask for is more than welcome. Moving halfway across the country (from CT, currently going to school in NY) is a big choice, so help put my mind at ease. Alternatively, you could tell me to run while I still can.

Here's a copy of my complaint to the Better Business Bureau:

&gt;Food came on time, the pizza was actually pretty good although a little small for a ""large"". The hot wings were terrible though. They had automatically charged my card with a tip, without asking me, was not happy about this. Here's the kicker though:

&gt;They wake me up at 12:30 a.m. to tell me my card declined. According to my card issuer, they had put the expiration date in wrong three times, regardless of the fact that I read the card number back to them FIVE times. Why decided till midnight to call me about this when I had order at 5:30 is beyond me. 

&gt;So, as i'm patiently working with the driver to figure out what is the issue, I can hear someone in the background shouting ""He's just trying to scam us! F&amp;%king scam"". I did not appreciate this as not only was it incredibly unprofessional but they had woke me up about this issue. After the driver and I resolve the issue, I demand to speak to the guy who was shouting at the phone (later turns out to be the manager). He picks up the phone, say ""Thank you. Goodnight"" and hangs up!

&gt;I immediately call back and he's answers and tries to give me some crap about people scamming the restaurant where I just cut him off and lit into him for the next five minutes, all the mean while the guy could give a crap. He would then later refuse to give me the owners name and phone number so that I could talk to him, can't imagine why?

""It has been brought to my attention that during the next Cultural Arts Board meeting some leaders of religious organizations will attempt to zero the arts funding for those organizations have produced work that is contrary to their christian /evangelical beliefs. These people will try to censor the work produced by those organization by pushing and protesting any further funding to those organizations. It is imperative that the arts community comes together to prevent any form of censorship based on a unilateral agenda. Protect the freedom of the Arts in San Antonio Arts by coming en-mass to this meeting and sharing your point of view.

Please, pass this message along.""

They're poised to stifle all forms of artistic expression and free speech simply because it conflicts with their personal beliefs. The basis for their hatred is is due to the fact that the play [Corpus Christi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_%28play%29) in which Jesus is depicted as gay recently showed at [The San Pedro Playhouse](http://qsanantonio.com/corpuschristi.html). 

They have every right under the constitution to protest, but dammit so do we.

Any advice on how best to confront and stop their plot would be much appreciated.

Please Reddit, don't let them get away with forcing us to fall in line with their biased world view.

So I used to work over at Sea World of San Antonio as the ride operator of the Great White. I would either be on the platform, strapping people into the ride, or in controls. Well, today was an exceptionally crazy Saturday, meaning we had a full queue of people waiting to board. I remember that day clearly.

There were 4 guys on platform, strapping everyone in, and I'm in controls, watching through the window and making sure everything was good and dandy. The 4 guys on platform were dicking around, but nothing too bad, just enjoying themselves as much as someone working at a god forsaken place like Sea World could.

I look through my monitor to check everything (I can only see a few back rows with this monitor) and I see everything is fine. The 4 dudes get on their pressurized pads, and give me the thumbs up (the pads were the go ahead, letting the coaster go. If there was any problem, any one of the guys on platform could have walked off the pad and stopped the train from leaving the station).

So, I prepare to launch, and see everything's clear, and launch the train. As the train is going by, with the mindless idiots still with their freaking thumbs up and on the pressurized pads, I watch as some lady still has her harness up ([picture of the seats and harness](http://woofcubs.com/BDO-990501/BDO12-990501.jpg)), and hanging on to the seat of the ride. [This is what she saw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvpXdGNZeY4) (Best Video I could find. This is the front seat though and she only went up a few feet.)

So I see her, screaming her head off with everyone else on the train screaming for joy (no one in the other rows realized what was happening).

**back story here** Our boss that morning had a meeting with us, telling us specifically that we were hitting that STOPLIFT button too many times (we would stop the train because we would see someone with a camera out, or if someone was horsing around ect). Our boss told us ""Whomever hits that stop button again is gonna get terminated"", pretty much we hit it, we get fired. 

So I'm seeing this poor lady, and she's going UP THE FREAKING RIDE NOW, and I snap and hit the STOPLIFT button. I grab my Lockout/Keyout thing, run out of the control room and drag the step rail a good 10 feet up, helping the poor lady from the inclined seat (you should note that my co-workers were staring stupidly, I guess cause of shock). As I'm coming back down the stairs with the lady, my boss has his eyes on me as he motions to me. ""Go home,"" were his only words. 

Gladly, I'd rather be fired than be responsible for someones death.

[CLICK HERE FOR A DIAGRAM WHAT I SAW.](http://i.imgur.com/d457o.png)

Okay, as you can see from the Diagram, I can only see whats happening with row's 1-4. My Monitor can see row's 5-8.
The X on row 5 is where the lady was. (And I spelled entrance wrong. Whoops...)

you get 2 FULL PINTS (in glass you get to keep w/ their logo on it) + 1 shot of their bourbon or a 3rd beer. I highly recommend the bourbon. So smooth and delicious. Awesome people doing great work. Making craft beer, being as green and sustainable as possible, and letting people come in and check it out. Located at 410/35 interchange, behind the Adult Video place.
They also have an Open House on the first Saturday of the month (not this month since it was 103 yesterday.) But they normally have beer, food trucks and live music out there.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Texas during the late fall/early winter and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

A few ghost stories from employees

A look at some of the documentation of the Gunter incident and subsequent haunting

A full tour of the St. Anthony which included several ghost stories, a look at restricted areas and a really awesome concierge to talk to about San Antonio history

Permission to sit on the roof of one of them (can't remember which) and smoke a cigar at 4am

[My daughter and I](http://imgur.com/8Szez.jpg) will be moving into San Antonio on the 3rd or 4th of November from Augusta, GA. I don't know anyone in the area and have no family nearby, so this is a call for help.

I have to return my UHaul truck on Saturday, Nov 6th. Realizing most everyone works Mon-Fri, I'm looking for some help on that day to unload my UHaul. It's nothing too major, 2 bedroom sets, living room, dining room, and some boxes - but more than I'll be able to handle on my own.

What I need: a few people with a couple of hours to spare that can help me out. Have a wife / kids? Bring them along - it would greatly help in entertaining my daughter during the manual labor and [my wife](http://imgur.com/5u1yJ.jpg) will be joining me in San Antonio in the next few months, could be a head-start to a great friendship.

What you get: Free beer and pizza and a new friend! Who knows, maybe some reddit gold subscriptions? Manual labor sucks ass - let's make this as fun as possible.

Where: After a month of searching I've decided on [The Lodge at Westover Hills](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Lodge+as+Westover+Hills&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wl). My apartment is going to be on the 3rd floor - I'm sorry, not looking forward to carrying shit up the stairs either.

When: Nov 6th, as early as possible

My name is Mike, reply here / send me a message if you think you'll be available. Every little bit is going to help me out here and, even if you're not able to make it, I want to thank you up-front for at least considering it.

Looking forward to moving to San Antonio and meeting new people.",,False,self,t5_2qqch,False,,,True,t3_du6zp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/du6zp/hey_rsanantonio_free_beer_and_pizza_on_nov_6/,

I am looking at a job opportunity in San Antonio that would require me to relocate from San Diego.

It's going to be a little brutal for me but I was hoping to get some insight on the neighborhoods and where to look for housing so I can get a better idea of what the CoL will be when I get there.

If anyone is familiar with the San Diego region I live in Ocean Beach and would like to live in a similar neighborhood in San Antonio. Basically a laid back community, lots of tasty beers and bars, not expensive to live, and on a lake or something. I don't know if that's stretching it or not, but I'd love some opinions.

NO MICROCHIP.  This pup has been here since. She's a very smart dog that 
leads with her nose. She IS HOUSEBROKEN, she knows basic 
commands, is great on a leash, and loves to play fetch with 
whatever you can throw. I, unfortunately, do not have the time

she deserves. My guess is that she is a pointer/pit mix

Maybe we could hit up a bar afterwards.  Any ideas for restaurants or bars?

Those of you who want to do something on Thanksgiving Day…As long as you aren’t a giant d-bag, you are invited to spend Thanksgiving with my family.  We aren’t a traditional family and generally go out to eat at Cracker Barrel (we hate dishes) and maybe to a movie.  We also sponsor airmen in boot camp from Lackland AFB.

I have a fucked up pool table with no felt for a table for inside but not much outside. There is no sound system that I know if so if someone wants to bring something, go for it.

There is maybe 35-40 yards of weeds I can mow in the back if people want to play frisbee or something. I was also thinking beer pong/beirut if people still play that.

Not sure when to start, since it is pretty hot. I'll be around all day if people actually want to BBQ and not just grill cheeseburgers. Accenture people will probably come later in the evening since they have some company thing.

Thoughts?

Edit: I will post a list of who is going Friday night, then work on the who is bringing what thing. There is a slim chance I will have to go to Los Angeles, but I will keep everyone posted.

The best things I discovered were the Menger Hotel, La Lecuza, and walking the opposite direction of the crowds on riverwalk.  

I'm a huge Teddy Roosevelt fan. The history in the area was a pleasure to see, especially at the Menger. That place certainly has an eerie feeling to it. The essence of the hallways on the upper floors remind me of the hotel in the shinning.  
Interesting there's a room dedicated to Roy Rogers there too.  The hotel itself reminds me of the lafayette hotel here in Buffalo, NY. As well as many of the mansions and other similar buildings.

We weren't able to get to the spots that were suggested for live music, however we did manage to walk over to the Cove since the lunch provided by our conference didn't appeal to us, and we were just up the street at the SA college.  
The cove's food was good. While it seemed a little overpriced, the fish tacos were awesome. Much rather have grilled fish than fried fish.  

The less traveled parts of the riverwalk are quaint, intimate and relaxing. Hanging around and watching the 'barges' go through the mini-locks is fun to watch. Was curious if the flow control lip is ever dropped for 'full' flow?  And there on riverwalk, i discovered la lecuza when she swooped down on me within two feet of my head.   

the alamo is pretty cool to photograph at night. is much of it rebuilt? we were wondering about that....

wish i more time to wander and discover more hidden spots off the beaten path of the city.
