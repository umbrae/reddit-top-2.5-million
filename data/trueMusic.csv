1344517394.0,82,self.trueMusic,xxqoi,"Welcome music enthusiasts, please read this simple guide before you start posting.",86,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/xxqoi/welcome_music_enthusiasts_please_read_this_simple/,"Yesterday was a [pretty busy](http://i.imgur.com/Unvor.jpg) day. Over 2400 of you subscribed to this little place, and the traffic is increasing at a faster rate now.

If you haven't already, I encourage you to read the information located in the right side bar, if not, I'll try to summarize to you what this subreddit is all about.

* The first and **most important** rule of this subreddit, is keeping the post titles in the right format, which is: **Name of the artist - Song title (Origin, Genre, Year)**. For example:

[*The Beatles - Helter Skelter (UK, Hard Rock, 1968)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMfkVGCU_BA)

[*Mike Patton - Ore D'amore (US, Italian Pop, 2010)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhaBDuSresQ)

[*Bola Johnson - Lagos Sisi (Nigeria, Afro-Jazz, 1970's)*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRC2DKklxGc)


This encourages users to do a little research about the music they post, and makes everyone a little happier. Use [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com), [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [Rate Your Music](http://www.rateyourmusic.com) or [Google](http://www.google.com). 

If you happen to post an obscure 20's french avant-garde tune and you can't find the exact year it was composed and/or released, simply put ""20's"", ""192?"" or ""early 20th century"". Same goes with old classical music or folk tunes from the 19th century.

The origin usually refers to the country of origin of the artist, and the genres are sometimes tricky to figure out, but you can try your best and no one will complain (too much).

If you fail to give at least two pieces of information out of three, your post **will be removed** and you can try to post it again properly.

* **The purpose** of this subreddit is to find and explore music that you probably won't hear on the radio, music that comes from all corners of the world (and beyond). I too enjoy [Sigur Rós](http://www.reddit.com/r/postrock), [Boards of Canda](http://www.reddit.com/r/ambientmusic) and [Tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/metal), but there are already subreddits for that. Popular artists like Pink Floyd, Radiohead or even Dream Theater will be removed, unless you've found an obscure brilliant new track that you have to share.

* You may not be interested in French pop music, [but are you sure you gave it a good listen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/q2yd6/jacqueline_ta%C3%AFeb_7_heure_du_matin_french_y%C3%A9y%C3%A9_pop/) We can't force people to listen to every song and give an honest vote, but we encourage you to expand your horizons. If you go to the [top submissions of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/top/), you'll see that the older posts are quite varied in genres and they're not something you'll find in the top submissions of /r/music or /r/listentothis on an average day, but most of them are *really* good songs though.

Most of the songs that have been posted since yesterday's flood do fit in this subreddit, and I hope it will continue to be like that. So go off exploring!

Almost every single hip-hop post gets either downvoted to oblivion or just gets no attention whatsoever. I'm not entirely sure why this is. As a legitimate and vibrant music genre that has as much (if not more) diversity than other forms of contemporary music, I cannot understand why nothing seems to stick. Is this a problem of taste, where people on this subreddit do not like hip-hop? Or is the problem more central with regards to how hip-hop is regarded in an objective theoretical sense? 

I'm sorry if this is not typically what people expect when coming to this subreddit, but I've found it to be a major problem when attempting to share certain songs that I love, which are oftentimes in complete contrast to ""the modern standards"" skewered in the sidebar.

I have taken it upon myself to discuss something with you what your friendly mods have been ~~plotting~~ planning. It has come to our attention recently that the direction of /r/truemusic has sort of veered off course and is starting to resemble /r/listentothis. While /r/listentothis is a wonderful sub with handsome moderators, we would like to stress /r/trueMusic 's by-laws.  

&gt;**Till now most of the musical content on reddit is focused primarily on English speaking contemporary music.** As it is the spirit of the /True franchise to foster greater depth of content, let's put together quality music that is representative of what music truly is - a global form of expression, experienced through the breadth of time.  

-------------

&gt;Global sounds, rarities, experimental, and forgotten classics. Light on the modern standards (indie, rock, hip hop, metal, electronic) - heavy on a new tickling of the ears.

--------

From now on there will be a heavier moderation on material to try and promote music that wouldn't make it on other subs. This is not to stifle rather encourage an ecosystem of amazing music. There are plenty of subs that will allow people to hear acoustic indie or European downtempo. Now I understand that some of you who are grabbing pitchforks are probably asking the mob behind you... 

&gt;well, what makes it into your fascist fortress?

Of course there is no distinct line I would wager that posts with modern standards (pop, hip hop, rock, indie) that come from the UK, USA, Australia, and maybe Europe will have to go through a second security line. Of course us dashing mods listen to everything so nothing is set in stone. 

There was discussion about just banning English language music for awhile but then comes the problem of the sizable amount of global music that sings in English. Please use this space to ~~throw priceless heirlooms~~ have a civil discussion on the future of /r/trueMusic

As we have discussed several times lately (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/1elx7g/rtruemusic_realignment/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/1g2v6x/can_we_just_change_the_subreddit_to_obscure/)), we recently stepped up the moderation of this subreddit in an effort to keep a global focus on the front page. We have tried to do this by subjecting posts from what we call ""the modern standards"" (indie, rock, hip hop, metal, electronic) from the English-speaking world to an extra layer of scrutiny. But it's not a perfect system, and this approach creates a real problem: we're missing out on a lot of great songs simply because of where they were made, how popular they are or what style they're in.  

So in an attempt to remedy that situation and make sure that we feature True Music in ALL its forms, we present the first Weekly Modern Standards Thread. Every Friday before noon US eastern time, we'll put up an open thread with no limits - everything is welcome, regardless of popularity, origin or style. We'll pin a link to the thread in the sidebar throughout the week for easy reference. 

If you've had a link removed by the mods, post it again here and prove what a bunch of dumbass hipster snobs we are. If you've been sitting on a great song but haven't posted it because it might be too popular, this is the place for it. Or maybe you want to show off your own music to the /r/truemusic community - we're all ears. 

So let it rip and post the baddest stuff you've got. And do let us know what you think of this idea.

Lyrics:

Hace mucho tiempo que yo vivo preguntándome  
para que la tierra es tan redonda y una sola no más.  
    
Si vivimos todos separados  
para que son el cielo y el mar.  
Para que es el sol que nos alumbra  
si no nos queremos ni mirar.  
  
Tantas penas que nos van llevando a todos al final  
Cuantas noches, cada noche de ternura tendremos que dar.  
  
Para que vivir tan separados  
si la tierra nos quiere juntar.  
Si este mundo es uno y para todos  
todos juntos vamos a vivir.      
 ------  

Translation (As a non-Spanish-speaking person interprets):  
  
For so long I have lived wondering  
why is the earth so round, and no more one.  
  
If we all live apart  
for what is the sky and the sea.  
For what is the sun that shines on us  
if we don't even want to look  
  
Many pains that are taking as all to our end  
How many nights, every night of tenderness we have to give.  
  
Why live so apart  
if the earth wants us together  
If the earth is one and for everyone  
All together we will live  ",,False,self,t5_2rzty,False,,,True,t3_1gnj7o,http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/1gnj7o/los_jaivas_todos_juntos_chile_progressive_rock/,

1344526696.0,8,self.trueMusic,xxyrf,[META] A question for the community.,12,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/trueMusic/comments/xxyrf/meta_a_question_for_the_community/,"First I want to start off by saying I really like this subreddit. I’ve only been a member for about a week but the sheer variety of quality posts is amazing. As can be seen this subreddit is beginning to really grow and expand. I’m sure the Mods can see this clearly from the subscriber’s chart. This is really great to see a community grow around such a variety of music. But with the growth comes a problem sometimes coined the [“September Effect”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) occurs when you have an influx of new people who alter the original course and structure of a community. The problem is caused be by a large number of people coming into a community and at a faster rate than it takes for them to learn the cultures and polices of said community. This problem is exacerbated by [reddit’s own vote weighting](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19588). When choosing how posts are ranked on the “Hot” page reddit uses a logarithmic algorithm which also takes into the age of the post. So that means when the ranking on the page is calculated the first 10 votes have the same weight as the next 100, which have the same weight as the next 1000.

In summary a post which can be quickly consumed and voted on will rise to the top. Unfortunately this rewards quick simple posts like memes or funny images and tends to punish posts which take some time to consider, like longer videos or articles. My point is that eventually you will reach a point where there is an influx of new people and the quality of posts will begin to fall.   

So in my rambling way we are lead to my question: How will you deal with popularity?  It’s a problem that plagues many subreddits and communities as a whole. Before /r/music was a default subreddit it seems that there was a fair bit more quality (or it could be the nostalgia goggles). One solution is to have a very active mod team but that is a lot of work. Another idea is to perhaps make a bot that somehow lets people post only after they have been in the community for a few weeks. I don’t really have an answer to this. I wrote this hoping to start discussion on how best to grow this community and at the very least get people thinking about it. I hope /r/truemusic continues to stay awesome.
