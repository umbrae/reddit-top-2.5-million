EDIT: Changed the sizes of the images and made some more alterations, think it looks a ton better now. Let me know if you think it's a bag of shite!

I'm ill and have been playing with the style sheet. Let me know what you think!

I'll be happy to use images other people can cook up (if they look better), I had to compromise as the width only seem to go to 15px so the upvote isn't as nicely spaced as I would have liked.

Oh well. If you think it is an improvement then cool, if not we can go back to default or use a different image.

Idea is: Hanging connection (tigers mouth) is strong and useful in many different ways. Empty triangle: Usually bad or inefficient, but very effective in unique situations if used judiciously.

He built the entire board, and turned both bowls rather quickly. He hand selected the white bowl's wood, and I hand selected the wood for the black bowl.

I haven't treated the board or the bowls as well as I should have over the years, but I plan on refurbishing them soon, so that I have this set forever.

I love go. I don't think I can just 'stop playing'. These past months I've felt depressed, unambitious, lazy, and overall very drained of color. Then a few days ago I come across some 10k-5k life or death Tsumego online, and do a few... Then a few more. Then, more. By the time I was done, I was all smiles.

Immediately I dragged out my old board and bowls, and started making calls to friends who I've played with in the past. I don't want to fall into disinterest, or burn myself out.

How do you shake off the rust, starting up again? I want that fiery passion for learning I once had, and It's hard when I used to be doing Dan level Tsumego and was playing at a 5-6k level; now I feel like a beginner again, with no sense of flow for the game and a distinct lack of joseki or keeping sente. 

There has to be another person who has been through this. How did you get the Go-Engine fired up again?

I decided to go ahead and purchase the first season of Hikaru No Go. It's kind of cheesy but seeing the characters all burn with ambition for their own reasons, seeing Hikaru go from clueless to interested, always makes me feel happy and reminds me of when I was starting out.

We played for about 25 minutes (he doesn't last that long for Candyland) and by the end he seemed to have a good grip on the basic rules.  He was capturing (""Putting pieces in jail""), he understood liberties and extending/connecting (""Saving a piece"") and even seemed to understand when a piece was hopelessly lost.  The amazing thing was that teaching seemed to help me understand a couple of other things I've been having trouble understanding.

I'm curious about how it has impacted you, especially if you've got an interesting story to share.

Personally I started learning Go at the age of 10, and reading HnG made me feel super motivated to get better at Go. I also felt somewhat ""privileged"" or ""special"" to be just like Shindo Hikaru. I had some non-Go player friends in elementary school, and they became very curious about Go after reading the manga, even asking me to teach them how to play. Today it's very much a part of childhood and I revisit the series fondly from time to time, though I have other motivations for improving such as chances to compete in regional and international tournaments, and the friendships I've formed over 10+ years.

*edit*
We now has a chat on the short game! And I reduced the time to 10 minutes.

Now I need to make a database of completed games and their SGF files.

I'll still contemplate the removing votes, or maybe just have them be displayed on mouseover. Or a toggle button. But it'll probably be a little while from now.

Also, the how to play link on the right is full of helpful material, but I think we could benefit from a sidebar link/section specifically for beginners outlining where to start &amp; key concepts and a simple, progressive manner.  The goal would be to provide resources that a totally new player could work through sequentially and get to under 20kyu (understanding basic fighting, life and death, opening theory, and good shape.)

Here is the list I've posted.  Please provide additional links or feedback and I will refine it for future use.

For example, when we recently announced Go Game Q&amp;A at http://gogameguru.com/go-game-questions-answered/ it got voted down so quickly that I doubt a lot of people here even know what it is.

Do people not like our articles? Or is it just that people don't want them to be posted here? Is this not what /r/baduk is for? Do you think we're spamming you?

We have been promoting /r/baduk on our site, and you'll have noticed that the readership has increased quite a lot recently.

To make it easier for us to review your game please follow these guidelines:

* Suitable formats are [SGF](http://www.gokgs.com/archives.jsp) and [Eidogo](http://eidogo.com/) (or both).  
* Do not post photos or screen grabs unless absolutely necessary.
* Post as *self text*.  That way you have extra room to ask questions and provide the game link.
* Be sure to tell us which side you played (black or white) and your estimated rank.
* Please remove chat comments from the game record (unless they are directly related to the review).
* When possible take the time to do your own review before posting. Include variations and comments in the game record. We can use this information to give you a more accurate review of the game and your reasoning.
* You will get the most out of reviews of slow, serious games (as opposed to blitz).
* It's usually best to submit games that are close (win or lose) instead of lopsided games.

Tips:

* In Eidogo, remember to click **Save to Server** and copy the *new URL*
* [How to delete variations in Eidogo](http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/17t268/how_to_delete_a_variation_in_eidogo)

1355867635.0,25,self.baduk,152mt3,Advice to kyu players: Joseki choice doesn't matter (much),31,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/152mt3/advice_to_kyu_players_joseki_choice_doesnt_matter/,"Since there a lot of kyu players in this subreddit looking to improve, I thought I would offer some general advice from my experience. There is a lot of material written about joseki and fuseki. The primary reason is that the longer the game goes, the less likely it is that the exact position has been reached before. Also, since in the very early game, you are much more likely to see your exact position in a professional game, there is a tendency among kyu players to want to correct their joseki and fuseki. This is ok to a degree. Playing a joseki, will almost always give you a better result than playing something that isn't joseki. However, my recommendation is that you don't let yourself get too deep. I can honestly say that in all of my kyu games, I NEVER lost a game because I played the wrong JOSEKI. I lost many games because I played really bad moves that were not joseki. But I also lost a lot of games because I lost a large group, or because I failed to kill or profit from attacking my opponent when he made a really deep invasion. However, I never lost a game just because I made the wrong choice of joseki. This is because, at the kyu level, the choice of one joseki over another simply doesn't matter that much in most positions. I'm certain there are exceptions to this rule, but I suspect you would be hard pressed to find a game where one of the top 5 mistakes was choosing the wrong joseki. For instance, if your opponent invades your star point, and you block on the wrong side, it contributes to your loss. But I suspect a bigger influence on the result was your misreading of the ladder 10 moves later. Now, there are many paths to dan level, and I won't claim to have chosen the best path or even a good one. The above opinions are simply a result of my experience regarding the relative severity of kyu-level mistakes. **TL;DR Bad choice of joseki probably isn't why you lost.**",,False,,t5_2qhqe,1355870460.0,,,True,t3_152mt3,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/152mt3/advice_to_kyu_players_joseki_choice_doesnt_matter/,

Anybody interested? I'll be happy to sort out the logistics, I have some ideas as to how it could be done, but before busting my rear end I'd like to see who wants to have a 'go' ;-) Clearly all levels are welcome and could be accommodated.

I think it will help create a community focus, we can review and discuss games by sharing SGF files using something like dropbox. The big idea is that we would all be responsible for updating our own scores so that results are automatically generated and can be posted when we are done.

There are some logistical problems relating to differing timezones etc, however, letting people organise a time to play with their matches and reporting their results after the game should solve most problems.

Edit: Please be sure to include your current estimated rank to help with pairing! For the sake of ease the first tournament will be handicapped based on rank. I'm going to give it 24 hours and then use the people who acknowledge in this thread to get our first tournament going!

Android has several goban apps, but none of them worked quite how I wanted, and often lacked features or configuration that I would have liked. noGo is still not perfect (yet...), but at least it works the way I want!

Particular features include:

* Open and edit multiple boards in one session
* Guess mode for playing through pro games
* Several different board/stone skins
* Replace/insert moves and rearrange the mainline variation...highly convenient when recording games
* Navigate mode where tapping the board navigates the game rather than playing stones
* Simple area score mode
* ~1000 included pro games from Andries Brouwer's [public domain collection](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/go/games/index.html)

noGo is distributed as open source under the GPL version 3, and its source code is fully available [on github](https://github.com/inclement/noGo). Its UI is written in python (not java!) via the fantastic [kivy graphical framework](http://kivy.org/#home). Board logic is tracked via Matthew Woodcraft's [Gomill tools](http://mjw.woodcraft.me.uk/gomill/doc/0.7.4/intro.html).

I'd be delighted for any comments/bug reports/suggestions/whatever. noGo is ready to use, but it's still an early release version, and there is lots still to come.

**Edit**: I should say, currently noGo is optimised for phones and should scale nicely to ~7"" tablets. It will also work on larger devices, but the UI will start to be quite inefficient.

Trying to come up after my big mistake on the left side, the chase of life and death, to kill with limited liberties was an absolute thrill! I had my heart rate through the roof and by some luck I managed to win at the end. 

Such great feeling.

Some feedback would be great to improve further. I feel that my style rarely wins me any corners/sides and relies heavily on winning the center. It seems to work at my rank, but I doubt it will work against stronger players who can connect more effectively.

In the second story they talk about chess, and ""The Book"" of moves where someone had recorded the moves in some large amount of games, and when chess players play, they copy those moves up to a certain point when the game then goes ""off book"". 

Obviously Baduk/Go has many more playable moves, but is there any such book or reference? any grouping of ""standard"" starting patterns that get played a lot, and then at some point the game goes ""off book""?

I'm seeing it as bit of a recruitment opportunity, so I'm hoping to blast them with the complexity of the game and pique their interest. I'm thinking of mentioning that there are no strong computer programs, and explaining the difference between chess and go programs.

I have a few ideas on how to present, I'm aware that this isn't going to be a normal lesson for the curious however. I'd really like to have animations of games in the background, starting with a simple explanation of the rules or 'laws' of the board, games starting slow and getting faster and faster, perhaps showing different styles (ie Korea Vs Japan) to you get different patterns spreading across the board.

The thing that bothers me, I think, is that I have no goal. When I play chess - I've been playing for years and I still remember my first steps - I always have a goal: kill pieces, get to the king. Even when my strategy was weak, with that in mind I had some sort of direction.

But with Go, I'm a headless chicken.

I tried a bunch of exercises from KGSGo and I did ""well enough"" for a beginner, but when I actually play it's just...so...sad.

Any tips anyone can give me? I'd appreciate it a lot.",,False,,t5_2qhqe,False,,,True,t3_11cvt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/11cvt2/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/,

I have played competitive chess at a low level before and enjoy studying a game and it's intricacies--Go certainly doesn't fall short in this regard. There is no Baduk club at my university so I think I will help start one with some other friends. 

I have some questions for you, if you would take the time to answer them:

-How quickly should I expect to improve? I know the first levels of Kyu are quick and that it steadily gets slower as you get better. What's a reasonable goal?

-How old were you when you started playing? What are some memorable moments you have with Go?

-What are good ways to improve aside from playing all that I can? Life and Death? Studying professional games? Studying joseki?

1) Important/iconic: Something that makes the game memorable in Go history. This can be anything, from a hard-fought win to &lt;insert pro player&gt;'s 100th pro victory to two really good players duking it out...but I want it to have some significance. Obviously the more significant the better, but this is less important than 2.

2) Aesthetics. The game should have a pleasing finishing position. Most games have this, but pick your favourite :) Again, criteria aren't important here. If you like the look of the end board, post it! 

I'll post the board here when it's complete, too :)

EDIT: I should probably stress: I care FAR more about aesthetics than fame. Everybody's posting famous games, but I'm more interested in how the board is going to look. That's what matters. For example, I'm currently leaning towards this one:

http://www.usgo.org/news/2010/12/members-edition-redmond-plays-tahara-in-gosei-c-section-game/

Is it iconic? Not really. It's a very close pro game, but it's not iconic. But the final position is complex, it has a lot of winding stone pathways, it's got a nice balance of color.

&gt; ""Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you’ll see the difference. The craftsman isn’t ever following a single line of instruction. He’s making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he’ll be absorbed and attentive to what he’s doing even though he doesn’t deliberately contrive this. His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn’t following any set of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material at hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of changes until his mind’s at rest at the same time the material’s right.""

This struck me as being relevant to the differences between strong and weak Go players. The weak player is thinking move by move, or only a few moves ahead, perhaps relying rigidly on joseki regardless to their proper use or impact. The strong player is reacting to the whole board position and being mindful of the flow of the game. 

This is something I always try to think about, but never seem to achieve. I assume it will come with hard work and practice, because the stronger players I've talked to describe it as almost a dance, or embrace (or in stronger cases - strangulation) on the board.

I thought I would share this with you fine folks and see what you thought about it. As an aside, has anyone read the book?

A possible issue with ranks is people using different rank systems. I want KGS rank, it just seems easier, by the end of this tourny however we should have more stable grades for a better pairing system next time.

Anyways, I thought I might share my routine, in case it may be use to others.

* First and foremost: play a lot of games with blitz time, especially with time constraints of 2 x 10s Byo-Yomi or 5 x 20s Byo-Yomi. Do not worry if you lose a few games, your rank when playing blitz may be lower than your actual rank (if you are worried about your rank, I suggest making another account specifically for fast games). But your rank does not mean anything. Remember: all that matters is that you are trying to improve; and you will.

Unless you don't like doing things with music, I recommend playing Go while listening to familiar music. It makes the whole experience more enjoyable.

(ENTS: Play go with trees, especially with music)

* Do some life and death problems. [goproblems.com](http://www.goproblems.com/) is a great resource. You don't have to do them all the time, but maybe try to do at least one or two a day (and by doing i actually mean being absolutely sure you have it right before you look at the answer).

Also, [Kiseido](http://www.kiseido.com/go_books.htm) has a great selection of beginner to dan level life and death collections to bring with you anywhere; heck, you can do life and death problems in the bathroom!

* Read other books too. Your library or your library's network might have copies of go books that you can take out if you'd like. Or you might be able to borrow them from a local Go club. Otherwise, you may just want to buy them online.

These books will help you work on your strategy. After reading books, try to apply what you've learned to your games, even if you lose at first, you should improve fast.

I Recommend [In the Beginning](http://www.kiseido.com/Begin3.htm#K10), [The Endgame](http://www.kiseido.com/Begin3.htm#K15), and [Attack and Defense](http://www.kiseido.com/Begin3.htm#K14), but there are many other great books.

Just and end note, you may not realize how much you have improved until you play some slower games, especially tournament games.

Well, I hope this helps you guys! And have fun playing, I certainly do.

While this isn't that impressive to many online players, its pretty impressive considering how lazy I am.)  I feel teaching and reviewing is a good way to get stronger, and I would like to help others get stronger too, so I am offering to do some offline game reviews.

I am AGA 3d, Oro 4d, and probably around KGS 2d (but I haven't played a ranked game there in ages).

So if you would like a game reviewed, please post the game here, and I will review it and then upload it back. You can save sgf files to eidogo.com and post the link to there if you do not have anywhere to upload it, or simply post the actual sgf text to pastebin or some other service and link there. (KGS account with game description that is still in your archive works too)

Please include your rank, what color you were, and any specific concerns you would like covered (joseki selection, tsumego situation, overall direction/flow, etc) but you do not have to specify anything if you are just curious about the game in general. I will look over the entirety of the game regardless, but put special focus to where you request.

One request is that you post serious games only. While blitz games are fun to play, those are games you can review yourself and learn plenty from. I am looking more for games that you were able to play your hardest. Don't worry about being embarassed to post games where a single blunder cost you the game, as long as you thought about all your moves during the game, there is still much that can be learned from it.

(As I am unable to really do reviews from work, I will do most of the reviews in the evening. I will try to do a few each night depending on how much demand there is, and how long they take. Please refrain from posting a new game while you still have one that is being reviewed. Once I finish a review of one of your games, feel free to post more games. As always, I am only 3d, so there is a good chance my reviews will have holes in them, so please call me out on them if you spot them! These are intended to make everyone stronger, myself included, and letting mistakes slide helps no one. Please post questions about your reviews if I have said something confusing or you do not agree with.)

I'm tempted to throw down cash, but I'd like to hear about some first hand experiences outside of the developer blog.

EDIT: I decided ""what the hell"" and donated for a supporter account.

Summary: For an alpha, it's pretty damn good!

Pros:

- The board is nice and responsive, and the stone graphics are pretty.
- Malkovich comments - The players can make comments only visible to the audience watching the game to describe why they made a particular move.
- The sound of the stones is really satisfying.
- [There is a hilarious easter egg](http://i.imgur.com/J51CW.jpg)
- You can give players karma (I assume for rewarding polite play and being helpful)
- Timestamps!

Cons:

- Some of the functionality is wonky or broken, such as reviewing games.
- The UI needs some work (although already looking better than KGS).

In summary, I think without a doubt this server has the potential to beat KGS. The speed of development is really fast, and it already contains some features no other server can offer. By the time it gets to proper launch, I think it will be in running for the best English-language Go server. It will definitely kick ass by the time it's matured a few years down the line.

What is it? Free tutoring among r/Baduk players. There are some unwoven threads here, but maybe we can come up with something together. In short:

* Assume I'm a 7k
* I find (or he/she finds me) a 13-14k player
* I take this player as pupil, and we meet (KGS or similar) once a week for 30 min-1 hour (or more frequently, as both players arrange)
* In this meetings, I try to teach stuff I know and I would love having back when I was 13/14k
* A 1k finds me (or I find him/her) and we do the same.

This structure 1k-7k-13k-(19k if it was the case) would be a ""thread"".

The only problem left would be what happens in the ends of the thread:

* 20k can teach newcomers how to use KGS and the basics of playing
* 1d-?d can form 3-4 person study groups

In the edges, the thing as you see is not that clear, but I think this could be _awesome_. 

If we get a pool of enough players, we can improve steadily (by doing something each week to make us better) and help each other.

Just wanted to share some thoughts.,18,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/1c26oi/after_a_lengthy_time_off_im_back_into_go_and/,"I had an unfortunate relationship with go. About January - June 2011 I got quite into Go. I was probably playing about 5 games a week on KGS. I rose from 20kyu upto 11kyu at my highest point. And really enjoying the steady progress. However, in July I travelled overseas on a university exchange. My University's network (unintentionally) blocked KGS and I was unable to play. To fill my go needs I downloaded Goban and loaded GNUgo but after some initial enjoyment I found the AI too robotic and it just wasn't 'fun'. I like to think of it as 'arcade go'.

When I returned home 6months later the magic was gone. I didn't play a game on KGS again. Not because I didn't want to, it just didn't really cross my mind. I couldn't really be bothered.

But a couple of weeks ago I just decided to have another game with GNUgo, giving myself a generous handicap. Kind of fun. Played another few games, reduced my handicap back to something fair. I was hooked. I got back onto KGS. Hoping that my handicap hadn't fallen too much. After a few games I levelled out on 15k. A few more games I'm back upto 14k and loving every minute of every game. I'm looking forward to rising up and hopefully hitting the 10k barrier. Wish me luck.

I just wanted to say I'm back. And sorry I left. Go's a wonderful game and logic in it's purest form. Hopefully I stick around a bit longer this time.",,False,,t5_2qhqe,False,,,True,t3_1c26oi,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/1c26oi/after_a_lengthy_time_off_im_back_into_go_and/,

There is so much awesome content, I just love it!

That being said, how can we get more support for this so it doesn't fade away due to lack of support? 

I think we all understand why Baduk TV English is so expensive. Having experienced Korean players translate and native English speakers edit takes time and money. I think they did a great job of setting it up so you can try it, but after that week, wow the cost goes up!

One idea I have been kicking around is to pitch the subscription to Go clubs and other organizations. For instance, 50 US per month is steep, but not if that's split between 5-10-20 people. They said they need a few hundred subscribers to make it feasible, and there has to be a market for this for Go clubs all over the (English-speaking) world! It would really lower the threshold for getting access to such an awesome resource.

Maybe this will have some complications, maybe they will need to make a new 'class' of subscription for groups? 

Marketing directly to Go clubs? Trying to get it plugged in that fancy documentary that's getting made about Go?

I really enjoy learning Go and want to continue improving, but starting new games on KGS is irrationally stressful to me.

I don't mind losing against players who are significantly better than me, but it's very hard and frustrating to lose against other players who clearly have huge flaws in their understanding of the game (e.g. occasionally make 1-2 point plays when there are still 20+ point plays open on the board).

I used to be a fairly competitive starcraft: brood war player, and I remember having this same problem (massive frustration at losing to bad players) until I achieved a certain level of mastery of the game. Once I got to the point where I only ever lost against other players who I considered pretty good, I no longer minded losing.

SGF games posted to eidogo.com all have the same base URL, with a different fragment identifier.  In order to get reddit to respect your URL as different from others, the base URL must be different.  Fortunately, eidogo.com seems to ignore unexpected query parameters that are passed to the URL before the fragment.  

This means that the following two URLs point to different games, but look identical to reddit:

http://eidogo.com/#2bqtfmCK
http://eidogo.com/#zl49HFv

However, the following two URLs point to the same game, but look different to reddit:

http://eidogo.com/#zl49HFv
http://eidogo.com/?game=zl49HFv#zl49HFv

So if you want to make sure your eidogo URL doesn't show up as a duplicate, just add `?game=[game_id]` before the `#` mark in the URL.  

In theory, you could probably add any get parameters, but eidogo is open source, so I'm planning on talking to the developers about whether they'd be open to me contributing a patch that would treat a game parameter the same way they treat the fragment ID.

""What is it?"", you might ask.  Well, it's a continuous ongoing ladder tournament. And it's open to all of /r/baduk no matter your strength or experience.

The basic idea is that each person on the ladder has a rung #. Players start at the bottom and try to work up to rung #1. Each time you win a challenge match you swap rungs with your opponent above.

The specific instructions of how to join the ladder are covered in detail on the [ladder web page](http://rbaduk.tigerjump.net/).

The Challenge Ladder is now open for business!  To get things started I joined as the first rung :)  That's right, the ladder is starting **empty**!!!

That means the earlier you get in the more games you will get as challengers appear from below!

In the spirit of /r/baduk I hope stronger players will be able to offer some game reviews as they move up the ladder. And I encourage all players to post interesting games back here in /r/baduk.  [EidoGo](http://eidogo.com/upload) is a good option for this.

That's pretty much it.  If anyone has questions please reply below.  I will answer any questions as soon as I can.

----

Hello redditers, I am the long-lost owner of [shidogo.com](http://shidogo.com). I have been a long time reader of reddit and its baduk counterpart, though I have never posted. But now I need help, as my website is soon to expire!

Let me explain. Nearly 9 months ago I decided to take advantage of Stack Overflow's Stack Exchange system and create a Q/A website for players of the wonderful game of Go. I worked for several days straight putting together a Stack Exchange website and hacking around its limitations to let players easily post game boards using Eidogo's open source goodness. I had never been so passionate working on a project before; nothing else was more important at the moment.

Finally getting the site to an acceptable state, I decided to advertise Shidogo on KGS. Unfortunately I got such a negative response (so it felt). The few people that did respond immediately started talking about money, if I was going to profit from advertising, or if I was willing to sign an agreement saying I would never try to make money from the site.

Advertising? Profit? These were subjects that had not even crossed my mind. My intentions were to create a go-player-friendly website where questions would get answered, yet I felt as if I were getting interrogated with the hammer of evil intentions. It disheartened me so much as to stop visiting my own website all together. Shidogo was a lost cause, I had thought, a product no one wanted.

One area that is really ripe for us to improve is understanding why basic josekis play out the way they ""should"" and how to take advantage if your opponent breaks from that sequence.

As a concrete example, consider the 3-3 invasion of the 4-4 point. [Looking at this sequence](http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointInvasion), last night we played 1 through 4 correctly. But then white decided to hane black's original group at 4-2, and black got stuck chasing white around the corner without really gaining anything.

Although I would welcome advice on how respond against that particular play, I'm more interested in go resources that will help us understand why the josekis should play out the way they do.

It's one of those games that I know that if I was better at it and had an opponent just as good as I am, I would play over and over and never get tired of it.

The problem for me right now is that I frankly suck at it, as most players do in the beginning. I have no one around to play against IRL on a regular basis (at least not now) so I have to resort to playing on the computer.

I have played some against both bots and real people online, but I'm always losing fairly quickly, and that discourages me from trying again. I know I'm expected to lose many, many times before things start happening, but it's still not fun to play when the game is over quickly and you have almost no idea what went wrong. What makes it worse is that even though I know most players are very helpful and delighted to train someone new, I feel like I'm wasting their time.

My guilt tells me I should play a lot against bots before I go online again, but my common sense tells me bots won't teach me anything worth anything ""out there.""

Should I play against humans or bots?

For the logistics part I think I'll settle with:

* Google docs (public) with participants and ""tutoring threads""
* Google calendar (public) with lessons/tsumego sessions/*sessions schedules (idea by Hellzapoppin and SolarBear: perfect for high level players to also get something out the structure). This would also appear in the KGS reddit room
* I'll open a Doodle to find an adequate time to make the lessons/sessions. First I'll need someone to ""speak first"", or either we can do a tsumego session with varied problems from some book I have over here
* Games/Lessons will be played in the reddit room in KGS unless something odd is arranged among participants
* I'll look for a place to store the SGFs in a nice way (at worst, a public Dropbox or in my cloud server, no problems)

Unless someone wants to play badly someone other as tutor, I'll assign the tutoring threads this Saturday paying particular attention to timezones, so you can guess that if you are in GMT-5 or around GMT you will play ""each other"", except for cases where someone told me he has very flexible schedule. This will be done in format low kyu -&gt; medium/high kyu - beginner. When I post the threads, it will only be preliminary, no problems in moving things around later.

Everyone is welcome to join, but I want to get it rolling for a few weeks just in case we need to tweak. 

Thanks to several new inscriptions, the structure has been cleaned a little, and is as follows:

If someone in the US and between 99d and 4k want to start teaching, he is most welcome, since MoodyBlues has to teach two students and I prefer people only teach one at once.

**What is expected from a teacher?** In the end what matters is that your student improves, no matter what. Teaching games, game reviews, joint tsumego sessions, lectures. Whatever you feel like doing. You can devote as much time as you want (and your student can take), but I guess that a minimum 30 min session per week should be the least to do.

**What is expected from a student?** Of course, improving and listening. If you arrange a session with your teacher, don't forget about it (same goes for teachers, of course). Also compliance: if your teacher says: do all these tsumego for next week and you agree, you should do them. 

I'll try to contact everyone, but we are quite a bunch and it may take a while. I'll start with the ""heads"" in each ladder. By Sunday next week everyone should have given/received the first lecture.

I'm still thinking about what benefits does a ladder ""head"" get, since there is no-one ahead to teach him/her. Any ideas on this area are most welcome. Of course teaching and getting your student better is satisfying, but getting teaching is also good :)

If I happen to find some free time, I'll set up a simple webpage (don't expect something as nice as the Reddit Challenge Ladder by programmar ;) on my personal domain. I broke Apache with some misconfiguration, so until I get this solved (and find time to write the page), this is the ""source"" for the ladder.

I'm a long-time chess player and RTS gamer. After getting interested in the Japanese language I've been trying shogi and go. Shogi feels natural to me but go is a mystery. 

It is about as abstract as a game gets. I just can't see the plans. With chess you can picture the fight - the attacks, the lost men, the battle formation of the pieces and pawns. It's instantly apparent when the game is over. But is it really possible to picture go?

A related question is - where is the beauty in go? What are some examples of brilliant moves? I looked at what seem to be the classics - http://senseis.xmp.net/?FamousGoGames. However, go continues to escape me.

1: Even games only, ranks seem too unstable and can actually change over the course of the tourny. Also inaccurate ranks lead to very unbalanced games.

2:Ranks to be altered retroactively during the tournament if it is obvious there has been a levelling up (or down!). This effects results somewhat, but nothing can really be done about that. This can only be done if there is an obvious problem, increasing grade for example may lead to your overall position increasing due to macmahon score increasing.

3: There were problems with non-responders staying in the tourny, this is my bad, so from now on a non-response will mean elimintaion AND default win to their partner.

4:Games left unplayed can actually be played at any time with the software I'm using, so if you miss a week due to lack of time you can play the game later. I'm not sure what policy I should adopt though, I'm thinking it should be up to the partner who is being stood up that week.

5: For clarity, I want submissions latest on sunday evening, reality means I won't actually update until monday evening. Submissions to state clearly who played who, and who won. E.G. Player A Vs Player B, player B won. It took ages to find the winner as I had to actually open the SGF files and look at the winner then cross-reference KGS names with Reddit user names. Obviously this led to some errors.

**FINALLY**: Programmar has come up with what I think is an awesome suggestion, original comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/mvuh9/tournament_results_sorry_for_the_delay/c34doq6)

**Copy paste below:
**
I would like to try an ongoing ladder tournament. I would be willing to administer the ladder if Hellzapoppin has time pressures or simply wants to focus on regular tournaments.

Games would be played on KGS using handicap
players can challenge an opponent 1 or 2 rungs above (negotiable)
challenges must be accepted (or forfeited) within 1 week
if the challenger wins they swap places on the ladder
the loser must challenge someone else before re-challenging the same opponent
a player can only issue one challenge at a time
new players start at the bottom of the ladder
I think the effect of this would be a ladder that strongly favours participation over rank. 

Of course playing well and winning games is still the mechanism for moving up so it also rewards effort.

The biggest issue is accuracy of ranks for determining the proper handicap.

Also, large handicaps (especially over 9 stones) are a bit problematic. We might have to use negative komi. Maybe 10 points per missing handicap stone.

A slight modification would be to play one less than the normal handicap (unless already even). This would create a hybrid ordering on the ladder so it follows rank to some degree while still emphasizing participation and effort.",,False,,t5_2qhqe,True,,,True,t3_mxqoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/mxqoz/tournament_discussion_and_suggestions_thread/,moderator

* Load until a certain move a SGF file

* Score estimate (if I get to the point I'm better than gnugo counting, no problem, I'll stop doing it)

* Spit a diagram of the position

Since I have recently reformatted tasuki's problem sets, I'd fancy having something similar for counting, but I'm missing some pieces:

* ~~Position to TeX: The old scripts to generate diagrams are hard to find, i was unable. Anything that can generate a PNG or PDF or whatever could work: I can generate my own TeX files from them~~ Okay, I had sgf2dg already downloaded. Bad memory
* Which games to pick? Random? High dan games from KGS? I don't think pro games qualify

Is there any interest in this? It's not hard to do (except for the first missing point), but doing it only for myself could be dull :/",,False,,t5_2qhqe,True,,,True,t3_mq7vr,http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/mq7vr/crazy_idea_to_train_counting/,

* A page in Sensei Library (the Go freely editable wiki)
* A room in KGS (or we can use reddit's room)

We need something to track participants and ""threads"", so SL (or Google Docs, or whatever similar where we can edit) is probably a must.

Looking at the current registered players, we can create easily 3 threads: 8k-&gt;12~18k-&gt;25k, although looks like we need more players in the low-kyu-shodan area, and a few more 25k are easy to fit.

Hopefully it means that next time we will be much improved in terms of system and execution.


That Said:

+ The tournament will use the McMahon pairing system.


+ If we have 40 or more players then we will split into bands, otherwise we are all one big happy family.


+ We will follow the Japanese rule set and counting system.


+ Even game, 6.5 komi.


+ Games should take place on KGS in the Reddit room.


+ Time limit: 30 mins plus five 30 second byoyomi periods per player.


+ Rounds: We have enough entrants for 4 rounds, each round will run over the course of a week (may extend to 10 days, lets see how this goes).


+ When to play:  You and your opponent shall decide the time of your game, it does not matter when you play so long as it is within the allotted time of a week (I'll give a final date / time to submit by).


+ No Shows: No game played will result in a void, one player not showing up at an agreed time means default win for the player that did. You can of course schedule for later, but this will be agreed by the players. 



+ Winners: The winner of the tournament is the player with the highest McMahon score; if this produces a tie, then the winner is the player with the most wins, and if that produces a tie, then the winner is the player with the highest sum of opponents' scores. Ties not resolved by any of these methods shall remain unresolved. I believe the program I'm using does this automatically, lets see how it pans out.


+ It is the duty of the winner of each game to report the result of the game. Report to me (Hellzapoppin) by PM on reddit. No game results will be a default void game.


+ Please report any disputes to me (Hellzapoppin) by PM on reddit, I'll do my best to make a fair decision.


+ Prizes: For now, the adoration of your fellow redditors! Perhaps we can look into a trophy tag, gold silver and bronze, to be displayed next to the user that achieves that position.

+ Review: Multiple methods have been suggested, lets try them all based on your personal preferences. I'd like the discussion to occur in the forum as much as possible, but lets just see how it works out.

Note: The decisions I'm making are to try and keep the tournament simple and accommodate potential time zone differences,  also to pick out any major organisational problems before we start to fine tune. I'm open to suggestions for different constraints and systems for subsequent tournaments


Please give me some feedback on this suggested rule set, I'm all ears and will make alterations based on sensible suggestions / consensus.

And I've yet to persuade any of my friends to get in to playing it.

Any good resources? Or other advice?

I really dislike my move white 24. I feel it is too deep and even if i live I do not like the deep invasion. What do you think is the best move given the board position for white?

Also, I won! After my just before and up to move 150 I mentally gave up, and I do not know why I kept on playing. Where do you think blacks biggest mistake is (after move 150)?

So, If you have any questions about why and I played where I did, feel free to ask. If you think I made any bad moves, feel free to help me improve.

Hello everyone !

I've mentioned previously in the very first posts about the reddit tournament that I was interested in doing group tsumego so I'm offering everyone just that ! I've never done that yet so think of it as an experiment. If it goes well, I might repeat the experience.

**What's that ?** If you don't know what tsumego are, [have a look at this](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsumego). Simply put, they're go problems. If you don't know what group tsumego is, well a bunch of people get together and try to solve a particular problem together.

**So, who's invited ?** Pretty much anybody although I'll focus on problems in the DDK range, so SDK and dan players will probably find it pretty boring. Knowing your [basic killing shapes](http://senseis.xmp.net/?KillingShapes) is a requirement, though.

**When is that?** Unless most interested members of r/baduk cannot attend, I plan on doing this on **Monday, December 19th at 9 PM Eastern time**. If you cannot attend, I'll post the SGF somewhere. Not as cool as the real thing, I know, but you'll still be able to see the attempts of everyone.

**How will it work** For the exact details, [please see this](http://i.imgur.com/TV2vp.jpg). I'm still in the process of figuring it out. What I DO know however is that I'll focus on life &amp; death this time. I'm especially interested into showing HOW to solve them : L&amp;D tesuji, how to ""create"" killing shapes and such. Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated.

**How do I join?** Anyone can join but as I mentioned anyone in the SDK or higher range will find this boring beyond hope. If you plan on being there, please reply in this thread so I can have a vague estimate of how many people will be attending. If you have ideas about how to run this properly or if stronger players want to suggest problems, please send me a private message so as not to pollute the thread.

I think the ticking clock makes me far more nervous than it should, and I find myself making stupid mistakes in the heat of the moment. This has caused me to fall out of playing Go for a while.

Recently, I found [anDGS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.anDGS&amp;hl=en)--a client for the asynchronous Dragon Go Server for Android (there is [another client that works on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-go-client/id384372078?mt=8), for you Apple folks). It's a little bare-bones, but it works pretty well overall. I've played a few games on it and absolutely love playing a move or two between meetings or when I need a quick break from work. I've found that I enjoy the experience much more this way.

What do y'all think about asynchronous play? Do you think it's a good way to stay in practice, when combined with occasionally playing games with a physical board and stones? Or am I building up bad habits by not playing with a time limit? What have been your experiences with asynchronous play?

I happen to think it's a fun one too -- it's game one of the *jubango* (ten-game match) that I am playing against my friend/*sempai*.  I happened to win this one despite starting at a disadvantage (could that be why I'm sharing it?  haha), but it was a very close game through the middlegame that we both put everything we had into -- so I promise you it'll have you on the edge of your seat.  :)  I am white in this game.

[http://eidogo.com/#30KzF4ZJ:0,0](http://eidogo.com/#30KzF4ZJ:0,0)

Some background on the *jubango*:  We have only played this one game so far, the second game is scheduled for later this month, with all games to be completed by year's end.  The jubango format is very modern and somewhat customized.  Here are the rules for the match:

* All games played using AGA ruleset;
* No *komi* (compensation points);
* Four hours of main time and ten periods of one-minute *byo-yomi* per player;
* Players begin alternatingly taking black and white, determining who takes black first for the series via *nigiri*;
* When one player drops to four losses below the other, that player is beaten down to the next handicap level;
* Handicap levels are:
  * (1) Alternating black and white,
  * (2) Black for all games,
  * (3) Two-stone handicap for all games.

As you can see the rules allow for quite a lot of time -- and actually this game was played over 4 sessions totalling about 10 hours!  Also:  it is traditional for *jubango* games to be played with no *komi*, not even a half-point; this gives the match format an alternating advantage to either player, making for an interesting dynamic -- you could compare it to serving, in tennis.

My opponent won the *nigiri*, so he took black for the first game, and I started with a slight disadvantage, which was made worse after an important opening mistake.  After that, I managed to hang tough and punish a few of his mistakes in the middlegame, bringing the game back to roughly even, and in the early endgame I pulled ahead by enough to force a desperate invasion and resignation.  The lesson for the game is:  Go is an endurance game, whoever makes the fewest mistakes over the course of the whole game wins, so never give up as long as the possibility of your opponent making mistakes remains -- there is still an opportunity to punish and make a comeback! ;)

In order to try and get better, I've started pitting myself against a computer on my smart go app and arranging artificial constraints on my playstyle just to see how it goes.  I tried to tie these constraints to things I thought might be important to close play - including as someone mentioned on this sub, playing more contact plays.  Here were some of the constraints I've used:

- Play only contact moves.

- Play only adjacent to opponents liberties

- Play only adjacent to your own liberties

- Alternate playing adjacent to your liberties and your opponents

Obviously there are many more possible constraints, but these are what I've used so far.  It's humorous that playing in this highly scripted and inflexible way usualy earns me better results than my own standard playing on the 9x9 board.  Now, obviously, I don't want my playstyle to be too rigid, but I feel as though I'm coming to understand how, for instance, those ancient Houses of Go used to have ""secret moves"" - certain beneficial shapes have made themselves known to me, and when I start to make those shapes a priority, my chances of victory increase.  It's especially funny because I already knew about ""good shape"" and had seen organic development from the more basic ones into the more complicated ones, but now I'm starting to see them in terms of fighting and how you can use them to entangle yourself to the degree you desire.  

Has anyone had these experiences as well, or am I totally off-base?

so far, the board is a stacked array of ""Points"", which will have a pointer to a Stone (belonging to a Formation, belonging to a Player). if a point is occupied, the color is obvious, but otherwise, what is a good way to determine the color of a Point?

Next year's 5-5 (5th May) (go-go in Japanese :D ) we play a 24 (or 12) hour Go-thon in our timezones (we start at whatever time we like during 5th May if 12 hours, we start at 0:00 in our timezone if 24 hours).

2. **So?** If everyone is on the same ground, we can pick a Go-thon winner as the people with the best % of wins (if there are draws we can work something out, like Hahn, rating deviation or something like that)

3. **Why so early?** I just thought about checking the calendar today, and 5-5 is Saturday.

However the Kingkiller Chronicles series by Patrick Rothfuss is the best fantasy I read in a long time. The first part ""The Name of the Wind"" was awesome and the second part just came out a little more than a week ago.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man's_Fear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man's_Fear)

I am about halfway through it and the main character is visiting the court of a foreign king. There he learns to play the game of tak from a somewhat mysterious nobleman. That game might very well be go or the author was inspired by go.

The rules are not explicitly mentioned but through anything I have learned it could hardly be anything else:

* The rules are very simple to learn
* Pretty soon they don't carry the playing equipment back and forth because the board seems to be big ;)
* They play with stones not any kind of special pieces
* They talk about sequences of moves in a corner and the teacher has a name for this sequence (not an actual name for a joseki or tesuji).
* After a while Kvothe thinks he has it all figured out, the teacher still thrashes him and tells him he has merely learned the basics, now he could start to begin to enjoy the subtleties.
* The teacher says it is not about winning. Quote from the book: ""The point is to play a beautiful game. Why would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?""

I might add more as I read on... anyhow I think the author captured the spirit of the game quite beautifully. Is he an AGA member or known go player? Anyone else read this?

Here are the rules for those who missed the first game post:

* All games played using AGA ruleset;
* White starts with 1 point of *komi* (compensation points);
    * This was 0 points for game 1, but a compelling argument was made that 1 point is more natural/correct for AGA rules, so we changed this for the rest of the series.
* Four hours of main time and ten periods of one-minute *byo-yomi* per player;
* Players begin alternatingly taking black and white, determining who takes black first for the series via *nigiri*;
* When one player drops to four losses below the other, that player is beaten down to the next handicap level;
* Handicap levels are:

    * (1) Alternating black and white,
    * (2) Black for all games,
    * (3) Two-stone handicap for all games.

I won the first game, but I lost both of these games.  Don't worry -- I'm not asking for a review, actually we reviewed both games in depth already.

He began going to crafting and hobby shops, and researching traditional Go boards. Unfortunately, they were much too expensive to buy, and too difficult for him to make himself. One day, however, while in one shop, the owner gave him the name of a master woodworker, Larry Schulgen, who lived nearby. My dad went to see him, and Larry loved the idea of making a traditional board game table. He had my dad pick out the tree to use, and Larry cut it down himself. A pecan tree was used for the table and the legs. He carved out the 19 x 19 grid and polished the surfaces. From there the board had to dry for a long time. All of this was done about four months before Christmas. Even by Christmas day it was only partially dried, but Larry let my dad take it home for a week to test it out. Unfortunately, some extreme temperature and pressure changes over the week caused the board to start cracking down the middle, so we took it back to Larry as soon as we could. We were relieved when he told us that it was nothing to worry about, but that he would need to coat it and dry it some more to finish the job.

[This is Larry (right) and I (left)](http://i.imgur.com/aYkV9xL.jpg) at his workshop with the table. He was incredibly nice and showed us all around his workshop.

&gt; Couldn't find a way to delete any trees in eidogo, let me know if you have.

It took me a long time to figure out how to delete variations in Eidogo and I'm guessing the solution may not be well known.

Actually there is no ""button"" to delete a sub-tree.  However Eidogo will prompt you to do so if you remove all ""properties"" from a position.

In practical terms this means:

1. ""Edit Comment"" and delete all text 
2. use ""Clear Marker"" to remove Letter and Number marks
3. remove the actual stone (using ""Black Stone"" or ""White Stone"")
4. click OK on the ""Delete Position"" dialog box
5. click ""Save to Server""

Step 5 is important because the game tree display doesn't auto-refresh.

Which says in passing: ""It is odd that Oe could come up with such fabrication, as he was part of a family who were hereditary scholars of Chinese in the Japanese court. Still, the story is important because it shows that the rules then in force were territory rules (i.e. prisoners have to be retained), confirming Chinese records that these were the rules used in China at that time.""

He cuts immediately when he has a ladder.  I've been trying to play on a more global scale during the opening, but it's really hard because he goads me into fights that consume an entire corner.  Since these fights involve lots of cuts we both have weak groups, and so the winner of this corner fight generally has a huge advantage in the rest of the game.  How do you guys deal with really aggressive plays in the beginning?

On a somewhat related note, I've been studying a little joseki recently, and I asked my friend (who doesn't study any) how he would respond to the following sequence as black (moves 1-4):  http://eidogo.com/#ZvjeBmO  Of course, being the kind of player he is, he said he would cut at 5, making things really complicated.  How would you guys deal with a move like this?

It's been great. I have a few friends I play with and we're still in the process of setting up a club.

The problem lies in that we aren't very good so that when we have a question about why joseki is the way it is, or when we are reviewing our games, we don't have much insight into the strongest moves or anything that isn't intuitive. If we only had a stronger player around to ask why move x was played instead of move y, then I feel we would all learn much faster.

What have you done if you were in a similar situation? It seems that baduk isn't popular where I am (I'm in the south of the US).

I have about an hour before my wife and I settle in for some television and then bed. I begin playing a game of go. I play badly and (even though I capture one of my opponent's groups), I lose. I am angry. Now I'm in a bad mood for the remainder of the evening. 

Worse: the next time I think about playing, it occurs to me that if I play and lose, I will again turn my evening sour. Therefore I'm less likely to play, and if I do, I'm terribly concerned that my entire emotional state for several hours will depend on the game.

Obviously there are issues here about my (in)ability to let go of anger, zen detachment, etc etc. I need to learn to just let it go and not dwell so much on my failures. But I'm sure I'm not the only one who struggles with the frustration of losing/playing poorly.

And I somehow arranged all people inscribed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/mi6nm/reddit_teaching_ladder_take_two_logistics/)

First, I have a problem with too few low-kyu/dan level players... So people around 4k and up have to take two students or make classes for two. I have arranged people by timezones, you can switch if you like! The tentative structure is:

GMT -5 and close:

* MoodyBlues 1d
* -&gt; PirateBushy 8k
* -&gt; OmnipotentEntity 8k
* ---&gt; WhatHole 12k

* SolarBear 4k
* -&gt; Orlandon 9k
* ---&gt; prichards 15k
* ------&gt; Aurorae 25k
* -&gt; Chevalierfewmet 8k 
* ---&gt; NomadFarmer 12k

GMT or around

* b3n 3k
* -&gt; RBerenguel 7k
* ---&gt; uuBI66ERuu 25k
* -&gt; Excalibor 7k

Just to make it clear, this means SB teaches Or and Ch, in turn Or teaches Pr who teaches Au and Ch teaches NF (this is the second tier in GMT-5).

If someone has changed a lot in their rank and this does not fit, please let me know. Also I think that MoodyBlues and SolarBear can play among them, also b3n if he can arrange with them.

I'll be contacting the ""heads"" soon, in turn they'll need to contact their disciples and so on (so except for the fact that I'm organising this, I should contact uBI66ERu to arrange details with him/her).

If any low-kyu or dan wants to join, he will be more than welcome!

We can still us dropbox as a place to store our games so you don't clog up your comp with sgf files, it's up to you! I'll be using it ;-)

Original post below:

If you want to have access to the games and have the ability to drop them in a shared dropbox file please email rbaduk@gmail.com.

If you don't have dropbox, email me anyway and I'll send you an invite. This is good as it will give rbaduk more online storage space.

Once you get your invite you should be able to access a Shusaku kifu I put there (just to make sure everything is running ok). The KGS game client will be able to open that for you :-)


If you are not interested in the dropbox scheme it doesn't effect your eligibility to play in tournaments, it just means that you won't be able to access the games. No problemo!


If anybody knows of a better online storage that doesn't require emails to be exchanged I'm all ears. With dropbox however we can get up to 8Gigs of free storage space. Just let me know in the thread below!

Just a warning, I’m VERY new and haven’t played much, just read up on basic go stuff ect.

When you mark dead stones, let’s say a cluster of 2 stones is marked as dead, that will give the other player 4 extra points (2 territory+2captured), but if he were to capture them like normal would he not have gotten less territory? 
He would capture the 2 stones but he would lose 1 territory from where he placed the last stone in the surround? This is only a problem with Japanese scoring rules?

Also, about invading, it looks to me that players don’t invade if they can see they can’t avoid getting captured at some point, but will it never be worth it, just to make the other player place a lot of stones in his own territory to capture you? Will he always come out ahead even if he captures a few stones? if he needs 6 stones to capture my 2 stones would I not get ahead? If it was in his territory
Sure I lose 2 stones but he loses 6 territories? I guess this only matter with Japanese rules like the other case.

I was tolled Japanese scoring rules and Chinese scoring rules would always get the same game result, I just don’t get that if the 2 situations I mentioned earlier is true

I hope you can help me answer these questions.
