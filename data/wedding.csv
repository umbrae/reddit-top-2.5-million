Here is my advice.,148,21,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1g0ep2/married_a_few_weeks_ago_here_is_my_advice/,"After considering my experience, this is my advice to all engaged women: you do not need bridal shows, TV shows, magazines, etc. to have a wedding. All those do is prompt you to spend money on needless things and lead you to feel that you should be living up to specific social expectations. All you need is your friends, family, food, and wine all in the same place (wine is key though, do NOT deprive anyone of wine) and you will have a beautiful day. It rained on my wedding day, I didn't decorate for the ceremony AT ALL, I didn't care if there were flowers in my hair or not, my bridesmaids were beautiful no matter what they did with their hair and makeup, I drank red wine (oh no she didn't!), we didn't have a DJ (just an iPod and some funkay friends!), and I danced to the point where I was dripping sweat on anyone within a few inches of me (seriously, I'm a sweater)... And it was AWESOME. Your wedding is as perfect as your attitude (and the feeling your event gives your friends and family), not your decorations and hair. Love your celebration and don't dwell on the little things, despite the tiny details Pinterest says you need to have! The link below is a photo that captured our day in one shot!
http://imgur.com/w58LsQZ

Edit: another piece of easy advice - choose scenery over decorations. This photo is why I had no decorations: http://imgur.com/sQHXw0g

Edit: Thank you for posting all of your stories and advice. I am noticing a trend among your comments, that whoever has the money in the wedding has the power. I wish I could offer more advice in this area. For us: Our parents offered to pay for part of the wedding, and so we asked for the contributions to go toward specific parts of the wedding, such as the venue. They were kind enough to consent, then left it up to us (within reasonable prices!). My dad told me later how much he appreciated the research I did for [the part they paid for], and he felt like I had done a great job. 
TIP: I saved us over $10,000 by having my wedding in early May rather than late May through early September (peak season). If you can set aside your fear of a little rain, this is a great way to go!",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1370907059.0,,,True,t3_1g0ep2,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1g0ep2/married_a_few_weeks_ago_here_is_my_advice/,

I'll probably be answering questions from around 8:30am to noon, Central Time, tomorrow morning (4/4/13). Until then, feel free to get the ball rolling so that I can jump right in once I sit down with my laptop in the morning!

I owned a bridal shop for about 10 years in the American south.

My store was mostly special order, and priced from around $800 to $5,000. We did tuxes too, and worked with almost every type of vendor you can imagine. 

Ask away! I'll see you in the morning!

Edit #1: Answered a few tonight, I'll be back tomorrow morning as originally planned. Thanks!

Edit #2: Running late at the hospital...  Will jump back in ASAP. 

Edit #3: Okay, good to go... At the hospital for a family member having surgery, so I'm answering during the waiting times.  Thanks for your patience!

I'm currently married--haven't been for altogether too long, but married nonetheless. The guy? I fell in love with almost immediately 5 years ago. We were crazy about each other but, at the time, too worried about ruining a tight friendship we had forged. When neither of us spoke up, we ended up with other people, were mutually crushed, and we lost contact for a couple of years. 

But, hope was far from lost. When I decided to call him on a whim, we soon realized that we had never fallen out of love. So, he moved across the country to be with me as I finished some school, I moved down the coast as he went on to his next phase of training, and here we are, years later: with two dogs, in a sunny little apartment, in the most phenomenal relationship I've ever even heard about. 

But, there's been no proposal. There's been no wedding ceremony. And yet, the act of being married to him has made me feel even more anchored, invested, and like I have an official teammate to weather life with; it's a joyous sensation.

Our marriage came about on the heels of oppressive medical bill debt. He had surgery to repair a ruptured ACL, and his ""insurance"" that is offered through the medical school is dismal. Thousands of dollars out of his pocket, and I said, ""Hey, we know this is it. Why don't we go to the courthouse and get married? I will throw you under my health insurance, and I'll have the peace of mind that you're covered."" 

...and so we did. 

I think we both underestimated how much it would mean to us. It was supposed to be in effort to assist in health matters (knowing full well that we will be getting married anyway in a couple of years when medical school timing for both of us is appropriate), but we dressed up anyway. And when I heard him echo the county clerk's words...it was all I could do not to cry. 

The point being: when two people love each other to a degree that they vow to spend the rest of their mortal lives as one, the wedding and the proposal end up not meaning a thing. So, to all of you who are stressed about plans, and money, and location.... take a deep breath. Because, from the other side of all of that, I can tell you that it's amazing. 

Be well, r/wedding

I'm the girlfriend of one of the bride's sword men (marine corps tradition for a sword ceremony involved in a wedding) and flew out with him to North Carolina from San Diego as his plus one. I had met the bride only one time before. 

I volunteered to help with any last minute wedding stuff she needed done having no idea how much was left for last minute. She saw on pintrist (damn pintrist!) a stick arch she loved and wanted and I commented how simple it would be to construct (not two day simple...); so that became my mission. 

We hunted for sticks in the woods near by (she specifically stated how she would NOT allow anyone to cut any sticks off of living trees in an effort to be green) and I went on probably 6 trips to find ""good"" sticks...later on in the construction (as seen in the photos) she decided she wanted the arch wider because she wanted to stand UNDER it for her vows, and since her dress was big, she needed a wider arch...

So after 48 hours of pretty much non stop work, wiring that made my hands bleed, stick pokes, constant risk of collapse, and sleepless nights...here is the final product! What do you guys think? 

For any of you wanting the same thing...this CAN be done in 2 days, but it's soooooo hard to accomplish on short notice...please please please plan ahead to have this constructed yourself...also, it weighs a TON (I'm a small 5'5"" female). I'd be happy to answer any questions you guys have in the comments if you want any more insight.

Finally done, and only out in the mail two weeks later than I had wanted.  @.@
These required an obscene amount of careful measuring and cutting.  I like how they turned out, but I would have done a few things differently if I had to do them again.

Total cost of paper, gift bags, envelopes, and printing was $41.10 for 43 invitations, with 18 extra gift bags since they came in packs of 20, and almost as many extra envelopes (with a couple sacrificed to printing error).  I didn't have to buy the linen paper, glue, cutting materials, or sealing stamp.  Permanent double-sided tape only came in packs of two, so that was $7.47.  I bought WAY more sealing wax than we needed, since we're the type of people who might use it again later.  So I got 8 oz for $22.25, though getting 2 oz for $5.75 was also an option, and would have been plenty.  For the postcards I only pre-stamped 11 of them that were going to older relatives, since RSVPing online is also an option.  So the total cost for me including postage, wax, and mistakes was $115.51.

What I would do differently:
None of this notches, slits, and tabs nonsense.  I would print the invitation and menu sheets on the same paper, fold them like a book, stick them to the blue paper with *permanent* double-sided tape.  Also stick the clear stuff to the front with the tape.  The permanent tape is clear, unlike the removable, and if I got the 1/2"" tape instead of the 3/4"", and cut it with scissors, you'd barely even notice it.  Then, I might even hit those suckers with a binding stapler.  It'd depend on how well the tape was working.  Also, I'd make damn sure the RSVP cards fit.  I would get our custom seal made properly in the first place while we had time, and I would probably have bought less wax.  I know I said we'll use it, but let's be realistic.  We won't use *that* much, and we will probably still have all this wax for many years to come.  I also could have saved a lot of time if I hadn't done the custom art for it, but that's not something I would change.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_1backw,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1backw/my_diy_invitations_are_complete/,

I am your newest moderator. As someone who has moderated other subreddits in the past and been reading/lurking on this subreddit for about a year now, I've noticed that the subreddit has been getting a little off-track in some respects. 

In order to address this, I am immediately implementing the following rules:

1. /r/wedding posts should be kept to things wedding-related. Questions, informational posts, wedding pictures/highlights, and other related and substantive posts are all welcome.

2. Self-promoting businesses or linking to sites that are clearly meant to drive up search results for pages is banned IMMEDIATELY. This subreddit will improve in quality if it's kept free of posts that clearly violate this rule. While this may turn off some- and I apologize if you are affected- this needs to be done to maintain a subreddit that doesn't feel like it's a big advertisement. While this doesn't seem to be a problem so much now, I was seeing a lot of this about 6 months back, and this isn't what this subreddit should be for.

3. Recently engaged? There's now a subreddit for that! Head on over to /r/JustEngaged to post pictures of your bling. Anyone posting ring pictures will be messaged and asked to post their photo in the appropriate subreddit, and the post will be removed.

More changes will be coming as I assess how best to go forward from here.

I look forward to moderating this community- please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/comments! 

Edit: I'm also reaching out to the community and other moderators for suggestions for related subreddits, which I will put in the sidebar this week. Any suggestions you have (/r/JustEngaged and /r/WeddingPlanning are two I can think of off the top of my head) would be greatly appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1358269976.0,,,True,t3_16kzpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/16kzpa/changes_coming_to_rwedding/,moderator

At the first fitting, the seamstress agreed that the front of my dress needed to be taken in one inch, and the back of my dress needed to be let out about a half inch. So we left my dress with them and I was super excited to get it back on Friday. 

So I go in on Friday, and I put my dress on, and it doesn't zip. I haven't gained any weight, and it zipped just fine when I bought it. The seamstress looks at it and says ""we have nothing left to let out"", and then proceeded to rip open the seam and show me, that there was literally nothing left to let out. 

It appears that they had taken the dress in by mistake and then trimmed off all the extra fabric. On top of this, my dress was filthy. There were huge white marks all over the dress. When this was pointed out the manager, she was furious. They spot cleaned the dress and tried to get us to take it home, which my mom and I refused. They said they would deep clean it and we could get it on Monday. My grandma and mom were supposed to go in Monday to pick up the dress (I had to go back to school) and I didn't hear anything about how it went, so I assumed they didn't go.

I texted my mom this afternoon and asked her if she could pick up my dress, because I had received a phone call stating that my dress was ""spotless"" on Tuesday.

She immediately called me and said that it was physically impossible for my dress to be spotless. She had seen it on Monday and the alterations manager stated that there was nothing that could be done and the dress was ruined. ***RUINED.*** 

The spots that were on the dress had been cleaned with something that made them appear to be grease spots, and there were more on the dress than the few spots that I saw at alterations. 

I have no idea how to approach this. DB claims that they are trying to find another identical dress, but it was a clearance dress and Galina doesn't make it anymore. I am at a loss. I am worried that I don't have time to find/order/and get fitted for another dress. (My wedding is May 25).

Any advice?

Real wedding: Got married in Glacier NP on the shore of Lake McDonald, just us and the officiant, early morning. It was perfect. Spent the rest of the day hiking, went to see some live music that night, etc.

Family wedding: Got married on my husband's family's property. We had the ceremony in a little tree grove and the reception in the garage/concrete pad outside the garage. After the reception a live band from our college played and we had a campout with all our friends.

The biggest ticket items were:
My dress... $167
Tents... $171 for two 15x15 tents (cost break for us setting them up ourselves)
His suit... $245 (bought a suit he still uses instead of renting)
Photographer... $450 (didn't have her stay the whole day, still got a little over 900 pics)

1359392114.0,65,self.wedding,17fpdv,Rehearsal Dinner Tips from recently married restaurant owner,73,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/17fpdv/rehearsal_dinner_tips_from_recently_married/,"Rehearsal dinners can be tons of fun, a separate special event that has its own vibe separate from the wedding ceremony. Rehearsal dinners can also be a nightmare of bad service, bad food, and disappointment. Good planning is key to having fun. I married this past August, and as a restaurant owner, this experience really opened my eyes to a whole new aspect of dining, and some things that people may not consider. Since most people don't really have too much experience planning an event like this, I figured it may be useful to break some stuff down with the goal of helping others have a great time. Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here goes!

The most important thing to do is to keep a sharp focus on the big picture. This is a once in a lifetime event that you want to be memorable. You're likely going to pay more than you want to, but hopefully by following these steps you can wind up paying a fair price for a special night. Staying within your budget is the goal, but don't get to the point where $50 is all that's keeping you from what you want. Now is a great time to begin planning this, especially if you have a spring wedding. 

* The first step is to figure out your total budget(including gratuity), and then divide that by the number of guests you plan to invite, to get the price you can pay per guest. Once you have your budget, you can look at restaurants with their menu prices as a starting point. It's far better to feed everyone well at a nicer casual place than to skimp at a fine dining establishment. The goal is for people to eat and be merry in a celebratory mood, not to impress people by feeding them poorly at a fine dining establishment. 

* go to potential restaurants that you would like to use and have a meal there, preferably on a busy night at a busy time. It might be nice to include parents if they are the ones footing the bill. Observe the service, food, attention to detail, atmosphere, everything. the people working there may well be the people there the night of your event, and the way they are acting when you are there for dinner is a great preview. If you get especially great service from someone, you can request that they are there. 

* after you have narrowed it down, call the restaurants before 11, or between 2-5 and mention that you'd like to have your rehearsal dinner there. Ask to set up a meeting. You will likely be meeting with the chef or general manager of the restaurant. At the meeting, be aware of what you can spend per person but do not reveal it. The chef should be able to help you plan a menu, and advise you of the options for alcohol. Think about dishes you have had at that restaurant, or favorite dishes from elsewhere. If the chef offers prices, then you can see if they have any wiggle room at all. Some smaller places may want a deposit the week of the event. This is to help them pay for the food they are ordering for you. 

* once you have your spot and menu, schedule a meeting with the person in charge of service. give them the outline of what you want to happen, and when. This makes it a lot easier on the staff, who in turn can offer you the exact service you want. If you want speeches after appetizers and before soup, for example, this is a very good thing for them to know. set the order in which things happen, not the exact time unless you only have the place for a short time. Speeches immediately after entrees are finished is no problem, but speeches at 7:45 may not work out. Events always run late, better to go into it knowing this rather than stressing that everything is running late.

* figure out your alcohol policy! there are lots of options. I like the idea of setting a budget, and when that is exhausted the restaurant begins charging individual guests for their drinks, and lets them know this when they order their first paid drink. You can allow full open bar all night. This can get pricey, but some people like this approach. You can do full bar, but limit it to all beer and wine and then lower quality liquor. You can do unlimited beer and wine, and a cash bar for liquor. You can do certain beer and wine and no liquor. You can do all of this for a certain time, say during dinner and until you decide to switch to cash bar. talk with the chef, they will help you. 

* putting everyone at one gigantic table is not always the best idea. Tables of 4-8, with a seating chart can be great. this does several things. For one, sitting at a huge table sucks. conversation can be hard and awkward. You also have to remember that there may be people there who have decades of bad blood between them. Add alcohol and things could be bad. We put ourselves, our parents, and siblings at one table, and then had the rest of our guests at tables of 4. Making the seating chart was fun, and it led to people making friends that they may not have made otherwise. We kept husbands and wives together and mixed couples. From a kitchen standpoint, splitting people up can make the evening run smoother. If you are going with an independent restaurant, serving a huge party at one table may just not be possible. If people are split up they can order in waves, avoiding the awkward situation of staring at your food for 20 minutes as plates trickle out of the kitchen.

*  Some places may want to charge you a venue rental fee, others may simply want you to match their projected sales for the night. This is a case by case call of the restaurant. Feel free to ask why they are charging it. If you are going to a larger place and have a party that is not going to take over the entire restaurant for the entire night, then you should not need to pay anything other than the gratuity they add on. If you are going to a place that is just big enough for your entire group, then this may be more reasonable. We went to a place that was just big enough, and they simply wanted us to match their sales for the night. this was awesome, as we could really take the time we wanted to take and not have to worry about other people's screaming kids or anything. 

* Expect a 20% gratuity. if you are making a ton of special requests from the staff, the restaurant may request a slightly higher fee. Feel free to question this, but do the math on what it actually costs you. If you spend $1,000 and they want 25%, the extra 5% is only $50. If they are unwilling to waver on this, is it worth it to lose the spot you want over $50, especially if the chef has been very flexible on food and alcohol pricing?

* ask your wedding photographer what they would charge to shoot this event. If you have a friend who takes pictures ask them. ask your florist about flowers. ask your cake maker about a groom's cake, if you want.

* if you have the place to yourself for the night, consider making an evening out of it. if they have a spacious bar, think about having drinks an hour before dinner begins.

* at the end of the night, take a minute to really look at the bill. make sure there aren't any weird fees, and that the gratuity adds up. you can do a quick entree count if you want. This is where the alcohol budget can come in handy. If you set a budget of $300, then you'll be pretty confidant that the restaurant did not add any drinks in. 

* Remember that while you may have rented out the entire restaurant, you are still a paying guest that must follow certain rules. Please no dancing on the bar, or going into the kitchen, or other stuff you would not normally do. The staff is there to accommodate your reasonable requests.

* don't get wasted. you don't want to be hungover on your wedding day.

Hope this helps you! If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask. ",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1359401924.0,,,True,t3_17fpdv,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/17fpdv/rehearsal_dinner_tips_from_recently_married/,

I married 2 weeks ago, everything was planned and organized and I was a bit nervous to marry my beloved wife. So in the morning my mother came to me to help me get dressed. My wife was at her parents home. I got ready and I wanted to be at the church 30 minutes earlier to greet our guests. As I got ready and got in the car of my mother I just heard a loud terrifying noise. My pants had ripped! Right at the butt crack, nearly 20-30 cm long. I was in shock! Prior to the wedding I thought about all things that could go wrong like bad weather, problems with the wedding cake, problems with the DJ, problems with the food, but NEVER EVER I had thought about problems with my pants! My suit was tailored and I loved it. I felt great in it and it was quite expencive so it never came to my mind that I could get a problem with it.

Well, I don't have many suits and so we had to fix this one ASAP! My mother jumped out of the car and ran back inside and searched for needle and thread. I followed her and pulled my pants down while running inside (nearly tripped). Usually my mother is quite hectic so I thought she would flip out, but she was so calm, it was frightening! She always repeated ""they can't start without us, we have plenty of time! They can't start without us, we have plenty of time!"" like a mantra. So after about 15 minutes the pants were as good as new or even better than before. 

Finally we arrived just in time and the wedding was a blast. Best day of my life! In the end the story of the ripped pants was spread around the guests and everyone had a good laugh.

So the morale of the story: Not everything might be perfect at you wedding, but thats OK. You will cope with it! :)",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_1f96ad,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1f96ad/the_day_of_the_ripped_pants/,

But I know that it was wonderful because I had my best friend by my side. I want to encourage you to relax in knowing that you will be there shortly. No matter how behind on planning or over-budget or stressed you are, at the end of that day, you're going to start a beautiful new life with the one you love. And it's going to BE FABULOUS.

**The long** - there are exceptions, there always are. Your mom is taking you dress shopping, that's cool, ask her to not tell anyone else about your dress.
Your grandma hates roses. Don't let her know that's your flower.
Friend A hates Friend B. Don't make the guest list public.

There is always going to be someone who dislikes something, someone who puts their two cents in without being asked. This gets irritating then frustrating, and is unacceptable. You are planning **your** big day, and that is how it should be, unless you hire a wedding planner/trusted friend. Maybe your MOH points out you shouldn't have an open bar because you met most of your friends in AA - this one we can let fly. There are good opinions/suggestions, and then there are the ones that are just *opinions*. 

I came to this conclusion when my husband's mom picked out a very non-traditional headpiece for me (she showed me a bunch, and I actually really liked them), and I let me my mom see it. Well, she went behind my back and told everyone my headpiece looks like a piece of pizza (in fact, it looks like a miniature top hat with feathers sticking out, and in no way resembles food). Not only did they now know what it looked like, they were also not looking forward to it.

I, personally, love surprises. My grandma hounded my mom about the details she knew, then told my sister (who also likes surprises, and did not appreciate being told everything). If I could go back and change one thing, I would have kept every single thing that I could, a mystery. I do not like being told what to do, how I should wear my hair, what shoes I need on, how I should seat my guests etc etc, when it is my own wedding. My mom had two weddings - shouldn't she be tired of planning them by now? ;)

Certainly not everyone will be or is or was in this situation, maybe you aren't bothered by peoples' suggestions, but I found out that everything was peachy until these few people started butting in. It was absolutely stress-free until grandma ratted mom out for the headpiece thing, haha. Then it turned into a bad family sitcom.


That was my unasked-for two cents. ;) Despite the last few weeks being mildly unpleasant, my wedding was perfect, and I hope that everyone else's is, too!",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_s16mb,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/s16mb/my_best_piece_of_advice_for_those_planning_their/,

1345560623.0,57,self.wedding,ykysu,Friendly tip from your wedding videographer/photographer,66,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/ykysu/friendly_tip_from_your_wedding/,"I've been filming weddings for almost 2 years now (photographed a couple, but mostly video), and I just have one thing to share that would help us get the best footage/photos of your day:

Quite regularly, my shots get messed up by guests that have their own camera. They stand up, right in front of me &amp; my camera, for as long as it takes to get their picture/video (which is footage lost for me). Being that I'm the one getting paid to get this shot, I think it's safe to assume that the couple would rather I get the shot than this guest, right?

Being that social sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have gained exponential momentum in the past couple of years, there are even more people taking pictures/video at big events like weddings, which means even more people not being aware that I've been hired for this very thing. I've done a bunch of things to make it clear that I'm the pro: Said it every time I ask someone to get out of the way, dressed the part, carried around big bags for no reason...still, it's crazy how people don't really care :(

Only less than a handful of times I've filmed a wedding has the person announcing that the wedding is about to start (if such a person exists) has asked to silence all cell phones...***and to be aware of the photographer/videographer***. I've heard about some weddings where it is announced that the couple has asked that everyone put their cameras away altogether. Having just gotten married myself almost 4 months ago, I definitely enjoyed seeing pictures from my guests' point of view, so that wouldn't have been an option for me...but my point is, guests shouldn't be getting those pictures/video clips at the expense of the pros!

This tiny announcement has helped me get perfect footage. I wonder why this hasn't been announced more often?? All they have to say is ""please be aware of the professional photographers and videographers [over here and over there], they are working hard to give the couple perfect memories of their day."" And to be shamelessly honest, pointing us out before the wedding also helps us gain business/connections.

A little thing that also helps immensely is roping off the center aisle. You can do it any fancy way you want (I used tulle and flowers), but this keeps people from not only spilling over into the aisle and getting in the photographer/videographer's way, but ensuring a clear path for the wedding party to walk in/out. I can't tell you how many times a bride has had to duck left and right to make it down the aisle because so many people are in the aisle trying to get the perfect picture to post online later or keep for their personal album.

More often than not, a photographer will create albums, and a videographer will create a short version of your video, for your friends to see online (I post mine on a public Facebook page, and they are able to be shared with whomever). That way, guests don't really even need to take matters into their own hands in order to see pictures/video at all.

Hope this makes sense...it would help us out a ton!

TL;DR - Make an announcement right before your ceremony begins to tell guests to turn off their phones/electronics...and ALSO to be aware of the photographers/videographers so they don't get in the way trying to take their own pictures. Also, rope off the center aisle to ensure a clear path/no guests spilling into the middle.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1345577884.0,,,True,t3_ykysu,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/ykysu/friendly_tip_from_your_wedding/,

June in the deep South is extremely humid and hot! We wore long bridesmaid dresses which were beautiful, but also very hot. We started taking outdoor pics around 3:30 pm and went until the wedding started at 6:30. I had been up since 8 am and going hard (hair, makeup, errands, etc.) and didn't stop to hydrate because I didn't account for pics and the length of the ceremony. Unfortunately, I fainted during the middle of the ceremony. I have never fainted before in my life. It was super embarrassing and I felt AWFUL for distracting from the bride and groom even for a second. Luckily I recovered quickly and I walked out of the ceremony with my escort (my man).

 So please, even if you think you're a baller, DRINK WATER. Even if it isn't offered, seek it out. It will save you embarrassment and possible health hazards. Even if you're used to being in the heat, DRINK WATER. I have been a southern girl all of my life and I still wasn't okay.

Turns out a guy came into the reception, hung around before we exited and then took it. Unfortunately, he also did this at 3 other weddings. Sadly, the cops were able to positively ID him at our wedding but not charge him yet. As of now, we are out $2500 and the Inn where we held the wedding says it is our personal property so took no responsibility. It has really put a dark cloud over our wedding and we have had to deal with insurance, cops, media and the Inn over the past month.

I've met none of the extended family on his dad's side, they are all spread out in Quebec. So when his dad told him his cousin was getting married and that we should expect an invite in the mail, I thought, ""Great! This will be a great time to meet them.""

They talked again on the phone today, and apparently her wedding has an ""entry fee"" of 95$ that you have to pay to attend the reception. I asked who this applied to...he said all guests.

I was just taken aback. I am pretty liberal in the do-what-you-want for your wedding department, cash bars or whatever, but to charge admission to your wedding? I used some choice words but the jist of it was ""I'm not going to wedding that I have to pay to get in to.""

Boyfriend offered to pay, I told him it's not a matter of money issues, it's the principle of the damn thing. I would have gladly attended and given them a cash gift if that's what they were after, but to be expected to pay upfront to offset the cost of the wedding seems entirely ridiculous, greedy and stupid. If you can't afford the wedding you want, then get your parents to help or lower your expectations - or go to city hall, or something. Just because you're young and have limited funds does not mean your guests should pay for your wedding.

I'm refusing to go now and boyfriend hopes I'll change my mind. I'd prefer he not go at all and not support this stupid idea, but I know he hasn't seen his family there in a while and he would think it rude not to go. But now I fear I'm going to look like the cheap person who didn't want to attend a wedding for that reason (never mind that it's out of town so would have to pay for gas and hotel).

They aren't asking for any gifts, but I still don't think it makes this okay. What am I supposed to say to his dad, who I have a pretty good rapport with?

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend's cousin is charging an entry fee to her wedding, I'm refusing to go, boyfriend doesn't understand that this is not customary wedding behavior.

EDIT: After taking a few hours to get over my initial reaction, and reading some of the comments here, I decided to bite my tongue and agree to go to the wedding, so I can meet his dad's side of the family.

Need help!!,61,10,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/116xnw/how_do_people_think_this_is_appropriate_need_help/,"So there's this girl I worked with for about 7 or 8 months.  We didn't even work *together* - she worked the front desk, and I worked the gift shop (at a science museum).  She's very cool and I like her a lot, and we've hung out outside work a handful of times.  However, she doesn't seem to understand it's not appropriate to ask for an invitation to my wedding.  The first time she did, I told her (truthfully), that we were having a small, intimate wedding off the coast of Maine (we living in Tennessee), hoping she'd get the hint and it would deter her.  This morning I opened up facebook to find she had left [this little gem on my wall](http://imgur.com/qy7AJ).  What drives me crazy is how publicly she's asking, too.  I have no idea how I'm supposed to respond to that.  I can't say yes, because she's not on the guest list and we're already struggling to balance it with our close friends and family, but what the hell do I say that doesn't make me look like a complete ass?  I also don't want to privately say anything to her because I'm afraid it will make a huge deal out of the situation.  Anyone else ever deal with this?

They thought that if for some reason a couple had decided to have the legal marriage before they were able to have a wedding, then any wedding celebration after the marriage certificate was a huge sham, and many people were angry that they had gone to these fake weddings and wasted there time and money.  Now i found this incredibly judegmental and mean, a wedding is a celebration for friends and family to celebrate that you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, and the marriage certificate itsef is in fact just paperwork.  Especially when couples are in the military or when there is insurance involved it seems to make sense in many cases to wait till you have the time/money to put on the actual wedding.  Am i alone in this thought? If you were invited to a wedding, and then found out that the couple had been legally married previously would you feal cheated and lied to?  Maybe its  because I'm not religious that seeing the marriage certificate signed isn't a big deal to me.

1372875715.0,49,self.wedding,1hkyrg,I got married on 6/22- my top 5 pieces of wedding-day advice!,57,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1hkyrg/i_got_married_on_622_my_top_5_pieces_of/,"First off, being married is the most wonderful thing in the world, and I quite honestly could not be happier!! I don't really know anyone else who is getting married quite yet, but I have some advice for the day-of that I thought might be helpful to some here! My wedding was absolutely, 100% perfect, and I would never change a single thing. That is not to say everything went according to plan, because goodness it didn't! But it was perfect, and beautiful, and so much more than I could have hoped it would be. Below is the advice I have to maybe help yours feel the same way for you!

**1) BE FLEXIBLE.** I don't just mean this in a shallow, ""it's not what I wanted but FINE, just do it differently."" I mean honest-to-God flexibility. ""Oh, that has to be changed? Wow, looks great now!"" or ""The wholesale florist didn't get enough flowers so we have to run to Harris Teeter and get more? Ok!"" (By the way, turns out that Harris Teeter has *gorgeous* flowers!) The thing is, the only thing you'll change *whatsoever* by being inflexible or stressing is... yourself. And the attitudes of those around you as they take in *your* stress. The more relaxed and flexible *you* are, the more that rubs off on those around you, and the more relaxed the day will be.

**2) Take some time to be by yourself.** I had a 5:30 wedding, and an enormous crew of helpers to set up. Because of that, I had practically all morning to myself. As an introvert, it was the most precious gift to have that morning. Even if you're an extrovert or having a morning wedding, take a little time (maybe a 30 minute bath, just something slow and soothing) and be alone.

**3) Take 10 minutes with your new spouse.** The first thing my husband and I did (HUSBAND! *Dang* that's so cool to write!) after walking back down the aisle was go to the room where I got ready and sit by ourselves for 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes seriously flew by, but they were some of the best moments of the wedding. Trying to process that you're *married* now... it's big!! I think we just giggled and said ""You're my *husband*!!"" ""You're my *wife*!!"" the whole time, haha! I'm so grateful for that time with only me him. 

**4) Feel how you feel, and be ok with it.** I expected to be an enormous pile of nerves the day before and the day of. But I wasn't. I was so calm. I fell asleep immediately the night before. I actually woke up an hour and a half earlier than I wanted (my brain decided I was going to think about getting married for 1.5 extra hours, haha), but it wasn't nervousness. I had a twinge of butterflies when I was about to turn into the venue, as I thought ""when I leave here, I'll be married!"" But other than that, total peace. You may be so jittery you can't sit still for 3 days. You may cry a lot more than you think you will (shoot I cried buckets), or you may not cry at all. Those things are all *ok.* Take them in your stride.

**5) Focus on what matters.** Decorations are fun. Food is yummy. It's nice to have pretty pictures. But none of that is why you're there, or why anyone at all who comes to your wedding is there. They are all there for you and your soon-to-be spouse. Make your love the shining focus of the day.

1365098623.0,46,self.wedding,1bob9q,It's sad when this is your review on a bridal shop...,66,20,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1bob9q/its_sad_when_this_is_your_review_on_a_bridal_shop/,"I would probably just steer clear of this shop if I had to do it again. 

I was given rings to put on dresses I wanted to try, which I thought was a great way to handle it. But then the consultant walked around saying she couldn't find any of my rings and I had to walk her to each one anyway. So that seemed pointless.

Then I was told to wipe my hands with an antibacterial wipe, which again is fine .But then she made my mother do it, too, even though she wasn't touching any dresses...and didn't have a trash can for her to throw it away in so my mother had to ask. 

I fit mostly into 16s, and in some bridal I had to put on 18s. I marked a few 14s as ones I wanted to try. The consultant pointed out that I probably wouldn't  fit into them. I explained that I knew that they wouldn't close, but I could at least try them to see if I like the style. (at another store they put me in a freaking 10, just to see!) So she pulled them...but then each time the next dress was a 14, she'd point out again that it wasn't going to fit and even asked me if I just wanted to hold it up in front of me. No, no I do not - I want to put it ON. And, shocker, they went on and just didn't zip all the way. I was able to tell if I'd even like them. She did the same for the too big ones -- kept trying to get me not to try them on. Why? I can pull it together and see how it would fit. If its a dress that can be ordered, why not let me decide?

They also mentioned numerous times in my short visit how all their dresses are one of a kind. I'm not sure who believes that, but I know it's not true - I saw at least one dress that was the exact same dress at another store.

I also did not want to put on a strapless bra. They never fit me correctly without custom ordering and they're uncomfortable. Plus, I want to have a dress where I don't need the bra. Multiple times they consultant or another consultant kept telling me that the reason a dress looked odd in the boobs was because I didn't have the strapless bra on and if I did that would fix it. That wasn't the case at all and I got sick of having to repeat myself that I didn't want the strapless bra. 

Also, EVERY SINGLE dress I put on they raved about it. I get it - you want me to buy a dress. But some quite obviously did not flatter my body in some aspects and there was no reason for you to go on and on about them.  When my MOH and mother agreed that one dress did not flatter my bust in the least (and I agreed, too), the consultant said something like, ""I don't know what you mean. It's lovely and makes her look great"" and ""don't listen to them, hun, it's great"". No, it didn't look good. Not at all. And of course I'm going to listen to my 2 favorite and most trusted women - that's why I brought them.

The consultant wasted a lot of time -- shouldn't the point be to get me in and out of dresses quickly so I can try on a few? She actually fastened up the dresses I had just taken off and put them away before even letting me get into another. A better way to do this would be to help me in a dress, walk me to the mirrors, and let me/my mother discuss ....and put the other dresses away during that time, not leave me in the fitting room alone and undressed for long periods. 

Speaking of the mirrors, there is not one section of mirror that is large enough to really get a good view without a break in it. The mirrors are big sections put together, not one big mirror. That definitely doesn't help give a good idea of the dress. 

Also (and this happened elsewhere) I did not like the consultant telling me what I should or should not do. I do not want a train at all, but most dresses without them are way too casual. So I wanted to try on dresses I liked, even if they had a train and said I was just cut it off.  Multiple times at this store it was like ""No, you shouldn't do that"" or ""Oh you don't really want to do that, trust me"".  No, trust ME. I know me and I know my style - I do not want a train. I know this. Having someone who met me 20 minutes ago telling me what my style should be is annoying. Same goes for the veil - I don't want one, so quit telling me that I'll rethink that later and change my mind. 

Also, she kept pulling dresses way out of my budget and dresses with cuts that I'd told her look bad on me and I absolutely do not want.  Now, at another store a consultant pulled a few I never thought I'd like and I put them on and did like them. But at this store I specifically told her I wanted to stay away from a few styles and she kept pulling them. What a waste of time.

This was long, but I wish I'd read more on this shop before *I* went. So I hope this helps someone decide.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1365180223.0,,,True,t3_1bob9q,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1bob9q/its_sad_when_this_is_your_review_on_a_bridal_shop/,

Here are the details

**Asking her father for permission**

A month ago we traveled the 5 hours to spend the weekend at her parents house. I was really nervous about being able to get alone time with her dad (and hopefully mom too) to ask them for their blessing. Luckily for me they have been getting up early every saturday to go to the gym. So all I had to do was get up extra early and was able to talk to them both for a long time before my now fiancee woke up.

**The Ring**

I was really worried about the ring size being several sizes too big. I had the correct ring size ordered, but the arrival time was scheduled a few days after when I was planning on proposing. The sized ring ended up coming in 2 days before I proposed! So this ended up being a non-issue.

**The Proposal**

On the first date, we went to a fancy restaurant and ended up going to an impromptu movie since the date was going so well. On our second date we went on a walk at a local trail we had talked about on our first date. For the proposal I took her back to the same restaurant (which we hadn't been back too since then). I then took her to a movie afterward which I had planned, but hadn't mentioned to her. The next day I took her to the trail we had went to and proposed to her on a pretty bridge. She was shocked and wasn't expecting it at all, she said YES and then kept saying 'really? really?' cause she was so surprised.

The venue's insurance company is requiring them to refund all monies and resign a contract if we want to still have it there with tents. I personally thought their tents look tacky so we decided not to do that. One of the other venues in the area has offered to discount their rental fee $500 if we choose to book with them. We toured the new venue yesterday and were taken away with all the scenery and the grounds. http://www.lilybarn.com/ if you are interested. We are in the process of signing the contract for the new venue. (they had to write up a new contract for the weddings they are taking on from the other venue) I am so excited and relieved that we found a better venue so soon after the other venue burned.

1350581344.0,47,self.wedding,11p62x,My Mother Says They Won't Pay - We're 48 Hours Away - What are my options...,58,11,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/11p62x/my_mother_says_they_wont_pay_were_48_hours_away/,"Well this is certainly not how I planned to make my first post in /r/weddings but maybe I can get some advice.

Limited backstory is - I got engaged 2 years ago, have been with the same man for 6, we put off our wedding date twice because it was impractical due to some things in life that 'came up' (e.g. Not finishing college on time, unable to find work).

About 4 months ago, we set our final date. October 20th. Yay?

Over the course of 4 months - I kept all my receipts. I showed itemized budgets to my father. We did go over, I will recognize that, but my father just chuckled, shook his head, and wrote the check saying 'I knew we were going to spend over, don't worry about it.'

I cleared the Reception and Menu with my dad a month ago. I knew we were going to need to adjust down on the menu options, and after reviewing the ultimate cost, my dad agreed to my initial 'Hey we should make this cheaper' suggestions.

My mother called me this morning. I am 48 hours away from getting married and told me that they may be able to pay for the reception (approximately $5,700) but won't because it will limit her 'ability to move on' with her life, and told me that my wedding is only 'hurting her.'

Whatever. My mother's odd behavior aside, which yes, I am already in therapy for, how do I swing this? I believe it's too late to cancel anything, so is my current plan of maxing out all of our credit cards and then paying it off with returning all of our gifts legit?

This is, yes, quite possibly the most depressing thing in r/weddings in a while, but I need some advice from 'those that have gone before me'.

Thanks, kids.

Edit: Update Numero 1. 
I've spoken with my dad and he seems to be under the impression my mother has gone crazy. He assures me that they will be able to cover it, but I'm still skeptical. The problem is, I have offered to cover the bar tab with a credit card several times. It will take us quite some time to pay off, but I knew money would be a stressor right before the wedding. Essentially my dad wont accept any of my help, and my mother is threatening divorce if I don't pay for everything. At this time I am kind of stuck between two very angry people, neither of which will give me a budget to keep it under other than 'We wont pay for anything' or 'don't worry about it, we can cover it.' Neither of which are budgets. I have reduced the menu down to bare bones and also am considering drink tickets instead of an open bar. I don't think the overall cost will be lower if I paid in cash, and I am working with the venue to limit costs

I will talk to my fiance about how his parents would feel about paying for the reception instead of our Honeymoon like they had originally offered. I also like the idea of volunteering to pay my parents back for half of the reception cost, since this seems like a fair compromise. We already took out a loan (my fiance and I) to pay for our wedding rings, since this felt like a cost we should accrue, so I don't think the loan route will be feasible or any less expensive than a credit card.

I'll let ya'll know how it shakes out. But I think this is a good thread for anyone that gets stuck in my situation as well.

Edit/Update #2: Spoke with my father. We have gotten the catering budget into a reasonable alignment and we are setting a limit on the bar tab. Now I will address some assumptions folks have made.
1.) I never expected my parents to pay for this wedding. I planned 2 wedding dates, but had to cancel them earlier in my relationship. For one of these weddings, I planned elopement. For the other, I planned a courthouse wedding with a small reception.
2.) My family STRONGLY opposed elopement. And by strongly, I do mean, take any money drama from now and double it. So fine, I said, let's have the ceremony and reception on the property of my fiance's grandparents. Simple country wedding, using their barn as coverage. My mother threw an absolute fit because there weren't enough 'nice hotels' in that area for people to stay at, and told me everyone would 'try to drive home drunk and die, then it would all be my fault.'
3.) So fine, let's default back to the simple courthouse wedding and a small reception. My original guest list was under 100. When my parents got a hold of it, they insisted on adding 70-90 more people. They then told me that I HAD TO HAVE a ceremony or they wouldn't pay for any of it. I protested loudly and said, 'But I really don't think we can afford a ceremony and all these extra people' and they pushed for it because 'I only got married once.'

I am NOT a bride that dreamed about her marriage since childhood. In fact, I never thought I would find the right person to marry because I NEVER depend on other people. This is the first time in my life that I trusted my parents to follow through on something and my mother doesn't want to because it will 'hurt them.' And let me clarify what 'hurting them' means. It means that when they move into their BRAND NEW 6-bedroom house on 5 acres that they bought with CASH, she wont be able to remodel the kitchen in the first year.

Reddit- I love you guys, but for those of you that are accusing me of over-budgeting this wedding that I didn't even WANT to have, I agree with you. I did over budget. And I hate myself for it, because I trusted the people in my life to be there for me and help me when they were the ones guilting me into over budgeting and promising that they would pay. This wasn't a 'Tee hee here's the final bill dad' situation. This was a 'Here are several options, I've mapped out them in rank of increasing expense. Which would you like to help me with?' And they inevitably pointed to the most expensive option. When I tried to tell them 'Well, that's kind of expensive...' They would say shit like 'You only get married once' or 'Don't worry, we have you covered.'

Edit #3: Also the Open Bar was at my parent's initial suggestion because they didn't want to give people the impression they were being 'cheap'.

Edit #4: I feel like you should all see this thing full circle. It's the morning of, and we had a fantastic rehearsal dinner (as per my fiance's parents). Today is the big day, and we are entering it completely stress free. My mother admitted that she was completely blindsided - but this was due to my father's lack of communication regarding what he had planned for the wedding with me and was NOT a fault of my own. I apologized profusely for trusting my father (who's ego got caught up in making this a production and not a wedding) to communicate with her. We have both unanimously agreed that in future cases where money will be spent in large sums, that all three people should be looped in on the conversation, and it should never be assumed he will communicate anything. As someone mentioned - they obviously have some big issues in their marriage that they are working through, and we have all luckily come to the conclusion that my wedding can be a learning device to all move forward with our mutual lives. I have spoken with my mother and committed to the following things so the wedding will not be so stressful for her - My fiance and I will help her with my two younger siblings and all their weekend activities so they do not need to hire professional movers. We will also both offer our lifting services, and those of our friends, and all of our vehicles (we have trucks and large vans) to get their house moved out by November 1st. If they are unable to afford a portion of our wedding, or it puts them at a financial strain to do so, then we will be paying them in installments with no interest the balance of whatever amount is causing them fiscal strain. Finally, we had a discussion about any 'future assistance' in the form of a down payment, and it was determined that this would be the responsibility of my fiance and I, which is fine since we had always assumed this would be the case and are already saving. I'm sorry for some of you who don't think I'm doing this 'right' or that 'I shouldn't if I don't have money in the bank'. I'm also sorry for those of you who think I felt somehow 'entitled' to this massive wedding. Had you read through everything, you would probably be able to identify that I really didn't care about any of these details, but was unable to cancel 48 hours before the wedding on any of my contracts. It would not have saved me *any* money. 

Moral of the Story - There will always be drama right before your wedding. Somebody will always say you aren't 'doing it right' or 'shouldn't be doing it this way.' Even if they don't say it to your face, don't be surprised when you hear it said behind your back. The reality is, everyone makes this decision on their own time with their own spouse. And that decision is only theirs' to make. Always loop in *all* members of your family when discussing finances, and never assume that everything you discussed with one parent is being communicated back to the other. And finally - for the love of whatever you find holy and sacred- plan your own wedding, don't let other people plan it for you. If this had been planned by me and my fiance and *only* by us, it would have had half the guest list and cost a quarter as much.

Was asked to stand for one of the two of my best friends, we've known each other since the second grade, very excited. She asked everyone last September with the wedding to be set this coming August, so there was plenty of time to arrange and save up for everything. She isn't helping us bridesmaids with any costs, which I didn't mind that much. There was enough time to save up for everything even for the girls in school, and myself who has been in some shitty financial situations recently. So the dresses are bought, shoes are ordered, save the dates are out. I get a text tonight saying she is cancelling everything and getting married in Cancun in January. So now what was going to cost me about $600 is going to be around $3000. I have applied to some crazy pipe dream schools for the fall where I would be an international student. The tuition is crazy, but it would be a life changing opportunity for me. I don't know if I can afford this vacation! She's giving us less than a year notice and quite frankly I would rather spend that kind of money on tuition. I'm just working a bar right now, $3000 takes a long time and a lot of effort to save up. Am I being a dick for telling her I don't know if I can go? She just keeps saying ""you have until January, it's not that big of a deal"". But her husband makes $100K a year, so it's not exactly a problem for them. I don't know what to do, but beer and popcorn seem to be the only answer I can come up with at the moment.

TLDR: Bride changed wedding from local to Mexico with everything half planned. Poor student bridesmaid can't afford that shit.

UPDATE #2: Apparently enough people have said they can't go now that they've cancelled that plan to go to Mexico and still do it at home. They're cutting the reception but going a vacation now instead to ""save money"", I don't know how that works.

Either way, thank you for your advice everyone! This has been a hell of a 24 hours. Even though it's not happening anymore myself and the other best friend received quite an earful regardless.

We had a contract that stated that he would take our engagement, bridal and wedding photos. The photographer did not do engagement photos and instead we agreed on an after the wedding shoot. That still has not been done because he will not answer our calls/emails.

At the bridal portraits, he said there would be 3 photographers from his business at the wedding. He was the only one to show up and missed very important photos because of this. Not sure if that matters because it was not in the contract that we would have 3 photographers.

We're a laid back couple, so we tried to not be too demanding with our vendors. We welcomed their opinions, and gave them lots of help where we could. In return, we had some great experiences working with people. 

Several vendors gave us breaks on cost and payment due dates because we made it a joy for them to work with us. We also got recommendations that saved us lots of money too; things where the vendor could have milked us for more money by steering us in a different direction, but didn't because we were friendly and helpful with them.

So thank your vendors often. Tell them how happy you are when they do good. If they mess something up, be patient, calm and descriptive about how to fix it. Apologize profusely for bothering them with a million emails and after-hours calls. Tell them how good you'll be rating them on Yelp. Send them Christmas cards. Don't act entitled or uppity or psycho. Make their job and lives easier, and they'll return the favor.

There are a couple common mistakes that lead to headaches for you and us. 

-First of all, don't bother with those disposable cameras on every table at the reception if it is indoors. Most of the cameras are recycled with a new cardboard wedding theme sleeve put over it. The batteries are dead or dying, and the film is some generic brand produced in 1995. Even if you sprang for a better quality camera, most receptions are indoors, and nine times out of ten, the camera is handled by the elderly and young kids, who don't know how to keep their fingers out of the view finder, much less how to turn the flash on. Many people don't understand that the lens doesn't see the same as a human eye. If you really must do this, expect to pay at least $100 to get them all processed and developed with a couple of good pictures to show for it among many many pictures of thumbs, balloons, silverware, centerpieces, all of your loved ones looking terrible from the flash when it is used, and a million ultra grainy first dance pictures from across a dark room. Even if your reception is outdoors on a sunny day, I would strongly recommend only getting the pictures processed onto a CD first. That way you can choose which pictures you want, and getting prints from digital is often cheaper than prints from film, anyway.

-Crop your pictures before sending your professional photos off to us to be reprinted if you are changing sizes! This is because your photographer edits his/her photos to fit a specific size. You can't just turn a picture formatted to fit an 8x10 into a 4x6 or 5x7 without cutting out part of it, any more than you can turn a square into a rectangle without cutting off part of it. For more information, google aspect ratio. I can't tell you how many times a couple has come in demanding their pictures be re-printed because their beloved's head got cut off. It may sound harsh, but the reason you are printing your photos here is to save money. The reason your photographer charges so much is because of his/her education in photos, and the individual attention. We simply don't have the time/resources to sift through your 500 pictures and individually crop each one.

-Call immediately after placing the order, or request to talk to the photo tech, and ask them to turn auto correct off before releasing the order. Not all labs are the same, but mine has software that takes digital orders and defaults to auto correct brightness/contrast levels. In my opinion, it makes the pictures look terrible. 

-There are always coupons. Don't be afraid to ask. 

-Buy the copyright release. Please don't put us in the position to break the law for you. You may not think it's a big deal, considering how much you paid for the photographer, but regardless of what you think, you are asking a stranger to put his/her job on the line so that you can save a few bucks. Would you do that for a stranger?",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,True,,,True,t3_ot66m,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/ot66m/some_advice_from_someone_who_processes_photos_for/,

They pushed the date up for timing issues, and a lot of things are getting done at the last minute or DIY. She has a very fussy and opinionated mother in law and a very tight budget. She's stressed about saving money and time and her cat just died and she's got a lot on her plate right now. I feel like she's not getting to have as much fun with planning as she should.

She's got a tea party, vintage hipsterish vibe to her wedding, which suits both her and the groom. We imagined putting her into a beautiful, Hepburn inspired short wedding dress; and she emailed me the other day to say she had found and bought the perfect one... For thirty dollars at a Forever 21.

That in itself is not the problem. The problem is the dress is awful, and is really unflattering on her.

I do not say this lightly. I myself had a jealous bridesmaid insult my dress (it was traumatic and I had to eventually uninvite her for other reasons), and the last thing I want to do is do that to someone else.  But as a sister who loves her, I am really torn between saying nothing, and telling her that the dress is really unflattering. My sister is a glamazon; big boobs, hips, and legs. I won't go into detail about the dress; but the way it is cut and sits emphasizes all the wrong things and hides all her beautiful features, and is way too short for her height. It is also way to informal for what she tells me the wedding will be like.

My sister is stubborn to a fault; I've talked to the other bridesmaid (my best friend) and we both feel the same way about the dress, but there is a good chance of her refusing to listen to us if we say something. But I KNOW her fiancé's snobbish family WILL say something rude about it, and she would be crushed and it would ruin her special day. 

I guess my question is should I say something, or not? We live in different cities, and I won't get to see her for a few weeks yet; if I should say something should it be face to face or is that worse? Anyone have any stories of being told or telling bad news about a dress that turned out well? I would love to take her shopping and help her choose something that she won't facepalm herself for in 5 years, even chip in if she needs it.

Basically, during 4th of July celebrations, my FFIL offered my fiancé and I $2,000 cash and a paid-for honeymoon if we decided to not have a wedding because it would be cheaper for him. He said he’d even call my parents and see if they’d match him because it would be cheaper for them too. I didn’t think that my parents would go for it because they are very traditional. However, I talked with my Mom about it yesterday, just to see what she thought, and she didn’t seem upset at all and, in fact, liked the idea, but did not mention anything about matching my FFIL. 

My dilemma is that I’ve always dreamed of the (somewhat) traditional wedding with the ceremony and reception and the whole nine yards. But, going that route is going to be very expensive and neither myself and my fiancé nor my parents can pitch in much towards everything and I don’t want to ask my FILs to pay for the majority of our wedding. Also, that $2,000 (or possibly $4,000) would be a nice start for a savings for us to build on and… FREE HONEYMOON. The more I think about the offer, the more appealing it becomes to me, but I’m still conflicted because, let’s face it, I want the big party too. I’ve read all the advice and suggestions on making sure our wedding doesn’t become a bill for us to pay off after the celebration and my FFIL’s offer seems like a great way to not do that… We’d be getting paid to not have a wedding. 

What does weddit think? Should I accept my FFIL’s offer? Or should I stick to what I’ve always wanted and try to do our wedding on a tight budget?

TL;DR – FFIL offered $2,000 and a free honeymoon if we elope instead of having a wedding, but I’ve always dreamed of what my wedding would be like and did not have elopement in mind. What should I do?

This is not the case in the wedding industry whatsoever.  Everything is negotiable - your dress, your venue, your flowers, your accessories, your invitations, your favors, your food, and your alcohol.  Do some research on what points of leverage you have: Do you have a small guest list?  Are you flexible on your date?  Are you getting married on an off-month?

I had this dream wedding venue.  Gorgeous resort on the cliffs overlooking the ocean.  I figured I'd ask the price knowing I could never afford it despite the fact that my parents are being extremely generous, but I'd regret it if I didn't ask.  Opening bid for a morning wedding with luncheon reception Sunday in January was $50k food and beverage minimum and a $8k rental fee.  Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I told her that I'm completely flexible with my date and is there anything I can do.  After about a week when I thought she had forgotten me, she sent me an email saying that if I was willing to finish my event by 4pm on January 6th, she'd be able to do $12k F&amp;B minimum and a $4k rental fee.  I told her that if she could lower the $4k rental fee to $2k, I'd sign the contract then and there.  And that is how I am now getting married at my dream venue with the cliffside scenery and a ballroom that looks like it came from Beauty &amp; the Beast that generally goes for $90k F&amp;B minimum during the prime summer months.

(I don't mean to rant, I promise...)",42,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1i35eh/bridesmaid_how_to_i_politely_and_tactfully_ask/,"So my best friend from college is getting married in October, and I'm a bridesmaid, along with her sister (MOH), another friend from college, and a childhood friend who lives across the country. 

Her sister and the other semi-local bridesmaid have been planning and talking and whatnot, but not once have I been included in any of their plans for the bridal shower, bachelorette party, wedding help, or anything, and although the other bridesmaids don't seem to care, the bride seems to have taken this as a personal slight. I've mentioned that I'm completely in the dark about things to both them and the bride, but it hasn't changed. The bride seems very irritated that I haven't ""contributed"" enough, and I feel like I'm failing to meet expectations that I didn't know were there to begin with. 

I feel like for the past several months, all the bride wants to talk about is her wedding. I've gone through some pretty traumatic life changes in the last few months, and I feel like I can't rely on her for any help--I get it, she's preoccupied and busy, I've tried to be understanding. 

This all kind of culminated about two weeks ago when I was just chatting with the bride over facebook and she seemed to have a bit of a meltdown. She told me she was sick of me talking about my life and the things I was doing (I don't think I'm a very self-centered person, but I'm biased). I told her I understood, if she didn't want to hear about me applying to nursing school or talking about my new friends or guys or anything else, that's ok. Then she proceeded to tell me I hadn't payed enough attention to her and her wedding. 

Here's the thing. I introduced her to the groom. I've listened to her gripe about her long-distance relationship for years. I've helped them through fights when he was 1000 miles away, and nobody else really cared. We don't see each other often in person, but the last time we did, I spent hours with her shopping for her dress and accessories, picking out a cake, on youtube for 3 hours debating first-dance songs. I'll admit I haven't helped much with planning for the shower or parties because--again--I'm being left out of the loop. 

All of this I could take in stride, but in the last two(ish) weeks, she's begun making comments like ""If you still want to be in this wedding..."" ""I don't have to have 4 bridesmaids, you know..."" and other veiled threats. I've gone from feeling a bit confused and dumped on to irritated pretty damn fast. 

We did see each other on the 4th and sorted some of it out. I told her I'd be down to help or hear about whatever, and reminded her I'm only a text message away, and she said she'd try again to get the MOH to include me in plans so I wasn't in the dark as to my responsibilities.

And then on the 6th at one of her bachelorette parties, I learned that as soon as I went to the bathroom she started making comments to the other girls again that ""She didn't know if I was going to be 'in' her wedding for much longer."" 

I'm almost at the point where the next time she implies I might be 'out' of the wedding, I'll tell her to keep the bridesmaid dress I bought, and just find someone else to wear it.

So I'm a pretty complicated situation. This is going to be a long story, so I really appreciate you reading this... Here goes..

This story involves 4 people, my two friends (with names changed) Paul and Sarah, my girlfriend, and myself.  About two months ago I told my friend Sarah, who is close friends with my girlfriend, that I was planning on proposing in early August. A few weeks later, Paul texts me and lets me know that he is planning on proposing to Sarah in June.  He lets me know this because he doesn't want me to feel like he's stealing my thunder.  Personally I could care less who gets engaged/married first...

Now, my girlfriend is a different story...She has been planning her wedding day since she was a little girl. She has a cute notebook full of wedding ideas and plans that she has been adding to ever since we got serious.  We have been dating for a year and a half and we have been talking about marriage for quite a long time. We are completely open with each other about this topic and she already knows that i'm proposing...she just doesn't know when. I know...we're a little strange.. 

As I mentioned before, my girlfriend and Sarah are close...so they discussed wedding stuff way before any of this. Paul had Sarah (and the rest of us) convinced that he thought they might get married...but not for a few years. Because of this...Sarah never took any time to think about what she wanted her wedding to be like. She isn't that planning type of person anyways.  So when the news of this engagement hit, my girlfriend felt a little cheated. She is well aware that this feeling isn't fully rational, but she has expressed that she can't help feeling a little disappointed that she isn't engaged first.

That being said, she never mentioned this feeling to anyone but me and has been incredibly supporting of Sarah so far.  Until now...
Now that Sarah has been engaged for about a week or so...she has been talking to my girlfriend about her wedding plans constantly... This would be a great bonding time for them...except Sarah has started to take multiple key ideas from my girlfriends wedding plans (which they discussed in great detail before all of this).  For example... 

My girlfriends favorite flower since she was a little girl is the Sunflower. All of a sudden Sarah's favorite flower is the Sunflower and she wants them in her wedding. I've known Sarah for 6 years..NOT ONCE has she ever had sunflowers or talked about them. 

My girlfriends talked about how she wanted her colors to be yellow and gray. She showed multiple pictures to Sarah in the past months of how she envisioned her wedding. All of a sudden Sarah's choice colors are yellow and gray...

As I stated before, Sarah knows exactly when I'm proposing, so it's not as if my girlfriends wedding ideas are simply hypothetical. Because of all of this...a huge rift is forming between them and my girlfriend feels incredibly betrayed. I'm doing my best to navigate the situation, but frankly I'm starting to feel pretty angry myself.

And help with Future MIL.,43,4,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1gz50h/question_about_sapphire_engagement_rings_and_help/,"So...basically my whole life I've wanted a sapphire engagement ring. My mother has one, as does my grandmother. So I have emotional attachment to the idea, as well as being practical because it will be cheaper for my BF. 

I know my BF has started shopping for a ring lately, and has asked his mother for help finding the ring, because she loves jewels and he's clueless. At dinner the other night, she cornered me and basically told me I would regret it for the rest of my life if I got a sapphire. They're an ugly color (I want a yellow one), they'll get scratched and eventually split. 

Granted, I know my future MIL loves me because she wouldn't help look for a ring if she didn't. But she's all about status and a sapphire just doesn't fit in with what she likes, so I shouldn't get it. Heaven forbid she have 2 DIL's who don't have diamond engagement rings. 

Basically, I'm looking for help backing up my stance. Or am I completely wrong? Should I get a diamond like she wants me too?\

Sorry for the giant wall of text. Thanks for reading and chiming in. 

TL;DR: I want a sapphire ering; future MIL wants me to get a diamond. Am I crazy for wanting a sapphire &amp; is she right or should I stick to my guns?


Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice. I'm so happy to hear that alot of you have sapphires and love them. You are all right, it is my ring and I should get what I want and not bow to her pressure. I'll handle it nicely of course. FMIL is a wonderful lady, she just cares to much about status and doesn't always understand that her words can be hurtful. Thank you again!

Some of the grooms-to-be on here might get some inspiration from this, so here is what I did.

I really wish I had taken more photos - I had intended to lay out the contents of each of the boxes so the pro photographer could get some nice shots of them, but we had a slight drama 40 minutes before the ceremony and I ran out of time. There are the photos she did get:
http://i.imgur.com/PhOK6l5.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/KTi4EEH.jpg

Each of the boxes was a surplus ammo box I bought online. These boxes themselves make great gifts - they're sturdy and waterproof and make excellent tool boxes or tackle boxes. Each box was spray painted with their name (only one visible) and on top ""ZOMBIE SURVIVAL KIT"".

As far as the contents - really the leatherman knife/tool was the main part of the gift, and the rest was really novelty, but it was fun to make and the guys loved them. Each box contained (in no particular order):

- waterproof matches
- firelighters/cooking fuel
- Army MRE meal
- cheap compass
- cheap binoculas
- length of rope
- water bottle
- no-doze pills
- Zombie weapon - in the photo it's a pipe wrench, another one had a small crowbar and the other had a hammer.

The contents have all been moved/fiddled with (and you can see my brother's watch) so it's not presented well in the photos, but hopefully that can provide some inspiration.

All week the forecast called for severe storms, 80% chance of rain, and our ceremony was set to be outside.  I fretted about it all week.  But, I woke up and the sky was clear and although there was a lot of cloud cover in the afternoon the rain held off.  

The ceremony went off without a hitch, but when we got to the reception hall it was chaos in the kitchen.  We chose to have my family do the catering to give the reception a more relaxed and ""family reunion"" style atmosphere.  However, when they got there all of the frozen food that had gone into the refrigerator the night before was still frozen, which nearly doubled the cooking time.  The cork screw broke off in one of the wine bottles.  The CO2 tank in the kegerator was empty.  The control box for the sound system was locked.  We had no booze, no music, and the only food we had to set out were finger foods.  I panicked.  Then they kicked me out of the kitchen.

We found someone to unlock the control box, about three people turned up with cork screws and a bartender friend was able to exchange the CO2 tank, and helped pass out sodas until the beer was ready to go.

Amazingly, with all the chaos going on behind the scenes, *absolutely no one noticed.*  Everyone thought it went great and we had the time of our lives.  So, for all you soon-to-be brides, take a breath and remind yourselves:  If there's something you planned that doesn't happen, no one will know the difference.  Everyone who is there loves you and will think it's the greatest day ever, no matter what.

* Good News: I'm 90% sure he will say yes
* Bad News: They live 5 hours away
* Good News: We're going to visit this weekend
* Bad News: My girlfriend will be around the entire time

So I see these as my only two options:

* Call her mother tonight or tomorrow and ask her to find a way to keep my girlfriend away and busy for a while.

  * Cons
     * Her mom has no poker face and I seriously doubt her ability to keep the knowledge to herself
     * Her mom has actually already expressed interest to me that she wants to be involved in this conversation  (a comment she made months ago)
   * Pros
      * I get alone time to talk to her Dad

* Hope to God sometime comes up that leaves me alone with her mom and dad
   * Cons
      * Probably won't happen
   * Pros
      * Her mom is part of the conversation


**Proposing**

* Good News: I have the ring she wants
* Bad News: The ring size is too big
* Good News: They ordered the correct ring size I need
* Bad News: The order time is 5 weeks
* Neutral News: The projected arrival time of the fitted ring is plus or minus 3 days of when I plan to propose

So, the question is: Do I go ahead and propose when I'm planning to (on our anniversary)? Or do I wait and propose a few days latter when the fitted ring has arrived? I know girls love to take pictures of their rings and show it off to everyone when they get engaged, and I'm afraid this won't be possible since the ring is several sizes too big.

Also, I am planning on proposing outside, so there is a chance doing it on our actual anniversary won't work anyways do to weather.

I'm really stressed out by both of these questions. Any ideas or suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

**UPDATE:** I'm no longer worried about the ring size and won't let it affect when I propose, getting excited!

**UPDATE 2:** Right now it seems the plan is to pull one or both her parents aside tomorrow, tell them I have something I'd like to talk to them about without my GF, and if they wouldn't mind waking up a bit earlier to talk about it, or if there is another way to be alone that they would prefer. This is super exciting, thank you all so much for your input!!

**UPDATE 3:** I was able to wake up early and talk to her parents for a long time before she woke up. Everything went great. Now I've only got 1 more person to ask... her!

Everything's fairly on course, the more important aspects have been paid off, but I'm getting frustrated at the fine points now. 

I had been given good advice ""focus on just a few items of your wedding that you'd like to be 'perfect', and don't worry if other things aren't perfect to the last detail.""

I really want my wedding dress to be stunning, I'm going apeshit over our flower selection, and I can't help imagining our first dance together being elegant and beautiful.

Problem? We're both terrible dancers, can't afford lessons so were planning on YouTubing it. He's been reluctant to start practicing, I've felt discouraged because of my own embarrassing lack of rhythm and his reluctance. I'm disappointed that one of the things I really hoped would be magical, is likely to turn into a clumsy, awkward shuffle while we just wait for the song to end. 

I've been okay with a lot of wedding compromises. I even was okay with an iPod instead of a live DJ... But I really wanted to (for one day, at least) be graceful, elegant, and admired. Now it looks like I'll just be ordinary me, looking out of place in a dress, looking dumb at my own wedding because I can't dance well. It hurts.

What's more, he's upset that I can't just be happy with the fact I'm dancing with my new husband. As in, I'm being vain to care about the dance looking fancy and elegant, and I should just be happy to be with the man I love. Of course I'll be happy about that, it just sucks on the one day I'm supposed to embody the essence of femininity and grace, I'll just be ordinary me. I'm never the center of attention, have always shied away from the spotlight, but on the one day it's supposed to be about us, I'll look ordinary. 

I'm sorry, I just had to vent, and I felt this would be the one subreddit that would be understanding. Thanks for reading. 

**EDIT** Thanks for the advice, guys. After a long talk about where we're both coming from, we finally bit the bullet and put on YouTube. Conquered the box step, so at least we have something basic to work with. I felt better just being in his arms and working on it, so I'm not going to worry so much about it being complex, and he promised to practice it more often with me.

The wedding dress scam.,36,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1i6xmw/a_cautionary_tale_the_wedding_dress_scam/,"So here is a little story about my wedding that happened back in June that will hopefully help someone else who is going through the arduous process of planning a wedding.

We got engaged in October. Life was busy with grad school and LDR, so when January rolled around we set a date. June 1.

My wife booked a dress from an extremely reputable-seeming dress maker on Etsy. The style was right, the price was right, everything looked great. 

Initially, communication was awesome and we would have the dress mid-March. Great! That's plenty of time!

Mid-March rolls around and no communication (bad sign) or process pics (worse sign) regarding the dress, so we hit Ms. Yuan Chen up... ""What's the deal?""

""I don't have a record of your order, did you pay yet?"" Oof, whoops. No deposit given, no dress began. This should have been an early warning. No worries, we'll pay in full to guarantee a May 21 delivery for a June 1 wedding.

The end of April rolls around and we get a message that basically reads ""I'm so sorry my etsy store is gone, thank you for your patience."" We hadn't noticed the etsy store's disappearance, but apparently it was closed as the seller was located in China but advertising as being located in California.

""What do we do now?!"" We thought. Well, the seller was very reassuring about our delivery date and all that so, we will give her the benefit of the doubt. Afterall, her online ratings at the time were wonderful.

Then it got dicey. No response to emails for weeks, delivery date is a week away and we can't get a status update. Then, a few days left, we get a ""your dress will be finished an I will overnight it"" response. AWESOME! This is great. 

Again, deadlines come and go an we finally (with 48 hours left) find ourselves with no dress and limited options.

By the grace of God, she found a dress on the Thursday before our wedding at a consignment shop for the same price as our original (fraudulent) dress and... No alterations needed!!!! Thank God.

There were other hiccups (including our pastor quitting the evening of the rehearsal) before the wedding, but everything came together and she was BEAUTIFUL!!!

Or should I just let it be?

I practice my feminism a little bit differently, but I totally respect my bridesmaid's opinions and want her to be comfortable at my wedding.  I'm just mildly concerned that they sort of clash with the fancy, glitzy aesthetic of the rest of the shindig.

Some background: My mother was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer in late 2009. Since then, she fought the disease hard until about a few weeks ago, when she was hospitalized and the decision was made to stop chemo because it was making things worse. The tumors have spread to her intestines, rendering her unable to digest food as one normally would. She had a stent placed in her stomach that would relieve the symptoms she was experiencing (pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.), but the reality is that after cancer has spread this much, and this procedure is done, her life expectancy is anywhere from 30 to 90 days.

For the past few years, I have dealt with the reality that my mom would die from this disease at some point. I have come to terms with it in many respects and my mom and I have had conversations about the future, including whether she will be able to see me get married on April 13. She told me regardless of what happened, she wanted me to have my wedding as planned. She epitomizes the spirit of living life to the fullest and not letting cancer become this dark thing that engulfs you and depresses your spirit for life.

However, the issue that arose yesterday involved my oldest brother and how he is coping. I had asked my two brothers months ago to get fitted for tuxedos, as I wanted them to be in the wedding party and walk our mother down the aisle, as I pray that she will make it to that day. One was fitted a few months ago, but when my fiance and I checked to see if everyone had been fitted (the deadline is today), I saw he had not gone. I sent him a text asking if he would do it. He replied, saying he would consider going tomorrow. I got upset and asked him to tell me if he was really going to do it because I was frustrated with him not being direct about it. I had asked him repeatedly for months, even before my mom became gravely ill.

He called my sister crying, saying the last thing he had on his mind was the wedding and that he probably wouldn't go because he would rather be by my mother's side instead of pretending to have a good time. 

My mother is not bed ridden. The reality is she may be at some point, but I choose to be optimistic. If I have to carry her down the aisle myself in my arms, I will make sure she sees this wedding.

Am I being selfish for being upset? I fear now he won't attend the wedding at all, regardless of the state of my mother or if she passes. I am starting to believe he wants me to cancel the whole thing. I think it would dishonor her and her wishes if I cancelled the wedding, or didn't proceed as planned. What is the best way to proceed? What should I say?

* Our leftover flowers were delivered to a nursing home the day after. Note: this required several phone calls to see if flowers were acceptable due to allergies, etc. Other possible locations include: hospices, hospitals (teenagers are often overlooked), nursing homes, adult foster homes.
* Our centerpieces (chemistry glassware, general nerdery) were delivered to an under-privileged high school in my parents' district. We included ""recipes"" for experiments that used the donated materials.
* Leftover food was delivered to a nearby mission. It doesn't have to be your denomination/philosophy. What matters is that people who need the nourishment are getting it!

I emailed her, and we'll see how she responds.

BUT, earlier today, we were talking and she asked if it was ok if her cousin (who I was also childhood friends with) and her husband could stop by the wedding.

I swear, I'm so close to disinviting her altogether.  *sigh*

Sorry this is so long, I needed to rant to someone who isn't my fiance, who told me not to invite her in the first place.

TL;DR: Childhood friend is causing me grief with my guest list.

&lt;b&gt;Edit&lt;/b&gt;: I sent her an email telling her that the kids weren't invited, and I have already told her no to her cousin as well (THANK YOU timesuck for the image!).  So, we'll see.  The Couple A/Couple B drama has been discussed with my fiance, and he agrees with me that they need to act like adults and not put us in the middle.  So, we'll see what happens.  Right now, I'm having fun registering.  ;)",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,True,,,True,t3_rg8hx,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/rg8hx/wedding_guest_issues_rant/,

My mother has ALS and her health has been on rapid decline.  My wedding is September 7th.  We're starting to ask the ""what if"" questions regarding her making it to the wedding.

I think my mom was really looking forward to the event of the wedding.  She wanted the people, the beautiful ceremony, dresses and tuxes and the whole affair.  She wants to visit with all of the family and friends and the whole reunion feel.

My family is starting to ask if she isn't going to make it that long, if we should do a private ceremony first.  If it is important to my mom, then yes we will do that, fiance is on board.

The tough question I'm being asked is: **Is it important to me?**

I guess I need help figuring out what's really important.  I want my mom at my wedding because I want her to see the beautiful ceremony and hear all the great music we've picked and enjoy the friends and company.  And I want to look from the alter and see her sitting there next to my dad.  If she can't be, it's going to break my heart.  Trouble is, I think it's going to break my heart at our ""fake ceremony"" even if we get married in a private ceremony with her there first.  I want her there for the big event day - meeting all my friends and my fiance's family and seeing us all dressed up and in this beautiful space.

Does anyone have any personal experience to share or has some points to help me think this through?  None of my friends have lost parents.

**EDIT:** My family (my mother's family) that she is so looking forward to seeing is scattered across the country.  Moving the date sooner is not a possibility, no one would be able to come.  Everything is paid for and there isn't a single open space or caterer - Minnesota just legalized gay marriage (YAY) so there REALLY is nothing available.

**EDIT EDIT:** This may have resolved itself.  She had a blood clot in her lung which caused major breathing issues and a heart episode.  The wonderful doctors are confident they will be able to treat for the clot, prevent future clots, and the damage to her heart won't be permanent.  This is still a VERY REAL fear of mine, but it's looking less imminent than it did this morning.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1374441176.0,,,True,t3_1irda5,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1irda5/possible_death_of_a_parent_early_ceremony/,

This is how it went down. When I asked her Dad for permission he mention an excellent restaurant in town where there is a breathtaking views of downtown and incoming planes landing in the airport. This restaurant is a special place for her family, as it is where her parents reception was held and where she has celebrated every birthday she has had for the last 20 years. I arranged a photographer to meet me there, 30 mins before she arrived. I asked her mom and dad to take her out for dinner there. I explained to the staff and Maitre d' what I wanted to do. Before the Mater d sat them, he made up a story about an ad for the restaurant and asked if they could have their picture taken outside on the balcony. Thats when I snuck up behind her and got down on one knee. She was in total shock and surprise.

Again I thank everyone for sharing their stories and the helpful advice.

I made an appointment but they me listed as a bridesmaid, so I followed the young girl over to bridesmaid dresses. I let her show me a few of them, but it was pointless so I asked if I could just look at wedding dresses. The girl was really excited to finally get to play with wedding dresses, but I could tell that she was worried that she would get in trouble for showing them to me. I gave her my size, my price range, what style I was looking for and she came back with one dress. It fit perfectly, it was beautiful and I decided to order that dress. 

The store actually ordered the wrong size at first. They got my sister's size and mine confused. When I picked up the dress they wouldn't let me try it on so I stupidly just took it home and left it in my closet for a week before my mother nagged me to wear it for her. Luckily I did and it was nowhere near the right size. I called the next morning and the manager had me come right in to exchange it. No problem there. I was amazed, considering their strict no returns or exchange policy. 

When my new dress came in today, I made an appointment, went in to pick up the dress and was shown to a fitting room. I asked for a bra, it was TOSSED over the door, and I was on my own. Ever zipped your own wedding dress up? Not easy! I had to use the hanger..... Anyway, the dress fit. Beautifully. I walked out of the fitting room (because they have no mirrors), looked in the mirror, didn't see my consultant, went back into my fitting room and tried to get the dress off. It was not budging. The zipper was directly between my shoulder blades and no matter how I wiggled, I couldn't get it up or down. So I tried to shimmy down.... got stuck.... had to blindly feel around the floor for my phone and call the store. When they answered, it was a ""hold please"" and I waited for 2 minutes. When someone finally answered, they were more confused than anything. I had to explain myself twice, and then prop the door open so they could find my fitting room.

So embarrassing!

1, canceled/flaked out on dress shopping with me multiple times.

2, tried to bring her boyfriend, whom I detest, dress shopping with us, and then her mother, who's a complete bitch and I've only met once. When I told her the only guy that would be coming is my fabulous friend J, she got pissy and wouldn't talk to me. 

3, she's told me twice that she doesn't like my dress preferences, that our honeymoon idea is stupid, and that her boyfriend doesn't approve of us getting married. 

4, she's expressed her opinion that I run the guest list by her FIRST, because there are some people she doesn't want there. 

5, I argued with her for 10 minutes last week because I'm not budging on the 'no plus ones' rule. We simply can't afford to let people bring dates. Spouses and significant others, yes, but NO DATES. She tried to convince me to let her bring her mom as a date, I put my foot down, and she started bitching. 

6, I had to firmly tell her that our venue does NOT allow hard liquor, yet she's hinted that she may 'sneak some in', and I also had to tell her that she was forbidden from bringing weed or mushrooms, on the principle that there are kids and our religious families around, and she clearly couldn't grasp why she couldn't just be 'careful about it'. 

7, I told her that we weren't allowing smoking during the ceremony, and she started bitching about how hard it would be to go half a flipping hour without a smoke break.

This time, last year, I was laying in bed trying to sleep. There was nothing else I could do in terms of wedding planning. What would be, would be. On this day, last year, I married my best friend. 

At the time, I was so stressed trying to make sure every last detail was perfect. Many people will probably tell you not to worry about these things. They are wrong! Do whatever you need to do to make your special day SPECIAL. 

Looking back, our wedding was exactly the way we envisioned it- because we made sure of it. You only get one chance to do it right, don't let anyone take that away from you. I am so glad we did everything the way we wanted, it made our day even more special to us! Still, today, when I look at pictures I beam!

Oh, and I thought I'd pass on the best ""day of"" advice I got: plan a few minutes during the day to just be alone with your new legal lover. The day goes by so fast, having some time to just take it in together is so special. 

Our reception was in a hotel. So, before we were introduced we went to the hotel room, talked for about 10 minutes, went pee, and then entered the party. One of my favorite memories- that and getting hitched.

It hasn't necessarily been easy, but I've been scouring the internet, and putting the creative side of my brain to work. 

We're having a small reception at a local restaurant, and I wanted to add touches of color and personal decor without going overboard and becoming overwhelmed with the setup. I also had it set in my mind that whatever decor I did purchase had to be reused in either our home or as gifts for our guests. [Here is one of my projects.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/71228857@N03/6440417689/in/photostream) This will make favors for 20 guests, while also adding decoration to your tables. 

**What You Will Need:**

* [Carton of 80 Tiles](http://www.flickr.com/photos/71228857@N03/6440364213/in/photostream/) ....$.10/each at Lowes = $8.00

* 12 sheets (12x12in) of [Cardstock/Scapbook Paper](http://www.flickr.com/photos/71228857@N03/6440364101/in/photostream/) ....4/$1.00 @ Michael's =$3.00 (You only need 9 but I bought 12 to have more variety)

* 20 sheets of [Felt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/71228857@N03/6440363987/in/photostream/) ....4/$1.00 @Hobby Lobby = $5.00 

* 2 Rolls of Ribbon....$.97 @ Michael's = $1.94
**TOTAL: $17.94**



**What You Might Have:**

* One 16fl oz bottle of Mod Podge....$6.99 @ Michael's 

* One 4fl oz bottle of Gorilla Glue....$9.99 @ Hobby Lobby

* Foam Brush....4 pack for $.97 @ Walmart 

**TOTAL: $35.89**



**Optional:**

* Xacto Cutting Board....$20 @ Walmart (This makes it really easy, but isn't necessary)
**TOTAL: $55.89**


**Instructions**


* Clean the tiles with alcohol to remove debris. 

* Cut your paper into 4x4 squares.

* Apply generous coat of Mod Podge to tile. 

* Quickly, center your paper on the tile, and press firmly. Dry for 15 minutes.

* Apply a layer of Mod Podge  evenly on top of the paper. Dry for 20 minutes.

* Repeat previous step until you like the way it looks.

* You can now add a sealant on top of the Mod Podge if you prefer. I may not.

* Once the coasters are dry, cut the felt into 4x4 squares. Use Gorilla Glue to attach felt to the bottom of the tile. Let the coasters dry for a day or two before bundling the coasters into packages. 

* Stack up sets of three, tie with a ribbon, attach a note, and leave one free coaster for the table!

1376496667.0,29,self.wedding,1kcsq9,"Brother (and groomsman) just got a DUI and is in jail. The wedding is this Saturday, and the rehearsal Friday.",33,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1kcsq9/brother_and_groomsman_just_got_a_dui_and_is_in/,"So to make a long story short, my older brother has aspergers syndrome, and has had problems with alcohol for many years. This will be his second DUI. Additionally, my mother who pretty much was the only one that took care of him and looked after him, passed away last year. Now if she were around, she would have bailed him out as soon as she found out he was in jail, and would have subsequently driven him wherever he needed to go. However, since she isn't around, he had to call my father. My father has already warned him that if he caught him drinking, he would be on his own so when he got the call from my brother he pretty much told him he wasn't going to bail him out.

Now, as I have already mentioned my brother is one of my groomsmen and the wedding is this Saturday. My father offered to bail him out if that is what I wanted so that he could be in the wedding. Though he made sure to mention how that would put him in a bit of a bind since he would have to essentially babysit him until his court date.

So now I have a few options...

1. Have my dad bail him out
2. Have my dad leave him there, and just have his place be empty during the wedding
3. Have my dad leave him there, and replace his spot with my brother-in-law

Now it should be mentioned that I love my brother, and I would love for him to be able to attend my wedding. On the other hand though, it would honestly make everybody's lives a lot easier if he just stayed there.",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_1kcsq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1kcsq9/brother_and_groomsman_just_got_a_dui_and_is_in/,

1375106890.0,29,self.wedding,1j9yl0,[UPDATE] Trying to Reason with Future SIL,30,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1j9yl0/update_trying_to_reason_with_future_sil/,"So it's been roughly two months since my last post about my future SIL and I'm here to update! I haven't been on Reddit much since I've been so busy with work and wedding festivities. Anywho, here it goes:

After her nasty text message back, FH and I sat down and tried to think how we could go about this and not have them pissed at us forever. I took a few days and sent something back. Here is the gist of what I said: ""We're really sorry you feel that way, but we have our reasoning and no one wanted to listen, so it came down to this. We just want 30 minutes of peace and quiet so we, along with everyone else, can enjoy the biggest day of our lives. I'm not saying that your children would be screaming the entire time, but we don't want to take the chance with any children. We have plenty of friends that are coming and bringing their children and bringing a parent or a babysitter that said they would be happy to watch your children for the wedding. We also offered to hire a babysitter for you, but neither of these options were acceptable to you. Hopefully we can be adults and move past this, and if you change your mind about coming, please let me know.""

She didn't say anything back to that. A few weeks later we went down to FH's parent's house for her birthday and future SIL and BIL were there with their two children. They screamed. The. Whole. Time. I'm in no way exaggerating. Future BIL and SIL just let them run around screaming their heads off the whole time chasing the dogs and pulling stuff down off bookcases. They're also the type of people who think it's acceptable to bring their huge dog with them everywhere. The funniest thing was, they acted like nothing had happened. They acted like our conversation never took place, so I just let it go. After they left, there was complete silence. It was glorious. Then my future MIL says to me ""Yeah, maybe you made the right choice about them not being allowed at the wedding"" to which future FIL agreed, even though they were also pressuring us to let the kids come to avoid a huge conflict in the future.

The same day, we started talking about the wedding and future SIL said, ""yeah sorry we can't come, but we don't have the money to fly down there and rent a car and hotel room."" To which future FIL said: ""What are you talking about? We offered to cover most of your expenses for the trip, we told you we would fly you down and you would just have to pay for a rental car for two days and your two night hotel stay in the wedding room block."" Future SIL looked like a deer in the headlights and quickly said ""Oh well, future BIL can't get the time off work to come (Friday before)."" To which everyone rolled their eyes because they had already told us they could get the time off, but that was before they heard about the no kids rule. 

So a few weeks later, we get invited down to their house (future BIL and SIL live about 2.5 hours away, near my parents vacation home) for the 4th of July, and since we have a long standing tradition with my family, we had to decline, but invited them all down for dinner and fireworks on that Saturday, to which they were very excited. I also told them they couldn't bring their dog because there is a strict leash law and my parents dog is very protective and doesn't like other dogs she doesn't know in our house. She said that was fine and she was going to text me when they were on their way down. But they never texted me or showed up. That's the kind of stuff they do. We had planned this for two weeks in advance and they blow us off. This apparently isn't a new thing, as confirmed by other family members.

She also blew off my bridal shower. She RSVP'ed yes, and then didn't show up. Probably because my cousin told her that she couldn't bring her two kids. I actually wasn't surprised at all.

Then just last night they posted pictures of football tickets that they bought for all four of them on our wedding day. The ticket package with a parking pass was well over $600. Kind of a large unnecessary purchase for people who claimed to be strapped for cash. 

As of now, I've run out of fucks to give about these people. There are more smaller things that have happened that make me think they're just ignorant people with no common social courtesy. My parents have decided to throw us a reception party for when we get back to our home state a few weeks after the wedding and honeymoon (not sure if I mentioned that before) and I wouldn't be shocked if they RSVP'ed yes and then flaked on us. 

So there's the update. I sincerely hope that any of you dealing with the ""no child policy"" at your wedding have more understanding guests. ",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1375122156.0,,,True,t3_1j9yl0,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1j9yl0/update_trying_to_reason_with_future_sil/,
1373408176.0,32,self.wedding,1hyri2,How do I un-ask a bridesmaid to be in my wedding?,41,9,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1hyri2/how_do_i_unask_a_bridesmaid_to_be_in_my_wedding/,"I got engaged this year but had been thinking about who my bridesmaids would be for a long time.  I asked these pre-determined girls to be bridesmaids and they all said yes.  Since then, I've seen some crappy things and had a change of heart regarding 2 of the girls.  Let's just call them Jen and Kim. Jen, Kim, and me are in my best friend's wedding this September.  Watching their behavior during the planning of a wedding has HORRIFIED me.  I have been trying to coordinate with them to do nice things for the bride and they have been total ass-holes.  We went to Vegas for the bachelorette party.  Prior to the trip, I had been throwing out ideas for fun things to do...sashes, boas, buttons, penis things, a veil, dare cards, scavenger hunts, etc.  Jen and Kim squashed my ideas because sashes and boas are ""too hot to wear"", buttons ""wreck your clothes"", penis things ""aren't classy and we want to stay classy"", and dare cards and scavenger hunts sound like ""too much work"" and involve things ""they won't do"".  I was the last one to arrive in Vegas and I walked in to find all the girls tucked into bed and watching TV at 4pm.  I tried to build some energy and excitement and brought out beads and margarita glasses and a veil.  They told me they were going to take naps.  What???!!!!!  So they did.  I got them to go out to a club that night but everyone got tired by 11:30 so we were back in the room and in bed before midnight.  Is this really what we came to Vegas to do??? 

The next 2 nights were the same.  I was able to go out with the bride and we partied until the morning hours, but Jen and Kim usually went back to the room early to sleep.  Jen said she's married so she doesn't need to stay out at clubs anymore.  Jen also said that this was her first vacation since she had her daughter, so she was going to do what she wanted to do no matter what.  She thought everyone should just go do their own thing and meet up as a bachelorette party later.  And Kim kept bringing up how much she missed her live-in boyfriend.  At one point, she said she almost cried during a taxi cab ride because she missed him so much.  We were only in Vegas for 3 days.  She said 3 days is way too long to be apart. Are you fucking kidding me right now?!  Did I really pay to go to Vegas and hang out with people who don't want to go out and just want to sit around and cry about missing their boyfriends? One night, Jen and Kim offered to go get the bride and the rest of us dinner.  They left and didn't come back for 3 hours.  They also would not respond to text, but we saw them posting pictures on facebook of their ""date night"".  When they got back with our cold dinner, Kim tried to blame Jen behind her back and said it was all Jen's idea to go watch the Bellagio show and walk up and down the strip sight-seeing.  Kim said they had a nice little date night though, and wanted to know if we saw their pictures on facebook.  I was mad but kept my mouth shut.  The bride asked when they bought our food and Kim said they bought our food first because THEY were hungry, then walked around with our food for 3 hours before coming back.  WTF.  I am having a hard time comprehending how they thought that was ok.  There was sooo much miscommunication, often stemming from Kim, who likes to play stupid if you call her out for giving misinformation.  People were getting irritated with each other and it took everything in me to keep my mouth shut and not say anything.  Jen and Kim even had the nerve to complain about how we didn't look like a bachelorette party because all the other parties had sashes and boas and veils, etc.  Still I said nothing because I didn't want to ruin the trip for the bride. The bride later confided in me that she tried to have fun, but it wasn't as much fun as she wanted. 

 Now I'm trying to organize getting the bride a gift from her bridesmaids.  I thought this would be nice since the bridesmaids collectively have done nothing for the bride (only 3 out of 7 went to Vegas).  I sent an email discussing a gift idea and volunteering to spearhead it.  Jen emailed me back to let me know she thinks I should have talked to everyone before sending an email saying I think we should give a bridesmaid gift.  She seemed very irritated that I would do such a thing.  She also said she doesn't really know if she wants to participate in the gift.  Jen has let me know that I've been way too much drama with all this wedding stuff and I should just sit back and relax instead of try to plan.  She also threw out that she thinks I am the cause of all the drama within this group and the bachelorette party, and that her and Kim had been talking about that for the past few months.  I asked her why she didn't bring it up to me months ago if she didn't want any ""drama"", rather than talk about me behind my back.  She had no answer for this but tried to back peddle a little.  

So herein lies my dilemma...Jen and Kim are bridesmaids in my wedding.  Everything they have done for my best friend's wedding makes me want them out of my wedding.  I want my wedding to be fun, easy-going, and drama-free.  Ironically, I feel that Kim and Jen cause a lot of drama with the prissy, self-centered, and self-righteous attitudes they've developed.  They like to say that we are all such ""good friends"", but do not include me in any of their plans.  I only find out they went out or got together through Facebook.  

I asked these girls to be in my wedding because we have been friends for the past 19 years and we used to have so much fun together and share all these great memories.  But lately their attitudes suck and I feel like I don't really trust them or feel like they are very supportive.  I have other people in my life who I spend more time with, feel closer to, and always have fun with.  On my wedding day, which is still over a year away, I want to feel like I'm surrounded by people who can be fun and silly, and who love and support me.  How do I ask these 2 girls to not be in my wedding anymore, without permanently losing them as friends?

Except this time, I'm the one getting married. I just got an email from her wanting to use the photographer she's used all her life. Don't get me wrong, they do great portrait stills of babies and seniors...in one of those old fashioned studios. Very traditional.

Cost is not really an issue so I don't understand why she wants them so badly. I want photographers who do work more like this duo -http://leahandmark.com/

We've had this conversation twice before the email today. Each time she acts like I shot her puppy. My parents are paying for everything, otherwise I'd tell her flat out no and not worry about it. If I piss her off, she makes my dad's life hell and I'd rather not do that to him. He's the one that tipped me off to her re-planning her own wedding.

Comments and suggestions? Anyone invented a mind-control device yet?

*UPDATE

So we had dinner Tuesday night. Good news and bad news. She completely capitulated on the photographer issue as soon as I brought it up. Unfortunately it was more of a ""ugh, I'm tired of talking about this do whatever you want. If the pictures are ugly I'm blaming you."" So spent most of the evening slightly angry at me, but after a couple drinks so loosened up a bit and we had a pretty good heart to heart. Overall I'd call it a slight win in that I got to hear her ""vision"" of the wedding and understand what she wants. She doesn't actually care what vendors we use, she just wants to be the one to pick them. The only problem with is that she's doing zero research for anyone or anything. ""Oh the wedding is a year away, it's too early to plan anything.""

Either way, I at least know what to do to make her happy. Thanks for all the suggestions guys. Also, a couple of you made me realize I was being a selfish brat and sulking/ranting instead of sitting down and listening to my mom. She's crazy (yelled across the restaurant ""If I can't be in control of EVERYTHING, I WILL NEVER BE HAPPY""), but if I listen, I think I can make her very happy and get the couple of things that are super important to me (which I can't afford on my own).",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1372427740.0,,,True,t3_1gsqej,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1gsqej/need_help_with_motherofthebridezilla/,

(Army) After a lot of tears I suggested we get married. Little did I know he had already planned on proposing.

Two days later he tells me his ship out date was moved up so he would leave July 1st instead of July 12. 
He took leave and flew out to see me and he gave me an engagement ring and the next day we were married in the courthouse on the 28th. I don't have a wedding band and neither does he (i couldn't afford one on such short notice)

We had planned on having a ""real wedding"" with family and friends whenever the army would allow. Now it seems a bit silly to get married again even though I never got my ""dream wedding"".

I would like to know you opinion on having an ""exchanging of vows and rings"" ceremony/ reception.

I see it as a way to celebrate with our family and friends and still get to enjoy the things I missed. Cake, dress, veil, flowers, gifts!, toasts all of that without a real formal ceremony.

I am getting married next month in a destination wedding. This is our dream wedding and we are super excited. We are taking a cruise to the Caribbean, getting married in St. Thomas on the beach and then doing an island tour as a group. 

Sounds amazing right? One problem though...I ordered my flowers (the bouquets I have had picked out and saved for 2 years mind you) from a place that does ""Realtouch"" flowers. I sent her the photos, asked if they could be done as shown and was assured that they could and that I would receive photos of them before they shipped for approval. Great. 

The photos came and none of the 3 looked like I asked for. I emailed them back, with the photos again attached and asked that they be fixed to look more like the photos. i heard nothing for days, so I emailed again and right away they responded with photos. The bridesmaids looked 100 percent better. Mine, well it looks like they tossed some greenery in it and it still looks nothing like what I asked for. So I emailed them back. Asking what we needed to do to fix it. Do we need to make it bigger...ok how much? Get more greenery? How much? Just tell me. No response. I called. No answer and no response. I posted to their FB account. No response. 

My boat leaves May 9th. I have nothing for flowers right now for my wedding and I am about to cry. I have looked online at dozens of other places and nobody can delver to me in time at this point. I do not know what to do.

Does anyone have ANY suggestions??? People to contact? Subreddits to post in? I really need some help and I am running out of time!

Thank you in advance for reading my rambling.

I've been trying to plan a wedding on a modest budget for 2014 and I recently went on my first dress shopping trip to a discount store to get some idea what might look good on me. Well, I found a dress I LOVE that fits perfectly...but it's well over what I wanted to spend at $1500 (yes, it was originally more like $4,000, but that is still a huge chunk of change). 

In case anyone is interested, this is me in the dress: http://imgur.com/a/rkQf8 (sorry, didn't quite have the right bra on but these are the best pictures I have - the back looks a bit like [this](http://www.weddingsunveiledmagazine.com/Blog/BridalMarketApril2011/Day4/ElizabethFillmore/TULLAHBack.jpg) without the lace bit)

Since then I've checked out a couple of other stores but I can't get this dress out of my head and I haven't found anything similar. I really don't think the pictures do it justice, it is a gorgeous silk and chiffon designer dress that flows beautifully and makes me feel like some kind of Greek goddess.

But...

a) I'm still over a year out from my wedding! Should I really be buying a dress this early?

b) $1500...argh! My fiance thinks I'm crazy to want to spend this much on a dress.

c) I don't have any family or good friends over here, so I'm making the decision all on my own and I'm worried I might make a dumb mistake, especially this early in the process.

Unfortunately it is a one-of-a-kind sample dress and once it is sold, that is it. The designer doesn't even make it any more.

On the other hand:

a) It is gorgeously light and airy and I'll be getting married in a hot place overseas, so good, breathable materials that are easy to transport are pretty important to me.

b) I feel like it is something I could maybe wear again to balls or operas, etc. down the track, unlike most other wedding dresses I have seen.

c) I just REALLY LOVE IT. And I do have some money from an inheritance I could theoretically dip into to get it (there would still be plenty left over), although I'd feel pretty guilty using that money on something frivolous like this.

So please r/wedding...tell me what you think? Do I look OK in the dress? Should I just be impulsive and get it, or try to find something cheaper in the wedding sales at the end of the year?

I have no family in the states and have to rely on myself. My SO on the other hand comes from a wealthy family, and were kind of offended by my idea of waiting for a couple of years to get married so I could at least have my wedding the way I want it. All I want is a small intimate wedding on the beach, which they reluctantly agreed to.

We agreed on the Bahamas because they were going there anyways for vacation this year, and they agreed to pay for everyone to fly out there and the wedding costs, however they were complaining about the costs. So I agreed to cut out things from the reception and ceremony that I really wanted to lower costs for them. One main thing for them deciding on the beach was that I agreed to not have a photographer.

Here is what I decided not to have in order to please them:

* reception venue back in ohio

* professional photographer

* my invitations

* videographer

* dress

* shoes

* reception decorations

* ceremony location on specific beach

They are paying for: 

* plane tickets

* ceremony costs

* cake

* their reception venue they picked out

* after-ceremony food

* their catering

Am I wrong for feeling so...bad about this idea? Or am I just too spoiled? I'm a photographer myself and the idea of not having professional wedding photos of my SO and I just kills me. I only have $600 to my name as of right now, so there is no way I can afford whatever I desire. Of course I have been open with them about this, but they are really stubborn and won't ever listen to me. Otherwise they are great people and I really do love them and am grateful. They have done a lot for me and my SO. That is why I feel bad for feeling this way!

I'm starting to have buyer's remorse though.  I should have tried on more than 2 dresses.  I was really excited about my choice, but I went to show one of my guy friends today and he started laughing at the picture because he thought I was joking.

My fiance' keeps telling me he thinks it's beautiful and he's excited to have blue as our accent color.  I can't help but feel that he's saying that just to try to make me feel better though.  I'm normally a pretty reserved person, so I think I went too bold with this dress.

This is the second wedding for which I've been a maid of honor. In the first situation last year, the bride was generally pretty unpleasant to work with, but it was sort of par for the course for her at that time. After the wedding, she lightened up considerably and we have a better relationship than we even had before her engagement.

Because of all the trouble I'd had with the first gal, I was psyched for the second one to get engaged. I consider this person my sister. We've been best friends for many years and I have always known her to be a steady, understanding, laid-back person. I thought her shower/bachelorette/everything would go smoothly and be a joy. 

Everything was pretty much fine until a couple months ago (the wedding is in July). We'd had a couple disagreements because she kept badgering me to ""lock down"" my own boyfriend (I presumed maybe because she wanted a partner in the planning process?) and it's not the right time for us, so I had to shut her down repeatedly. No big deal. The real trouble is that now she is being overwhelmingly negative about everything. The flowers, the DJ, the pictures, the venue, the money, the dress, I've heard her complain about all of it--but the real trouble is the dates/details of the shower. She drags her feet every time I try to set a date (I'm throwing her 2 showers in 2 cities so things need to come together soon). She is snarky with me about my choice of date--it's limited because I'm in med school and just trying to eke out my first year, and I have finals/ceremonies/mandatory internships I have to work around. 

Negativity is one thing. But now she isn't responding to my requests to hang out. When we hang out in a group, she ignores me, to the point where her fiance recognizes what's happening, looks visibly uncomfortable, and goes out of his way to include me. There was a death in my extended family a couple months ago and she barely talked to me about it, even when I brought it up. I can forget about venting about school to her; she just launches into how much harder her situation is because of wedding-this and wedding-that. 

I am honestly doing my best, and I started out with the best of intentions. I worried for a long time that maybe she was being hostile to me because she'd heard me vent about the first friend's wedding and thought that I'd adopt the same attitude to hers. But I truly didn't think anything like that until she started getting cranky with me. I know I am probably at least partially at fault but I have done everything I can think of to correct my own behavior and nothing has improved. If anything, it's worse now that ever.

So I need advice. The fact that my first friend totally returned to baseline after her wedding makes me want to hold my tongue. I know that this friend is incredibly sensitive and holds some major grudges, and I don't want to get on the bad side of that. Is wedding planning really so consuming and important that it can temporarily morph a person's personality, only to return to normal? Or is this something I need to hash out right now, since the problem won't evaporate in August? My best friend is unrecognizable to me and my feelings are getting hurt. 

I understand that this is ridiculously long but I'd appreciate any insight. Tell me your stories and help me understand the wedding-planning mindset. Thank you :)

For those of you who are recently engaged, let me tell you its going to be a whirlwind for you, but it will be so worth it!

Ahead of you are some amazingly hard times, and even more amazingly good times. Things will be ridiculously crazy and ridiculously awesome. You'll be making memories that will shape the rest of your life. 

Plans will fall through, family drama and money worries and logistics and ridiculous sillyness and money worries and money worries will make your plans seem insurmountable...

But just keep pushing though!

Keep thinking about the real reasons you're going through this, the joy you'll have on your big day, the good times to come afterwords, and (possibly the biggest stress reliever) keep reminding yourself that this craziness is only temporary; all this planning and spending and organizing and crying and saving and spending and spending (and spending!!!) will pass by so quickly, and soon you'll be two days away, just like me, making a post like this yourself.

And all that will be left is to party and to see all of your friends and family and to leave on your honeymoon and to have lots of sex and to build your home and to finally -- FINALLY -- be husband and wife. To finally start the family you've always dreamed of. Whether it's 1.5 kids or 12 kids or 15 cats, it will YOURS. It will be imperfect and it will be silly and it will be expensive and it will be awesome.

Just dont stress out. Get things done ahead of time, let friends help you, let yourself cry and let yourself laugh, and be sure to enjoy this time.

Any help or advice?

On a more technical side, it's required me to learn Linux to an extent far beyond what I already know, so it's going to take a little while to get up and running.

When I do have it going, I'd like to have some data in it immediately, so I need your help to do that. Please report any abusive spamming links you see using the link below the post/comment, and if you report these, especially if you have seen them more than once, message the mods with a link to the comment/post in question. I can put the data in a spreadsheet and then have it ready to go, day one. 

This system will help us cut down on the spam while letting the real posts get through almost instantly, so any help you could give me would be hugely appreciated.

The venue we chose has an in-house chef. How it works is we choose a dollar amount we want to spend per person and then split it - how much per plate, how much per alcohol. Based on the plate amount the chef comes up with this huge meal but there isn't really any variations from it - just a lot of food. We have three different kinds of appetizers: cream corn shot, chicken sandwich bites, and watermelon bites. For dinner there's a greens and apple salad, a potato salad. Then there's a bean dish for the vegetarians, a dish of whipped sweet potatoes on grilled greens, and then pork shoulder on slaw that comes with two kinds of BBQ sauce. Later that night we'll have s'mores at a bonfire and coke floats.

But now all these relatives are like ""Well I want chicken!"" or ""but I don't eat salad!""

Wanted to vent about my experience.",27,5,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/tn086/went_to_buy_a_dress_over_the_weekend_and_got/,"I only get to see my mom a couple of times a year, and since we are moving farther away, it's about to get way less. So I decided I'd go there for mother's day, and she expressed interest in going dress shopping with me. We made an appointment for the top designer I had picked, and we had plans to buy that weekend if I found something I really loved and have it shipped out a store closer to where I am moving to.

Shoot to the appointment. We pick out a number of dresses and start trying them on, and I'm pretty nervous to start out with, this being my first time and all. My mom picks out something I was rather ""meh"" about until I actually put it on, and then I pretty much fell in love with it. But there were a couple of other specific dresses I came to try on, so I tried those on as well; the first I didn't really like on, but the second was really, really close to what I felt about the first.

I wanted to put the first one on again. At that point, the store manager walks over and starts telling me how the dress I had on at the moment was the only one that looked good on me. My mother asked her if she'd seen the dress I loved. The manager replied she had not. My mother then said that I should put that one back on again. The manager then changed her story, saying that yes, she had seen the dress, and that it looked terrible on me (bullshit!- it was just as flattering to my figure as the other one was, and my consultant and mother had agreed to that). The manager told me that with my figure, not much in the store was going to look as good on as that dress did. (I am 4'11 and weigh 150 lbs, although I am working on losing weight).

At that point, my nervousness just went over the edge. I somehow got talked into trying on a fit-n-flare, which I hated, and at that point, was so shaken up I told my consultant, who was incredibly sweet and really standing up for me to her manager, that I had to walk away. I got back in my clothes and proceeded to leave the store, with the manager harassing me and my mother about buying the second dress the whole way out while the consultant is firmly telling the manager to basically back off, .

A few hours after the experience, I just felt disappointed. I am quite sure that I would have bought the first dress if I had stuck to my guns and put it on a second time, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it after the manager's pushy comments. 

I wrote an e-mail to the company's corporate office about my experience, but have not yet gotten any answer. Like I told the company, I feel like the manager would have tried to get me to buy a burlap sack, if that's what I had been wearing the exact moment she walked in. I could tell she thought I was indecisive and wasting the consultant's time, but seriously, when we're looking to spend $1100 on a dress, before accessories and alterations, I feel like the manager should have let me take my time and make my own decisions without making me feel fat and like I had no sense in fashion. Is this the norm for boutiques or something? I've seen this sort of behavior on Say Yes to the Dress, but I can't see how it actually works. Anyways, yeah, so that experience kind of sucked.

However, our families remain extremely catholic.  His mother almost cried when I causally said that we didn't want to get married in the church, asking where she ""went wrong"" as a parent, even after he went through 13 years of catholic school.  

Our grandparents pass out communion at church, my grandfather goes to mass every day, his grandmother takes communion to the home-bound....very catholic people here.  

Another thing to consider is that his only sibling, a brother 4 years younger, is gay and can (probably) never be married in the catholic church.  

If it were just a matter of per-marital counseling and a mass/wedding, that would be one thing.  However, as far as I know, you must join a parish, tithe, be in good standing with the church, book the church years in advance, all these hoops to jump through.  


People I know who were just married say to do what WE want, people who have been married for years say to do it in the church...I just want some more perspectives to consider. 

FYI, wedding will not be until after May 2015


edit: a lot of responses to read, but I have to study for a test tonight so...I'll check it out later.  
ALSO, I look up the rules of our city's arch dioceses, and readings and music can only be chosen from a list from the Church, vows must be that Catholic vows, and a Catholic wedding must be INSIDE the church. 

and update from my mom: she talked to my dad and he's they both want us to do what we want to do. However, she told him I'm a non-believer and that really bothers him. damn it Mom, I keep that on the DL so my dad doesn't stay up all night worrying about it. (he's a worrier)  We haven't brought it up with fiancee's family. that sounds terrifying. 


UPDATE: Went to a funeral for the 3rd person to die of suicide in the past 8 years in my family, and my grandfather was so disappointed that I didn't come to the rosary before hand...I can't break his heart anymore, and he still has another 15 years or so of ticking, my Polish side lives to be 100 at least.

Having spoken about weddings, marriage, and the like before, I have an idea of what she wants for a ring.


Instead of the traditional diamond center, she would like a pearl set in the center, surrounded by a ""halo"" of small diamonds with a few small diamonds (or more) on the band. The pearl can be substituted by light opal (which I honestly recently learned was a mineral and not just the band before Mazzy Star).


[Basically something like this. She even showed this to me and said getting this would be ""fine"".] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MN0I8Q?ie=UTF8&amp;force-full-site=1&amp;ref_=aw_bottom_links) However, since it's something she has to show to her friends and wear for the rest of her life, would that be a quality product to get? Is it possible to get better pearls and/or diamonds than that? I know fuck all about quality with regards to jewelry.

Here are some other things to know:

-I would like to spend under $4,500 for the ring. I assume that, since there's no center diamond, it'll be pretty easy to do, right?

-If it's a pearl in the center, she would not like it to be any bigger than the one shown in the link above.

-I live in New York City and am available to go to stores around the area (and the Tri-State Area).

I'm new to this whole thing. Would someone be able to help me out, please?

Edit: If I'm not to go with pearls or opal, where do I start at a diamond center (with a halo)? The ""halo"" is an absolute must.

Edit 2: After a long talk, she is still set on having an opal or pearl ring and absolutely does not want a diamond in the center. So, good for me in terms of price, bad in terms of longevity, I guess.

Again, thanks everyone who gave me advice. I took it all to heart. A couple people said to let them know how it resolves so I thought I would post an update (and frankly I still need a lot of advice, so that is another reason for the update!)

We talked a couple days ago. Long story short, it didn't go my way. Our conversation centered around two arguments. The first argument was the old standby about how I am not engaged and not making any effort to be. She presses me to ""drop hints"" or propose to my boyfriend myself, even when I have said repeatedly that I don't want to get married right now. I have plenty of reasons and rationales, all of which she dismisses--the fact of the matter is, I just plain don't feel like it, and neither does he. She told me that she takes it personally when I say that I don't want to get married right now. There may have been more specific details (about which of my reasons she takes offense to, exactly) but she didn't articulate them. I didn't know what to say to that. This argument actually escalated to raised voices, which is not something that has EVER happened between me and a friend, especially this one. This discussion ended with her saying ""agree to disagree"" over everything I tried to say. The reason why I am unhappy with that is that I don't think she should be disagreeing with me (and my boyfriend!) over my marital status. I tried to say so and was not acknowledged.

The second argument was about one of her bridal showers. People who read the last post will remember that I was stressed because she was being negative and complaining about the choices I gave her. She told me during this argument that she felt that because I had only given her 2 choices of dates, she was made to feel that the shower wasn't really about her. It made me sad to hear that because I do want her to feel that it is about her. The fact of the matter is, there were concrete reasons why I gave her the choices I gave her--details on request but suffice it to say, I honestly did my best. When I tried to explain my side of the story she said that we weren't going to discuss it. She repeated that over everything I tried to say.

There were a couple of moments where I felt so attacked that I needed to leave. I didn't, because I was afraid of how she would react to that, and it seemed immature. Eventually we talked about other topics. During a discussion about my relative who passed recently, I expressed guilt that I wasn't able to help out with his estate because of school commitments. She told me that I shouldn't feel bad, that I should be protecting my own emotions, and that sometimes I need to look after myself. 

This loving advice made me realize that she may be lacking insight. In both situations the central theme for me is that I am doing my best and hoping it is good enough. In the dead-relative situation, she reinforces my decision. In the shower situation, she won't hear me out and accuses me of centering the date of the shower around myself.

I'm just plain heartbroken (and honestly, a little angry, which I'm hoping will pass.) There's more to say about our argument, obviously, but I just realized that this turned into more of a standard relationship-advice post. I still think it belongs in /r/weddings because of the lack-of-insight situation surrounding her wedding that I described. Should I just let this slide because of other wedding stress that I know she must be under? Should I try to tell her how I feel at the risk of aggravating the situation so close to the showers/bachelorette/wedding itself? I truly want her to have 2 beautiful showers and an awesome wedding and I don't want to stand in her way but at the moment all the planning has me sick to my stomach because I'm so upset.

Yikes, this was even longer than the last one. Thanks in advance for any advice :)",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_1bdcbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1bdcbx/update_to_i_need_advice_about_dealing_with_my/,

Saying that, I definitely want to impress her with a nice ring. She's not expecting much, and she doesn't care how much the ring costs, as long as it's pretty. The ring in question I've been looking at is this one: http://i.imgur.com/GdY92RT.jpg.

It's 9k White Gold with a 0.20ct Diamond (Color: F, Clarity: Si1). I've seen the ring in person and it definitely looks nice, and it's definitely a flattering cut on the diamond, looks more like a 0.25/0.30ct cut than 0.20ct.

We have limited resources, but our family wanted us to have a ""real"" wedding. We agreed, but we have a very strict budget.

As well as: ""Children are a magical addition to any event, but due to venue restrictions...etc.""

A cousin, that we don't have much contact with, has added his children as two guests to their RSVP. I wouldn't be so upset, but we had to eliminate all plus ones that weren't in a serious relationship or living together. We had to eliminate guests that we both wanted to attend.

She also insisted that we find a better venue and when we said we couldn't pay for the one she had in mind she offered up the cash. 

The problem now is, the venue itself only allows an open bar (bumps up the budget) and our guest list has expanded to include all the extraneous family members my folks want (people I rarely, if ever, see). 

This is getting out of hand and we both hate the idea of our wedding now. We're thinking of bailing out and doing something else (elope much?) but if my mother can't get her $4000 back for the location I couldn't do that.

I apologize if this if the wrong place to post, but I wasn't sure where else to look.

I have a big milestone anniversary this year, and my wife and I are renewing our vows.  We would like to ask someone special to be our officiant.  

But the problem is that we are not very close to this person.  In fact, we don't even know him.  It's Bill Murray.

I know this is a long shot, so I would like to send him a very nice looking, handmade, wedding invitation-style request to join us for this special occasion.

I'm thinking something really fancy.  Multiple layers, a wax seal/stamp, the works.  Something that looks so nice, you feel obligated to at least open it even if you throw it away immediately afterwards.

The problem is that I don't know where I can find someone to make something custom like that.  Especially someone with a sense of humor.

I am willing to pay, but I am looking for someone crafty and creative.  They should also have a sense of humor, and be able to appreciate the hilarity and futility of writing to Bill Murray for something as odd as this.

If you know someone, or are that special someone who would enjoy making something like this, I would sincerely appreciate your help.  Please reply in this thread with recommendations, or feel free to PM me if this is something you could actually do yourself.

Thanks in advance!

PS - this is not a joke.  I am serious.

If you don't like to be in the picture just take the picture of the two.

Derp.

My girlfriend and I went ring shopping the other day.  We spent a few minutes browsing and the clerk was giving her different ones to try on, and all of them kind of made her go ""meh.""  Then she put on

[Option 1](http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/RobbinsBros/0379869_T?$normimg$)  
...and you should have heard her gasp.  She loved it, and absolutely started glowing.  We looked at the rest of the rings in the store, but nothing compared.  So here's the issue.  She loves this style of ring (kind of a vintage/milgrain look), but she thinks it costs too much.  So I started looking online.

Tonight I found 

[Option 2](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VDIC3xeoL._SL500_AA300_.jpg) 

on amazon, and it's half the price of Option 1.  I showed it to several friends and they all agreed that the second ring, Option 2, looks better than Option 1.

  Now the money isn't an issue for me.  I could pay cash for either and not feel a pinch, but she's a very frugal person and doesn't want us to waste money on a very expensive piece of jewelry.  Since she's the one who has to wear it every day I want to honor her wishes, and certainly won't complain about paying less.  What do you think, reddit?  Option 1 or Option 2?

If there are other options or viewpoints you'd like to contribute, I'm all ears.  Thanks everyone!

**EDIT 2**  So I'm fairly confident about option 1, after receiving input from you guys and other friends, and talking to her about it a little bit more.  I believe that I can convince her that it's ok to splurge on an engagement ring, especially since she's going to wear it forever.  A little extra money now for her long-term satisfaction is worth it.  I have also been reading that the lifetime warranty/repair/replace/trade-in/cleaning package that comes with rings from Robbins Bros is worth the extra expense of buying from a major retailer, from a frugal standpoint, so that will help me in justifying the extra expense to her.  Thank you very much for all of your input guys, and expect me to post some photos and announcements here after she says yes to the proposal!

Me and my fiance have been together for 8 years, we've been engaged for 5 of those years. We had a little boy last year and we have finally set a date! The 7th of March 2014 which will be our 9 year anniversary. All was going well, we had the funds set aside, we decided on a venue and i was enjoying planning the whole thing. 

Then when it came to the guest list it's all gone horribly wrong. I told my mom and my nan that i did not want to invite one of my male cousins to the wedding because he bullied me throughout school (he and his friends would taunt me on the walk to and from school, he spread rumors about me and he threw my coursework from the window of my form room into the rain and ruined it amongst other things) This did not go down well. My nan uninvited herself, my uncle and my other cousin if said cousin was not invited, in the heat of the moment i said fine it will save me money in the long run. My nan lives with my mom and dad and she is very good at making there lives hell if she does not get her way. She was the same with me growing up, i would always cave into her to make my parents life easier. 

Then came the argument with my mom, my nan is making life hard for her so that my mom comes to me and makes me change my mind. My mom even told me that my nan would have paid for my dress before this all went down. My mom doesn't want the hassle of the arguing and because they aren't getting their way she uninvited her and my dad. This hurt me to the core. I left their home crying and threw up once i got home. I have never been so hurt by my own parents before, as i see it they are choosing my bully of a cousin and my controlling witch of a nan over their own daughter because it's easier. 

Since that day they have mostly ignored me, they wont look me or my partner in the eye and only talk to us about our son and even that is scarce. We spoke to my parents a week later and she have said they will come to the wedding but they don't like how I've handled things so far. I have been working on letting go of what happened but it has been very hard. So i have continued to plan this wedding mostly by myself. 

Now it has come to the wedding dress. I have my maid of honor coming with me on Sunday to try on dresses for the first time and i asked my mom if she wanted to come along and she said ""no thanks"" that's all i got. Even though i was kind of expecting to get let down it still sucks. So Redditors of the wedding community i ask thee for your help and wisdom. I have only wore 3 dresses in my life time and i am at a loss for what to look for. Do i need to wear any specific underwear, is there questions i should ask? I will hopefully take pictures of what i try on and would really like some brutally honest opinions. Sorry for the lost post, feel good to vent!

His mother was going to 'give me' (not us?) $6000 for the wedding. He asked me if that sounded like it would be half, and I said I thought it might be but it's hard to tell at the very first beginning stages. My parents are dead but they left me a decent amount of money when they died, which is how I'm paying for my half. But, the thing is, I thought HE was going to pay for HIS half, but he's acting a bit of a mama's boy at the moment. He said if I needed any help to just ask his sister or his mother.

I got really turned off by the whole conversation, so he asked why and I said it was because he seemed like he wanted nothing to do with the wedding. I teased kinda passive aggressively that I should just marry his mother, so he apologized in all the wrong ways by saying “What can I do to make this easier for you? I've taken you to all the vendors you want to check out, I told you to get help from my sister. I'm supporting you on this, I really am.”

I let it go at that, with the last thing I told him being “Supporting me? Isn't this supposed to be OUR wedding?” And we smiled and he said that of course it was our wedding.

I haven't decided what to say at this point, or what is fair. I know he comes from a very traditional Italian family where the women take care of the men-- and my background was very much the husband took care of the family. So this kind of stuff is bound to come up every now and again, and yeah, I still get turned off by it and don't know how to handle it. 

We just had a discussion last week too about how he doesn't know if he wants to have kids because he doesn't want to take care of anyone. I told him he has to tell me what he wants because I really do want a family, so he finally agreed that he does want one and he was just nervous. I take that at face value.

But his whole attitude about the wedding (which he was always the first to say he wanted) is “Whatever you want as long as you take care of everything and pay whatever is left after your half.” What's fair in this situation and how should I tell him that he needs to pick up a damn oar because we're both in this boat together?

1375235441.0,18,self.wedding,1je4rc,Wedding is on Saturday and SW Oregon fire has made it impossible to have my wedding at my outside venue. Don't know what to do.,21,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1je4rc/wedding_is_on_saturday_and_sw_oregon_fire_has/,"Okay, well it's not impossible to have it outside, but... it would suck to have it outside. And that's probably what we're going to have to do.

[This is the view of the smoke at my venue and satellite pic of the fires in my area right now.](http://imgur.com/a/W41yX) It doesn't look like these will be clearing up by Saturday. I'm supposed to get married outside, at a beautiful park. But now it's unsafe to even be outside without a mask due to hazardous air quality.

I just feel so..... lost right now. All the work I've put into this wedding, it just feels like it's all going down the drain. I spent hours and hours making DIY/pinterest-y decorations and spent a lot of money on a photographer and DJ, but now it feels like those won't even matter anymore because people won't dance since the smoke makes it hard to breathe and visibility is so awful I'm worried the photographer won't get good photo ops. I mean, I know that the most important thing is that I'm getting married to the man of my dreams. We're going to go on a wonderful honeymoon (and get away from this mess!) and I know I'll be happy. But this certainly wasn't what I envisioned for my wedding day.

Right now, all the churches in town are booked. The high school I work at would have been a great back-up option for the wedding... but, they're currently a fire camp housing firefighters through at least next week. And even if we do have it inside, it's still smoky indoors (the fires started just under a week ago, and the whole town's been getting smokier every day since Saturday).

We have 160 people that were planning on coming, many from out of town. I'm worried that a lot of them won't show up now. And for people like my grandmother, who has only 40% lung capacity, it's dangerous to be outside.

Unfortunately, what I think will end up happening is we'll have the wedding at the venue as planned. People will just have to wear masks. And then I'm imaging that most people would probably leave right after dinner. I'm just so disappointed and stressed. The decorations won't be seen too well in the smoke, everything (including my wedding dress and everyone's clothing and the food and gifts!) is going to get infused with smoke. :(

When planning for an August wedding, we thought the worst of our worries would be that it was too hot outside. I never considered that we'd need an indoor backup option, because it doesn't rain in August.

I just don't know what to do right now. Help? :(

UPDATE: We got a venue indoors!!!!!!! The private school that we were hoping to get into has allowed us to hold our wedding there, inside their gym. The gym is fairly big and has super tall ceilings. It's actually not bad for a gym. We found a place that will put in a white curtain wall for only $100 to cover one end of the gym that has mats and other equipment, and that will be the backdrop for the ceremony (so it won't look like we're in a gym, thankfully!) There are 6 basketball hoops unfortunately, but two will raise up, and we've got cloth to drape over the other ones. We'll be stringing lights across the various hoops so at least it will look pretty when you look up.

It is by no means perfect, but I am SO RELIEVED that we have a venue, at least! And a plus side is, as opposed to our former venue in the park outdoors, we have REAL BATHROOMS instead of port-a-potties, and there's hardwood flooring so I can wear heels instead of the wedges I would've been wearing outside (which I didn't love so much). My dress will not get ruined by the smoke now, and the bottom of it should stay cleaner, too. I'm definitely happy and trying to look on the bright side now. It's actually a beautiful school, and I can get ready in one of the classrooms.

It's costing us more money (our old venue was free, thanks to connections), but our parents and family have pulled together to pay the bill so we can have it indoors. I'm so grateful to all of them, and so relieved. It won't be the wedding of my dreams, but we can still make it look nice, and the most important thing is we're getting married! The school is even letting us have the alcohol (which we'd already purchased) and they're letting us use the kitchen to warm up some of our food (most of the food is catered but a few things are not). The photographer is going to meet with us  and do our bride/groom photos somewhere outside (he said the lighting caused by the fire is actually really great for pictures), and then get the rest of the pics at the school (it's not the most attractive place for pics but will have to do).

My thought was to pick out a tasteful CZ ring for the actual popping of the question, with the promise to then immediately go ring shopping WITH her to pick out her actual ring. I think that going ring shopping with her beforehand takes away the surprise and some of the magic so that is off the table.

So I've been working on my July wedding for a long time (obviously!). As you all know, it's been stressful. My dad gave me about 5K and the rest has been my own money (wedding total will be about 12K). Our wedding is on a Thursday. The Saturday before is our shower. Weds of course is rehearsal/rehearsal dinner. We can't really afford our dream honeymoon so we're just going to retreat to the mountains for like 5 days. 

So here's the rub. My MIL calls my fiance and proposes a party on the Saturday after my wedding. Just his side of the family at his aunt's house. The underlying idea would be to celebrate our wedding and honor my fiance's mother (MIL is actually his stepmom, his mom died when he was about 13). Fiance's parents got married in that backyard so it would be nostalgic, etc....

I HAVE to be back at work the following Wednesday after the wedding. I made this commitment long ago and thought it through carefully because this gig will pay a lot of money (money that we desperately need after this shindig). 

My fiance is really keen on the idea. This would drastically cut short our getaway. 

My feelings: When this wedding is over, I want QUIET. I want alone time with my new husband. The absolute last thing in the world I want is to see family again for a long time. And before you judge me as a total bridezilla bitch, I GET it that having a dead mom sucks. My mom died when I was a teenager too and believe me, I have been feeling her loss terribly through this whole process, so I can surely empathize with my fiance. I can even safely say that if it were my family offering up this follow up celebration/honoring of my mom I would politely decline.

This was longer than I wanted it to be. God damn. Words of advice/comfort would be so much appreciated because I am now in full-haven't-cried-this-hard-in-years- meltdown mode.

TL;DR: Dead moms. Too much family. Also hate my MIL for planning shit around my wedding without even consulting me. 

UPDATE** I posted it in a comment, but I'll put the text here too, because what the hell?

Thank you all for the responses.

The big issue is that fiance really wanted to do this as well.

We came up with a compromise: They will try and hold it the day after the wedding. If it's the day after the wedding, then we will drop by and make an appearance before we head to the mountains. If they want to do it on Saturday or later then we won't be there.

I'm still not happy, but I can live with this compromise. 

Thank you all for your kind words. I'm feeling a lot better and ready to move on from this meltdown. ",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,1372208167.0,,,True,t3_1h0qco,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1h0qco/wedding_meltdown_after_months_of_planning_ive/,

I'm going to be asking my fantastic girlfriend to marry me relatively soon (within the next six months. I already know I want to do it, It's just a lot of logistics to get the fathers blessings and blah blah blah that's in the way at the moment.) 

So here's my question. 

My lovely lady is not Jewelry oriented. I've asked probing questions and taken her into local ring vendors and joked around to find some kind of response either way towards a specific type of ring. Nothing. No reactions for anything. I've conned her sister into doing research for me and STILL got nothing. 

So I'm going to have to do this myself, and buy a ring for her. 

I've bought her some jewelry before, All of it has been white gold with Diamonds and Sapphires (because they match her eyes) 

So what my question is... Do modern, free thinking ladies accept sapphire engagement rings if their boyfriends find big chunky diamonds to be kinda trite? Or am I better off going all traditional and stuff and just accepting that I might as well buy into the whole Diamonds are Forever thing?

First is the cost, I would imagine this would be fairly expensive. Does anyone have any details about how much this costs on average?

Secondly, we don't want the photos to be in a booth. I was thinking if we had something without a back drop, we could have the dance floor be in the background of every photo, rather than just the back wall of the booth.

I was trying to figure out if it would be possible to rig up something myself so guests could take photos of themselves and print them on the spot.

Here's the workflow in my head (haven't tested it). I'd set my macbook up, open the Photo Booth app to full screen, set to the photo strip setting. I'd then have to buy a color printer with some nice photo paper hooked up to it. (I would get a security wire so no one would be tempted to walk off with the laptop, guest nor staff). I'd then find or create an applescript that watches the photos folder, and whenever anything is added there, it would automatically print it out. I'd like to figure out how to make a template so I could create some framing and branding for the wedding so it's not just 4 plain photos.

After a few months of flip-flopping over wedding issues (couldn't pick a date, or a venue, or decide if I was wearing a dress, extremely unwilling to spend tons of money) we decided that a big wedding isn't important to either of us. So we're getting married, at my mom's house, in three months.

The tentative date is the last weekend in September. My mom's house is old (1920ish) and spacious, and parking isn't an issue. We're thinking ceremony in the flat, gigantic backyard and reception both indoors and outdoors. Maybe just setting up some tables in the yard and on the screened-in porch. But there's plenty of room inside if it gets chilly.
I have literally just started planning this- we came to all these decisions yesterday when we attended my mom's ""happy 1 year with your newly transplanted heart"" party and realized her house was perfectly able to accommodate about 50 people.

So, here we are. I want a lovely, small wedding in my mom's house. But I have ZERO idea how to handle any of it. Has anyone else done an in-home wedding? Been to one you liked? Any and all advice is welcome and EXTREMELY appreciated.

I got engaged a little over a year ago and at the time, we were still very close. It was understood that she would be my maid of honor. 

The wedding was put on hold for the past year (we weren't ready yet!) but since the beginning of this year, I've been planning my wedding. The problem is I haven't even had a real conversation with my best friend in more than half a year.  She had just gotten with a new boyfriend. I completely understand how exciting that is and I am absolutely happy for her. 

The two times I did see her, she stopped by and then left early because she had other things to do. (with bf) Again, that's fine. When I started planning wedding stuff, I'd message her to see if she was free, or wanted to catch lunch/dinner.. even go try on dresses with me. She was busy each time, and told me she'd message me when she was free. Hasn't happened yet.

I don't want my best friend to be my maid of honor anymore. 

Earlier this morning, I messaged her and asked her if she could help me with my make up for an engagement shoot in about a month. She tells me she's not that good with make up, but if I want her to, then she will. Then she finishes it off with ""I'm such a terrible maid of honor""

How do I tell her that I don't want her to be my MOH? I still want her to be a bridesmaid, but I have someone else in mind for MOH. Is it wrong to go back on a promise, even though I don't feel close to her anymore?

**TL;DR:** Promised my best friend she would be my MOH. She's pretty much disappeared out of my life over the past 8 months. How do I tell her I don't want her to be my MOH when she still assumes that she is?


**UPDATE** I sent my friend a message telling her that I had to talk to her about something. I mentioned that I wanted to ask someone else to be my MOH, that she's been helping me a lot over the past few months. That I understand she's been busy with a lot of other things so I don't want to put this on her too. That I care about her, that I'm happy for her and still want her to be in my wedding, as a bridesmaid. That I just think it makes more sense that way. And finally, that I hope she understands. 

She sent me back a message saying she feels the same way, and thanked me for understanding.

Over the years, we have been growing apart but I still thought it would be appropriate to invite her. She is a bit of a drama queen and self-centered (read: thinks she's a hotshot because she works in 'the industry' in LA and is doing this whole free-spirit, sleep around and do drugs type of lifestyle. Whatever.) I asked her and my two other high school friends to be bridesmaids during our annual holiday party, one of the very few times in the year that we all get to see each other. Somehow, after I asked and they accepted, this friend starts crying and excuses herself to the kitchen. She stays there for a while and then comes out to say goodbye to leave, and starts full-on sobbing. I have no idea why she is doing this, and bring her aside to hear her out. I guess it had something to do with her feeling left out in our group of friends and feeling like we judge her for being more... 'Liberated' than we are. 
It ruined the night. I waited for an apology that never came, and SHE actually believes that I was at fault that night. We just tried to talk it out over lunch and it went pretty badly; I feel pretty confused because she is so convinced that I'M being a horrible friend. 
My question is, how horrible is it that I want to revoke my invitation for her to be a bridesmaid? I know it will likely have lasting repercussions on our friendship, but I'm pretty tired of putting up with her childish outbursts and selfish ways. I know it's a pretty mean thing to do, but I feel at the end of my rope with her and have run out of patience.

First of all, I just really want to thank everyone who posted with help and advice after my last post. I was in a bit of a blue funk at the time, and it REALLY helped!

Basically, after talking/thinking it through a bit and deciding that we could afford to splurge a bit on the dress, I went and talked to the ladies at the dress shop. They dropped the price by $500 for me (!!!) to about $1000, so I put it on hold.

I'm now about 99% sure that I'll get [the dress](http://i.imgur.com/iOGEB4v.jpg), although I've been trying to do due diligence before committing to a dress this early by trying on a few other looks in a similar price range!

He is in the Coast Guard and I am finishing up grad school in another state. We are head over heels in love and decided that we will get married around or slightly before the time I graduate, maybe mid-July. The distance is killing us and we cannot wait to finally be able to start our lives together.  

   I have no idea where to start. We were thinking about eloping for money-saving purposes but I know a part of me will be upset if we don't have a ceremony.We aren't in the spot to pay for a wedding right now and don't feel comfortable asking for parent contributions. Him and I could probably scrounge up $3000/$4000 to have *something* but everything I have looked into is ridiculously expensive. We were looking at airbnb.com to rent a nice house somewhere for a few days and doing a small ceremony there, but even that seems like it will end up being pricey. 

   I would say we just do a courthouse wedding and do a small get together at a rental house afterwards but I really want my dad to walk me down the aisle, want to do the father-daughter dance, etc. We would wait to get married until we could afford a ceremony but we need to do it around the time of graduation for moving purposes. 

   Is $4000 too little to even bother trying to do a ceremony? What was your budget, if it was similar to mine, what did you do? My friend and I started discussing wedding planning last night and my head almost exploded. I always thought bride-to-be's were exaggerating about the stress of planning a wedding, but holy crap it's overwhelming. 

Any ideas would be super helpful. Especially details related to our budget. I believe my dad wants to buy my dress, which I am going to keep under $500, but besides that it's up to us to pay. 

Edit:  My fiancé's parents live comfortably, and would probably help with the wedding if we asked. I don't want to ask because tradition says it should be the bride's family who pays, and also because my dad can't really contribute anything. I would feel terrible if his family paid for our wedding. What is the etiquette of all of this?

What do people usually do?

Edit: This is us. I finally found a guy who I can wear heals with and not tower over (I'm 5'9)! :)

I am confused now, hoping you guys can shed some lights on me.

We have been 'together' - exclusive relationship. for over more than 10years. However we have been living apart for 99% of the time (we are talking different continent) but we do maintain daily contact, bbm, calls etc.

Now, a couple months ago we discussed to get married sometime early next year (2014) and she will move over to my place after wedding (UK). She is in Asia.

Last week she told me that she was offered a Director position in China with multiyear contract, which means that she wont be able to come to UK with me.

I proposed that we postpone the wedding. but she was furious at me for wanting to postpone. I told her that it is no use to get married and then not living together under one roof. What is marriage for if not that?

I moved across the country last August for grad school, away from all of my friends. Because of the limitations of my school schedule, we are thinking of getting married next winter - way sooner than I had originally envisioned! I'd like to get started shopping around for dresses sooner than later, since I'm super busy with school and all the ordering/alteration issues can tend to drag.

However, I never thought that I'd possibly be shopping by myself. I have no siblings; my parents live out of the country and we're not super close. My best friend growing up is currently serving in the Peace Corps in a different country. Generally, all of my good friends from home/college are in the same situation as I am - very busy and in saving-money-mode, so they can't really afford to fly down or take a weekend away from their lives, especially if they will have to do so again for the wedding. Likewise, I can't really afford the time/money to take a trip up there either, just to dress shop. My fiancé's family is great and willing to help with planning overall, but they also live across the country.

I have a few new friends in my grad school program here that I'd feel comfortable shopping with, BUT I'm not currently planning on inviting them to the wedding (possibly if space/funds allow, but won't know until much later). I don't want to be rude and have them involved in any planning, and give them the wrong impression that they'll be invited.

WHAT TO DO? :( I'm not totally against shopping by myself if I need to, but it won't be the happy experience that I was hoping to have.

**EDIT:** Thank you, thank you for all of your lovely comments and kind words! I feel so much better about my situation and am actually pretty excited now! The fiancé and I were out and about earlier today looking at venues, and since we were in the wedding mood, we impulsively stopped by two bridal salons and I tried on my first few dresses! I think I would have had a sad moment trying on my very first dress all by myself, so it totally helped that he was there for gown #1 to break the seal.

The theme was redneck, casual wear (jeans) or Camoflage attire were expected.  The Invitations included the priceless phrase ""And don't ya'll be late 'cause we a'int waitin' on yer late ass.""

The arbor had antlers from deer the bride AND the groom had killed over the years.  Decorations were empty multicolored shotgun shells with lights in them.  Orange and Hunter Green Crepe was everywhere.  All the flowers were silk bouquets the bride's mother had arranged.

The cake was camo frosted and the tiers were empty bud light 40's from the groom's stag party.  Food was from a local chicken shack (coleslaw and wings and baked beans and the like).

The Bride sewed a camo panel into her dress; the groom had a camo cumberbund, and the bridesmaids and groomsmen were, you guessed it, head to toe in hunting gear.  Including face paint.  And guns (not loaded at the bride's request).  The bride's processional was an orchestral recording of ""Freebird.""  The song they exited to was ""Highway to Hell"" by AC/DC.

Just as the wedding began, a 100+ car train rolled by (empty car noise is awful, if you've never been right next to one).  The conductor poked his head out, sternly, and gave the bride and groom a massive thumbs up, blowing his horn.  Everybody basically went nuts at this point, giggling all over the place.  

Post marriage, there were other traditions to attend to.  I have never heard the word ""a'int"" used so frequently in a speech given in public, but the best man pulled it off well.  However, there was contention over the throwing of the garter, as when the Men organized to go catch it, one smartly asked why.  On learning that the one to catch it was going to get hitched, the common reaction was, and I quote, ""F**k that!"" and the grooms went back to the beer cooler.  The Dude of Honor, as he wanted to be called, got the Groom another beer.

The ever-appropriate gift from bride to groom and vice versa were new hunting guns.  The wedding party got ammunition for theirs.  The honeymoon was likewise well timed -- the day after was the first day of deer season.  Guess where they went?

My step-father would beat my mother, then when we went to court to move in with my father she took his side. I had even asked her to leave him and we would stay but she refused (this was all when I was around 12 years old). So fast-forward a couple years and he supposedly ""changed"" even though when I would go there to visit, which was mandatory in the summer, he would cuss me and say I was a whore. This continued until I was old enough to not go. He would say horrible things to me and threaten me and she would consecutively take his side. There is so much more wrong with it but I don't want to get into it. Anyway I barely talk to her, don't visit, and pretty much ignore her and her entire life. 

My point is that my boyfriend and I have been talking about getting married more and more recently and I do not want them there. I know that people always say ""it's your wedding do what you want"" but I think it will make it so other family members won't want to go.

So I bought [this](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_Floral-Burnout-Chiffon-Gown-859695D?cm_mmc=GMCPLA-_-%20Gowns%20Under%20%24300-_-Floral%20Burnout%20Chiffon%20Gown%20Style%20859695D%2C%20Ivory%2C%206-_-6174771&amp;mr:referralID=eb81fd77-f57c-11e2-a969-001b2166c2c0) dress online from David's bridal. It's an ""online only"" style so there was no trying it on. When it arrived I thought it was pretty, and decided to keep it (there is a very short window for returns). However, the longer I had it, the more I disliked it because I thought with my body shape it left me very shapeless. I am plus sized, and I don't think the way the gown falls is very flattering (very flattering on the bust, shapeless the rest of the way, which I think makes me look like a fat rectangle). I loved it for the ""romantic"" style, but I think I just have the wrong body type for it.

So I recently bought [this](http://www.kiyonna.com/plus-size-clothing/Bridal_Boutique/19120902?green=5AF507CE-9C17-5831-946A-DBF5B1503C9D) dress from Kiyonna and I really like it. It is *way* more comfortable than any other wedding dress I've tried on, and I think it's so cute. I have always loved tea length dresses, but because of my height this dress comes down just below my knees (very similar to where it hits the model). I find the dress flattering (I have a waist again!), and pretty. I really like it. However, there is a similarly short return window for this dress, so I need to make a decision ASAP on whether or not to keep it.

The only thing stopping me from selling dress #1 (btw, anyone want a lovely size 18 chiffon dress at a great price? :P) is that I'm worried that a short, knee length dress is inappropriate. We are young, and neither of us have been married before, and I'm not sure a simple, knee length, ivory gown is appropriate for our wedding. We are having an outdoor, daytime wedding with ~100 guests (no attendants), which lends to a more casual aura, but I don't want to be too casual at my own wedding.

I will be talking to my fiance about this in general terms (i.e. not showing him the dresses), but I imagine he will simply tell me to pick the dress I love. I am asking for an honest appraisal of whether this is appropriate. 

EDIT: Here are [a few pictures of me in the dresses](http://imgur.com/a/FWveh) -- while I appreciate honesty, please be kind, it's not easy to post these. Also, obviously only good natural lighting in one of the pictures. They are both ivory (very nearly the same color).

My mother.  OH LORD MY MOTHER.

So my mom belongs to a social club/bridge club thing that women in their 60s belong to I guess.  They get together every month, celebrate birthdays, drink and cut loose.  They also invite each other to each other's weddings.  

So now we get married and, of course, my mom is inviting all her friends.  They are also footing most (not all) of the bill.  Probably 10k of a 17k affair.  They gave us the money 'no strings attached'.  This is a total of 50 guests that she is inviting to our wedding.  This accounts for 1/3 of our entire wedding.

So we say fine.  Whatever.  As long as we get our special day, you can invite your bridge club.  We go on our merry way planning our special day.

Our close friend/graphic designer/Maid of Honor creates our invitations.  They are bright/colorful and include caricatures of me and my fiance.  We send them to mom to see.  She writes back the following  (please note there is no humor in the invitations):

""You guys have done a beautiful job of organizing the wedding. It is going to be a wonderful celebration.
 
I have only one request. The invitations are great for your set of friends. My group will not get the humor. I would like to order invitations that are a little more formal for my guest list. That way you can still do the cartoons and I can have ones with a little more information on them for our guests.""

So this throws both myself and my bride to be into a tail spin of frustration, anger and resentment.

Is my mom overstepping her bounds here?  She has already invited 50 people WE DON'T KNOW to our wedding and now she wants to send them a different invitation. Well why not just have a different wedding?!

Any help with what we should do would be really great.  I'm stressed, my fiance is stressed.  I don't want to end up resenting my parents.

**Update**
Before we could even email her, mom texted me to apologize for her 'negative comments' so all is well.  I love my mom, she just gets a little worked bout about things sometimes.

Basics:
When: End of 2013/Early 2014
Where: La Jolla, CA
Budget: Would like to stay under $10k if possible, but it seems $15k is more reasonable.

I have a spreadsheet going now to start organizing things and get ballparks of costs etc including:

Ceremony Location(Cost may be included in Reception for some locations)
Reception Location - is 4 hours enough for Ceremony+Reception? ($3k?)
Dinner: Catering ($2k?
Bakery: Cake ($1k?)
Clothes: Wedding Dress, Rent Tuxes (i hear the Groom's tux rental is free if his best men rent from the place) ($1k for dress?)
Drinks: Open Bar for how long? Beer&amp;Wine only or also Hard alcohol? ($2k)
Chairs: Maybe can find on craigslist or might be included with venue
DJ: Have a few friends, maybe they can do it for $500
Band: would it be cool to have my friends band play for half hour? They are really good/professional.
Photographer: I want to put a few GO Pros through out, but also hire someone for professional pictures ($1k?)
Flowers: I was thinking maybe I could cut this down a lot getting in contact with the trader joe's flower distributor and ordering direct? ($500?)
Invitations/Thank you letters: $500?
Website: Shouldnt be more than $100

I am in my sister-in-laws wedding this coming April.  I am in it with my two other sister-in-laws (the brides sisters) and the groom's sister (problem child 1) and the groom's brother's wife (problem child 2). 

Problem child 1 wants to save money, which is understandable, we all do.  But, to the point where she is suggesting things and I am afraid she won't help with the output.  Usually to save money you have to put in more time and effort (again something we are willing to do) but this girl is a lazy brat.  She isn't even the problem though.

Problem child 2 wants the entire thing to revolve around her.  She is coming from out of state (so is one of the sisters of the bride, she isn't the only one) She wants the bachelorette party on a day no one else can manage but her and problem child 1 (On an effing Wednesday).  She is calling the bride to complain about pricing on everything and that we won't do the bachelorette party on the day she wants.  She even is expecting the bride and groom to pay for her and her husband's plane tickets!  To put this in perspective, the bride's sister is flying in from out of state as well, and she is worse off financially, but she managed to get a plane ticket! The money situation is funny to me because I am currently UNEMPLOYED and I am not complaining. 

 Then, when we suggested to have a party the weekend before and one on that Wednesday so everyone can have fun with the bride. She threatened to not leave until Thursday to come to the wedding (it's on Friday)  Which screwed the groom out of his bachelor party, his was on that Wednesday too.  Apparently this isn't shocking behavior to the grooms family, they think she is fantastic, and we are the bad guys. 

What we have done so far to keep her from dicking everyone over:
MOH (bride's sister) sent out an email to everyone saying that we should not include the bride and groom in drama involving the bachelorette and bridal shower.  We should discuss it together like ADULTS.  Talking about it with the bride only causes her undue stress. (obviously!) 
Also, we are still having a little gathering the weekend before (just myself and the bride's sisters) and not calling it a bachelorette party. That way we can all have fun not having to worry about working the next day, and the bride can have fun with us not worrying about us being stressed about being out late etc.  We are NOT telling the problem children, or even the groom for that matter, to avoid problem child 2 changing her flight plans.  We are also having a gathering on that Wednesday as the bachelorette party, but now there will not be pressure to stay anywhere and stay out all night.

As of now though, every decision leading up to the wedding is a battle with her.  Has anyone else dealt with a bridesmaid as difficult as this? How did you deal with her?

Last month I did a wedding for a couple and there were at least a dozen or so young children there.  It started out fine, but after dinner the kids became bored and cranky... and began causing trouble by doing things like fighting and hurting themselves running across the dancefloor.   I did my best to play some music that would keep them occupied but that didn't last for long. 

I'm always looking to help people along with ideas for their wedding.  and one that people seem to come up short on is what to do with the little ones at a wedding.   Things like goodie bags, glowsticks, magicians or balloon sculptors were big hits and did wonders for keeping everyone entertained. 

 I've seen some pretty good ideas out there, but I am always looking for more.   

Since I am not lucky enough to have my own children yet, it's hard for me to come up with ideas.  

I'd like to add to this blog I wrote about [Keeping Kids Busy At a Wedding](http://www.conquest-entertainment.com/keeping-the-kids-busy-at-your-wedding/).  

If you have an idea, share it here and I'd be happy to give you full credit on my site, with a link to your site if you like as sort of a guest blogger if you happen to be in the industry.

I really need some advice...",16,0,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/uyurx/whats_most_important_when_choosing_a_maid_of/,"Throwaway here. I have two friends I consider equally close. Let's call them Mary and Polly. Mary and I have been friends for YEARS, but we had a serious rough patch in college. We got through it, but the trust level in our relationship took a major hit, and I feel like our friendship is much more superficial than it was before. 

I met Polly while I was having problems with Mary. She quickly became a close friend who I could trust with just about anything. We started doing almost everything together, from classes in the morning, to work at night, to the bars on the weekends and never got sick of each other. 

Then, we all graduated. Polly ended up moving quite far away, and I went from seeing her every day to seeing her just for lunch a couple times a year. Neither of us are really ""phone people"", so we only talk once every couple of months.  Mary, on the other hand, has recently moved closer to my current city, and we've started to hang out more and more.

So here's my dilemma. Mary is the ""old friend"". Polly is the ""new"". Mary is the quiet type. She doesn't give speeches, she doesn't throw parties, and she tends to be a bit of a flake when it comes to planning things. Polly is the life of the party, and can pull together an amazing ""girl's weekend"" at the drop of a hat.  She also lives 9 hours away, and won't be able to make it for most dress fittings, DIY-decoration get-togethers, and hair/makeup trials. Mary will probably be at them all. Day of the wedding, I can easily picture Polly being on top of things; getting my bouquet, gathering everyone for photos, whipping out a safety pin when someone dress rips... But I feel like if she's given the title of maid of honor, Mary will be hurt because she'll have been the one by my side through all the planning. So what should I do?

tl;dr: Two friends, one's a planner, and more trustworthy, but the other will BE there for planning, and we have more history. What counts?",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_uyurx,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/uyurx/whats_most_important_when_choosing_a_maid_of/,

""One of my favorite things to do with you has always been to sit and look at the stars. Be it on the cottage roof, at West Hill Lake, or at your families beautiful farm, each and every time we do this I feel how much closer together it brings us. Each time I look to the stars while holding your hand, one fact runs through my mind. From the iron that courses through our veins, to the oxygen that fills our lungs, every piece of me, and every piece of you comes from those stars above us. How amazing it is to know that countless years ago the very atoms that make us both the individuals we are today were perhaps intertwined, interconnected, but most importantly...together. Now as we stand here today at our wedding, a day that recognizes the union of two becoming one, something we have both claimed to feel has become more clear than ever. From the minute I laid eyes on you, I had known you forever. From the first time I touched you, I had felt you forever. From the first time we acknowledged our love, we have loved forever. We are one. We have always, and will always be one. 

Now while everyone with us today comes from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and religions each of us have been taught the “golden rule”. Treat others as you wish to be treated. I see now more than ever that this wise saying means more to me than I had ever been aware. As such, I promise to love you in the ways that you want to be loved.  I promise to make you laugh...especially at corny jokes. I promise to share in your dreams, and help you attain each and every one. I promise to step in and help when it is needed, and to step aside when it isn't. I promise to remain faithful in the face of good times or bad, sickness or health.

1367334648.0,14,self.wedding,1dexbv,Trying to Reason with Future SIL.,16,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1dexbv/trying_to_reason_with_future_sil/,"My anxiety levels are over the top right now and I'm sorry if parts of this are out of order, but I'd appreciate any input. 

I need help on how to handle a situation with my future SIL. My fiance and I are getting married a few states away my favorite city. We chose this location because we will probably never get to live there because of it's economy, so we wanted to get married there. We are paying for 95% of the wedding out of our own pocket. We also decided early on that we do not want small children (under the age of 6) attending the ceremony because we've never been to a wedding or funeral where children don't get upset and start screaming because they have to sit still and be quiet. 

Now 99% of everyone coming is okay with this because they understand that this is the most important day in our lives, but not my future SIL. My future BIL and SIL have two children (roughly 2 and 3) and are so offended by the no child policy, that they are not coming to the wedding. This really bums me out because I grew up with FH and his brother and I would hate for him to miss his wedding since future BIL and SIL eloped and didn't tell anyone which angered the entire family because no one even knew him and his now wife were dating or that she even exited. My fiance was super bummed that he missed out on his brothers wedding.

Now we're getting close to the wedding and getting RSVP's back and future BIL and SIL declined. In all honesty, I do believe that they are trying to call our bluff by saying they won't come if the kids can't come and thinking that we will want them there bad enough and change the no-kid policy (ain't gonna happen). They even went so far as to drag my future in-laws into the whole thing. Instead of talking to us about it themselves like adults, they sent my future in-laws to try and guilt us into allowing the kids there. We tried to explain to them about how we just want peace and quiet for 30 minutes and don't want to risk a crying kid since it is being video recorded, but we didn't get that far. They cut us off after we said no and wouldn't listen to any reasoning.

So the other day I sent future SIL a very cordial text saying ""So sorry to hear you can't make it! We just wanted to make 100% sure you can't come, because our parents have more friends/family they want to invite and space is limited. Hope all is well"" (I really tried to word it as nice as I possibly could). Well, I got a text back saying that my future BIL is completely pissed at us that his children aren't welcome at the wedding and they aren't coming because they can't get the time off work blah..blah..blah. Which we know is a lie because before invites went out they told us they had taken the time off work already AND we were told by my future in-laws that it had been arranged that one of future SIL's family members was going to fly down to vacation with them the week after the wedding and watch the kids during the ceremony (which we're guessing has since changed?) and that it wouldn't be an issue if the kids couldn't come. 

Now, I haven't responded to her text. My fiance says to just let it go and that there is no point in trying to reason with her because she seems to like to start fights and bring drama into everything and is one of those people who gets offended by everything. I don't want this to start an all out war, and I want to have a relationship with my future SIL and BIL and their two children. I understand that they think immediate family children should be allowed, but the best man's daughter is like a niece to me and my godson is like a son to me, and even their parents understand about the no child policy. We aren't close with my fiance's nephews because I've never even met them and I've never met my future SIL (they lived on the other side of the country until recently) and have no idea what the children's temperament is. 

Having the children there is not going to happen. We're asking for 30 MINUTES of peace and quiet in a small chapel to say our wedding vows. Should I try and reason with future SIL and explain to them why we are not allowing small children at the ceremony or just let it go and let her think whatever she wants to think?

**tl;dr:** Future SIL is acting crazy about us not wanting small children at our wedding. Should I try and reason with her and let her know it's because we're video recording and don't want to risk any outbursts from her 2 or 3 year old, or just let it go, and let her think whatever she wants and have her hold a grudge?",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_1dexbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1dexbv/trying_to_reason_with_future_sil/,

My SO and I have been ""pre-engaged"" since Thanksgiving.  By ""pre-engaged"", I mean that we have agreed that we will be marrying each other, we've set a date, got a rough guest list, got a venue picked out (not rented or anything yet), got a fair number of details worked out, but haven't announced it yet.

We didn't want to announce due to the fact I haven't found an engagement ring I like yet.  We have taken our time because there was no rush - I'm still in grad school until December, and we aren't planning on getting married until the end of September 2014 as that will be our 6th anniversary - it happens to land on a Sunday.

But this kind of puts me in a pickle.  My sister is planning on getting married June 2014.  However, she has a lot more instability in her life than I currently do.  It's very likely that date could change.

**How on earth can I go about announcing my engagement/planning my wedding without stealing the spotlight from her?**  

How long should we wait before telling everyone we're engaged?  Is there any way that we can mitigate the possible issues that might come up due to having two weddings in three months?

I realize that perhaps the most gracious thing would be to delay to 2015, but I honestly don't want to wait that long as that would be a nearly 3 year engagement.

I'm not asking for much, but in some cases, these groomsmen live in a different time zone, which has required travel-planning. 

I've had to help them with places to find flight deals, and reserved their hotel rooms. They've booked a return flight the morning after the wedding that would require them to leave the hotel at 5am. This would be fine, except that they haven't rented a car, or booked a shuttle, or communicated in any way that they intend to exchange tickets for a later flight, so the passive onus is on me and the bride-to-be to possibly drive them back (no) or book a shuttle for $200. It's a 2-hour drive from the venue to the airport. In that specific case, the groomsman have less money to afford the costs, and one of them is unemployed. I've specifically said that exchanging tickets would be cheaper, but neither of them has said anything other than ""as long as we don't get stranded."" Thanks.

On top of that issue, there's little things causing anxiety: not everyone has gotten their suits together, no one's stepped up to give a speech at the reception (or at least told me about it, but I have asked them collectively), and I've asked one of them to volunteer with helping set up a photobooth, but no one's responded. When I call them up or send emails to get updates, the more it seems like I'm nagging. Part of why I'm in this dilemma may be because I led by trying to be as accommodating as possible, but now I need them to step up and handle themselves, their suits, and their travel plans like grown-ass adults.

I'm stressed and anxious and depressed, so I need some help in finding a rational way to be more proactive and direct, without coming off as nagging, or at least, no longer caring about nagging. Am I approaching this incorrectly? If this is just paranoia, what can I do to reassure myself?

Your care, love and wisdom, and for the everlasting memories.

Granted, I am in my last (and hardest) year of grad school, working, have 2 puppies to take care of, am working on research, and a lot of other things, I believe that the wedding planners we hired have made this SO much easier. 

Some of them are willing to work with any budget, (ours has planned as low as $5000 weddings) and they typically charge ~7% of your budget. 

They have found everything for us - the perfect venue, photographer, video, catering, etc. And since they have relationships with these companies, we get a better deal. As a couple, you are a customer once. Wedding planners are repeat customers, so to speak. They find us vendors they have worked with in the past and know they are excellent. Plus, they only show us things in our price range. 

Our wedding is this October, and everything is falling into place at a nice pace. I haven't had to worry about anything. I haven't had to find anything on my own (which maybe is the fun part for some of you, but I didn't really have the time for it). 

I am so happy. 

If you are in the Chicago area, let me give you our planners info. 

Otherwise, feel free to ask me questions about it. ",,False,self,t5_2qhtr,False,,,True,t3_ngp3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/ngp3a/how_i_feel_about_getting_a_wedding_planner/,

I'd just like to highlight some of the differences in the whole wedding process over here, mostly for interest's sake. I'm the Canadian groom.

* The wedding is western/Christian styled (although no one in attendance will be Christian), and held in a large Chapel built for the express purpose of holding weddings. It's adorned with statues of Catholic saints, and a large stained glass window depicting Adam and Eve. Someone might read a passage or two from the Bible. I'm not sure.

* The wedding ceremony will be followed by a ~2 hour reception, with food and speeches. There will be no dancing, and no band.

* Following the formal reception, the young folk among us will head to a separate venue (in this case, a nearby cafe/bar) for an after party. Another 2 hours. Here, it is more or less expected that we will play bingo. 

* Guests give us money! Not super small amounts either. Apparently we can expect upwards of $200 per guest. More from closer relatives. 

* That last point is good, because this thing is EXPENSIVE. Oh, my, god. For a wedding of about 40 guests, at our not overly priced location, we're paying $23k. This is base costs. This does not include things like wedding photos, dress rentals (the wedding dress RENTAL is another $3k), or the assumption that we'll pay half of our guest's commute costs.

* We're getting $5k from my parents, and $15k from her parents, and I have no bloody clue how much this thing is ultimately going to cost me. It's slowly driving me insane, waiting for the axe that is the bill to fall.

* We are kinda expected to invite our bosses at work, and coworkers and such. Ever if they're not friends. We've skipped this part. I'm rather glad, since if they came, they'd have to sit at the front center table during the reception, while our parents and family would sit in the far back corners. 

* I helped my bride pick out her wedding dress. I've taken pictures of her wearing it. :P

* There is a six day week of 'fortune stuff' in Japan. 1 day is lucky, 1 day is unlucky, 1 day is lucky only in the morning, 1 is lucky only in the afternoon. Wedding places offer huge discounts for weddings on that unlucky day. There was absolutely no way that she was going to go for that. The entire family would have been scandalized. Ours will be held in the morning, on that 'morning is lucky' day.

I don't mind sating anyone's curiosity if you have any questions about... anything. I'm bored at work all week. :D

One of my bridesmaids is Chinese-American.  I (along with everyone else in - and attending - my Wisconsin wedding) are as white as the new fallen snow.  A week ago, the bridesmaid contacted me and told me that her boyfriend (also Chinese) was not attending my wedding, and would not allow me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding for that matter.  

I was told that it is standard (Chinese) practice for the bride to pay for all of the bridesmaids costs, including airfare, hotel, car rental, bridesmaid dress, hair, makeup, etc.  Because I'm not doing this (for anyone in my bridal party - except for hair/makeup), he believes I'm rude and taking advantage of her.  

The bridesmaid has attempted to clue him in on how white girls do their weddings, but to no avail.

First, I'm curious if this is, in fact, a cultural thing.  I hadn't heard of this before, but it's not like I'm overly familiar with Chinese wedding practices.  

Second, should I offer to pay for her expenses?  She is in California - so the total would be about $1000.  I assume that she would do the same for me if I ultimately am in her wedding.  (FYI - I wasn't going to have her pay for my expenses if I don't cover hers.)

I want to let the girls choose their own style dresses because I want them to be comfortable and get something that they like but I am going to pick the color. I think I am going to go through Davids bridal because the girls are spread out over several different states &amp; it is hard for us to all get together. My colors are wine, olive green, and a burnt orange. It is a fall outdoor wedding that will be held in Vermont. [This](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Browse_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-Shop-By-Color?&amp;colorName=Wine) is the color that I initially picked out but there aren't many options in that color. Would it look weird if I mixed in [this](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Browse_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-Shop-By-Color?&amp;colorName=Fern) color as an option. I have not seen mismatched dresses in 2 different colors and I am having a hard time picturing it. Opinions please! Also how would I go about making sure there are an even number of each color while still letting them choose. 

Edit: So since that looks like Christmas these are the other color options... [this](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Browse_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-Shop-By-Color?&amp;colorName=Plum) and [this](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Browse_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-Shop-By-Color?&amp;colorName=Cognac)

She kept the huge beautiful house while him and my fiancés two younger siblings went to live in a house down the block with their dad. He pays HER child support, even though he has both of them. She never sees the kids. Not birthdays or Christmas or anything. In her most recent shennanigans she took too much Ambien,  climbed out of a window and went to her neighbor's house at 4am saying that "" The choir kids locked her out of her house."" the neighbor drove her to my father-in-laws house, covered in mud and crying. Last Christmas eve she left a voicemail saying that she was ""sitting with my fiance's entire family trying to figure out why he stopped talking to everyone."" the truth is she was never there, they never saw her. We were over there the next day pretty worried that we'd have to deal with her but she never showed up. Hell, there's a chance I could send her a wedding invitation and she wouldn't show up.

Where were you proposed to? Did your fiance know that it was a significant place and that was why he chose it? Or was it just a romantic spot, or even your living room couch?

I've been looking for a mother-son dance song for my upcoming wedding with little luck.

The problem is my mother and I have a somewhat...complex relationship. In fact somewhere around two thirds of my father's side of the family (They've been divorced for 20+ years) is not coming to my wedding due to her. Further complicating things is the fact that I have a step-mother who has been nothing but caring for the 24 years or so i've known her (I've chosen Simple Man - Shinedown for her dance). Never the less i do love her and she HAS been there for things no one else has. 

Please help me pick a song that reflects the unusual nature of our relationship and isn't about these perfect mothers who have always cared/done their best for their children.

I'm perfectly comfortable flying solo, or I can work alongside another photographer.

I see a lot of 'cookie cutter' photographs of weddings, that don't reflect the personality of the couple or the true feeling of the day. I don't want to do that, I want to get to know the couples I photograph and really make the finished product reflect them and their special day.
