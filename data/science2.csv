1331181811.0,34,self.science2,qmw79,The darkside of reddit's real-time social science experiment on live human subjects,44,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/science2/comments/qmw79/the_darkside_of_reddits_realtime_social_science/,"**Edit: jasonp1982's account now appears restored.  His user page no longer 404s.**

This is an interesting case study.  I think it is a sad case that everyone should be able to take a look at and see how they feel about it.  It has aspects of experimentation on human subjects that comes with no review, regulation or even code of ethics.  It is the wild west of human experimentation.

First, reddit has a thing called 'ninjabanning'.  This is a practice where either manually or automatically a user is pseudo-banned.  What this means is that the user can log in, submit links, post comments, up and downvote etc.  However, what the user does *not* know is that no one else can see these actions.  It is a sort of cruel experiment wherein subjects are placed into an everlasting timeout.  The site appears to that user to be fully functional but is actually suppressing everything that person does.

I've known this existed for a while.  However, I never got to see it fully in action before.  That was until jasonp1982 came along.  [This link](https://pay.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/qaq1u/privacy_friendly_webmail_does_it_exist/) was initially in my spam queue and I had to decide whether to kick it loose or not.  I did, because it clearly isn't spam.  After that I had to manually approve every one of this user's posts.  I thought this was odd because it hadn't happened before.  What I now know is that jasonp1982 was one of the untouchables.  He had been shadowbanned *over a year ago* for a cluster of posts that probably do qualify as spam.  However, since that time his contributions have been positive and in some cases important.  His reviews of the email providers in the thread linked above were very informative.

I'd like everyone to take a look at jasonp1982's [posting history](https://imgur.com/a/0kD6B/noscript).  You'll note that after his initial posts he has no up or downvotes on his posts.  That is because no one was seeing them right up until I manually approved the post to r/privacy.  Then of course you can see his account come alive because he has a real contribution to make.  Please note I'm not nominating him for redditor of the year, I'm just suggesting that the punishment here does not suit the crime.  Further, it just made me feel really bad to see someone trying to reach out on a social website only to be summarily ignored, systematically, by reddit.  I guess it made me a little sad even though that sounds a bit sappy, there it is.  As far as I know there is no appeal process.

If you think this sucks you can do some things.

1) I'd love some discussion of ninjabanning.  Is this good, bad, indifferent?

2) If you want to upvote this as an issue you can do it in the thread I posted in [r/reportthespammers](https://pay.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/qlu88/can_i_get_a_review_of_jasonp1982/).

3) You can PM the mods and ask them to reconsider the ban of jasonp1982 and/or stop the practice of ninjabanning.",,False,,t5_2qkkb,True,,,True,t3_qmw79,http://www.reddit.com/r/science2/comments/qmw79/the_darkside_of_reddits_realtime_social_science/,moderator

It's 90 minutes long, so no one watched it.  Not surprising.  I tried to give you guys a hand by [summarizing it](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fza09/dan_nocera_a_researcher_at_mit_presents_his/), but it seems that no one was interested.  Do yourself a favor and watch the lecture, it's a glimpse of our future.  And a bright future it is!

What they've created is a small silicon crystal with a few coatings on it that, when dropped in a glass of water and powered by nothing but sunlight, breaks down the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.  Don't believe me?  [Watch it yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3HNrAGWoAI#t=1h06m28s).

So what can you do with this?  Collect the oxygen and hydrogen, then burn them to create energy.  That's easy solar power, and you don't even need a giant power plant.  What else?  Well, the ""waste"" product from burning hydrogen gas is pure water, so if you put the crystal catalyst in a source of dirty water, collect the gas, then burn it, you've got a water treatment plant.  Or a desalinization plant, if you like.

Cheap, clean, backyard energy production?  Cheap desalinization?  Those two things will make energy wars obsolete, they'll stop wars over water before they even happen, they'll solve global warming, and they'll solve the energy crisis for the foreseeable future.  They'll also be a big step toward pulling the third world out of poverty.

Watch this lecture now so you in two years you can tell everyone you knew about artificial photosynthesis before it was cool.

(The original journal article is titled [In Situ Formation of an Oxygen-Evolving Catalyst in Neutral Water Containing Phosphate and Co^2+](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5892/1072).  I wasn't able to find it online for free.

The sampling areas and depths and scientific method is fine, it will be a simple test to just examine the volume of micro plastics and the ratio to seawater rather than the varying polymers within the water or pollutants.

what im asking is what would be the best method to separate the microplastics? Also what precautions should be made to preserve the samples before testing? Taking samples will be easily done, testing them would be problematic until i can get to the uni labs, possibly meaning samples would be left for upwards of a week before they could be worked with.
