If you write/tweak a lot of SQL -- especially *other people's* SQL -- consider tracking down a free SQL (re)formatter.  I ""inherited"" a crapton of SQL from others at my job, with some queries pushing a couple hundred lines (tons of inline views, formulas, etc).  The formatter has changed my life.

What it does is pretty simple, just parses out the code and inserts standard/proper spacing and indentation with the commas in places you desire.  You COULD do this yourself, but wow does one of these things save time.  The change in readability is amazing; makes it MUCH easier to discern WTF the query is doing.  Plus if you use it on your own SQL, it kind of shows you some good recommendations on formatting for readability.

I've been using [this one](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fsqlf/) at work, but a quick Google search will turn up others that I'm sure are just as good.

My first thought is that there are multiple joins on the same data that seem to be poorly defined, but I'm not sure my reasoning behind that is correct.

The question asked is, ""Why is this incorrect?""

My answer, ""The INNER JOINS are both trying to join the same data, and the last join does not have a type specified.""

I feel like I've missed a glaringly obvious facet of the language. Is this really just about query optimization, or is it something else?

    declare @s varchar(max)
    set @s = ''

    select @s = @s + sometable.somecolumn
    from sometable

This was massively slow for large amounts of data, so I wrote a simple User-Defined Aggregate in C# that concatentates strings using a StringBuilder.

I did some performance tests and noticed that while SQL displayed the expected O(n^2) time when repeatedly concatenating strings (due to the creation of a new string and copying the data), things got dramatically worse once the resulting string reached 500,000 chars.

Enough words, [here are the graphs](http://imgur.com/a/MRcha).

My employer currently has an unlimited Enterprise license with Quest for all of their software (which is actually quite nice), but... recent issues with Toad for Oracle and Toad for Data Analysts (not just this acquisition) have made it clear that we need other solutions.

So, what does everyone else use?

We do have some features that are ***must haves*** simply because of our daily reporting needs:

* Ability to build automated scripts to execute, export, email, etc. (#1 reason why we use TDA)

* Cross-functional ability to use with Oracle &amp; SQL Server is desired.  Note, we don't need the Heterogeneous query functionality that TDA has, as, quite frankly, it's crap and doesn't work right 99% of time (Really Quest, using MS JET as the driver?!?!)

* Large (100k+) data set support.  We regularly pull down 100k records, and have, and will again, pull 15M down.

* Relatively small memory footprint.  I develop on a crappy Dell laptop (sense a theme?!) with XP and 2GB of RAM because IT has no clue what I do and doesn't care.

The table I'm reading from contains the following columns:

Vendor Name, Receiving Period, Amount

Now the receiving period will be in the format YYMM (i.e. 1210, 1211, etc).  There is also another table I have which will have a single column with five rows; the current period date and the 4 preceding (i.e. 1211, 1210, 1209, 1208, 1207). 

What I need to do is select from the sum from the vendor table and group it on vendor name and period which is easy

    select vendorname, period, sum(amount) from vendortable group by vendorname, period

The problem is that say that for vendor ABC, there are only rows for period 1211 and 1210, I will only get results for those periods.  I need to have rows for all 5 periods corresponding to the periods in the period table (and even better, the oldest period [in this example 1207]) will be a sum of the amount for that period and all periods prior (1206, 1205, 120,etc).  It's pretty easy to sum up the oldest period and previous ones by just doing a case in my query...

    select vendorname, case when period&lt;=@oldestperiod then @oldestperiod else period end as period, sum(amount) from vendortable group by vendorname, period

I'm still just stuck on getting rows to show a 0 sum when there's no rows for a vendor and a period in that table.

I already have an answer.  This query will work:



SELECT DISTINCT cust.full_name, od1.order_price, od1.description

FROM customers cust

LEFT JOIN orders od1 ON od1.cust_id = cust.id 

WHERE order_price=

Happily, I haven't made any big mistakes while working at my job at the IT department - until today.  At my college, we have a POWERCampus/Microsoft T-SQL Server database, and since we don't have a computer science degree, the number of people willing and able to learn SQL are few and far between.  I was working on making a new applet to recalculate the GPA of students in the database, and was using a stored procedure given to us by SunGard to test it.  One of the 'features' of this stored procedure is that if you don't provide an argument, it recalculates the GPA for everyone in the database, which, as you might imagine, takes quite some time - especially when there are hundreds of thousands of students.  As I was working on testing the results of my applet against the stored procedure results, I accidentally ran this stored procedure without an argument and in the Live database.  I stopped it immediately, because I hadn't meant to do either of those things.  I looked at what records it had already processed, and was about to fix them when I remembered that this stored procedure, to save time, deletes all of the contents of the transcript GPA table before calculating individual GPAs (this was one of several reasons for rewriting the stored procedure).  Not thirty seconds later, we get an email from a student complaining that their GPA doesn't show up in their online transcript.  I tell you, people are clairvoyant when it comes to things going wrong.  

tl:dr - I deleted all the student GPA records because of a badly thought out stored procedure and a giant 'D'oh' moment on my part.",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_wdh6m,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/wdh6m/think_before_you_hit_execute/,

I've got daily data that I want to group by fortnight for summing up.

So far, I've managed to the following:

     GROUP BY DATEADD(DD, DATEDIFF(DAY, '1-Jan-2013', t1.date) / 15 * 15, '1-Jan-2013')


The problem lies in that months have a different number of days, meaning that a 15 day offset is not quite right, and as time goes on my fortnight groups go off kilter. eg:

Context: I'm using a table to, basically, fill in a template for video encoding. This table has three fields (id, attribute, and value). Profile 1 could, for example, be concerned with 5 attributes, while profile 2 uses 10 attributes -- making a hard number of JOINS (almost) an impossibility.

    SELECT [profiles.id] WHERE [attribute] = [value]
  
  Basically, the users want to see all of the profiles where profile.attr=Resolution_X has a profile.value of ""1080"", etc. Ideally they'd be able to do something along the lines of:

I'm trying to create a database of drug characteristics such as onset of action, duration, drug mechanism, side effects, indications for use, contraindications, etc. This will then be part of a searchable web database, hopefully with capability of adding additional drugs via an online form. 

For most of the characteristics, it's easy to put them as columns and then have the individual drugs as rows in a table. However, some of the characteristics, such as side effects, will be tables in their own right because for each side effect, there needs to be a description of the side effect and what to do if it occurs. 

I was initially thinking of using JOIN to link a side effects table with the medications, but I think that will make adding additional drugs harder as multiple drugs may have the same side effect.

The information for these manuals is stored in 2 tables:

manual_index, which has information about which manuals are assigned to which client, and an 'ordinal' column for what order to display them in

and

manual_content, which has a row for each page in every manual, with the manual's id (primary key from manual_index), a page index, the actual page content, and a title.

So I've made a big nasty SQL INNER JOIN query to return all the pages for just the first manual for a specific client:

SELECT CONVERT(TEXT,content),title FROM manual_content INNER JOIN manual_index ON manual_index.id=manual_content.field_id WHERE manual_index.client_id = _the client ID number_ AND manual_index.ordinal = 0 ORDER BY manual_content.page_index ASC

What's giving me trouble, however, is that manual_index.ordinal = 0 - because unfortunately the first manual's ordinal isn't _always_ 0 (look, I just work here, alright?). Is there any way to make this query do ""manual_index.ordinal = (just the lowest one)""? Or do I need to break this into two queries - one on the manual_index that JUST returns the first row ORDERed BY ordinal ASC, then run the second query off the id I get from that (which would probably work, but is using two queries for something I bet can be done with one)?

I've reduced the pagefile size to alleviate some of the sluggishness of interacting with the server via Management Studio and RDP, but at the expense of processing speed. Queries that took 10 hours bumped up to 18 hours.

We're completely virtualized.

Backend:

* VMware vSphere 5.1 U1
* NetApp FAS2240 for storage using NFS

VM:

* MS Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard (8 CPU, 32 GB RAM)
* MS SQL Server 2012 Standard
* 8 TB storage
* Databases live on SAS 15K disks, but IOPS doesn't seem to be the issue since our NetApp is hitting 96%+ cache.

Examples of resource hogs:

* CPU - spatial join of 11 million blocks' relation to nearby points of interest, chunked per state. We are using spatial indexes.

* RAM - 130 GB table (half is indexes), 196 million rows. There's a couple hundred windowing functions finding a few thousand medians.

We're about to purchase Windows Server 2012 Standard since they've increased the amount of RAM allowed. We're also about to purchase SQL Server 2012 Enterprise so we can utilize the Resource Governor. I don't think there's a way to do active/active MS SQL clustering without doing read-only databases and a lot of headaches.

Something I'll be testing with the new purchases is putting our database volumes directly on the NetApp's CIFS shares, alleviating usage of vmdk's and the 2 TB limit and removing a layer of abstraction.

Is there something better that isn't Oracle (money reasons)? Or any SQL optimization tweaks that you've come across in your travels that could possibly increase performance?

Next Wednesday I have an interview for a junior level SSRS job, and I was curious if anyone has been in my shoes with such an interview.  I will be interviewing with the project manager and a SQL developer, and this will be my first technical interview I have ever had. I nailed the phone interview (~25min conversation) with confidence and ease, and I know I'll be able to build up a personal rapport as I'm all around a great interviewee. Right now, though, I'm primarily concerned with the possible questions they may ask. 

I have over a year and a half experience in creating SSRS reports and writing complex stored procedures, and I am very confident in my skills and abilities (I have singlehandedly developed the entire report catalogue my current company uses, and it employs 200+ complex statistical and auditing reports), but I am worried that I will not be able to articulate when they ask particular questions. I am very much so a hands on person, and I know incredibly well how to DO the tasks and I can work my way around SSMS and BIDS fluently. However, I can't help but worry I'll fumble over my words and not seem as knowledgeable as I really am, or that they'll ask a very simple question and I'll just be dumbfounded while I know the intricacies when it's in front of me.

So, is there anyone out there that has interviewed for a Jr. SSRS developer position or someone versed in the interview process that can offer me some tips for the technical interview? What exactly should I expect?

Also, should I print out a few of the reports I have created and bring them to the interview as examples, or should I can that idea?

I've recently started my first SQL programming job, doing reporting with Reporting Services.

One of my first tasks has been to fix a report which has a query with approximately 10 joins, and aliases on each table. I struggled with this one for the majority of the workday today, and didn't get much closer to comprehending the query. I've tried stepping-through and paraphrasing each join, and imagining the result set at each of the joins, however once I get past four or five, I lose it. 

Surely there has to be a better way to understanding how a query works than stepping through TABLE1 INNER JOIN TABLE 2 ON TABLE1.PK= TABLE2.FK INNER JOIN TABLE3 AS TABLEX ON TABLE2.PK=TABLE3.FK INNER JOIN TABLE4 ON TABLE3.PK=TABLE4.FK etc.?

Does anyone have any advice on how to picture/comprehend the result-set (tablespace) for a larger query? How do people who write queries with ~10 joins and large numbers of aliases comprehend what they're doing?

I'm thinking it could require a higher cognitive or IQ aptitude than I possess, and that's got me a little scared.

For reference, I'm straight out of Polytech/College, and am competent with doing smaller SQL reports, but the work I'm being given feels like it's going to be very difficult for me to achieve. 

My manager's in meetings most of the day, and my collegues are all busy with their own work, I don't know who to ask for help, and feel scared to admit that I can't do this work at the moment. I've let my manager know I'm having trouble.

I know what each join is, and I can mostly understand the corporate field-naming system, so it's not specific to this workplace.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can get to grips with larger SQL queries (with subqueries), or information that could help? ",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_ei3r0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/ei3r0/new_sql_dev_struggling_with_larger_queries/,

For my job I have been assigned the task of converting a legacy program/report from SAS into our SQL Server environment. I've been successful thus far, however there is a function in SAS (mort) that will calculate a missing variable, in this case payment, if provided 3 of the 4 variables. Is there a way to accomplish this using SQL?
Below is a sample from the SAS documentation:

&gt;In the following statement, an amount of $50,000 is borrowed for 30 years at an annual interest rate of 10 percent compounded monthly. The monthly payment can be expressed as follows:
    payment=mort(50000, . , .10/12,30*12);
The value that is returned is 438.79 (rounded). The second argument has been set to missing, which indicates that the periodic payment is to be calculated. The 10 percent nominal annual rate has been converted to a monthly rate of 0.10/12. The rate is the fractional (not the percentage) interest rate per compounding period. The 30 years are converted to 360 months.

Syntax
MORT(a,**p**,r,n) - the period(.) in sas is the same as NULL.
Arguments
a=is numeric, and specifies the initial amount.
p=is numeric, and specifies the periodic payment.
r=is numeric, and specifies the periodic interest rate that is expressed as a fraction.
n=is an integer, and specifies the number of compounding periods.

Any thoughts?

My problem is the no data condition. When I run this without the GROUP BY, the COALESCE works fine and I get a single row with the zeros that I was looking for. However, when I try grouping, the COALESCE is rendered ineffectual.

The weird thing is that it works fine on both my Macs but my friend's Windows laptop stops importing after about 71.000 rows with no error messages. He wrote a different version of Java code with exactly the same result.

It turned out to be a problem with text encoding. Who knew there were different versions of Latin1? I didn't. It's all smooth sailing now that I forced Java to use the correct charset.

So this is all fine and dandy except it doesn't match my headcount of students for the fiscalyear. The reason being, that people may cross over in the age ranges during the fiscal year and is adding them to my count twice.

My challenge is that when I need to pull records over a span of time, I end up with so much information, I have to break it into several smaller data pulls. I then pivot the data out to get summary level results, copy and paste into another workbook so that it's not an enormous file.

My goal is to modify the SQL statement so that the summary level results are what is returned. Then I can just refresh my query to update my values.

Here is my current SQL statement:

SELECT TRANS.Client_ID, TRANS.Account_ID,TRANS.Post_Date,     TRANS.Transaction_Amount, ACCOUNT_SELFPAY.Assigned_Date

Perfect world, the query should return the client ID, Assigned Month, Sum of transactions that posted the same month as the assigned month, sum of transactions that posted the following month and so on for 4 months.

    USING  tableB AS b
        ON a.codeID = b.codeID AND a.docID = b.docID AND a.codeTypeID = b.codeTypeID

    WHEN MATCHED THEN
          &lt;what do I do here?  I want it to ignore/skip the record.  I don't need to update anything&gt;
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (codeID, docID, codeTypeID)
        VALUES (b.codeID, b.docID, b.codeTypeID);

My questions are:

* Is MERGE the right statement to use and if not, what is the right way of doing it?
* What should I put under the WHEN MATCHED THEN line?
* Am I able to use 3 comparisons in the ON statement?

Any help would be appreciated.  I'll be offline for an hour or two, but back on to answer additional questions afterwards.

http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do

(Intelligence Collective, O'Reilly), which talks about AI in websites, such like Products Suggestions from Amazon, Music Recomendation of Last.fm, etc. I have a strong background in Math, so I understand (and a few I already knew) examples, etc.

The book also has code implementing the algorithms, which I am doing in PHP (which I use), but they are with an array with 5 elements.

The example used is an array with critics, and the score to each movie.

Then a function (using the euclidean metric) gives a score between two persons, and with that, you can compare to everyone and then order by higher score and voilè, you got the most similar reviewer.

My question is... this example is with 5 elements in an array.

How do you implement this in MySQL?

For example, I could have the next tables:


    - Critics
    -- id
    -- person


    - Movies
    -- id
    -- title


    - Scores
    -- critic_id
    -- movie_id
    -- score

How do you involve all the euclidean logic and everything in a query? Is that possible? I know SQL, joins and everything, but I can't figure out (maybe creating functions in SQL?)

I've checked out some great posts with great information. I'm currently studying for the 70-432 and had a question regarding indexes.

The way page splitting happens as described in my self paced training kit book, is in this way:

&gt;"" ...two additional pages are allocated to the index in a process called page splitting. The existing root page is pushed down the structure to become a leaf-level page. **SQL Server takes half of the data on the index page and moves it to one of the newly allocated pages.** The other new page is allocated at the top of the index structure to become the new root page...""

Now, I'm imagining the data the index points to is sorted by the primary key. I'm also assuming that the data is ordered without any gaps (for example, let's say the primary key is the Order Number column, starting with 00001, and there are orders all the way through 50000). So if the page fills up with data being entered, sorted by the Order Number column, and the last row is Order Number 50000, then according to the above, when the page split occurs, one of the leaf-level pages will have orders 00001 - 25000, and the other will have 25001 -  50000.

So since orders are being placed sequentially, the first leaf-level page will only contain half of its quota, since more data won't be indexed there (since everything is ordered, which is how an index works, right?). The second leaf will fill up twice as fast (since it only has 25000 free spaces instead of 50000 like the original root page did) causing another page split, and so on and so forth. This seems very strange and inefficient.

Hi /sql!  I've got a horrid DB that can not be modified:

MyTable.MyField should be numeric but it is actually a varchar and it has old records with non numeric values.  Specifically, several records have a question mark in the value: Rather than '123', it will have '?123'.

Now I want to 

     SELECT MyField 
     FROM MyTable 
     WHERE MyField &gt; 10

But this will crash because of the old garbage records.  

So, is there any way to filter out the old garbage records, then run my simple query?  I tried 

    SELECT MyField 
    FROM (
        SELECT MyField 
        FROM MyTable 
        WHERE NOT (MyField LIKE '%?%')
        )  AS MyTable2
    WHERE MyField &gt; 10

But that doesn't work, it claims to be still picking up the garbage records.

MSSQL if it matters.

PS: Before you ask, the DB is full of medical records and can not be modified, so no, and I can't update the table to fix the records.  =/

Some of my thoughts are

**Pros:**

Smaller databases means smaller size and smaller Tx log

Greater Plug and Play possibilities

Lower possibility of bottlenecks as compared to a single DB structure

More work in maintaining multiple systems

Possible data and structural redundancy 

Data concurrency and integrity challenges

    process cduration and ctype in this area. the cduration is numeric and can be anything from 1 to max column size varchar(50)

Update:  Maybe it would be easier to start at the beginning. Maybe the Tables I ended up with made it harder than it is. (P.s. You guys have been very helpful and I've already learned some things even though they were not exactly helping )

**Breakdown:**

* I have a list of 10,000+ products with unique product numbers.
* Most of these comes in sets of three or four. for example: osiris a; osiris b; osiris c
* 
* There is one piece of logic built into our system where if the product type B variant is sold out, it automatically goes to product type A variant. (this is not part of the database and shouldn't be, it is done by an external system)
* 
* The main problem is that the field that drives the B to A transfer is manually entered.
* 
* The Osiris B should always go into the Osiris A but if someone misskeyed, it might roll into Hercules VA or any other product.
* 
* I thought it would be easy to run a query that listed all B products, then another query that ran the value from the field BtoA field and alligned it to the right of the B products.  This is how I ended up with Example Table1 above.  I thought it would be easy to eyeball it with columns next to each other, but there are too many records.
* 
* My next train of though was to somehow subtract one column from the other so that I only see the differences.  This would mean if the B to A was right, then I would only see the last digit most of the time.  If it was wrong, the difference column would show the long string.

Maybe there is an easier way if I modify it or run it differently from the beginning?
I thought maybe I could use the InstrRev function inside the select statement but I am completely new to this function.
[Instr Function](http://www.techonthenet.com/access/functions/string/instrrev.php)

I tried this, but it is crude and doesn't work all the time do to some variation in the fields.

        &lt;&gt;Left([TABLE1].[PRODUCTNAME],(InStrRev([TABLE1].[PRODUCTNAME],""A"")-1))

Maybe I could trim the right side of each string by a few letters then they would ""ideally"" match perfectly and I could use a not-equal-to?

1331929017.0,5,self.SQL,qzuw9,[Oracle] Query Assistance,5,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/qzuw9/oracle_query_assistance/,"I've been struggling with trying to build this report for weeks, and I'm at my wits end. Maybe what I'm trying to do isn't possible (I doubt that), or I'm just not looking at it correctly. So I'm hoping perhaps you experts here could provide a fresh set of eyes:

I have a product sales report that, among other things, returns either a 1 or 0 for each set of products on an order. At first glance, the report I originally built worked just fine, until we discovered that Wash Sales were being counted as an actual sale. A wash sale is one that happens when a customer adds another product, and during the course of that transaction, an existing product gets changed - new price point, etc. - but the existing product itself is not truly added or removed. We use product codes to for each product and price point (not my design).

This first sub-select looks for any customer orders that have a product (a customer can have more than one product per order) that has a reporting center of 1, and returns a 1 if they do, and a 0 if they don't:

    NVL((SELECT 1 FROM IDST_RATE_REPORTING_CENTER RC INNER JOIN IDST_WIP_CUST_RATE WR ON RC.ACCTCORP=WR.ACCTCORP AND RC.DRATECODE=WR.RATECD
                   WHERE RC.ACCTCORP = 99999 AND WR.HOUSE=C.HOUSE AND WR.CUST=C.CUST AND WR.WPCNT=W.WPCNT AND WR.RATESIGN IN (' ','A')
                   AND (RCTR01 IN (' 1') OR RCTR02 IN (' 1') OR RCTR03 IN (' 1') OR RCTR04 IN (' 1') OR RCTR05 IN (' 1') OR RCTR06 IN (' 1')
                    OR RCTR07 IN (' 1') OR RCTR08 IN (' 1') OR RCTR09 IN (' 1') OR RCTR10 IN (' 1') OR RCTR11 IN (' 1') OR RCTR12 IN (' 1')
                    OR RCTR13 IN (' 1') OR RCTR14 IN (' 1') OR RCTR15 IN (' 1') OR RCTR16 IN (' 1') OR RCTR17 IN (' 1') OR RCTR18 IN (' 1')
                    OR RCTR19 IN (' 1') OR RCTR20 IN (' 1'))
                   AND ROWNUM = 1), 0) AS V

The ""WR.RATESIGN IN (' ','A')"" specifically looks for the product being added. If it's being removed, it has a different sign (either a '-' or 'J' depending on the type).

The problem for this particular select is that because it's looking at products (being the only way I can make this work at the moment), for orders where a customer is swapping one type of product for another (one V for another V; both having reporting center 1), it still counts the order - but we don't want that.

If the order has a net zero change in product, then we want to return a 0, because the sales person didn't actually sell a new product.

This sub select will give a -1 for order where the product is being removed (much like the one above where it's being added) - the only difference is the WR.RATESIGN argument:

    NVL((SELECT -1 FROM IDST_RATE_REPORTING_CENTER RC INNER JOIN IDST_WIP_CUST_RATE WR ON RC.ACCTCORP=WR.ACCTCORP AND RC.DRATECODE=WR.RATECD
                       WHERE RC.ACCTCORP = 99999 AND WR.HOUSE=C.HOUSE AND WR.CUST=C.CUST AND WR.WPCNT=W.WPCNT AND WR.RATESIGN IN ('-','J')
                       AND (RCTR01 IN (' 1') OR RCTR02 IN (' 1') OR RCTR03 IN (' 1') OR RCTR04 IN (' 1') OR RCTR05 IN (' 1') OR RCTR06 IN (' 1')
                        OR RCTR07 IN (' 1') OR RCTR08 IN (' 1') OR RCTR09 IN (' 1') OR RCTR10 IN (' 1') OR RCTR11 IN (' 1') OR RCTR12 IN (' 1')
                        OR RCTR13 IN (' 1') OR RCTR14 IN (' 1') OR RCTR15 IN (' 1') OR RCTR16 IN (' 1') OR RCTR17 IN (' 1') OR RCTR18 IN (' 1')
                        OR RCTR19 IN (' 1') OR RCTR20 IN (' 1'))
                       AND ROWNUM = 1), 0) AS V

What I've been struggling to do is find a way to combine both of these so that they return a 1 when it's a true add, and a 0 when either there's no add at all, or there's an add &amp; remove (a ""wash"").

What I'm looking for is something that will look at today's date (03.02.2012, for example), and logically determine that the current fiscal month (and thus date range for the report) is 02.22.2012 - 03.21.2012.  One of the nasty caveats to this is that on 03.22.2012, the report range needs to stay 02.22.2012 - 03.21.2012, and it's not until the 23rd that it would move on to the next fiscal month.

Table is pretty straight forward:

My main question is how to do a BULK INSERT from a file containing a list of just EMAILS and specify a value for SOURCE to be populated in for the entire file - sounds simple in my head and I feel like i'm missing something from sql 101...

Furthermore and this I've found a lot more documentation on this is populating the MD5 column automatically with the MD5 version of the email address.

**UPDATE:** First thanks for the help and advice. I ended up just writing a bash file to normalize the email, convert them to MD5, add a source column and spit it all out in a nice easy to import format.

* I am trying to run a SQL query that will compare values across all subplatforms for a single value in one of the tables and if any of the values are different between the subplatforms, I want to report all the values.

For example if Platform1SubPD, Platform1SubDM, Platform14SubAB all have:

It's a fairly standard n-&gt;m relationship between products and categories. Categories have a parent_id which is the id of another category that is its parent. The parent_id is set to 0 if this is a top level category. Products can be linked to a top-level or a sub category.

I have a query that returns a list of only the categories that have products in them by doing an INNER JOIN between the tables above. However this does not return categories whose children have products, while they themselves do not. I'm sure this has been done before, how would I go about returning a list of all categories who are linked, or whose children are linked to products?

`serps` is a table of search engine rankings, basically a list of dates and ranks for a bunch of keywords.  I want to get the two *most recent* rankings - the problem being, the data is sometimes spotty, so there are missing days and such.  So this is what I came up with, and it does the job - but as expected, it's pretty slow.  It'll have more WHERE clauses on it in actual use, but...is there a better way to do this?  I could also just loop through each keyword in the code and do a quick LIMIT 2 query - would that be significantly faster or slower?

This, btw, is the EXPLAIN for the beast:

I have a table of tags that can be synonyms (children) of other tags, and I need to return tags that match a string *but* children of a tag must only be returned if the parent tag does not match the string. They also must be sorted by their frequency in another table.

Note that a tag will not be a parent and a child at the same time, there are no chains

Here is my schema:

    CREATE TABLE tag (
        tag_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        synonym INTEGER -- tag_id of the tag's parent, or NULL if no parent
    );
    CREATE TABLE image (
        image_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        -- snip
    );
    CREATE TABLE tag_mapping (
        tag_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        image_id INTEGER NOT NULL
    ) WITH OIDS;

And here is the query I've been using, it only returns one of a parent and its children, but there is no priority for the parent, and it feels really hacky:


    SELECT array_agg(t2.name), array_agg(t.name) FROM tag AS t
    INNER JOIN tag AS t2 ON t.tag_id = t2.synonym
        OR (t2.synonym ISNULL AND t.tag_id = t2.tag_id)
    INNER JOIN tag_mapping AS tm ON t.tag_id = tm.tag_id
    WHERE t2.name LIKE %s
    GROUP BY t.tag_id
    ORDER BY count(*) DESC
    LIMIT 7

Then I can get the first entry of each array to get the tag's name and its parent. It's not exactly what I want and it probably runs slower than it needs to.

Is there any way to do it in SQL entirely?

The problem is that the report only includes the states people came from. No users are from Vermont, so it's not on the list. I've been asked to include those states on the list as well, defaulted to zero, so when the report is sent out people can play with it in Excel without breaking things.

My current approach is to create (comp_states) a table with the states as one field, and a value for the count as the second.

I want to update comp_states to set each state's value to whatever that state's count is in the earlier query, and to leave the rest as zero.

If there is another, easier way to do this I would be more than happy to try that route.

I can get the values that need to stay zero to stay zero. I have a WHERE in my UPDATE looking for 'ST' in a subquery looking for distinct state values.

Hi, y'all,

I had a query running a couple of nights ago. It left-joined eight tables, unindexed. The number of rows in the tables were:

* 25.2 million
* 3,195
* 8,282
* 16.7 million
* 22.7 million
* 267 million
* 1.57 billion
* 6.3 million (this table is being left-outer-joined to most of the other ones)

This query took 3 hours and 1 minute to finish. Now, I'm running the same query, except the tables have been updated and indexed on the join keys. In the same order, the number of rows in these tables is now:

* 26.0 million
* 3,227
* 8,283
* 22.7 million
* 45.6 million
* 267 million (exactly the same as before)
* 1.57 billion (exactly the same as before)
* 12.9 million

Most of the tables have slight increases in size compared to before. One table doubled in size, but the rest are close to the same size as before. This query has been running now for almost 6 hours. Does the increase in data size justify the amount of time that it's taking? Shouldn't the indexes help with that, especially since the indexes were created on the join keys?

Thanks in advance for any help and advice!

We have a customertable which will hold a record for each of our customers we have. Our customers will be given logins to the database for their users. Users records will reside in the usertable which will have a link to customer table through a customerid

I then have a client table which holds our customer's client records. 

The problem I'm having is that I want a clientstatus table which will hold default records  such as ""live"", ""dissolved"",""prospect"" etc that are available to all our customers, but I also want to allow our customers to create their own statuses. Any status a customer creates obviously should only be available to that customer and not others.

Where I am stuck is getting my head around how to design this. The easy route would be to have a customer id in the clientstatus table and repeat the default list for all customers and then allow them to add their own into this table with their customerid assigned to their created records. I really do not want to do this however as I don't want thousands of duplicated default statuses when we should only have one list of default statuses for all our customers to reference.

I thought about having a default clientstatus table and a custom default status table and having a defaultclientstatusid and customclientstatusid in the client table and only allowing one to be filled in at once however I feel that this is messy and bad design.

That part is easy; lots of sed, grep, awk; and cron. However, I am thinking that the best way to store this data would be in a SQLite database. 

The current task I'm trying to accomplish is creating a set of information regarding tasks. It will include a task name, a resource, the schedule, the data source, and a description. I thought about just making basic multi-dimensional arrays, but I also want to link this data to a calendar on the same page, and associate it with other data for a historical system.

in my DB is a ""Trades"" Table with the following Design:

    tradeID as Int (PK / Identity Auto-Increment)
    tradeDate as datetime
    amount as numeric
    price as numeric

Calculating the SMA (Simple moving Average) for this in a view was quite simple. I used the following query in a view:

    SELECT Maxgrouping.LastTradeID, MaxGrouping.TradeDayClose, Maxgrouping.price,
    AVG(Maxgrouping.price)OVER(ORDER BY MaxGrouping.TradeDayClose ROWS 89 PRECEDING) as SMA90DayPeriod,
    AVG(Maxgrouping.price)OVER(ORDER BY MaxGrouping.TradeDayClose ROWS 29 PRECEDING) as SMA30DayPeriod
    FROM (SELECT B.LastTradeID, B.TradeDayClose, A.price

       max([date]) as TradeDayClose
       FROM dbo.trades
       GROUP BY CAST([date] as date)) as B
    ON A.tradeID = B.LastTradeID) as MaxGrouping

This gives me accurate SMA values.  Now calculating the EMA is a different ball of wax.  The method of calculating the EMA is as follows:

    Yesterday's EMA + (2/(number of periods +1)) * (Today's price - Yesterday's EMA)

To quote another post I found somewhere that discusses how to seed this EMA:


&gt;    EMAs are initially seeded with SMA, simple moving averages. This means that if you want a 9-day EMA, you have to wait 9 days until you can have a 9-day SMA, and then the next day you will calculate the EMA using yesterday's SMA.


I've been wracking my head over this for hours.  Is there a way that I can use the same view above to also add EMA30Period and EMA90Period?  Unfortunately unlike the SMA where I used a different column to average (Price), I'll instead have to reference the same column (EMA) in my aggregate.

I was hoping to do this strictly within a view, but at this point I'm open to whatever needs to be done, I guess. :)",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_1dqeid,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1dqeid/ms_sql_need_some_advice_on_calculating/,

    SELECT t1.ID, t1.Timestamp, t1.Type

    WHERE t1.OtherID = (one ID value)
    AND t1.Type = 1
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT t2.ID

        AND t2.Type = 2
        AND t2.ID = t1.ID
    )

Basically I'm querying for all occurances in a given table for a given ID, also tagged with the ""other"" ID, where there is a Type value of 1 but not another record for that ID with a Type value of 2.

The query as above (edited for clarity and paranoia) works fine as far as that goes - but I need it to do something else, which is to add a time-based bent to it - I want to get all occurances of Type 1 records where there is no Type 2 record within, say, a 10 minute span.

I've tried adding in this line, within the not-exists area:

    AND DATEDIFF(minute, t1.Timestamp, t2.Timestamp) &lt; 10

but that's not doing the trick. I'm either getting back no records, or too many records, depending on how I flip the check.

I've also spent the last good while googling around, trying to find a workable solution for comparing the datetime values from one record to the next, thinking I should query on Type IN (1,2) and go that route. Most involve simpler queries with sequential row numbers and using those values as pointers to the next/previous record - my base query is too selective to work that way.

**Edit: Resolved,** thanks to /u/Konwayz!

The trick seemed to be handling the DATEDIFF as a BETWEEN instead of less-than. Just dropping that one line from his example (see his reply below for a link) worked great in my original syntax - but his modification of my original syntax runs a bit faster than my original syntax so I'm going with that.

Sorry, I know this has most likely been covered many many times, and I know there is a ton of information out there on stuff like this (because I've actually gone through most of it). But, I'm hoping for opinions on best practices as well as practical advice.

 

The basic premise is this: I've created a database to house all our keys for software. Even though it's going to be a pretty small database, I've decided to normalize to 3NF because, while I have a bit of experience with MySQL, I am doing this project so I can learn ASP.NET and SQL Server 2012. I've also never had a database in production, I've only ever done them in undergrad classes and instances needed for things like System Center (I have more sysadmin experience than DBA).


A basic overview of my tables, and is not complete:


**Publisher**

pub_id smallint PK identity    
pub_name varchar(50)    
pub_notes varchar(255)    

**Product**

pro_id smallint PK identity    
pub_id smallint FK      
pro_name varchar(50)    
pro_notes varchar(255)    




And so on, with a few bridge entities. [Here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3554092/SoftwareKeys.sql) is a script for my ddl if anyone is actually interested.


So, I first want to create an ASP.NET ""admin"" page with a combobox for Publisher, Product, Version, etc all the way down the line so a user can enter records in with dropdown or by typing in a new name if it doesn't exist. I figured I would create that first and actually populate my database using this method since it's so small. A button would fire a stored procedure that would then insert into publisher, select identity insert into product, select identity insert into version, etc. 


I see a lot of info online to use scope_identity, but that just grabs the last entry and has shown to grab the wrong identity at times. Another method is to use an output clause, but from what I'm understanding from the documentation, you can't use that in this scenario since I have an FK constraint on my identity column.


Any and all advice would be welcome. If you made it through all this text you have my thanks.

I am a novice at writing queries as I don't have to do it very often and when I do they are very simple but after spending a few hours trying to find a solution or workaround I have decided to ask for help from the pros.  
When using GROUP BY in my queries I normally have no issues as my queries are typically very simplistic in nature…that is until I had to deal with a table that has columns with spaces.  If I run my query on the SQL server in Management Studio it works just fine but if I use SQLCMD or access the data via PHP I keep getting the error ""Each GROUP BY expression must contain at least one column that is not an outer reference.""  I read up and tried to understand what this means but since the query works in Management Studio I don’t think I am doing anything wrong in my query (Please correct me if I am!).
For example, in this query GROUP BY works just great even if I use it through SQLCMD
    
    SELECT LastTemplateUsed as NAME, COUNT(*) [COUNT]
    FROM [DATA_Reports].[dbo].[Photo]
    GROUP BY LastTemplateUsed ORDER BY COUNT DESC

But this next query gives me the error I mentioned above if I use SQLCMD or PHP but works in Management Studio:

    SELECT ‘Branch ID’ as BRANCH, COUNT(*) [COUNT]
    FROM [DATA_Reports].[dbo].[Archival]
    GROUP BY ‘Branch ID’

If I remove the GROUP BY it works but obviously not as I would like it to.  As far as I can tell the only real difference here is the quotes I have to use because of the column name.  Something just isn’t working when I try to run this query remotely through sqlcmd.  I have tried double quotes just for grins but that doesn’t help.  
This is an example of how I run sqlcmd:

    ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\binn\sqlcmd” -U username -P password -S SERVERNAME\SQLEXPRESS -i count.sql -s "",""

Here's a quick screenshot of the actual schema:

http://imgur.com/q8SOLbS

foreignKeys are implied by naming conventions in that screen cap

Now the dataset in ""runData"" contains close to 50Million rows.

When querying runData, I always have a WHERE clause that includes runId. This is because my data contains a large amount of redudancy in that column (1 unique runId per 2-5million rows).
Because of this, my original schema actually created a separate table for each runId and the runInfo table contained a field that was the table name. I refactored it to this schema because multiple tables seemed incredibly kludgy.

The problem is that some of my queries require simple search and that is incredibly painful on this table.
I'd like a way to tell MySQL that this table should be stored sorted on runId or something similar - ie tell it that this is essentially a bunch of separate tables.
I've tried adding an index (ind_on_runid) but it hasn't improved my performance much (and kinda degraded it but not by much). For example, the following query takes 47seconds with an index and 45 without:
    SELECT DISTINCT coordinateId FROM runData WHERE runData.runId=4;

What can I do? this is really multiple tables that share an identical schema, does MySQL support some kind of table partitioning based on a highly redundant column?

I need to create a pass through query in MSAccess to query data in MySQL from two data sources.

I have my ""inner-most"" query just fine, but the problems start when I attempt to nest it in a query that pulls from two data sources.  Here is what I have:

    **ON tblPM.fieldPK = x1.fieldPK);**

Bold is the outer query, regular text is the subquery.  When I execute I get a syntax error in that last bit 

    **(ON tblPM.fieldPK = x1.fieldPK);** 

but I can't figure out why.  I need to basically run the subquery and then have the outer query join that temporary table with 2 other tables to get my results.  From what I read on forums found through Googling, I think I have the nested Select statement correctly in the FROM clause, but I could be mistaken.

In addition, ""tbl2"" is on one data source and all others are on a second data source.  I know that this will be a problem even if I can get the nesting correct unless I insert an ODBC line (ODBC;DSN=xxx;Description=xxx on xxxx;UID=xxxxx;Trusted_Connection=Yes) but I don't know where to insert that command in the query, or in which query ""layer"" it should go.

Can anyone enlighten me?  I am very new to this and am learning by doing but I haven't been able to find an example of this online that has been helpful to me.  Can anyone out there help clear this up, or point me to a better source for figuring this out?

I am trying to determine what active machines started on the floor from 1999-2012.  

There are two tables. A machine table and period table. The machine table has all the information about the machines including start and enddates. However, if a machine is taken off the floor and then put on at a later date, the startdate changes.  Or if a machine is converted, the machine number changes as well and it begins a new startdate.  In order to find the physical machines you have to use the serial number rather than the machine number. 

The period table has the information for the coin-in and coin-out amounts for every time the machine was played from the very beginning. This table can be used to determine when the machine went on the floor for the first time.  But it will return numerous results for a single machine.

For example

    Select distinct(m.serialnum),m.status,p.date
        from Machine M left outer join period p on m.mnum=p.mnum
        where date between ('01-01-1999') and ('12-31-1999') and m.status='a'

that will return one machine the Sigma Derby

now when I run the query with dates between 01-01-2000 and 12-31-2000 it will return the machines that started in 2000, but will also return the Sigma Derby because it was played in 2000 as well.

Is there a way to run a query that will omit machines that had any play in 1999? Like Select machines where the date is between 01-01-2000 and 12-31-2000 but have no dates in 1999?

My company does not develop the site content, but rather develops the functional backbone for a particular kind of cross-industry website.

Strictly speaking, we don't have anyone who actually holds the title of DBA. From the clients' perspective, a handful of support team members are generally accepted to be the system administrators. We compile custom reports as needed, perform initial investigation and potential diagnosis of time-sensitive client admin issues, and are generally expected to go far beyond the duties of Level 1 support.

Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made at the upper levels of the company to remove all Support team access to all production databases, and grant production access exclusively to the developers. This has had a severely detrimental effect on Level 2 support items: Issues which would normally take less than 10 minutes now require a minimum of 24 hours as the request is rephrased for the developers, then assigned to one of the (overseas) developers. If the developer doesn't ignore instructions in the request, or overlook file attachments, it might be completed the following day. Otherwise, it's another cycle before the clarification can be sent and received.

I know this isn't normal. I know it's generally seen as the exact opposite of how things should be done. I can link my employer to hundreds of articles on the subject, hammering home the point over and over again.

* We want to track each game what the name is when we got it, etc.
* some stats about each player, name when they started playing with us, wins, etc.
* stats about individual play such as the date it occurred, how long it took, who was there, etc.


What I have come up with is workable but I think I could do better:

* A table for the player that tracks name etc.
* A table for plays that records basic info about each play
* A table for each game that has different columns based on what we are tracking. Each row in these tables corresponds to a user play a single session of a game (So the primary key of this table is a composite primary key that corresponds to the plays and players tables).

Ive got an interesting problem for you - Didnt know if i should post here or in r/boardgamedesign, but SQL seems like a handy tool for this sort of set-based problem, so that is what I have been working in.

	Africa	Europe	Australia
	Africa	North America	Europe
    Russia	Australia	Asia

1. Total deck size between 40 and 60 cards, 
2. Each card contains a distinct set of 3 continents(there are 210 distinct sets),
3. Each continent appears exactly the same amount as every other continent in the deck(so exactly 12 cards have africa, 12 cards have asia, etc),
4. All two-country pairs appear exactly the same amount of times(so only 4 cards have both Asia and Africa, only 4 cards have both North America and South America, etc)


I probably could build this out of trial and error, but I am sure there is a slick way to figure this out in SQL. 

Below is some code to start with - it simply lists all of the distinct sets of three continents:

Apologies for the long post but I want to try and give across as much info as possible. 

My SQL skills have been stretched and looking for assistance in writing an efficient SQL to extract data from a logistics/finance database. 

It's a relatively large database with thousands of financial transactions going through daily. I have been tasked to write a report that links the financial transaction back to the originating task. For example, someone receipts an asset into a store, the stock on hand is increased and a financial transaction is generated to recognize that asset. Essentially a Task creates Movements which in turn generates  Financial Transactions. 

This may sound simple, but to trace from the financial transaction to the originating task requires to go through 4 tables with varying duplication of linking fields. 

Essentially, I want to return all records in the Transactions table and only matching TASK_TYPE from the Movement_Task table where available (left outer joins) and with no duplication of records.  To get the TASK_TYPE, you must go through the Transaction_Movement and Movement table. 

I have put together some dummy data in the following spreadsheet that illustrates the content of each of the tables and the desired output:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/432284/JournalsToTask_Example.xlsx

**Transactions**

 * TRAN_ID
 * ACCOUNT
 * AMOUNT
 * ASSET

**Transactions_Movement**

 * TRAN_ID
 * MOVEMENT_ID

**Movement**

 * MOVEMENT_ID
 * TASK_ID
 * MOVEMENT_TYPE
 * MOVEMENT_QTY

**Movement_Task**

 * TASK_ID
 * TASK_TYPE

This is on DB2 database and using QMF v8 to write the SQL. 

I have tried to do this using nested IN statements with SELECT DISTINCTS, however the query runs extremely slow and generally times out.

I've read some posts and gotten some help and insight into SQL. I'm doing some extremely basic work with Oracle SQL (this is only my second assignment).

Write a script that provides all of the information in, and duplicates the formatting of, Oracle's SQL*Plus describe command. Additionally, the output should add the comments on the rows. Input: owner and table name. Output: columns for Name, Null?, Type, Comments.

I'm lost. I spent hours upon hours looking into different sites for information and I'm just lost. I emailed the Prof and he wrote back 

&gt;Have you run the describe command yet? Step 1 is to find out what it outputs. 
&gt;At an sql prompt run describe STUDENT; or whatever you have a table named.
&gt;Then start querying data dictionary views like dba_tab_columns, dba_tables, dba_col_comments, &gt;dba_tab_comments, dba_views to find out what views or tables have that information available. 
&gt;Then write one query that joins some of those views together and prompts on owner name 
&gt;and table name to allow you to lookup the information displayed in describe through a prompted query &gt;instead.

I still feel lost. This is a state school online class and my in class assets are emails with my Prof and our textbook. The text doesn't help me too much! I've searched YouTube and around the net and I am not finding much. I watched some videos and read in the book, so I get the idea that the data dictionary is metadata..about my data. Obviously I'll need a table in my database. Do I have to have data in that table to run this command as he's asking? And I'm not asking for someone to do my whole assignment, just help me along the way if possible.

I want to write a query (or a few queries) that will look at the scores students have for a given concept and then determine the grade for the concept.

The grading system works like this: each time you test on a concept, you get a score of 0 to 4.  If you do a homework assignment for that concept (and you have less than 3), then your score goes up by 1.  If you get a 4 two times in a row, then your Grade will be a 5.  Otherwise, your Grade is the best score (homework bonus included) you have gotten so far.  [If this is confusing, let me know, and I will explain better).

Thusfar, I have:


    INSERT INTO tblGrades ( StudentID, UnitConceptID, Grade )
    SELECT tblConceptChecks.StudentID, tblConceptChecks.UnitConceptID, Score+1 AS Expr1
    FROM tblConceptChecks
        INNER JOIN tblHomework ON (tblConceptChecks.StudentID=tblHomework.StudentID)
        AND (tblConceptChecks.UnitConceptID=tblHomework.UnitConceptID)
    WHERE ((tblConceptChecks.Score)&lt;3) AND ((tblHomework.Completed)=1);

This code checks if the student has a score less than 3, and if they have done the homework.  If so, they get that score +1.

The problem is that it includes every score the student has gotten, where I just want the highest score for that concept.  In the WHERE command, I tried adding in

    (tblConceptChecks.Score) = (max(tblConceptChecks.Score))

But that did not work.

Thanks in Advance for your ideas.

Update:  I can input everything (kind of) now, but to get the 5's, it is kind of ghetto.

How do you check for the most recent date (this would be a fix if I add OldScore as a field containing the last score they got)?

I have been asked to make an order number column, which will function as a means to identify the order. It consists or a location code, two digit year in which it was ordered and a five digit unique serial number. Normally I would make a computed column that would concat all of that together, using the ID column as the serial number, but they want the serial number to reset to 0 with the first order of every year. Would I use a trigger or a stored procedure for something like this? I haven't used either one yet. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_x5pl2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/x5pl2/ms_sql_question_for_generating_serial_numbers/,

Hi,

I'm running DB gathering some data (irrelevant here). There are hundreds of interactions with DB from different sources going through IIS.

One of tables stores variable A char(9), and B int plus the key, there is also a UNIQUE index on A and B pair.

Second table stores (among other things) foreign key to above table.

Each record going to second table is identified with A and B. Several records can use the same A and B variables.

Naturally I check if first table already has provided pair:

 - if not, I INSERT new pair, and get the key using OUTPUT INTO clause
 - if yes, I get the key in the SELECT statement used for above check already

Here is where the problem appears:

Every now and then, once in about 1000 records, mentioned SELECT statement returns incorrect but existing key (so not a random int).

I can't find the reason for that, and for affected records (I started logging original data for debugging) I can't reproduce the error manually (tried 10mil loop, with no errors).

Query in question is currently not run in transaction, so as to each time record is inserted to first table, SELECT statement can access it without waiting to COMMIT, as it was before.

I added workaround where key is used only when 3 SELECT statements in a row get the same result, but I still get incorrect key from time to time.

Database is run with below settings due to deadlocks we've had before:

    SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON;

    SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON;

If you have ANY idea, I'll be more than happy. If you're missing any information, please ask.

Some more detailed information (I'll use pseudocode here and there):

first table:

    
    if OBJECT_ID ('t_order_tie') is null

    CREATE TABLE t_order_tie
    (
    	id_order_tie int IDENTITY (1,1) NOT NULL,
    	order_number char (9) COLLATE SQL_Polish_CP1250_CS_AS NOT NULL,
    	order_tie int NOT NULL,
    	
    	...
    			
    	CONSTRAINT PK_t_order_tie PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (id_order_tie ASC)
    	WITH (PAD_INDEX  = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
    )
    ON [PRIMARY]
    GO

second table:

    if OBJECT_ID ('t_stc') is null

    CREATE TABLE t_stc
    (
    	id_stc int IDENTITY (1,1) NOT NULL,
    	stc char (8) COLLATE SQL_Polish_CP1250_CS_AS NOT NULL,
    	id_order_tie int NULL,
	
        ...		
	
    	CONSTRAINT PK_t_stc PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (id_stc ASC)
    	WITH (PAD_INDEX  = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
    )
    ON [PRIMARY]
    GO

procedure called by IIS for each source of incoming data (usually this one is called once every few seconds, however there are more procedures reading above data, or inserting into other tables, no other procedure inserts into t_ot which is worth noting i guess):

**1st version:**

    procedure
    (
        @stc char (8),
        @order_number char (9),
        @order_tie int,
        @some more parameters irrelevant here
    )

    declare
        @id_order_tie int

    select
        @id_order_tie = id_order_tie 
    from
        t_order_tie
    where
        order_number = @order_number 
    and order_tie = @order_tie 

    if @id_order_tie is null
        begin
            declare @idot table (id int)
            
            INSERT INTO t_order_tie
            OUTPUT inserted.id_order_tie INTO @idot
            VALUES (@order_number , @order_tie , @other columns)
            
            select @id_order_tie = id from @idot
        end

    INSERT INTO t_stc
    VALUES (@stc , @id_order_tie )

**2nd version**

I was playing around with some changes to make sure it's not because of calling outside function (originally instead of select), etc. But after that I decided to implement a workaround doublechecking the id, when data needed was already in table t_ot. This way, whenever id was already present, I checked again and used it only when it was the same twice in a row.

    procedure
    (
        @stc char (8),
        @order_number char (9),
        @order_tie int,
        @some more parameters irrelevant here
    )

    declare
        @id_order_tie int,
        @temp_id_order_tie int,
        @confirmed int

    set @confirmed = 0

    select
        @id_order_tie = id_order_tie 
    from
        t_order_tie 
    where
        order_number = @order_number 
    and order_tie = @order_tie 

    if @id_order_tie is null
        begin
            declare @idot table (id int)
            
            INSERT INTO t_order_tie 
            OUTPUT inserted.id_order_tie INTO @idot
            VALUES (@order_number , @order_tie , @other columns)
            
            select @id_order_tie = id from @idot
            
            if @id_order_tie is not null set @confirmed = 1

        end

    while @confirmed = 0

        begin
        
            select
                @temp_id_order_tie = id_order_tie 
            from
                t_order_tie 
            where
                order_number = @order_number 
            and order_tie = @order_tie 

            if @id_order_tie = @temp_id_order_tie 

                set @confirmed = 1

            else

                set @id_order_tie = @temp_id_order_tie 

        end

    INSERT INTO t_stc
    VALUES (@stc, @id_order_tie )


Unfortunately this didn't help, as I still managed to get false id. I even modified it later to continue only after getting the same id three times in a row, with the same result in the end. That is where I stopped for now. However I might not have taken into account autocommiting, and will try manual commiting later.

*Update:*

It is worth noting, that before workaround was implemented, for several (let's say 10) s having identical o_n and o_t pairs, two of them aquired correct id, while 8 got wrong id, but it was the same id for all 8 of them, and procedure was not called for all of them at the same type. This is why I think it's not random per se, erroneous yes, but not random.

After workaround, I got 2 wrong ids, both the same (different than before - very old, usually when id was returned incorrect it was quite close to correct one).

*Update:*

OK, since some of you said variables are unclear, I used real names now, wherever I could. I also pasted above original definition used to create tables.

Below are indexes definitions for 2 tables mentioned above:


    IF EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.indexes WHERE name = 'UQ_t_order_tie') drop index UQ_t_order_tie on t_order_tie
    GO

    BEGIN TRANSACTION
    GO

    CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX UQ_t_order_tie ON

    	t_order_tie (order_number ASC, order_tie ASC)
	
    WITH( STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
    GO

    ALTER TABLE t_order_tie SET (LOCK_ESCALATION = TABLE)
    GO

    COMMIT




    IF EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.indexes WHERE name = 'UQ_t_stc') drop index UQ_t_stc on t_stc
    GO

    BEGIN TRANSACTION
    GO

    CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX UQ_t_stc ON

    	t_stc (stc)
	
    WITH( STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
    GO

    ALTER TABLE t_stc SET (LOCK_ESCALATION = TABLE)
    GO

    COMMIT

    GO

    BEGIN TRANSACTION

    GO

    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_t_stc ON
    	t_stc (columnX, columnY)
    		INCLUDE (id_order_tie, columnZ)
		
    GO

    COMMIT

    GO

Ah, yes, our favorite topic - Whitespace elimination within String Concatenation - I'm at my whits end :)

Background: I use an enterprise-wide Oracle data store that is a near real-time (&lt;4 hr lag) replication of our main billing application.  I have read-only access, and some of the really weird table layouts are the due to how the  original billing application was designed, not design choices in Oracle.  I say this, because ""just change the table"" always comes up and that's not possible :)

Situation: I'm often asked for reports that include address information.  In our data store, addresses are split into discreet columns - one each for: Street/House Number, Fraction, Direction, Street Name, Apt Designation, Apartment Literal.

As is often the case, my users want that address information outputted in a format suitable for mailing, which means I need to concatenate the fields together - simple enough:

    STNUM||' '||STFRACT||' '||STDIR||' '||STNAME||' '||APT||' '||APTN

However (you knew there'd be one :)), things get... interesting, as none of these fields are ever NULL - they always have a value, either alpha/numeric or a blank space (getting the picture yet?).  This means that if, in the above example, the address doesn't have a fraction or direction, I end up with at least two extra spaces in my output - something that severely annoys my EU's, and since one of them is the boss man...

I've tried the following:

    Trim(Trim(STNUM)||' '||Trim(STFRACT)||' '||Trim(STDIR)||' '||Trim(STNAME)||' '||Trim(APT)||' '||Trim(APTN))

And:

    Trim(NVL(STNUM,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STFRACT,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STDIR,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STNAME,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(APT,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(APTN,''))

And even:

    Trim(Trim(NVL(STNUM,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STFRACT,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STDIR,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(STNAME,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(APT,''))||' '||Trim(NVL(APTN,'')))

All to no avail - I continue to get excessive whitespace in the output.

My problem is that a column named ""CurrentBalance"" has default values of ""0.00"" (decimal(10,2)), however I get value of ""NULL"" when i execute my query.
Here is my query:
select Acct as AccountNumber,(select top 1 trandate from gctran_dbfile where acct=a.acct and trantype='Redeem' order by skey desc) as LastRedeem,(select top 1 trandate from gctran_dbfile where acct=a.acct and trantype='Reload' order by skey desc) as LastReload, date_issuedc as DateIssued,a.IssueAmount - a.VoidIssueAmount as OriginalIssuanceAmount,a.NoOfSale as RedemptionTotal,a.NoOfReload as ReloadedTotal,(select top 1 CurrentBalance from gctran_dbfile where acct=a.acct and convert(int,GcTran_Dbfile.TranDate,101) &lt;= convert(int, cast('05/15/2012' as datetime),101) order by skey desc) as CurrentUnredeemedBalance from gcbal_dbfile a

**Note:** bookings are actually for `x` no. of nights, so back-to-back bookings on the same slot end and start on the same day.

Now, what I would like is a query that returns availability details for each slot between any two dates. So, if I queried say from 2011/10/01 to 2011/11/01, this is what should be returned:  

slot_ID|start_Date|end_Date

**EDIT 2:** WOW! Thanks for the terrifically detailed responses! I'll try to work through each one in turn, which may take me some time – especially for the ones referencing SQL Server, as I'm totally unfamiliar with it and I know Access doesn't support a lot of its functions.

We also had Oracle 10g as a choice but I thought it would be easier to handle migration and development with MS SQL Server.

Now IT has offered us somewhat of a quickfix solution involving MS SQL Server 2005 on VMWare. I have tried researching today and the issue is somewhat pressing.

Does any one of you have experience with this setup? Would anybody care to explain the possible setup just a bit since I honestly don't  entirely comprehend how it would function at this point.
Do I just access my database settings via VMWare player and connect it to access via ODBC like I would with other external db's?

I feel like an idiot at this point and don't want to make any stupid decisions. Any comment would be helpful.

I've only been using SQL (MySQL DB) for a little over a week so to say I'm a beginner is an understatement.  I'm doing an analysis of my company's clients and I'd like to setup a query that will only return me the name and revenue of the 25th client, the 50th client, the 100th client, and the 250th client for a weekly basis.  This is just so that I can better understand the gap in spend for my clients.  I can easily pull a list of ALL my clients by name with their revenue, then export to Excel and just hide rows 1-24, 26-49,51-99, and 101-249 but if possible id like SQL to only return me those rows in the first place.

Here's what I have so far:

    SELECT
        clients.`name`,
        sum(costs) AS revenue
    FROM
        clients ,
        rollup_order_day_costs AS r,
        orders
    WHERE
        clients.id = orders.clientid AND
        orders.id = r.order_id AND
        r.dayperiod BETWEEN TO_DAYS('2011-03-07')-TO_DAYS('1970-01-01')-1 AND  TO_DAYS('2011-03-13')-TO_DAYS('1970-01-01')-1
    GROUP BY
        clients.`name`
    ORDER BY
        revenue DESC

    Client B  |   75000
    Client C  |   50000

Then only after the designer has verified it, say the QA guy should verify it. Again the date and the person need to be recorded. Then say the release manager can verify the product only after the QA person has done so.

One way is to have a table structure like (product_id, designer_person_id, designer_verification_date, qa_person_id, qa_verification_date, release_manager_person_id, release_manager_verification_date) with all the columns with the exception of product_id set to null initially and getting filled as the workflow progresses.

Basically, when the company first started we calculated a sales rep's commission based on a set criteria. If you sold X at Y you get 10%.

Now, we want to add incentive to sell more. So, we've been doing things like:

If you sold $100k worth of products, you're commission is 12%. $101-$150k is 15% etc.

I'm thinking that I'll have to run a script every month to calculate these. The solution that I came up is to create an XML column on our SalesAssociates table called ""CommissionsLogic"". The XML would look like:

    &lt;ROOT&gt;
        &lt;Commission Lower=""0"" Upper=""100000"" Pct="".05"" /&gt;
        &lt;Commission Lower=""100001"" Upper=""150000"" Pct="".10"" /&gt;
        &lt;Commission Lower=""150001"" Upper=""200000"" Pct="".12"" /&gt;
        &lt;Commission Lower=""200000"" Upper="""" Pct="".15"" /&gt;
    &lt;/ROOT&gt;

Then, I created a SQL Function that would return the reps commission percent based on SalesAssociateID and TotalSales variables:

    SELECT  @Output = ( SELECT  D.element.value('@Pct', 'decimal(3,2)') CommissionPct
                    FROM    dbo.SalesAssociates AS sa

And, thus, I would run (or schedule) a script to update our Commissions table at the end of the month with the percentage returned from the function.

My questions are: 

* Does anyone see anything absolutely crazy about this implementation?
* Any recommendations for an alternative?
* Is there anything that I should consider doing to make improvements or to make it more scalable?

I'm brand new to this sub Reddit and relatively new to SQL as well. In the office i work in the last programer left and i no longer have anyone to ask questions regarding my musings in SQL. We use both AS400 (aka JBA aka system 21) and Oracle depending on the company we are accounting for (im an accountant). In my SQL code for JBA i have a WHERE NOT clause. In the said WHERE NOT clause I want SQL not to return a record if all of the fields are NULL. When i practice at home in Access i can accomplish this with the clause WHERE NOT ( cl1 = """" AND cl2 = """" AND cl3 = """"). In MS Access this will return a record if any of the cl fields contain non NULL data - this makes sense to me. But in AS400 to get the same results i have to use the following clause:
WHERE NOT ( cl1 = 0.00 OR cl2 = 0.00 OR cl3 = 0.00). To me the Access syntax use of AND makes sense but the AS400 use of OR instead of AND makes my mind go into a uncontrolled seizure. Why why why is the syntax so different in the so called standardized SQL. I'm just assuming there is a very good reason my companies developing a DBMS don't follow standard SQL syntax.

The field I'm trying to use the variable in is TEXT if it matters.

    DECLARE @parentID varchar(7)
    SET @parentID = (SELECT jobrun_id FROM jobrun WHERE jobrun_params LIKE '%equity_warrant_euro.dif%'
    AND jobrun_proddt = '2013-04-29' AND CAST(jobrun_stachgtm As DATE) = '2013-04-29'

    WHERE jobrun_prntid = (SELECT jobrun_id from jobrun WHERE jobrun_prntid = (
    SELECT jobrun_id from jobrun WHERE CONVERT(varchar,jobrun_params) LIKE @parentID))

I know the variable is returning the value I want, but it doesn't seem to be parsing it into the LIKE @parentID.  I've tried '@parentID' and '%@parentID%' and variations of both '%' + @parentID, etc.

Alternatively, if someone know how I can embed my SELECT statement into the LIKE clause I would do that, but it doesn't like the syntax.

UPDATE - 

So I must have been brainfarting I got it to work thanks to the help of you guys :)  But it doesn't like that I'm trying to do it as a 3rd UNION (see below).  If I run everything after **DECLARE** on it's own it's fine.  As soon as I try to run the whole thing together it craps out.

I moved the DECLARE to the beginning and did an order by jobmst_name at the end and we're all good!

Is I_PAIR1 better or is I_PAIR2 better?

I have taken over some database development duties and the previous developer has some procedures written in the style of I_PAIR1. I have attempted to follow this pattern but one of my DBA's has cautioned me against this and prefers something after the style of I_PAIR2. If the precedent has been set with I_PAIR1 would there be benefit to switch to the other style, aside from pleasing my DBA. 

It seems odd to me that using named exceptions would be bad or wrong. It also seems odd to me to try to figure out a way to avoid using standard exception handling. But, I am new to this and could be wrong.

Can anyone offer advice or an opinion on this?

tl;dr - Is it better to use standard exception handling or figure out ways to circumvent it and handle known exceptions without referencing them in the Exception block?

Good morning everyone,

I'm currently in a temporary help desk position at a educational non-profit and they are opening up a ""technical and software specialist"" position.

I'm very interested in the position. Part of the job description cites knowledge in SQL, MS Office, Crystal Reports (desirable), and ""experience in data communications and an understanding of the Internet and web-based applications are highly preferred."" I am curious as to what skills a ""junior-level SQL programmer"" should have.

All of my SQL knowledge has been text-book and online resources. I am very confident in my ability to learn any proprietary software that they may use or support. I am just a bit hesitant whether my non-professional, self-taught SQL knowledge will be enough.

Can anyone recommend some ""junior-level"" work, or even define that for me? The applications for this job are not due until September 28th, I'd like to get as much practice in as I can before any interviews. Also, if anyone could point me in the right direction on how to implement self-teaching into a resume? Forgive me if this is the wrong subreddit!

Thanks a lot everyone!

tblHumans is my 'primary' table.  I have a large query with JOINS to 5 tables other than tblHumanColors.

Part of this query I need 7 fields (1 for each day of the week).  I'm trying to return the COLORS for each HUMAN for each DAYofWEEK

So the result should look like this:

    |ResultTable
    |-------------------------------------------------------|
    | HumanID  | ColorForDay1 | ColorForDay2 | ColorForDay3 | (...through Day7)
    |-------------------------------------------------------|
    | 1        | RED          | BLUE         |              |
    | 2        | RED          |              |              |
    | 3        | YELLOW       |              | PINK         | 
    |-------------------------------------------------------|

The trick is that ***this ResultTable is just a small part of a larger table.***

I tried nesting a SELECT statement inside the larger query but I get multiple rows (I was hoping it would pass the tblHumans.HumanID into the nested Select, but no luck:

    SELECT tblHumans.AField
    , Table3.SomeOtherField
    , Table4.AnotherField
    , Table5.YetAnotherField 
    , (SELECT tblHumanColors.COLORS FROM tblHumanColors
       INNER JOIN tblHumans ON tblHumans.HumanID = tblHumanColors.HumanID
       WHERE DayofWeek = 1)
    , (SELECT TABLE2.COLORS FROM TABLE2 
       INNER JOIN tblHumans ON tblHumans.HumanID = tblHumanColors.HumanID
       WHERE DayofWeek = 2)
    ...


I tried using a variable (DECLARE &amp; SET) but I can't seem to get it to SET inside the main SELECT statement.  I guess you have to use them outside the SELECT(?)

For example, here are the two different ideas I was considering:

**Artificial Keys**

    LocationCities
        Columns
            CityID - int, unsigned, not null, auto_increment
            SubdivisionID - int, unsigned, not null

*OR*

**Natural Keys**

    LocationCities

I would like to return NULLs for the other correpsonding column, even if only one is past 90s days.  However, I do not want any return if both Column1 and Column 2 are NULL.  

I am unsure of what exactly I am returning at the moment.  Any idea in order to correct my statement above?

Figured the title was a perfect description so I used it. I unfortunately couldn't find anything there to help me despite the suggestions, at least that I could follow. I read the code that was suggested in one post there and it seemed to only work if you have a very small number of columns since it was pretty static.

Basically I'm making a Netflix-esque queue on a website. I currently have 5 columns (in an SQL table, which will soon be extended to 50 columns) in which users can add titles to their queue (which will be an interactive list where they can edit the order). My code currently first tests to see if the title has been added. If it has it gives the option to remove and if it hasn't it checks to assure the queue isn't full and then gives the option to add. If added, the code finds the first empty column in the users queue and populates it with the title. The problem I'm having is that if I have 5 columns and 1,2,4,&amp;5 are populated, a newly added title would be populated in field 3 instead of at the end. For this reason, I'd like a string of code which I could implement (the entire site is PHP and I plan to implement some jQuery) which would shift the data over so new titles will populate the end of the list instead of a random middle field.

Any suggestions on how I could do this? Or even an alternative method of storing the data which may provide a workaround?

Thanks!

EDIT: Just thought that I could do:

    if($queues[q1] = 0){UPDATE 'q1' = 'q2 IN queues WHERE ID = '$id'; UPDATE 'q2' = '0' IN queues WHERE ID = '$id';}

and do it 50 times, 1 for each column, but that seems pretty inefficient and it could possibly take up a lot of resources, especially if the user has a relatively empty queue.",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,True,,,True,t3_r4pq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/r4pq0/mysql_how_do_i_update_multiple_fields_so_empty/,

Need ideas to overcome drop table issue.,3,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/ph19t/mssql_triggers_need_ideas_to_overcome_drop_table/,"I have a problem. I work with a program that, i don't know what to call it, but has no backup system and no way to undo a deleted record. Now it's not all bad, because it is actually an enterprise level application and the only backups required are at the SQL database end and the applications save folder on the server.

One problem that we see weekly, is people constantly deleting things they shouldn't and then asking us to bring it back.... well bringing it back entails restoring a massive backup, remounting it to the program, copying the details out, dismount and remount live database then copying details back in. That is very tedious and a pain.

I've made SQL triggers on all tables that are ""INSTEAD OF DELETE"" and it takes the record from the live table and moves it to a deletion database which has the exact same tables just without data. And now I'm able to, in about 5 minutes, restore a record.

That is all fine and dandy, but now I'm running into issues when a user changes a field or adds one, the table gets modified and the schemas don't match anymore. Today, I was reading up on DDL triggers at the database level as ALTER_TABLE attempting to figure out my problem.

My real headache begins now. I've learned, that there is some SQL standard out there for modifying a large table(we're dealing with DB's 100's of GB's) that all data be moved to a temporary table, drop the live table, recreate it with the new column and then move everything back. I've learned this is done because at the enterprise level, you do not want to be editing a live table without a backup, so you move the data, make the table and make sure it went through fine then move everything back in.

Well that is causing problems, because it's deleting my triggers, and not only that but my DDL trigger doesn't work because it's not an ALTER_TABLE but rather CREATE/DROP table.

I'm at a loss of what to do now. Is it possible to have a trigger create a trigger within itself? Such as, when CREATE/DROP TABLE is fired, the DDL trigger actually recreates all table triggers to make sure all tables contain one?",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_ph19t,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/ph19t/mssql_triggers_need_ideas_to_overcome_drop_table/,

This is not homework!

At my company, we have software that's used to manage &amp; monitor optical networking switches. One of the software devs for it has been learning SQL/MySQL and came to me with this problem to get my input (I was not helpful):

So, we have two tables:

**monitorings**

mid, far_sid, near_sid, stamp

**switches**

sid, name

Now, the idea with this is the monitorings table houses monitoring transactions - when two switches make a connection, the row is saved in the table with the near_sid being one switch, and the far_sid being another switch. These two fields are populated using the sid field from the switches table. These two fields can either have different sid's or the same sid.

What the software dev wanted was to return the *names* of the switches for the near_sid and far_sid fields, even if they are the same, as well as the stamp field from the monitorings table. 

Many attempts to do sub-queries and joins have fallen flat. The developer I think came up with a workaround (involving another table), but for me, I was curious to see if this could be output with one statement.

Here is the query I need help fixing:


select r.remittance_id, r.remittance_type_cd , r.remittance_sequence_no,r.COLLECTED_AMT, r.paid_dt  
, rh.responsibility_centre_cd, rh.EFFECTIVE_DTTM

and rh.REMITTANCE_SEQUENCE_NO = r.REMITTANCE_SEQUENCE_NO

and r.REMITTANCE_STATUS_CD = 11


Additional Info: remittance_id, remittance_type_cd, and remittance_sequence_no are three fields that make up a unique id for a receipt
-	The Remittance table only has one record for each receipt.  The Remittance History table has multiple records for each receipt, because it tracks each time the receipt is changed.  I.e. the receipt is entered into the system = entry into Remittance History table with date timestamp in EFFECTIVE_DTTM.  Then that same receipt is set to a Status of Reserved (11) = another Remittance History Entry

Table furniture_sets

Table components

It produces a result set like the following.

HeaderID | Username | Question | Answer
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
123  |  user1  |   date? | $2010-18-11
123  |  user1  |   name? | $user one

Now what I want to do is append each row with the date. No hassle with the first row, just do a self join. Is there any way I can do the same again on the subsequent rows that have the same HeaderID but don't have a date in the answer field?

To give an idea of the (bad) design, the header/username are coming from one table, the question is coming from one table and the answer is coming from one table. Header and answer are linked by ID and question and answer are also linked by an identity on the question table. Here's what the query looks like so far.

    SELECT h.ID, h.Username, q.QuestionText, a.Answer
    FROM tblHeader h
    INNER JOIN tblAnswer a on h.ID = a.HeaderID
    INNER JOIN tblQuestion q on q.ID = a.QuestionID

I think it might be easier to just go ahead and use a temporary table and work on that but I'd like some second opinions first. Any ideas?

edit: damn table formatting got me.

edit 2: thanks to shaara for suggesting this query

    SELECT h.ID, h.Username, q.QuestionText, a.Answer, foo.MyDate
    FROM tblHeader h
    INNER JOIN tblAnswer a on h.ID = a.HeaderID

It is giving me an error of ""subquery contains more than 1 row"" - which is true, ms.trig does contain some 4922 rows.  I was hoping that it would make 4922 'when em like [row] then 1' statements so I didn't have to, but it doesn't like that apparently.

Could anyone give any insight onto how I could make this work?

Further, once that gets figured out, I'm on to try to figure out how to score them.  Each row in ms.trig has a score associated to it, and I want to add up all of the scores of matches and sum them together. So if ms.trig contains

abc, -5
def, -8

and it is matching on something that is abcldef, it would report score as -13.",,False,self,t5_2qp8q,False,,,True,t3_1kqedw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1kqedw/mysql_concat_and_case_are_not_working_together/,

I have a SQL database that stores transactions for a loan company, I need to write a query that calculates the current amount due, and separates that out into fees due, interest due, and principle due. The database contains each transaction labelled as either a payment, principle, or fee. See below for an example. The interest is not stored in the database but can be calculated each principle payment by principle amount * .05 * daysBetween, where daysBetween is the number of days since the last principle type.

So now the hard part, I can easily calculate a running total of all the fields and get the amounts, and subtract the payments, however these are current loans that are still racking up interest, fees, etc. We need to see a ""picture"" of the loan in it's current state. So each payment that comes in gets applied first to whatever fees there are, then to the interest, and then to whatever principle there is. This means I can't just add them all up and subtract, I need to do it row by row.

Anyone have any ideas? I'm totally stuck, I've had this on my plate for two weeks now luckily there's no specific due date but I need to get it done sooner than later. ""It's not possible"" is an answer my boss will accept as long as I can explain why it's not possible with the database as it currently is.

So, I'm a desktop tech working for a healthcare provider in Australia and I've started coding solutions to manage our cataclysmic software situation (not really sure what software is on what pc's).

I've modified an audit tool that used to write all our stuff out to a CSV file and now its writing to a MSSQL database.  Now, what I'm trying to do, is write all the information of whats in a pc's add/remove list to a table in a database so we can query it at a later date.

So, when this is finished, it will look like this

Database: db_softwareaudit
Tables:

PC22222222
PC33333333
PC44444444

So, ideally, we'd have a master table that would contain all the distinct software names in it (And would get updated nightly via scheduled task), and then when the user goes to a asp net web page, selects the software from a web page, a SQL operation will happen that will find how many PC's that piece of software is installed on, as well as their asset numbers etc.

1373229987.0,1,self.SQL,1htjy4,[MySQL] Looking for some help with joined table inheritance and 'unknown' types / discriminator,1,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1htjy4/mysql_looking_for_some_help_with_joined_table/,"Hi, little warning I'm not the most proficient at SQL but I'm getting my feet very wet with it on a project at the moment. So if anything I've put / any explanations are a bit off if you point it out I'll try and explain further :)

So I can't divulge the exact details due to the project, but I'll give some more generic examples. I have a 'container' of sorts. The container will hold many items, all of these items inherit from a common 'item' entity. For this I'll say they're items of different media types - audio_item, image_item, video_item and so on. In terms of the inheritance I'm going to (or want) to use joined table / table per class inheritance. Like that of the Hibernate ORM for Java or SQL Alchemy for Python (http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/inheritance.html). I understand how this works on it's own, and would want to store a 'type' in the base class table and map it's ID to the ID within the sub class tables (with a foreign key also) and perform a join to get the necessary data. I understand how the queries would work etc, that is until I need to get all of the items belonging to a 'container'. Reason being it can hold lots of items, all of varying types, at the time of the query I need to know how I can dynamically handle the type - or if this is even possible at all. 

I.e. one of the common examples is the 'employee' base and 'managers' or 'worker' sub types. Getting all managers or workers is nice and easy as you have the table name to join to within the join operation. But I won't know what table name I'm joining on (LEFT OUTER JOIN &lt;type&gt;) other than type coming from the base tables type column. Can I use this result in the query somehow? But, even then, the different types are going to have different properties / columns that I need to query. 

So could someone tell me how to do this? Or if I'm just pursuing it wrong / overcomplicating / undercomplicating / being stupid point me in the right direction?

I have a medical record system that links to patient documents and has an identifier for each data point for the patient document all stored in different tables.  I want to link them to make a table for each patient of all their documents.  Each document is listed more than once to give the different variables related to it, but not all of these listings have an attached patient (it simply lists the document ID)

I'll simplify to the example:

I've created this table by using multiple inner joins:

DocumentID------Patient -------- DocumentField-------Data------ImageType

1 ----------------- Smith--------MedicalRecord--------223-------- Photo

1 ----------------- NULL -------- Date of Service --------1/23/12 -------- Photo

1 ----------------- NULL-------- InsuranceType -----------2 -------- Photo

2 ----------------- Johnson-------- MedicalRecord --------239  -------- HistoryForm

2 ----------------- NULL--------Date of Service--------4/11/13 -------- HistoryForm

2 ----------------- NULL -------- InsuranceType ------  2  -------- HistoryForm

3 ----------------- Davis -------- MedicalRecord ------ 837  -------- HIPPA

3 ----------------- NULL-------- Date of Service ------ 2/13/12--------HIPPA

3 ----------------- NULL --------  InsuranceType ------  2 -------- HIPPA

I want to have a table that lists:

DocumentID    --------   Patient      --------     DocumentField    --------   Data   --------    ImageType

1  ----------------  Smith  --------  Date of Service--------  1/23/12 --------   Photo

2  ---------------  Johnson  --------  Date of Service   --------4/11/13  --------  HistoryForm

3 ----------------- Davis --------   Date of Service -------- 2/13/12  -------- HIPPA

AND then I want to be able to filter it down by individual patients.  The reason I can't do that now is as you can see in my first table, not every incident lists the patient name (NULL in some slots).  The documentID is listed to link to all the other data but only one instance uses the patient name to link to the document ID.   When I filter down by patient name, I lose the date of service rows which is the one I want to keep.

But.. how do I bring this data into the 2NF or 3NF - into the format I designed before? Are there any tools that can help me do that? In other words: How do I import this unnormalized data into my normalized database?

We currently have a SQL cluster in a physical environment, running on Server 2003 SP 2 Enterprise. We are currently 95+% virtual, with only fax server and this cluster still physical. We want to break them out into stand-alone servers, to better manage. We currently have one node controlling the file aspect, and another node controlling the database. From what I gather, typically both nodes usually share these roles, ours do not. We need to have them retain the same server names (if it is possible) to minimize impact to the rest of the environment. 

What is the best way of going about breaking them out? Should we build whole new servers, transferring the database and files? Or should we just break the cluster? Ultimately, we want to virtualize these servers. 

I have done some googling, and came up with these articles; but would the SQL jobs transfer over as well, or just the database? We also use SQL Integration Services, would those jobs transfer as well?

I'm not asking you to do my schoolwork or anything, and google has not been much help.

I am working with a turnkey solution where the schema is what it is.  I have also changed the actual table and column names to make it more readable.

In the case I am working with, there is a main table in it that has a key to another table where the column names in that table are just an id and ""value1"", ""value2"", ""value3""...  Then there is a 3rd table that consists of what each column represents.

    MAINDATA
    	MAINID
    	USERNAME
    	METARECORDID
    METAATTRIBUTESRECORD
    	METARECORDID
    	VALUE14 (i.e. ""42101"")
    	VALUE20 (i.e. ""XYZ123"")
    METAATTRIBUTEDEFINITION
    	NAME (i.e. ""Zip Code"" or ""License Plate"")
    	COLUMNID (i.e. ""14"" or ""20"")
    
So, for instance.  If I wanted to get all of the rows that had a zip code of 42101, I would first have to select columnid from METAATTRIBUTEDEFINITION where name = ""Zip Code"" and then use that columnid to select * from METAATTRIBUTESRECORD where value$columnid = '42101'.

This could be achieved programmatically, but this is where my SQL ignorance begins.  The whole program must be defined as part of a SP, so a programming language I am more familiar with is not available.  How would I put the column name I need into a variable?  Or can all of this be done in the context of one query inside the SP?

MS SQL 2008 R2
Our existing solution involves a single large (1 TB) database table that we are replicating to a local subscriber database for use with the web service.
We are currently using MSSQL Transactional replication with a simple row filter that only replicates rows based on a certain column. (only pull records that are linked to certain companies)

The problem is that we have a new need to be able to change the list of companies dynamically, and still maintain realtime replication without needing to manually change the filter and create a new snapshot. 

Is there an elegant database replication/caching solution that we can use that can replicate data on demand, and then continue to replicate records pertaining to that filter in the future.

So for example

    A request is made to check the data of company A. 
    Company A is in list and is kept locally in the subscriber database, so data is pulled from the subscriber  database.
    A request is made for company D, but D's data is not in the subscriber database.
    Company D is added to the row filter and replicated to the database subscriber.  
    Company D is added to the row filter list.
    Company D's data will continue to be replicated to the subscriber database for any future calls.


All of this logic would have to originate and be controlled by the subscriber side, as we have no control over what happens on the publisher.

1363884684.0,1,self.SQL,1aqoru,[MySQL] Basic database design questions,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1aqoru/mysql_basic_database_design_questions/,"I'm currently in an introductory MySQL database programming course and we have a course project in which we need to design a database for a small business.  The business rents out party supplies to local businesses as well as individual local clients.  

I'm having a couple of issues with my database structure that I was hoping some of you could help me with.  I'd like to add that we have not yet discussed creating functions, triggers, procedures, or loops.  We just recently went over normalization and basics of DB design.  We are only required to design our DB up to the third normal form. 

One of the requirements is that we must store how the customer paid, when they paid, and if paid by check, whether or not the check bounced.  Here is where I'm starting to get a bit lost.  [This](http://arexius.com/favorites/structure.jpg) is how my table structure currently looks.  As you can see my payments table contains a ""check_bounced"" boolean.  Regardless of whether someone pays using a check or not, it will still store a value for whether or not the payment check bounced.  I considered making a table to specifically store which payment_id's bounced like so:

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bounced_checks
    (
    payment_id    INT,

    CONSTRAINT bounced_checks_fk_payments
        FOREIGN KEY (payment_id)
        REFERENCES payments (payment_id)
    );

It seems a bit odd to only store one INT on a table and not have anything in it but a foreign key.  Would this be a more efficient way of doing it, and if not, can anyone suggest another solution?


The other issue I've come across is I'm not sure where the most efficient place to store my invoice_total would be.  Either way it will have to be calculated based on how many items are being rented, how long, at what cost, and if returned late i'll have to account for that as well.  I'm assuming I'll use a procedure for the calculations, although I'm not sure yet.  Here's a sample of how the system works based on the [current database structure](http://arexius.com/favorites/structure.jpg):

    INSERT INTO general_invoices VALUES (DEFAULT, 1, '2013-03-10', DEFAULT);
    INSERT INTO invoice_item_rental VALUES (DEFAULT, 1, 6, 3, 1, '2013-03-11', '2013-03-15', DEFAULT);
    UPDATE inventory SET item_quantity_out=(item_quantity_out+3) WHERE item_id=6;
    UPDATE inventory SET item_cumulative_rentals=(item_quantity_out+3) WHERE item_id=6;
    UPDATE general_invoices 
    SET invoice_total = invoice_total +
    (
    (SELECT item_quantity*(rental_return-rental_pickup) FROM invoice_item_rental WHERE invoice_item_id=1)
    *
    (SELECT item_cost FROM inventory WHERE item_id=6)
    )
    WHERE invoice_id=1;

That would create the general_invoice, create an invoice_item_rental record that links to the general_invoice_id, then calculate the total from inventory-&gt;invoice_item_rental-&gt;general_invoice and update the invoice_total record stored there.  Is this an efficient method of calculating and storing the totals?

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks in advance for anyone who is willing to help me out.

Beforehand, thanks for the help. 

I've got a spreadsheet that has a query that pulls the invoice amount from a table. This is DBO.a_invoice.totalship_amount

In another table, I have the sales tax amounts. This is DBO.a_acct_trans.cr_amount.

The connection between the two tables is between:

DBO.a_invoice.invoice_number

and

DBO.a_acct_trans.main_key

Where the main_key contains the invoice number the transaction relates to.

So in the query, which I'm just editing an existing quiery, I need to connect the key in the two tables and then select the totalship_amount, but substract the cr_amount if the keys match.

So far, I have:

INNER JOIN DBO.a_acct_trans ON DBO.a_invoice.invoice_number = DBO.a_acct_trans.main_key

SELECT DBO.a_invoice.totalship_amount - DBO.a_acct_trans.cr_amount

But I'm getting an error saying I have a syntax error near ""FROM"" and near ""DBO""

Any way you guys can hep? Thanks again.

2      2  
3      3

Also I want to be clear I'm not asking for an answer as such but just any pointers in the right direction, I understand I've got to do and learn the work, but google renders nothing to help after several hours searching (maybe I'm typing the wrong kind of query?). Nonetheless:

The table I'm responsible for has to keep a record of meetings for clients who will be inserting values into it. 

Meetings cannot be scheduled at the same time. 

With relevance to time, the table has a meeting date (DATE), time start and time end of meeting (both 4 numerics; the first two representing hours and the second two representing minutes). We are not allowed to introduce new entities.

If say for example the table had...

m_date: 05/05/2013 
s_time: 1300
e_time: 1500

...noone should be able to enter a meeting which would start or end between 1300 and 1500 on 05/05/2013.

If anyone had any ideas as to how this could be done I would be very grateful. My pseudo code-esque solution for a table constraint was:

    IF entered_m_date = col_m_date THEN
         CHECK((entered_e_time &lt; col_s_time) OR (entered_s_time &gt; col_e_time))
    END IF

I understand this probably makes very little sense, I'm not even sure if you can put an If statement into a constraint, nor am I aware as to how you can reference one specific row of data and compare that against the entered data.

It's not just an easy ""select from mssql"" and ""insert into oracle"" as the Oracle database will have some foreign keys that would need to be resolved. I also need to keep track of the changes that are made during each sync job. 

A couple of ideas I had were:

-Create a temporary table in Oracle to store the data from MSSQL, and create a stored procedure to do the synchronization and return the changes. 

-Use a synchronization script to grab all of the data from MS SQL and use already-written PHP functions to verify/update the data row by row. I imagine this would probably take a long time and a bunch of memory.

1355165928.0,1,self.SQL,14m8hh,[MS SQL 2005] Update Temporary Table (Column of NULL) With Row Numbers,2,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/14m8hh/ms_sql_2005_update_temporary_table_column_of_null/,"/SQL, this is something I've been trying to do that I cannot seem to properly do. I think this should be a very basic operation yet every solution I try on my own or from my Google search produces query errors.

Essentially, I have a table object, with 3 columns. Column 3 is the pertinent data, column 2 is an identity(1,1) column, and column 1 is NULL from the get go.

I perform an operation that inserts data into column 3, column 2 is updated with integers automatically, and column 1 is left blank. I then perform operations that may or may not remove some rows from temp table. What I need to do at this point is update column 1, which was NULLs up until this point, with integer row numbers.

To put is visually, I have this

    NewID       OldID (iden)      Data
    NULL        1                 Data-A
    NULL        2                 Data-B
    NULL        3                 Data-C
    NULL        4                 Data-D
    NULL        5                 Data-E
    NULL        6                 Data-F
    NULL        7                 Data-G
    NULL        8                 Data-H

I filter the data and get this:

    NewID       OldID (iden)      Data
    NULL        1                 Data-A
    NULL        2                 Data-B
    NULL        3                 Data-C
    NULL        5                 Data-E
    NULL        7                 Data-G
    NULL        8                 Data-H

This is easy. What I want is to update the table to get this:

    NewID       OldID (iden)      Data
    1           1                 Data-A
    2           2                 Data-B
    3           3                 Data-C
    4           5                 Data-E
    5           7                 Data-G
    6           8                 Data-H

I've tried all manner up updating the field using an self-JOIN and the ROW_NUMBER() function. But I can't seem to get it to work. Any advice on this? The only thing I can think of now is to create a second table, insert the data from this table setting column 1 as an identity(1,1) field in the second table. The data I'll be working with is relatively small and this would be doable, but it seems sloppy. I feel like I should be able in update the table from ""within.""

Hart Supply Company is a wholesaler of plumbing supplies products that sells to construction companies. It carries an inventory of approximately 7,500 items. Customers place orders by phone and buy on credit through a line-of-credit arrangement with Hart Supply. A typical transaction involves the customer first contacting the customer services department to check the price and availability of the needed item or items. Sometimes the customer ends up talking with several customer service clerks, depending upon the quantity and types of items he or she is seeking. If the customer decides to buy, he or she is transferred to a sales agent, who takes the order. The fulfillment clerk picks the items in the order and packs them together in preparation for delivery. Orders are sometimes delivered in multiple shipments. Once the ordered items are loaded onto the truck, the billing clerk records the sale in the sales journal, prepares an invoice, and sends it to the customer, who is given 30 days to make payment. In order to reduce accounting errors, Hart Supply’s business policy only allows a check to be applied to one invoice. In other words, customers are not allowed to write a single check to pay off multiple invoices.  The AR clerk also receives a copy of the invoice and records it in the AR ledger. Subsequently (within 30 days), the customer sends a check and the remittance advice to Hart Supply. The cash receipts clerk receives the check, records it in the cash receipts journal, and updates the cash account. The remittance advice goes to the AR clerk, who updates (reduces) the customer’s account receivable.

Currently I'm having trouble designing a particular query. The relevant tables are UTILITY (only one column, ""Utility,"" which contains several utilities that a house/apartment might offer), PROPERTY_UTILITY (a gerund between a property and its offered utilities, with the columns ""PropertyID"" and ""Utility""), and USER_UTILITY (gerund between a user and their preferred utilities, with the columns ""Username"" and ""Utility"").

What I want to do with this query is show a list matching users to properties based on the utilities. In order to match, ALL of a user's preferred utilities MUST be offered by a particular property, but NOT all of a property's utilities must be requested by the user. (So if it were a Venn Diagram, there would be a smaller circle called ""user utilities"" that is enclosed entirely in a larger circle called ""property utilities."") So the query should list every match between each user and any house that fits them.

I haven't been able to figure it out.

I have three tables: Movies, Sales, and Orders.
The Movies table keeps track of the movies on sale at a video store. Each record consists of a MovieID, format (DVD or VHS), title, genre, and price.

The Orders table keeps track of orders made by customers. The table consists of an OrderID, CustomerID, dateStamp, and the shipping address.

The Sales table is the link between the two and consists of OrderID, MovieID, and the quantity of copies of each movie in that specific sale. Naturally, an order can be composed of several sales.

I've been asked to find the average number of DVDs sold per order. The only way I can think to do this with my current model is to take the average quantity per order, which, if I'm not mistaken, requires a nested select statement within the AVG function. Does the following snippet of SQL make sense?

SELECT AVG
	(
		(SELECT SUM(sales.quantity) 
		 FROM sales, orders, movies
		 WHERE sales.orderID = orders.orderID
		       AND movies.movieID = sales.movieID
		       AND movies.genre = ‘DVD’

Our backup software (Quest's NetVault FastRecover) protects our DBs in real-time via an agent that sits on the SQL server.  In order for it to properly handle snapshots the instructions for FastRecover specify that we:

* Set the Recovery Model for all DBs to 'Full'
* Disable auto-shrink
* Disable auto-truncation
* Take a full backup of the DB via MSSQLMS
* Set the 'truncation interval' on the agent

**According to their tech support all that will happen at this interval is the agent will issue a checkpoint on all the DBs.**

Problem is, Full recovery model dictates that log truncation will **ONLY** occur after a transaction log backup.  See here:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189085(v=sql.90).aspx

So even though I'll have full transaction logs with current checkpoints, the log file will never truncate and **will continue to grow**.  Their tech support's response was:

&gt; Do you have logs that are not getting truncated or something? 
We would think someone in your enviroment would have noticed by now if logs weren't getting truncated.
Normally we do realtime protection that includes the logs. 

I have been back and forth with him and he's convinced I'm wrong.  I'm not a SQL guru but the TechNet article seems pretty clear cut on the issue.   It wouldn't matter if we didn't have such insane growth in some of our DBs and such limited space on the transaction log volume, but we do.

tl;dr

I'm just looking for somebody that can confirm or deny this statement for me:

&gt; A database using the Full recovery model only truncates it's transaction logs after a log backup.

Need to get single row.,5,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/wsgn1/oracle_need_help_getting_around_multiple_rows_on/,"This may be somewhat of a n00bish question, but I'm having trouble with getting more rows than I want on a one to many join.  Here's the scenario:

Table A &lt;---1:M---&gt; Table B

In table A, we have a dispatch_id column with a single record for dispatch 123.  In table B, we have four records associated with dispatch 123, each referring to a different Part (antenna, racks, router and gear).  I'm trying to design a report that will determine if each part has been installed or not (status of 'INS' from table B).  This all needs to be returned in a single row for each dispatch_id.

Example column Output:

Dispatch      Antenna Installed (y/n)     Racks Installed (y/n) etc..
123                      Y                                    N

Essentially, I was trying to use a case statement like the following:
case when part = 'ANTENNA' and status = 'INS' then 'Y' else 'N'

The problem is that, since table B has four records for the dispatch and it's joining on the dispatch ID, no matter what I try, it always returns four records (one for each part).  I can't guarantee that more parts won't be added to table B for a particular dispatch so I'm hesitant to just hard code some filters in there and I want to avoid having to create a view if possible.  Is there any other way to get the results I want into one single row?  Essentially, I want the query to cycle through the records and if it finds a scenario when it can produce a 'Y', then ONLY use that value.  

This may be somewhat confusing so let me know if any clarification is needed.

So I am new to SQL as a trainee in BI and have begun learning it/teaching myself  since being given access to the company database recently. I have put together a SELECT query to pull out customer data for standard monthly reports. However, since doing this for 1 or 2 new group customers I have found an issue with the code that has befuzzled me (although I have found a workaround). I have posted the code in a comment below.

When I change Cust1, etc. in this line of the WHERE clause it will run perfectly for some groups, but for others it will continue to run (presumably indefinitelY) until I am forced to cancel it:

    Orders.groupCustomer  In  ( 'Cust1','Cust2','Cust3','Cust4' ) 

I have figured out a few things:

 - It only has an issue when at least one of the groupCustomers returns data
 - The issue does not present if I comment out the bold areas of my code (so that join is causing the issue somehow)
 - Adding an OR to the WHERE statement for a value that does not have this issue/return data makes the code run smoothly in 3secs (this is my workaround - commented out in code)

I have got it working but I would rather know why this is happening. I can't understand how adding an OR to WHERE would ever make anything run faster. Any ideas?

**TLDR; SELECT query runs indefinitely when I change values selected in 1 line of WHERE clause. Looks like a join is causing the issue. Issue is resolved by adding an OR to WHERE clause. Why?**

I have a humongous ScorecardTable (design below). I'll be updating rows with MetricID = 4, which is a sum of rows with MetricID = (1,2,3). Recently I found and deleted some duplicates where MetricID = 2 for five certain employees. Don't know or care how those were created, the goal right now is to update MetricID = 4 so that it's a correct and current SUM of MetricIDs 1, 2 and 3.

ScorecardTable

&gt;ScorecardID int, pk

&gt;OrderID int

&gt;EmployeeID int

&gt;MetricID int

&gt;Date int

&gt;Money money


6717	501	50	1	20120401	$5.00

6418	501	50	2	20120401	$3.00

1628	501	50	3	20120401	$2.00

1221	501	50	4	20120401	$10.00 (correct result)

9079	502	30	2	20120415	$1

4611	502	30	3	20120415 	$1 (duplicate, is now deleted)

4117	502	30	4	20120415	$2 (remaining bad result, should be $1)


Again:

* Money for MetricID = 4 is created by taking the SUM of the Money column for MetricID = (1,2,3).

* Some duplicates for MetricID = 2 were deleted, but I'm not sure which.

* OrderID, EmployeeID, MetricID, Date, and Money are grouped and should be distinct. (There should not be more than one combination of OrderID = EmployeeID = MetricID = Date = Money). One MetricID = 4 is made for each combination, though, grouping (1,2,3)

How do I best update the Money column for MetricID = 4 for five different EmployeeIDs to make it correct? 

I was thinking something like this:

    UPDATE [dbo].[ScoreCardTable] SC1

    SET [Money] =

    (

    SELECT SUM([Money])

    FROM [dbo].[ScoreCardTable] SC2 (NOLOCK)

    WHERE [EmployeeID] IN (10,20,30,40,50)

    AND [MetricID] IN (1,2,3)

    AND [Date] &gt;= 20120401 and [Date] &lt;= 20120601

    AND SC1.OrderID = SC2.OrderID

    AND SC1.EmployeeID = SC2.EmployeeID

    AND SC1.Date = SC2.Date

    AND SC1.Money = SC2.Money

    )

    WHERE [MetricID] = 4

    AND [Date] &gt;= 20120401 and [Date] &lt;= 201200601

    GROUP BY OrderID, EmployeeID, MetricID, Date, Money

This may seem a little backwards, but any help would be greatly appreciated.
I have a relatively simple SQL statement that is failing to return any records due to a WHERE condition that utilizes the LIKE operator.

To condense:

    SELECT * FROM Table
    WHERE '%' + RTRIM(Table.Column) + '%' LIKE @parameter

For example, I know that there are multiple rows with a Table.Column value of ""R.L "" with two trailing spaces. The @parameter I'm passing in should allow me to query on values such as ""R.L"" and others, separated by pipes (|). 
However, even when passing in just ""R.L"", the query returns no rows.

I've wasted so much time on this already. Any ideas what I'm missing here?

____________________________________________________________________

This finally did the trick.

SELECT * FROM Table

Row 3 is grouped by itself because there are no rows in the dataset where the displayid and objectid match within a 5 minute of that groups latest timestamp (row 3).

Row 4, 5 and 6 are grouped because the displayid's match, the objectid's match and the rows timestamps are within 5 minutes of the last row, row 5's timestamp is within 5 minutes of row 4's, and row 6 timestamp is within 5 minutes of row 5's.

Row 7 and 8 are grouped because the objectid's and displayid's are the same and row 8's timestamp is within 5 minutes of that groups latest timestamp (row 7).

Anyways, we have multiple xml tables that are similar to:



&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

&lt;/videos&gt;

What we are thinking is that we should import, these into a table where the fields are 

-ID

-thumbs

-link

-title

-categories

-tags

-duration

-publication date



Once we have that into a table, we can then work on importing similar XML files into similar tables that we can reference and display as required.

The company had a higher-tier of IT on the other side of the country for dealing with the nitty gritty of our environment.

I now have a job where I've taken on a hell of a lot more responsibility in a smaller company. (More rewarding, less of an automaton, blah blah blah) I am now almost entirely responsible for the configuration (both hardware and software) of almost all of the database and web servers (a few racks with between 4 and 8 servers each, SAN, VMs, etc, almost all new hardware) I run into problems fairly frequently and haven't had a full weekend-off in about 6 months. It'll get better... I hope.

My setup is basically:

Two VMs of the MS SQL 2008 r2 variety. (each 3GHz, 4GB RAM, 2x250GB LUNs from the SAN. each on a different physical server.) The main database for the web-app is approximately 50 tables, ~10 of which have between 300,000 and 600,000 records with 10-20 columns, almost none of which have more than a 50-character limit. It's not the largest database I've ever dealt with, but I've never dealt with MS SQL intimately before this job. (I mainly dealt with a bunch of MySQL stuff about 1/10 this size and complexity)

Two VMs running IIS 7.5 serving the ASP.NET front-end.

The SQL servers are in a failover cluster, as are the web servers. The web servers have never really been an issue.

My main issue/question is this: About every 4-6 days, the SQL server hosting the actual ""SQL Server"" service becomes bogged down (timeouts here and there, slow resulting, etc) and I switch from A to B, (or B to A whatever the case may be) and all's well for a few more days.

Obviously, his just doesn't work, especially if I have to bump people off for a few seconds every couple of days.

I've checked logs there isn't any single proc or view giving more grief than any other. Ive optimized the more complex stored procedures and views as much as I can. Nothing has helped in any noticeable way.

I guess what I'm asking is, is there something more I need to be doing to keep this from being bogged-down and having to switch from server to server? Is there some way to share the load all the time? Tips/tricks I should be trying?

We have a grant called ""K_Land fund trust"" with an actiual underscore in the name. We have other grants with underscores as well. How do you search for an underscore sign with a wildcard on each side? The ineffective query below gets all records that are at least one character long:

*Bad query*

[9/16/2011 12:11:03 PM] Attorney K: from [grant]
where grantname like '%_%'

we have 3 special characters and no literal percent sign. Again, we take the wild that you want to evaluate and put it inside square brackets. You see 3 grants having underscores in their names. In This example the square brackets tell SQL you are looking for literal underscore character.

Select *
From [Grant]

So what questions would you have for someone with a SQL background with such a vague job description?

A textbox in the details section of the report would have Fields!NUMBER.Value, and I would like a text-box in the table footer to have all values of the field joined, for the above example ""123"".

The query behind this is much more complex than I've described above, so I'm trying to stay away from copying and modifying the query to join all values of the field in SQL.

Is there something in either MSSQL or perhaps the software that's entering the data that we're missing that's having it enter data into both servers DBs?

Also, someone mentioned setting up a destructive testing database instead of cloning the VM. We've done some searching, but can't seem to come up with anything on setting up a destructive testing database. Anyone have any more info on this approach?

Here are the tables and columns (only listing the once concerning this problem)

Feature:
---------
fnumber
name

Example:
    fnumber     name
    10            potato
    20            carrot
    30            apple


Feature_link:
--------------
f_feature_number
to_feature number

Example:
    f_feature_number     to_feature_number
    10                   20
    10                   30
    20                   10

So I gotten this far:


SELECT feature_link.F_FEATURE_NUMBER, feature.NAME, feature_link.TO_F_FEATURE_NUMBER
FROM feature, feature_link
WHERE (feature_link.F_FEATURE_NUMBER = feature.FNUMBER)


Gives the output
    f_feature_number name    to_feature_number
    10               potato  20
    10               potato  30
    20               carrot  10 


I want to find the name matching also the to_feature_number field, how can I accomplish this?

End result should look like this:
    f_feature_number name    to_feature_number  to_name
    10               potato  20                 carrot                 
    10               potato  30                 apple

There are five tables involved: Jobs, Users, Occupations, Fields, and Expertises.

Jobs have foreign keys ""customer_id"" (points to user), ""employee_id"" (also points to user), and ""field_id"".

Users contains all of the application's users, both customers and employees (people can be both)

Occupations have foreign keys ""user_id"", ""field_id"", and ""expertise_id"".

Expertises have an integer ""rank"" field. 

What I'm trying to do is return all of the jobs an employee (user) is qualified for. This means all jobs that have been assigned to them already (job.employee_id = current_user.id), and jobs that have not been assigned to anyone yet (job.employee_id IS NULL). The second case (jobs not yet assigned) also requires that the employee have at least one occupation in that job's field, and if the job's customer (user pointed to by job.customer_id) also has an occupation in that same field, the employee must have a higher ranked expertise in that field. 

Like I said, I don't have a lot of experience with SQL, and my tongue ges twisted just trying to say the requirements in English. I'm sure this isn't overly complicated for someone who actually knows what they're doing, so if any of you could give me some pointers I'd be very appreciative.
