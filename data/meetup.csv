Take to the steps of the US Capital &amp; Rayburn House Office Building - Dec 21st 2011 - 7:00AM,192,40,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/ng4hh/emergencyurgentmeetup_stop_sopa_take_to_the_steps/,"We thought we had won the first battle against SOPA

But the draconian Entertainment Industry Lobbyist written ""Anti-piracy"" law that includes due process lacking three strikes bans from the internet, warrantless website shutdowns without judicial oversite, and internet technology damaging stipulations to remove encrypted secure sessions, like the ones you need to protect your online banking, Is back in congressional hearings on Wed Dec 21st 2011 at 9:00am

Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and the congressional entertainment industry shills who helped sponsor the SOPA act were able to manipulate the congressional hearing status for continued study and investigation of SOPA; originally set for mid January 2012, it is now moved to this week on December 21st at 9:00am EST

Not even the budget reform bill has gotten this type of unprecedented fast tracking. They are trying to pass this no matter what 90% of the population says or does and no matter what the network engineers of Google, yahoo, Cisco, and hundreds of others warn them.

This will repressively damage the security and function of the internet if SOPA is passed. The fear of the loss of the freedom of speech and rise of state sponsored corrupt corporate mandated censorship is the first steps to fascism and big brother.

This if passed could ban reddit, facebook, youtube, twitter, and more because it made the Entertainment industry mad that day. It could even stop people from voicing issues against the government and government contractors who do illegal things.

Take a Stand people. Join me on the December 21st 2011 at 7:am on the steps of the US Capitol and then on to the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill if you can and help me protest this.

**""NO ON SOPA - H.R.3261"" ಠ_ಠ**

**Be on the steps of the US Capitol (38.889825,-77.010361) http://goo.gl/38dKY (map)**

**Wednesday - December 21st, 2011 - 7:00AM EST**

If you are not in the area in another state or US ex-pat please start calling your congressmen and senators. Let them know you will not stand for this act if it passes and their will be hell to pay come election day or sooner if knowledge of the corruption comes to light.

If you are a foreign compatriot of the open and free internet, take it to the closest US Embassy or US Consulate at the same time and let them know, you are not happy.

It's just a web page, so it should work on Android/iPhone/iPad/Laptop/etc. It makes use of the geolocation feature found in modern web browsers. So when you first run it, you must allow the browser to share your location.

[This is what it looks like while running on Android](http://garyc.me/ruf/ruf.png). The distance to the closest user is rounded up to the nearest power of 2, and the heading to one of 8 directions. I think this provides a good amount privacy while still being useful. 

I'm thinking that this is something you can bookmark on your mobile device, then check periodically while you are out and about, and you might get lucky!

I thought this would be a good subreddit for this since we are interested in meeting other redditors here. I would appreciate any feedback you may have (good or bad). Thanks.

Why am I doing this?  I strongly believe anyone who can take a stance against an issue should understand the issue first.  So what better way to understand the operation of a firearm than to use one and spend some time with someone on the other side of the fence.

I have a boyfriend, but I only see him once a week, and I don't have any friends of my own that are girls. It's really lonely. 

I've been cruising Meetup.com for months now -- I can find groups with similar interests to me (Books, geeks, d&amp;d) and I can find groups catered to my age group and gender (20s party girls), buuuut... these groups don't really intersect. If I were to attend the ""similar interests"" meetups, mostly guys/men are there, and being a mostly socially confident decent-looking girl, I'm afraid it'll be a really uncomfortable experience and not at all what I'm looking for. If I attend the 20s party girls groups I'm afraid I won't have anything in common with the girls there.

The point of all this rambling is, I wish I could search a website for other girls in my area (Chantilly/Centreville) who are looking for friends, who have similar interests, and are in a similar age group. It would be so cool if the site could match people who are similar to you, and say like, ""Hey, Girl X also likes Skyrim! Here's a meetup in your area that you could both attend! And here's a link to message this person and introduce yourself!"" So, basically a dating site, but for friends. At least you could feel like you are showing up to these meetups with a ""buddy"".

**tl;dr** A meetup site that is like a dating site.

---
**update**: OkCupid is actually pretty decent for this purpose. There's a ton of functionality on the site you just have to ignore / can't use if you're only looking for friends (matches, etc), and as far as I can tell there is absolutely no way of filtering who can send you messages. Also, I've been on the site for like, an hour, and I have 50 billion emails from just random OkCupid bot crap. But I've found some people that sound really friendable, (some of whom probably live in my apartment complex, hahaha) and I sent some messages out. Here's to hoping they don't just assume I'm a lesbian trying to get it in.

**update no.2 --  4/29**: Two out of four people replied on OkCupid and they both seem really cool! Also, there's a fairly huge redditors group on meetup.com for dc/nova, which, idk how I didn't notice it before. The people on here seem pretty normal and chill, and I'm actually considering braving going solo to an event: http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-Metro-area-Redditors/ ",,False,,t5_2qn4t,1367287233.0,,,True,t3_1ckud6,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/1ckud6/i_wish_there_was_a_datinglike_site_for_finding/,

It's looking to be around $30 per head.",76,12,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/df7jr/hey_philly_im_getting_together_a_charter_bus_for/,"** Update 9/28/2010 **
The bus is full.  I sold the last three seats this morning.  If you still want a seat, send me your contact information and let me know how many are in your party.  I'll start a standby list and it will work on a first come, first serve basis.

If you are holding a seat and find out you can no longer go, let me know as soon as possible.  I don't anticipate that getting your seat filled quickly will be very hard to do.

I will be speaking with a project manager later in the week to nail down specifics.  Once that is done, I'll send an update with the fine details.  If you paid for other people, then odds are I only have your email address.  What would be really helpful is if you gave me their email addresses as well.  Don't worry, I will use bcc on the distribution so we don't all get swept up in an email storm.

I also created a new subreddit for this: [PhillyBus](http://www.reddit.com/r/phillybus).  Since the bus is now full, I probably won't be updating this page anymore.  I would suggest directing all new questions and comments there.

-T

** Update 9/27/2010 **
If you tried to contact me this weekend and I haven't gotten back to you yet, try to contact me again.  I believe I've returned all calls and emails, but I don't want anyone to fall between the cracks.  I had a great weekend with a small group of redditors in the /r/motorcyles subreddit at a meetup camping trip in WV.  [Here are]() pictures if you're interested.

At last count, we have 10 seats left.  At this point I am positive they will fill.  Someone is supposed to drop off a check for two seats at my house later today.  This is looking like it will be a fun group.

Does anyone want to get together for a Center City meetup downtown the night before?  If there's any interest, let me know.  I'll toss something together.

** Update 9/24/2010 **
Thanks to everyone promoting this; the seats are slowly but surely filling up.  I am going on a camping trip with /r/motorcycles to WV this weekend, so I won't be able to respond to email or PM's.  I'll catch up with everyone first thing on Sunday when I return.  If, by some miracle, the seats oversell over the weekend, I'll issue seats in the order they were purchased and give refunds to the rest.  Have a great weekend, everyone.

** Update 9/23/2010 **
I'm signing the contracts for the bus today and putting down the deposit.  *Please* help me get this bus full.

I finally came up with my sign.  The caption will say ""Illegal Aliens are Taking Over America!"" and the picture will be a reddit alien smoking a blunt.

** Update 9/22/2010 **
Sorry, I don't think I was very clear in my post.  My PayPal account is the same as my email.  Just send it to the Tom@.net (remove REDDIT for actual address.  

The Center City pickup will be at Market &amp; 30th.  The pickup will be whenever the bus can get there from KoP.  If anyone would like to volunteer to be a Center City representative to stay in touch with my on that day, that would be helpful.

Found out today that the bus has a TV.  What should we bring to watch?  

** Update: 9/21/2010 **

I just did some calling around and have decided to hire US Coachways.  They seem like a very professional and dependable company with good prices.  Based on everyone's feedback, I have adjusted the schedule to get to DC earlier, leave later, and do two pickups.  Here's the details:

* 6:00 AM pickup in King of Prussia.
* Secondary pickup in Philadelphia, place to be determined.  The time will probably be around 6:30 AM.  It depends on when we get out of KoP.
* We should arrive in DC at around 9:00 and we will be dropped off near the National Mall
* We will depart DC at 6:00 that evening.  There is a Federal law that a driver cannot be on duty for more than 15 hours, so this is the best we can do.
* The bus is a luxury liner with high-backed tilting seats, personal AM/FM stereos, on board bathroom, and heating / AC.
* Total capacity is 56 seats.
* Total price to me is $1490.
* I will be asking $27 / head for a seat.  If you reserve a seat and later need to cancel, please let me know as soon as possible.  I’ll do everything I can to get it filled and refund your money.

I have not yet put a deposit on this or signed the contract, but I will be doing it very soon.
If you want to get in, let me know soon.  

If you would like to get a seat, I'll have to ask for payment in advance.  If you would like to discuss this with me, my personal cell phone number is .  I know that I am asking you to take a risk by trusting me, a stranger, with your money.  Let me just say that I have been on Reddit for (almost) two years, and I'll be using PayPal to collect funds which will offer you some small degree of consumer protection.

My personal email address is Tom@.net.  Remove the word ""REDDIT"" for the proper address.  This is the best way to contact me.

As seats are reserved, I'll update this thread with a list of seat holders.

Oh, one more thing, I still need suggestions for a spot in Center City to pick up.  Try to think of place that would offer parking for those redditors with cars.


** List of redditors who have a seat reserved (paid) **

The list is now available here.

We launched in this morning and are super excited about it.

Firstly I'd like to say that what we have launched today is (hopefully) only the beginning.  I hope to make many changes based on feedback from the reddit community.  Please try this out for all of your reddit meetup needs and give me feedback by PM or via email to support@redditgifts.com.  I will listen to all feedback and probably implement most of it, making it **the** meetup site for reddit.

**Here's a short introduction to reddit meetups:**

[meetup front page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/) - You can start your search for meetups here, note the little calendar icon at the top left, use this to find meetups on a specific day.

[meetup page in map view](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/?show=map) - a handy map view of all meetups in your search criteria.

[subreddit meetup page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/r/twincitiessocial/) - we will add the ability to subscribe to these soon.

[special day pages](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/global-reddit-meetup-day-2010/?show=map) - we tend to do a lot of things here on reddit on special days.  This year we are having [Global Reddit Meetup Day](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/global-reddit-meetup-day-2010/?show=map) on June 25th, you'll see here that all the events are nicely grouped by this day.  If anyone wants to have one of these special days, please PM me and I'll set it up, it takes about 1 minute for me.  If this is something the reddit community would like to do itself, let me know and I'll expose it to everyone.

**Your meetup tracker** - If you're logged in to redditgifts at the top right you'll see ""your: meetups"", here you can find any meetups you've created or clicked the ""Count me In!"" button for.

**Emails** - We will send emails to remind of the meetup 1 day before the event to anyone who has clicked the ""Count me In!"" button.

**Photos** - Anyone can add photos to a meetup and they will appear in a slideshow format.

Again, I would love to add new features to this and already have a list of requested features that I'll start implementing over this week.  PLEASE, contact me with ANY requests.  This meetups feature is for REDDIT, I want to make it special for reddit.",,False,,t5_2qn4t,False,,,True,t3_h7i72,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/h7i72/today_with_reddit_we_are_announcing_reddit_meetups/,

employees at retail stores and restaurants that are open late. I try
to target places with pretty low pay and benefits like Wal-Mart and
fast food chains.

In the past, I've even been able to get sponsors. They've given me a
card or a coupon to put in the bag in exchange for more candy. Maybe
this year we can print small slips that say ""Happy Halloween from
reddit"".

I am a 23 year old male who lives in a corporate world and pretty much do the same thing every day, I wake up go to work yada yada yada... I want to experience a different kind of life! So I decided I will take a leave of absence and travel the US with a good friend of mine who I met by chance (more of that story later) and his brother. We currently live in Florida and would like to head north up the east coast and then head all the way out west then head south through California, then east to get back home.
Here is the kicker, us 3 are a bunch of guys who like to have fun and party whenever possible (comes with the miami life) so each state we go through; we want to meet up with fellow redditers for one hell of a night of fun! So starting from GA we want to spend one night with a fellow redditer and party at their house or a local bar for one night we will all never forget and then continue north!
We will be driving in my BMW which has room for one more person if they would like to take the trip with us! We will be documenting the whole trip and will have a blog up!

who would be interested in helping us out along the way and show us what their state has to offer?!


*Edit- If you have a place to stay for the event, please pm me and message me with the state/county of where we will be headed to!

So I think we are going to make T-shirts for those of you who will be meeting up with us, And for those of you who support us! WE think it would be awesome for when we take pics that we all have the same shirt! We also think it would be bad ass if our supporters would post pictures of them in our shirts on our blog!
I am not to tech savy and honestly don't know how to make a website, so if anyone can help us with that; that would be great!!!

We want to name the trip, So here's where we will need YOU the community! Come up with a name for out trip, who ever gets the most upvotes wins! maybe we can even throw in a $25 prize to the winner? (lol just a little motivation?)
We also would like someone to design the T-shirts, same thing goes for the shirt, winning design gets a prize, and the first shirt :)

I think this would be a great opportunity to forge new friendships with fellow redditors outside the limits of our cities.

It wouldn't take much to find common interests (you know offline) and one motivated person to get the ball rolling. Trips could be easy as meeting up to go skydiving/paint balling/indoor climbing/art musuems for the day or as in depth as hiking in Europe.

For instance: I just got into mountain biking and have been looking at doing a biking/kayaking/car camping trip in the SE US once the weather warms and it came to me, why not just invite the family?

To do so we're going to implement two new rules for right now. More may be added in the future, but for now we'll just keep it simple. 

New Rule #1: **No more ""does anyone live in (huge geographical area) type posts.**

There have been a lot posts that are such a large area (i.e. Western US or England) that a meetup between everyone in the area wouldn't even be plausible. If this is the case, we'll leave you a note (or a PM) letting you know to resubmit with a bit more specific location.

New Rule #2: **If a large, active subreddit exists for the location you're trying to arrange a meetup at, we will start removing the post and leave a note telling you to post there instead.** 

This will only apply to a small portion of you, as most of you already do this. Also, it really only applies to large metropolitan areas for the most post. We're not going to send you to some dead subreddit either, we're just trying to clean up our front page, not throw you under the bus.

All of these rules may seem a bit strict, but we're just trying to declutter the front page, and make [/r/meetup](/r/meetup) more effective. We also ask you guys do your part by reporting posts that break the rules or are obviously spam, as we aren't always able to catch everything!

A. 5:30 PM - Meetup at [this](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;abauth=4546fc9c%3AlDRHQtAI9VhUQzBN5c79Jwian24&amp;sll=40.746974%2C-73.992206&amp;view=text&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;q=waldy%27s+pizza+nyc&amp;btnG=Search+Maps) pizza place. 

B. 6:30 PM - Walk over to the [People's Improv Theatre](http://www.thepit-nyc.com/daily.html?y=2009&amp;m=08&amp;d=15) to checkout an improv comedy show, Bastards, INC. Cost: $10. I will call to see if we can just get tickets at the door, or if it's required to buy ahead of time.

C. For interested, over 21 persons, the area seems to be flanked on all sides by bars. Afterward, we can hit a pub for a drink and some chit-chat.

With this in mind it would be a good idea to bring grills, nerf guns, blankets, lawn chairs and whatever else you would bring to a day at the beach.

So be it!  Sorry it's not in Davis/Somerville, I know that's what I originally posted would happen, but I have to bow to democracy.

I talked to the folks at Charlie's Kitchen and they are cool with it.

**Start Time:** Wednesday, November 18th, at 8 pm.

**End Time:** 12 am.

**Location:** Charlie's Kitchen, Upstairs.  Harvard Square.  10 Eliot Street, Cambridge.  

**About:**  

  * All ages welcome.
  * Red Line to Harvard Square, then walk down Brattle Street until it becomes Eliot.  It's about a 5 minute walk. 
  * I'll have name tags to distribute as people arrive.  
  * Arrive and leave whenever you like, I just chose 8 as an approximate start time.  I should be arriving there a bit earlier. 

I've reserved 40 seats.  Management is aware of us arriving so there should be no trouble finding seating.  See you there!

EDIT: Good news, I talked to them again and they said it's okay if under 21 people show up, so everyone is now welcome!  

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that came, I hope you had a great time.

I don't usually tend to share my ""life's story"" with people, but here it goes.

* Dad's a pastor (I'm religiously ambiguous for now)

* Moved around often in my life - broke connections, got used to it.

* Came to B.C., Canada as a depressed teen 4 years ago.

* Drugs/Drinking ensued

* Drug/Drinking related friends appeared

* 2.5 years later, Quit all drugs/drinking and disassociated with said friends.

* Got new friends

* Got a girlfriend and fell in ""love"". Disassociated with new friends

* Broke up ~6 months later. Friend-connections were shaky.

* Graduated highschool, rarely see Friends, hard to find new ones. (I work weekends with 30/40 year old immigrants - really cool people though! - and am studying online to become TEFL certified and potentially emigrate to Belgium for a year or two, so I'm not in College/University.)

* Denied needing friends for a while (6 months) and spent time working and studying to complete goals.

* Realized that I'm a lonely bugger!

* Posted on Reddit.

My original idea was just a meetup that isn't at one set location, but instead travels - say, walking through a downtown exploring as a group. But then I was thinking of ways you could bring some tech into it:

* An app where people participating in the event could post trivia about different parts of the downtown area, or suggest specific places / events occurring in the area of the expedition. 

* The QR codes used for the rally in DC could also make a comeback, as people connect with each other while exploring.

* As someone who is a big believer in supporting local businesses, the QR codes for the event could even be extended to local businesses that want to get in on the action.

Honestly, that's about all the ideas I have so far.  It's obviously not a fully formed idea as of yet, and I don't have all the necessary skills to pull off such a thing on my own.

I contacted a mod about getting the title changed, but (sadly) that's seemingly impossible.

So I'm resubmitting this with the appropriate date in the title, just so things are all on the same page (people were getting confused with the old title, and rightfully so).

As I noted in the original post, I'm willing to take care of making sure there's a sign and junk at the meetup so people don't get confused. Seems most people agreed on [Bus Boys and Poets](http://www.busboysandpoets.com/) (*the **14th St** location*) as an ideal place to meet; I suggested a time of 4PM, which seemed to work for some people, so I'll move forward with the assumption that we'll meet at that time.

If that time doesn't work for you, speak up. I'll edit this post as more details are set in stone.  
  
**EDIT - 01/22/2010:** For those who are definitely still attending this, I'll aim to be there around 3:50-ish. I'll wear a bright red sweater that says ""Nike"" across the front, and for the hell of it I'll most likely hold a Reddit bobblehead in my hand. Hopefully it'll be impossible to miss - see you there!

**Edit 01/23/2010** I am outside right now, in case anyone is checking this thread. 3:44 PM
 
   
**Edit 01/25/2010** Seems like this weekends meetup went pretty well, definitely wanna organize future ones.

Mark your calendar! :),29,2,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/d00yr/copenhagen_meetup_august_28th_mark_your_calendar/,"**[New updated post with a detailed plan](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/d2n7f/copenhagen_meetup_we_have_a_plan_now_august_28th/)**


As determined by the voting in the [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/cxseh/copenhagen_denmark_meetup/), the meet-up will take place on Saturday, August 28th.

The location has yet to be decided... my main question is if we should risk an outdoor meeting place or if it needs to be somewhere inside in case of rain. I'm thinking we could meet in some public place where we could hang out for bit and give people a chance to show up casually, and then just decide what the main activity should be from there. Unfortunately, I don't have a reddit t-shirt or anything, but I can wear something specific so people can recognise me... not anything weird though. 

Anyway, any ideas on where to meet? I'm so not at a planning type person, so I'd appreciate some input. I'm not idea-less though, here's mine:

1. Nyhavn - We meet at the the start of Nyhavn in that [slightly scummy little square](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Nyhavn,+K%C3%B8benhavn,+Danmark&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.160552,75.761719&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Nyhavn&amp;hnear=Nyhavn,+1051,+Copenhagen,+Denmark&amp;ll=55.680601,12.587521&amp;spn=0.000691,0.001937&amp;t=h&amp;z=19). There's options in most price ranges. When I go, we usually get some fancy beers from Magasin and then go hang out across from the expensive cafes... like a classy bums or backpackers. :) But, there are plenty of other options. Be nice to just walk around a bit too. It'd be great if it's sunny.

2. Some pub - Like [Lord Nelson's](http://www.lordnelson.dk/) or [The Globe](http://www.the-globe.dk/). The most obvious thing to do... and better if it happens to be raining. (Sigh. Do I hate to have to think about that in August.)

3. Fælledparken - Someone suggested this in another post and this may be the best plan if it looks like a lot of people will turn up. Only problem with this is that I don't know where in Fælledparken to meet. Maybe someone could Google map a suggestion.

4. [YOUR BRIGHT IDEA HERE]

So, I'm thinking we could meet at like kl13-14? Give all the night owls a chance to wake up.

Come on Danish reddit (including you lurkers)... we can pull our shit together to do this can't we? It's not that big of deal and has the potential to be really cool. 


EDIT: As much as I hate Facebook, it had to be done... here's a [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=143990182288605). I'll post an event when we decide on a location.

EDIT 2: It seems like Fælledparken is most popular... in good weather. If it's raining too much then we need a Plan B. I haven't really had any great ideas. The only pub that would work for a large group is The Dubliner. So, unless someone else has another suggestion...

EDIT 3: It looks like the rainy day plan will be go to Temple Bar. I will make a new post with the meet-up details in a couple days.

* Name tags. I know they look goofy but I swear I think I only remember like 4 names.

UPDATE #2:  Spoke to the park people we can reserve a picnic area in the park for May 8th at Lewis Morris park.  $100 for covered $20 extra if we bring booze, $40 for non-covered, no booze allowed.

Anyone interested?

EDIT - READ THIS:

It sounds like there is some good interest in this.  My group was planning on pregaming at a friends house or at the bars early in the morning and then stepping off to the actual event.

Given the amount of responses I think it'd be better to pregame in a bar somewhere (or somebody's place if they don't mind opening it up).

My idea for the day was - Pregame with kegs n eggs type deal early in the morning (0800 or so) and then take public transport to the docks for the 'tag.

I think if we could get enough people and get a keg and a backyard we'd have a fucking blast.

I know I've got a crew that wants to come so if we all crew up and find a good place to do this that would be ideal.

I'm leaving Boston tomorrow morning for a month-long roadtrip around the country.  I'm going to try to visit as many places I've never been as possible, and while I have friends in most cities, there are a few along the way where I'll find myself alone for a night.  So if you live in any of these cities and wouldn't mind showing a fellow redditor around, or even just providing good company for a few drinks, comment here.

I'm also [couch surfing](http://couchsurfing.org), so if you're on there or if you'd like to let me crash, I'd really appreciate it.  

My schedule (skipping cities where I'm already staying with friends):

* Mon 8/9: NYC
* Mon 8/16 (AM): U of Cincinnati
* Mon 8/16 (PM) and 8/17: St. Louis
* 8/17 (night) and 8/18: Kansas City

* 8/23-8/25: Utah, Arizona, Southern Cali (on the road mostly)
* 8/27: Monterrey

* 9/2 &amp; 9/3: Seattle

I have a degree in Architecture but I've been working at a beer bar recently due to lack of real employment.  I'm a huge beer geek, love outdoors and urban exploration.  I'm not super awkward or creepy.  I am outgoing, sarcastic, and love meeting people.

Sorry it is such late notice everyone! This is hosted by myself and my boyfriend, jook11

3/28 happens to be Something on a Stick day (Think corn dogs, popsicles, and other stick like foods, etc) , so that's going to be our theme since random holidays are amusing.

We've got a nice backyard with an outdoor kitchen, a waterfall fireplace, and fire pit to hang out at. It includes a grill and we can also use the oven so we can cook things that are brought over. We ask everyone to come over at about 4pm. We'll probably start cooking some of the food at 4:30 or 5pm. Coming later is totally okay, it's just you might miss out on some stuff/food. The party will last till 10pm, since it's a work day the next day etc. and we don't want to keep people up too late.

As for the potluck portion, we usually do it this way: You either bring something edible to share with everyone or you bring $5 or so so we can make a pizza run or run to the store for the stuff that gets forgotten. Sorry, we can't afford to feed everyone but we can supply the plates and plasticware, etc.

**Please PM me if you plan on coming and what you plan on bringing, also if you've got additional guests and I'll respond with the address.**

A list of suggestions:

* Ice 

* Drinks 

* Corn dogs 

* Shishkabobs (or ingredients for them) 

* Popsicles 

* Lollipops 

* Snacks you might eat with toothpicks... 

* Pretzel sticks 

* Red vines

....and anything else stick like or not that you might wanna bring :) We won't be picky. It's just preferred that the food is tasty. Please let me know though so we don't have 10 people bringing ice.

If you really can't bring anything foodwise or afford to pay, our policy is that you're still quite welcome and we want you to come, but then we might not have enough to eat and those who bring stuff get first dibs. ;) Plus we might make you wear a funny hat. :)

Thanks everyone! Hope everybody can make it. I'll try to update this with the count and what's being brought.

EDIT: Here's who is coming so far and what they're bringing. I'll update this more when I get more confirmations.

**Yes:**

fishfishfish - popsicles/ice-cream on a stick

barbehque, causecaniwatch, and pixelatedcow - smores, shish kabob stuff, maybe beer

bananabelle - Pastries... on a stick!

anonamous - a 12 pack or ice

asev0 - red vines and other candy

misterFR33ZE and 2 friends - beer and maybe chips

ap0rnnstar - beer and some sort of substantial food

KillYourTV - wine, some soft drinks, some beer

I just got off the phone with 77or88.  They're pretty well busy with Warner Brothers tomorrow but the next day is essentially free.  I know a number of things have been discussed in the past couple weeks but to the best of *my* knowledge (and 77or88's) nothing has been firmly set in stone.  I figure we're getting close - maybe we oughtta start puttin' something together.

I will also make a confession - although I've been living and working in The Valley for a couple years now, I just moved my wife down from Seattle to Playa Del Rey.  So we're in a whole new community and while I've got my Industry buddies, she'd kind of like to start making friends.  So maybe this is a start towards that?

I'm biased towards the westside for obvious reasons, but it's not like we can't drive.  Throw sumpin' on out there.  You guys have done meetups before, I haven't.

**Edit:**  It appears that we're gonna try and take our travelers to the Aquarium of the Pacific during the day and if we can make a Museum of Jurassic Technology visit fit in with that, we will.  More info as time evolves.

I've made three responses - 1 for [Barcade,](http://www.yelp.com/biz/miss-ts-barcade-los-angeles), 1 for [Arsenal](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-arsenal-los-angeles-2) and one for [Liquid Kitty.](http://www.yelp.com/biz/liquid-kitty-los-angeles)  If it were up to me, I'd prefer Arsenal because it's less of a drive or Barcade because it looks intriguing but then, it isn't wholly up to me.  Vote up by your preference and hope to see you there.

###UPDATE:

So.  I'll be taking our intrepid travelers to Liquid Kitty, 11780 W. Pico Blvd.
Los Angeles, CA 90064, right around 8pm.  We may wander, as a group, to Arsenal after that.  PM me if you think you're going to make it so I know how big a table we should try and grab.

And I'll try my best to get something together that will actually work for people.

Being unemployed sucks and is boring.

**Edit:  I will be friending everyone who replies to this thread with an Ohio location so I can PM you all very easily when a meetup is in the works.  I will probably also create a Google docs sheet with usernames/locations so it's easy to see where the most people are - so if you are just upvoting another person who replied with your location, please reply to them (or the thread itself) so I can get individual usernames for PM purposes.  It really makes things easier when I can PM people about a meetup rather than hoping they remember to check the thread for updates!**",,False,,t5_2qn4t,True,,,True,t3_a1yws,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/a1yws/im_now_in_ohio_unemployed_and_would_like_to/,

After careful consideration of everyone's recommendations of a location, Triumph is the best bet. I had to consider:

•	Space

•	types of beer served

•	&lt;21 accommodations

Triumph covers all of that. I hope you guys are ready for a good time... [Directions!](http://www.triumphbrewing.com/blog/philadelphia_directions.html) (Thanks Garage_Dragon!)

Use the code ""Reddit"" to get a $9 ticket (normally $15 in advance, $20 at the door.) With online service fees, it is a $11.50 ticket, total. 

[Buy Ticket Here](http://www.greenhousetheater.org/index.php/kisskisscabaret) That code can be applied to multiple ticket purchases too. 

Single Redditors who can snag a date can score a cheaper ticket too, using that code. 

**We do encourage everyone to buy in advance, though.**

(To save the extra cash.)

There is a bar in the lobby and folks can buy beer or wine there. (No discounts on those, as the theater controls that.) It's a good show sober, but it will be a better show, with alcohol.

Once inside the theater, you guys can sit wherever you want to. We average 60 - 80 audience members per show in a 200 seat theater. So, there will be space available.

**STILL WANT MORE??!?!?**

Post-Show Afterparty: Kelsey's. 2265 N. Lincoln Ave. 

Biddle(Redditor who is helping with all of this)will see if we can't set up a Reddit drink special there. They have a pool table in the back and plenty of seating and are generally very cool cats. Several of the cast members will likely end up there, drinking and giving each other shit about the show.   

I've been told that Reddit snips will be peppered throughout the show and the cast/crew of the show are all thrilled!!

Let me know if you have any questions.

I would also like a head count. In the comments or PM me - Just let me know if you are in or not!! Thanks guys!!! Let's have a blast!!

I was blindsided by how much effort was going into this and despite all of my excitement, forgot to think about the environment. Well...I've thought. haha. So **ALL** enjoy.

UPDATE: I have about 10 surveys completed! Keep them coming!

UPDATE2: (9-23) 13 Surveys, 10/13 people prefer 5:00PM meetup on the 23rd. 9/13 Want it to be **IN PHILLY** so we can draw so far that most likely, it will be in Philly.

 FINAL UPDATE: 15 Surveys submitted so I'm not going to leave you guys hanging. 

 **DATE:** Friday, October 23rd

 **TIME:** 5:00PM 

 **LOCATION:**[Triumph Brewery](http://www.triumphbrewing.com/indexfl6.html)

After careful consideration of everyone's recommendations of a location, Triumph is the best bet. I had to consider:

* Philly area
* Space
* types of beer served
* &lt;18 accommodations

Triumph covers all of that. I hope you guys are ready for a good time...

If you have been to the Gainesville or South Florida Meetup(Broward/Miami) we already have some friends you've met. There are a good number of Floridians from other places also. Our local meetups are awesome, and so it is great to have an opportunity to meet more area redditors without leaving your house and perhaps later even in person. We would be very pleased to have some more people join in with us. The people are cool there and many topics are discussed, so even if you don't want to meet up it is a great place to be.

[Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=143990182288605) - now up to 26 members!

Here's the plan(s)...

**Weather - cross your fingers!**

There are two plans, an outdoor and an indoor. In general, the rule will be if it's not raining or just about to, we will go with the outdoor plan. On a warm day, I'd still rather sit under grey skies than under a roof. I hope the rest of you feel the same. Since the weather can vary a lot... *I'll update this post in the morning of the day of the event, so you can always check back here to be sure.* But if you can't... Unless it seems obviously wrong, I'll go by the [DMI forecast for KBH/Nordsjælland](http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark/regionaludsigten/kbhnsj.htm). 


**Outdoor plan: Fælledparken**

Meeting place: Entrance near Trianglen at the Genforeningsmonument statue. [Google maps location](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=F%C3%A6lledparken,+Copenhagen,+Denmark&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=33.572881,63.457031&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=F%C3%A6lledparken&amp;hnear=F%C3%A6lledparken&amp;ll=55.699161,12.574869&amp;spn=0.000729,0.001937&amp;t=h&amp;z=19) *Note:* This is NOT the main entrance on Øster Allé. This is the corner of Øster Allé and Blegdamsvej.

Activity: Bring your own beer/whatever. Bring something to sit on if you like. If someone wants to bring a frisbee or something else activity-related that would be cool. 


**Indoor plan: Temple Bar**

After much consideration, I think this is the best option... not too expensive and big enough to handle a large group. It's a pretty cool place too. There's also bordfodbold and a pool table, in case anyone is in a gaming mood. Once everyone arrives we'll probably want to head upstairs where it's nicer, but to make meeting up easier we will start out downstairs.

**How to find me/us**

I don't have a reddit t-shirt, so I'll just describe myself... First of all, I'm a pretty average weight/height/looks female. I wear glasses. I'll wear a plain white baseball cap, which is not all that common and should make me stand out. 

**If you want to show up much later than 14:00**

PM me and I'll give you my phone number, so you can SMS me and find out exactly where we are. 

**I hope a lot of people can make it. I think we'll have a fun time! :)**

If you haven't already heard of it, Piece is a popular pizzeria in Wicker Park. It's very highly rated among its patrons, and has established a reputation as one of the best pizza joints in Chicago. AND it brews its own beer.

As far as I know, the establishment is under-21 friendly, so don't let that stop you from coming.

Finally, I understand this event's start/stop time is pretty early, but we can always go out somewhere afterward. The restaurant doesn't accept reservations past 6 PM on weekends. I've booked 15 seats, but Piece is willing to accommodate more people with reasonable notice. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!

We've got several people under 21 that have expressed interest in coming, so would everyone be okay with meeting someplace non-21+?  I'll be honest, I don't know much about midtown/downtown that isn't bars, so someone should throw out a suggestion here.  

As far as time goes, I'm thinking we can plan on meeting around 7?  If that time isn't good for everyone, we can work out something else.

Everyone that is still interested and plans on attending, pm me and let me know!

EDIT 3: Pyramid Alehouse has been suggested for location, that sounds great to me.  Sound good to you all?

EDIT 4: I posted comments, one for Pyramid Alehouse and one for Dave &amp; Busters.  Those two sound the best to me, if you have a preference then vote one up and we'll get this settled!  Also, if you want to get a cell number, to avoid somehow missing the group, pm me and I'll send you mine.

**What**- Here is the plan. We will vote either on Pictionary, or Scrabble. The Bar has a downstairs room that is a private place with couches and a nice big table.  They have a cheap happy hour and other non alcoholic drinks. Also we can play our tunes there as well. 

Im open to other venues but this is the only place that comes to mind. I would invite you guys to my one bedroom apartment but its a one bedroom apt. Maybe if someone has a backyard?

Let me know what you guys think about the dates, I know its labor day weekend so I also threw the next friday up there too. 


UPDATE # 1

* Me +1
* Mystimel 
* jook11
* hrage 
* comradecrunch
* bananajamm
* Life_is_Good
* G325C9 + 1
* The Dark Haze (possibly) 
* Muhs
* Pussyfarts

Only downside is that it isn't in the city and I know a lot of people wouldn't have transportation, but maybe we can work that out. I'd be willing to give some people a ride. Other option within the city is [Triumph Brewery](http://www.triumphbrewing.com/indexfl6.html) in Old City. We held a meetup there back in October and it was a sweet deal.

March's turnout was awesome and I hope to see you and some new people, too, this month! We can also pitch a few more ideas for Global Reddit Meetup Day in addition to having an all around good time.

March 11th, 12th",19,2,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/fvhud/pax_east_redditor_meet_up_march_11th_12th/,"Before I start, I'm well aware that there are several other meet up threads involving PAXEast. The reason why I'm making a new one is that the most popular thread [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/f8iqr/pax_east_boston_mass_march_11th_13th_two_of_us/) has been archived without anyone ever really coming to a conclusion as to where to meet. As it stands now we only have about a week left to coordinate a meet up. 

**I'm proposing two meet ups, one on Friday, the 11th from 3:30pm - 4:00pm and one on Saturday, the 12th, from 3:30pm - 4:00pm both at console freeplay**

*Why console freeplay?* - for those of you who haven't been to PAX, console freeplay is basically just a giant room where you can 'rent' out games (for free) and play them on any of the many available consoles.

I feel like it's a good spot since it's easy to break the ice with a game. It's not as easy as breaking the ice with alcohol, but we're all going to PAX because we love games so we might as well partake in what we came for. 

*Why 3:30pm to 4:00pm?* - I figure most people are going to be at the convention during the middle of the day. Why not just meet up when we have the most people there?

*Why meet at the convention as opposed to a bar?* - I'm not a Boston local so I don't really know of many bars surrounding the BCEC, but from what I've heard the BCEC isn't in the greatest location in relation to Boston's downtown. However, if you have any bar or restaurant that might work in mind, please, please *suggest one*. 

**Edit 1:** It looks like another meet up thread has popped up on /r/gaming and picked up some steam. You can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fy367/pax_east_reddit_meetup/). 
 
**Edit 2:**We're still on for Friday at 4:30pm in Console Freeplay. Be there! I'll wave you guys down. If you need to contact me asking my whereabout just send me a message and I'll give you my number. 

**Edit 3:** So a few of us met up on Friday at 4:30, if we missed you, I'm really, really sorry. There will be another meet up tomorrow at **1:00pm at the handheld lounge**. See you guys there. If we can get a few people involved we'll *try* and shoot for 4:30pm on Saturday as well. I don't have internet access while at the BCEC.  Again, I'm really sorry if we missed you. It was really fun to meet the few of you I met today!

So hey everyone. I'm hosting our friendly neighborhood travelers this weekend on Saturday and Sunday nights, and this obviously calls for a grand, Madison-styled drinking escapade, in addition to missions, etc. So post here if you have ideas for what they should do, where they should go, if you've got an entertaining mission for them in the afternoon, and if you want to come hang out at any given point!

So they were originally going to take the bus up, but that didn't work out for their scheduling. As such, they'll be renting a car and driving up, and will thusly be able to arrive a little bit earlier. So post here/PM me if you're up for that or you have fun things in mind.

If you're interested in running them around at some point during Sunday or whatnot, meeting up with us, or other shenanigan ideas, post here or PM me and we can set something up.

Brats &amp; bacon will most definitely be on the agenda. Probably concurrently.


**Items currently on the agenda**

**Saturday Night**

* Power Hour at the Nitty (10-11p). They should be arriving on time for that.
* A boot at the Essen Haus. This has to happen.
* For the non-bar crowd--a short visit to a house party?
* Fishbowl at Wandos?

**Sunday**

* Brunch at Mickie's Dairy Bar at 9:30-10a. Depends on the hangover.
* Small grillout at my place--mostly to feed them the bacon-wrapped brats that they missed from the previous day's tailgating.
* Hang out at Genna's and/or Great Dane for some beer-tasting?

**EDIT 2**: If you want to join, PM me your cell phone number and let me know whether or not you can receive texts. I'll provide live updates to people as the events proceed so you can join us if you'd like.

This is for all you Metro Detroiters out there interested in meeting up on [Global Reddit Meetup Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/bu9d6/global_reddit_meetup_day_is_happening_on_saturday/).

Who all is interested, and where should we meet?

**UPDATE**
Looks like the general consensus is that we meet at [Ashley's](http://www.ashleys.com/) in Ann Arbor. Anyone have a preference to a time? 

[arcsin suggests that we have the meetup June 12](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/bu9s1/metro_detroit_meetup_on_global_reddit_meetup_day/c0oled8) due to Ashley's probability of being packed the 19th because of Ashley's Lobsterfest. He would be more than happy to talk to the manager to get the downstairs opened for us.


**ALTERNATIVE LOCATION**
For those who think Ann Arbor isn't ""Metro Detroit"" enough/too far away for them. Somewhere in Royal Oak, perhaps?

[The last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/am2kl/redditor_meeting_in_socal/) almost seemed like it was gonna happen but it seems that's fallen through.

I know there was that recent thread on snowboarding, but I have a feeling I'm not the only soCal redditor who doesn't snowboard.

Every time a socal meetup is brought up, people tend to suggest downtown Fullerton. I haven't checked out the bar scene there myself, but it's always seemed like fun. Then the underage redditors come in (get off my lawn!) and make us all sad because they can't join in on dtf bar hopping.

My idea? I prefer Dave &amp; Busters myself. It's got booze, it's got games, and underage people can come in if they're with someone over 25 (and I think there are enough redditors over 25). I know there's a D&amp;B at the Block and at the Spectrum, but I don't know what would be better for redditors.

I'd like to note that I'm horrible at organizing social events. I just wanted to bring this up to provide an open forum to see if people are still game for a socal meetup, and if there is anyone out there who is awesome at organizing events.  But if this takes off, I'm more than willing to organize! Just letting you know I suck at organizing and it'd be great if someone could help me put the word out and put this thing together.

**edit1:** Protophobic suggests just throwing a date and time out there, so let's try it the Boston way. For those lurkers who might be eyeing this with doubt, I'm setting a random date/time/place that's open for discussion, but at least that way it's a little more tangible. This will happen!

So random tentative date/time/place: **Saturday, February 27 at 8pm at D&amp;B at the Spectrum.**

So it's about time we had another reddit meetup here in San Francisco. And just in time, the holiday season is right around the corner! Beer, Bacon, and Narwhals!* How can you say no?

We've been talking about a 12/12/09 meetup date. Early enough so people won't have finals or holiday travel plans yet.

So far some murmurs have been going on in the conversation here.

http://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/a91w5/i_just_moved_back_to_bay_area_are_there_in_reddit/

The suggestions have been:

Kennedy's in Russian Hill
Jillian's at the Metreon in SOMA
Sweeties in North Beach

I've also heard good things about Zeitgeist in the Mission.

Any and all suggestions welcome! Come one, come all!

*most likely only beer. I'll try to convince someone to dress up like a narwhal though.

Edit: Hi everyone, looks like Zeitgeist is the best balance between being a reddit friendly place and close to public transportation! If anyone has any objections please let me know.

For most it was their first time, so it started slow. Torwards the end we got a really great group going and had a lot of fun talking outside by the fire, many lols were had. 


So this time I'd like to build on that group and get this going on a regular basis, perhaps regular meetups every two weeks, larger meetups to attract new members every two months or so.

With that said, I'd like to get the rest of you a little more involved this time around. So if anyone has any suggestions on a place to meetup, feel free. I wouldn't mind trying a new place out, but otherwise we can do the Pizza Factory again since everyone seemed to enjoy it, many were very close to it, and it was a comfortable environment.

My recommendations are... 

* **When:** Sat @ 3pm (Sep 4)
* **Where:** Hilltop Arena (inside the festival grounds and past all the craziness that is the entrance)
* **Why:** Because we all rock *HARD* and all the raving will make us BFFs 4Ever!!!

Planen är alltså att vi ses på Filmstaden i Lund fredagen den 20/4 och ser någon film (förslag?) och sen kanske går och tar några öl efteråt någonstans. Låter bien ey? 

Vore bra om vi vet några dagar i förväg vilken film vi ska se och hur många vi är så vi kan reservera platser. 

In case there's someone who doesn't speak swedish who's interested: I've got a free ticket to the cinema that expires the 24 and I've got no one to go with. So basically I'm asking reddit for company. The plan is to meet at Filmstaden in Lund the 20th and go see a movie (suggestions?) and then afterwards go drink a few beers somewhere. Sounds good ey?

Edit: eftersom Iron Sky har premiär den 18e så tycker jag att det skulle vara passande att se den (annars är det risk att folk redan har sett filmen) så jag bestämmer helt enkelt att det blir den. Om inte beslutet möts av massiva protester förstås. Sen vore det bra om folk meddelade senast 12.00 på onsdag om de kommer så jag kan reservera platser.

I figure that as many people as I see browsing reddit in meetings, there must be at least a few.

Since we're all just getting back from the holidays and the LHC isn't running, I propose the first (to my knowledge) CERN/UN Reddit Meetup in Geneva.  Since there will probably be a prolonged debate between me and the two other people who reply to this post, I would propose Friday February 3 at 7 PM as a possible meetup time.  If anyone has any suggestions for a place, I'm open to ideas.

Anybody who isn't slowly burning out their 20s looking at proton collisions and/or peace agreements but who lives in Geneva is also more than welcome!

UPDATE: I was thinking maybe we can go to the Eagle &amp; Key in Geneva.  It's about 100 feet from Coutance.  It's a pretty decent little place that serves beer and pizza and I'm sure some other stuff.  I'm not sure what time people are keen.  As far as I know, only two people have responded.

Is it too forward to mention the orgy? Maybe. It seems forward to me.

I don't know the city, have never been to the city, and don't know when or where this should be held. Preferably this wouldn't be in a bar, or at least in one that cards (Yay being eighteen), and considering the response I got with the /r/Askreddit post it will probably have to be somewhere that can handle a large group.

Any ideas and/or interest in coming?

I like the park idea, since I wasn't a big fan of the long rectangular table. I felt like we were all divided in half :(

So, the reason you all waited at least one whole minute (!!) to see this post. Pictures!

Unfortunately my camera decided to hate me last night, so my pictures turned out like CRAP. Apparently there was a smudge on the lens making all the pictures look weird and it threw off the white balance. LAME.

That's me and 6000-some-odd other people in this town.

I'm pretty sure I saw an iPhone here, once.  We have 3 bars, one main street and recently got an Arby's... that was the town highlight of the last year or so.

I discovered the /meetup/ subreddit a few days ago, and saw that it was pretty active.  So, as [almost] a joke, I posted Sequim, WA.  Within a couple of hours, my Reddit envelope went from grey to reddish-orange.  I clicked on it.  My jaw dropped.

Someone from Sequim, who lived just a few blocks from me, also surfs Reddit on a regular basis.  Regular enough, at least, to flip through the MeetUps section right after I had posted about Sequim.

We talked a bit ([Epic, geeky, D&amp;D-referencing thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/9xvq7/sequim_wa_fat_chance_anyone_will_be_coming/)) and eventually decided to meet at a local bar.

I brought my fiance and a few large friends.  He brought a tough looking guy with cut-off sleeves (who was actually pretty awesome... shout out to Elias!) to make sure I wasn't an axe murderer.

There were drinks ($1 Tequila shots are *not* my friend), there were many Reddit references (""I would *so* upvote this Busch Lite!"") and, ultimately, an [Epic Sequim Meetup photograph](http://i.imgur.com/gCcyO.jpg) on the back deck of said bar.

It was my first MeetUp ever.  It was a success.  We are better people for it.

Also, he will likely be joining my D&amp;D game.  Thank you Reddit!  You've helped me realize that I am not the only geek in my quiet, little pissant, redneck, podunk, jerk-water, green-horn, one-horse, crud-hole, right-wing, inbred, unkept, out-of-date, white-trash, kick-ass town!",,False,,t5_2qn4t,True,,,True,t3_9z3z7,http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/9z3z7/sequim_wa_meetup_a_success_story/,

My [SO](http://www.reddit.com/user/foxfulness) and I are going to be roadtripping through the Pacific Northwest in mid-August, and we're looking for a few places to stay.  For those who are not familiar with [Couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/help.html), it's a non-profit with this mission statement:

""CouchSurfing seeks to internationally network people and places, create educational exchanges, raise collective consciousness, spread tolerance, and facilitate cultural understanding.""

Basically, it's a site that helps put you in contact with people all over the world who have a spare bedroom, couch or even just a floor and can put you up for the evening.  I used it a few years ago when I took a 3-week roadtrip through the southern US, and I had one of the best times of my life.  I stayed with 14 different people and had a positive experience with all of them.

In any case, the two of us are looking for people to stay with or maybe meet up for a group camping trip in the following cities:

* Billings, MT  -  8/12  (edit: no longer need lodging on this night)

* Spokane, WA  -  8/13

* Seattle, WA  -  8/14

* Vancouver, BC  -  8/15 &amp; 8/16

* Portland &amp; Cannon Beach, OR  -  8/17 (camping on the beach, wanna come?)

* Boise, ID  -  8/18

* Lava Hot Springs, ID  -  8/19  (camping &amp; tubing the river)

If sleeping arrangements aren't possible, we'd be interested in simply meeting up with a few folks (especially in Vancouver) and checking out what the city has to offer, maybe grabbing lunch and a beer or something.  Locals have a better idea of what's fun and what's not than AAA guidebooks do.
