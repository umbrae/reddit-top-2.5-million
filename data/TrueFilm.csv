I went to advanced search on IMDb, set the vote count to low numbers, and kept narrowing the movies down until I had a definite list of movies that are incredibly well reviewed, but only have a few votes.

I kept the vote count high enough so that the movie has a few reviews and proof that it exists, but low enough that I'll get more under appreciated films on the list. Also, I set the review score high, so the movies would most likely be of quality.

I understand that most, if not all of these movies are foreign, but we're looking for lesser known quality, no matter the language.

I will provide IMDb links, and if possible, Youtube links as well. So, here's the list, enjoy!:

If people really think that this is the ""direction"" that the subreddit is heading, please look at the front page or through our history. There is no ""direction"" or overwhelming influx of discussions on teen sex comedies and don't let this post trick you into thinking that there is.
On our front page right now we have posts about the use of colour in a Kurosawa film, the legacy of Universal horror from the 30's, a discussion about an Italian auteur who made sparse, beautiful films, an interpretation of a modern auteur's magnum opus and an ongoing debate about what makes a James Bond film.

Does this seem like a ""direction"" or does this cover a pretty wide base of cinema? I feel as though almost every corner of cinema, certainly in a critical sense, is explored on this subreddit and I find it sad that one or two submissions about *Superbad* and *Juno* suddenly indicate that the subreddit is being overran with idiots. This simply isn't the case, it is just that submissions regarding lesser known but critically admired films like the Japanese serial killer film *Vengeance is Mine* or Ken Russell's cult hit *The Devils* focus on films that haven't been seen by as many people. Hopefully the most this sub can do is open people's eyes to what cinema has to offer on a broader scale so they can build a better understanding of the medium and come back with a genuine discussion to be had. 

There were one or two points that the OP made which I agree with, such as titles of submissions being too vague and meaningless and we are taking these observations on board for sure. But please don't let one or two posts about films that you may not admire get in the way of a subreddit that I am personally very proud of and that continues to open up awesome discussions on film on a daily basis. Just ignore the conversations you care very little about and move onto one that you want to partake in.

We constantly get compared to other large subreddits such as AskHistorians and it's been said before but I'll reiterate, **opinions on cinema are not as easy to moderate as opinions on history.** I think the reasons for this are quite clear and that is why our moderation is more lax than theirs. That being said, we delete numerous submissions and posts every day so if something slips through the net, feel free to report it to us with an explanation as to why it should be deleted. There is usually one of us around to deal with this and we actually care a lot about what our users think so we will definitely listen to you. We take ideas on board so message us and get involved, we're not as horrible as you might think!

1345136777.0,277,self.TrueFilm,ybu6e,Superbad: The serious approach,323,46,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/ybu6e/superbad_the_serious_approach/,"Recently I was about to watch Superbad, and I asked a roommate if he wanted to join.  He replied saying he's not into ""those kinds of movies.""  It made me realize that it is a film that could potentially turn off a lot of people with it's juvenile dialogue and over-the-top plot.

But here's my opinion on why it's a great film:  First of all, it is an extremely relatable movie for me.  I grew up around people who were almost exactly like those characters, constantly obsessing over the pursuit of girls and alcohol, using dick jokes and ragging on friends as a genuine form of communication. 

These are the kids that grew up watching those embellished 80s and 90s high school movies that showed kids driving beamers to parties with full liquor cabinets, slutty girls, jocks, etc.  They have formed in their minds an ideal world where having sex is as simple as party+alcohol+girl=sex.  

The beginning of the movie is constantly reinforcing this misguidedly logical approach, most notably the conversation in the convenience store about how many handjobs lead to a blowjob which leads to sex, etc. This leads to their conversation about how they need to have sex a certain number of times before going to college.

So they spend the bulk of the film pursuing alcohol to get girls drunk in order to have sex.  Even once they're at the party, this ""logic"" continues, with Michael Cera's character questioning the morality of hooking up with a girl who is shitfaced.  He is informed that if he is also drunk, it's okay, so he goes into the bathroom to swill down some ""sex elixer.""  

By the end, the dream is shattered.  Michael Cera's girl ends up vomiting all over the place, while Jonah Hill's doesn't even drink, in fact his drunkenness becomes his downfall, literally.  When the cops show up, Hill realizes what matters most is his friendship with Cera, so he saves him.  As they are walking back, they betray their childishness, expressing a desire to have a sleepover and eat pizza bagels like when they were kids. As they fall asleep, their drunkenness allows them to express their true love and admiration for one another, something they constantly cover up with dick joke defenses for fear of appearing weak or uncool. 

The next day, it's relatively back to normal as they shoot the shit shopping for pants.  When they see the girls in a sober context, they are able to make plans that allow them to get closer in a real way, without the social lubricant of alcohol.  As Hill rides down the escalator, he looks longingly back at Cera, expressing at once his sadness and his exhilaration at the realization that this is how true relationships are created.  He must leave his comfort zone, his bro, and invest real interest in a woman.  The glitzy dream of Hollywood high school movies is not, in fact, real life. 

It may be close to my heart because I can so easily relate to all elements of this film, especially the characters.  Because of this, it is one of the most refreshingly authentic films I have seen in a long time, and I find it to be as serious as it is humorous.  Thoughts?

Edit: Not to be ""that guy,"" but this is my first post in this sub, and I have to thank everyone for such good discussion, even though half of the top thread has been obliterated for some reason.

Well, it's unsettling to me. More and more often come discussion threads that, frankly, for anyone who is serious about discussing film, don't need to be discussed. A lot of movies come out every year... hell, every single week. The majority of them are nothing special. They are formulaic, pander to the lowest common denominator, and make money because going to a theatre to see a movie is entertainment. There are also quite a few films each year, and many over the past few decades, that are brilliant pieces of cinema, which truly are worthy of discussion. The Citizen Kanes and the Kubrick films etc etc which employ film techniques that no/few other director or artist has thought of. These movies change how we view film, and even the world around us. 

Additionally, those discussion threads about great films exist plenty. But often I find myself a bit disappointed that the discussion never goes deeper than to speak about the character development, mention that ""cinematography is great"", and that's about it. I want to know *why* this film is great. *Why* is the cinematography interesting or unique? What message is being conveyed by the artists **and how do they use cinematic techniques to convey it?** Or else, why would I see this film from 40 years ago, as opposed to just going out and renting the most popular one in a Redbox?  

""Let's discuss Fight Club"" doesn't really inspire a strong discussion - it's open ended, and sets no tone. ""Let's discuss how David Fincher builds suspense in Fight Club"". This opens up a specific, high-level conversation which causes comments to speak about the cinematic elements, more than stating that they are good. This is just one example (although for a film class I wrote 10 pages on that question and also compared the elements to Se7en). People dedicate their lives to film studies, I'm sure many people in this subreddit do. .

Im not trying to be mean or at all pretentious here, but I just think that /r/truefilm should have a higher-level of discussion that what one could see in /r/movies. I just don't think we can have a Werner Herzog banner and discuss whether or not we liked The 40 Year Old Virgin. If the majority disagrees, that's fine, and I'll search elsewhere for ""in-depth discussions about film"".

* The cinematography was beautiful. The way it swerved around the house in the beginning and the end made it feel like it was inside of a doll house.
* The actors (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) shared such a cute, sensitive, raw and innocent connection, which I think is mostly natural and only about 50% acting. Their lack of the need to act amplified their natural awkwardness and body movements, which for me made the film even more raw and unique.
* The film location was absolutely idillic and beautiful, I could almost feel the gush of wind during the overhead shots of the landscape (okay maybe because the a/c was on)
* Loved the fact that ""Social Services"" was represented by one person (Tilda Swinton) and she even refers to herself as that. Her cold, robotic movements and monotonic voice was so perfect for portraying the darker side of the SS.
* I was honestly, completely sucked into the film, I believed every line that was delivered out of a character's mouth.
* Edward Norton. Nuff said.

So with my rather long list of films from all era's I've seen, it's interesting to me to see how acting in the films themselves changed.

Films from the beginning of the ""talkies"" up until about the mid to late 60's have an especially different flavor. The dialogue is more formal, enunciation is more pronounced, fight scenes are stiffer with more exaggerated moves (the wind up and punch), faces don't seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression. Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind them.

My personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater, where facial expression is not as important as vocal expression. Additionally movements had to be more pronounced to be visible to the entire audience. Additionally, the audio recording equipment of the time was not as high of a quality as it is today requiring the actors be be more formal in their pronunciation. By the time the late 50's into the 60's and beyond, a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater, causing them to shift to a more naturalistic style.

Am I off base on this one?

Analysis of film on a macroscopic level is something that's always interested me, and my first kind of forays into the history of cinema and its function as a mirror to society came through watching American Beauty and Fight Club in high-school, no joke. In addition to their somewhat hamfisted comments on society (that sixteen-year-old me *loved*), I think they both reflected this crisis of masculinity faced by the 1990s grey-collar man, and that opened up my eyes to the notion that films might be more than just stories, but rather a reflection of a 'cultural consciousness'. I'm not going to delve too deeply into Fight Club here because people will probably give me shit for it, but I genuinely feel there's an interesting subtext in those films (also present in Office Space and Falling Down) that a lot of people ignore.

^^^please ^^^dont ^^^stop ^^^reading

The 'shared nightmares' approach to horror film analysis follows on from that line of thinking, and I feel that it's pretty spot-on at times. There are just too many elegant correlations for me to not buy into it a little bit. The basic premise is that successful horror films become successful because they tap into something that resonates with a lot of people, and scares them. Subsequently, successful horror film trends can be said to reflect the collective fears ('nightmares') of a society. Frequently, popular horror tropes have beared a close symbolic resemblance to social ills or geopolitical threats.

Take for instance the Kaiju genre (giant Lovecraftian monsters, like Godzilla) that was widely successful in post-WW2 Japan but never really caught on in any other time or place. The original *Gojira* (1954) is a pretty blunt recount of the war (albeit with a [happier ending](/spoiler)), and the destruction of Tokyo by an unstoppable foreign force bears obvious resemblance to the havoc wrought by US bombings only a decade previously. Subsequent monsters represent newer threats to the japanese populace, it's kind of like a schlockier *Animal Farm* (you can find a detailed writeup of kaiju history [here](http://www.historyvortex.org/GodzillaSymbolism.html)).

On the other side of the pond, horror films were capitalising on fear of the atomic, and anything related to the meddling of science and it's disastrous consequences (Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man). Later, Hollywood would prey on the 'Red Scare', and the infiltration of radical ideology into American suburbia would manifest as alien invaders (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Man from Planet X, Invaders from Mars). I read an article wherein the author speculated that the Abu Ghraib scandal was to blame for the rise in 'torture porn' like Hostel, Wolf Creek, and Saw (I to VII, haha).

An important point to make is that this kind of 'cultural consciousness' talk doesn't necessarily imply that we're all part of some greater linked hivemind, in case anyone was reading it that way. It does sound a bit like mystical pseudo-science sometimes, when you put it like that. When a film or trend in film is successful though, it demonstrates that the antagonist or adversary in the film resonates with a large number of people, or a significant slice of society. Of course there are always going to be people who don't find kaiju scary and never will, but you can still draw conclusions about society as a whole based on the fears of a majority. Of course there are outliers too... Pacific Rim is a kaiju film coming out this month but it's existence (and presumably, it's success at the box office) doesn't mean that there's paranoia about nuclear armageddon. -Sometimes a throwback is just a throwback. Early horror films seemed to get by on having some creepy monsters and I can't see any particular sort of symbolic underpinning in werewolves or vampires, they're just scary entities that people eventually grew tired of.

________

Anyway, the big antagonists of horror right now are zombies. Consider the qualities of a zombie: mindless and lacking identity, infectious, slowly but steadily unstoppable, many in number, sometimes comical and sometimes vicious... As a disclaimer I'm going to quote /u/fourwordsbackwards when I say 'I'm half bullshitting for the sake of discussion, but are you feeling me?'. Let's discuss anyway:

* **What does the present ubiquity of zombie films reflect, in terms of our 'shared nightmares'? Overpopulation? Decline of individualism? Fear of immigrants?**

* **Does the huge success of superhero films say something about the dreams and desires of society**, or is their dominance simply attributable to the widely succesful Hollywood formula of rehashing known intellectual properties?

* **What do you think about this whole method of cultural analysis anyway?** Is it just seeing correlations where none exist? In any case, tell me exactly how stupid and wrong I am below.

* **What other cinema trends correlate with historical events or the past or present zeitgest?** Anything outside of horror?

* Is anyone familiar enough with contemporary Asian horror cinema and Asian culture to be able to identify some of the trends and speculate on their origin? They seem to have a preoccupation with hair and drains that I've always found completely baffling.

I was a huge fan of the future plot lines and found the story of the composer and his gay lover to be the weakest of the bunch. I found the acting spectacular, especially from Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, Hugo Weaving, and Jim Broadbent. The soundtrack was also wonderful, as were the special effects. 

I can see why some people would criticize the ""everything is connected"" theme but I admired the way the stories connected, both in the obvious and not so obvious ways.

1359221800.0,179,self.TrueFilm,17bmej,My problem with plot-holes. ,208,29,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17bmej/my_problem_with_plotholes/,"In recent years the term ""plot-hole"" seems to have become more and more prevalent. In some ways this has been a good thing for pointing out inconsistencies within films but there is also rampant misuse of the term ""plot-hole"". A ""plot-hole"" should be something which contradicts information given within the film, something which ruins whatever the film is trying to do or say. Yet the term ""plot-hole"" is pretty much now attributed to anything a film doesn't explicitly show us. 

For example: Looper and The Dark Knight Rises. Firstly, I think there are a few real plot-holes in TDKR but people seem to focus on the bogus ones. These two films have generated a lot of discussion but sadly much of that discussion gets derailed by apparent ""plot-holes"". When it comes to Looper, people accuse it of plot-holes when in reality it just decides not to tell us some things that are completely irrelevant to what the film is trying to say. The film could explain in detail why the time machines can't be used to zap people into the middle of the ocean or a furnace, but that wouldn't be relevant. And the fact that it doesn't tell us at least lets us know that it's not relevant and that there must be a reason for it. Not every sci-fi film is Primer so the details aren't always what's important. Similarly the film could detail exactly what happens to the Rainmakers men who (SPOILER) shoot Bruce Willis's wife, but this isn't their story so what would be the point? The film asks us to just fill in the blanks ourselves, which some people sadly find annoying. The film tells us that murder is near impossible so despite their attempts to burn the evidence they're probably screwed. But doesn't that tell us how terrifyingly powerful the Rainmaker must be if his henchmen will still carry out his work even when they know they're done for? Similarly in TDKR, people ask 'How did Bruce get back to Gotham?' even though it doesn't matter. Do we need ten minutes of Bruce Wayne calling in favours or hiding on the backs of trucks just to fulfil some people's need to be told everything? These loose ends should make us think more than they make us dismiss. Like the whole Eagles conundrum in the Lord of the Rings films. It bothers some people that at the end we see how easily the Eagles can fly in and out of Mordor and this makes them ask why they didn't fly the ring there in the first place. This makes some people call the films stupid but it should make people think about why the eagles don't help within the context of the universe. I think the books say that eagles keep away from the lands of men because they would be shot down due to their penchant for sheep. And they steer clear from Mordor whilst the Nazgul and Witchking are still around. Did the films need to tell us that? No, the fact that it doesn't tells us enough. The eagles have a reason for not helping so just enjoy the journey. 


The reason I hate these accusations is because it's such empty criticism. Imagine if we could no longer discuss Citizen Kane because people de-railed the conversation asking who specifically heard him say his final words. Or when discussing Rashomon people get bogged down in asking ""How on earth could a baby have been there the whole time, if it was raining that hard it would have started crying well before then"". In both cases it doesn't matter to what's actually important about the film and it detracts from discussion about what is important. I would love to be able to talk about the failings of Bane as a character but some people seem more concerned with pointing out ""How did he know where Bruce's weaponry was?"". We gain nothing from this and we miss out on discussing what's actually interesting about these films. 

Does anyone else notice this double standard between older and newer films? Is it just the popularity of these films that makes it seem like most of the ""discussion"" is about plot-holes? Or am I being too forgiving of these films and should we scrutinise every detail? Maybe every sci-fi film should contain Ellen Page's character from Inception so that there's a character that everything can be endlessly explained to and we as an audience won't need to think.

Most of the participants agree that Nolan's latest Batman film is his worst movie. They frame the discussion around three major criticisms of Nolan's films: ""(1) they have a shoddy grasp of space and time, despite always being centered around chronologies and intercut action; (2) they use political issues and reference-points and take contradictory stances on them (this point applies only to The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises); and (3) most of them use personal traumas (more often than not, Nolan's ""dead wife"" motif, which appears twice in The Dark Knight Rises) and public tragedies as plot points, but have no sense of the emotional.""

Me and a couple of the other mods have recently been discussing a brand new concept for this subreddit. As the user base grows, we are starting to realise there are quite a few people whose knowledge of film and willingness to discuss and recommend their favourites is being sorely misrepresented on Reddit as a whole. Very often on r/movies, the most popular and interesting posts are based around ""What are your favourite [insert topic here]?"" questions but I'm sure that many of you have noticed the same movies brought up again and again, without any explanation or afterthought as to why a user has chosen that specific film. Sadly, when posts of a similar nature have been submitted to TrueFilm, they often yield a more varied list of films but come up against the same problems, with users coming out of the woodwork and simply posting film titles with very little explanation as to their decision. 

Here at TrueFilm, we are hoping to emulate the popularity of these types of posts whilst maintaining the high quality of discourse that is seen from a lot of our users on a daily basis and hopefully finding new, exciting films for each other to explore. Hence the new concept of **The TrueFilm Inventory**!

For starters, we will be posting a bi-weekly question to the user base along the lines of a simple ""What is your favourite..."" or ""In your opinion, which film has the best..."" and then giving you guys the opportunity to have your say, hopefully stirring up some good-natured debate and passionate recommendations. If this proves to be popular (and if new posters can abide by the rules) then we may make it a weekly submission.

The first of these posts will be cropping up in the next few days and I'm hoping you will all be able to get on board with it. We don't ask for much from people who post on the thread except they maintain an intelligent, well reasoned argument for their choice and try to make it longer than just two or three sentences. If we simply get a rush of film titles with very little reasoning behind them we'll have to close down the submission and forget about it. Users who break this rule twice will also be banned from the subreddit because, come on, it's not a difficult rule to follow. These rules will be reiterated in the first post.

Everyone up for this? Any suggestions on the topics or how we can make sure the quality of the posts are maintained would be welcomed. Would be a great addition to the sidebar if we can eventually compile all these discussions into one post as well.

EDIT: I think it is also important to add that these will be the only list/question based posts on this subreddit and any others will be removed. Rather than this being a tyrannical grab at power (mwuahaha) this just keeps things moving along steadily instead of our sub becoming overran by people asking for recommendations because they can't be bothered to do some research of their own.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1368103779.0,,,True,t3_1dztvh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dztvh/the_truefilm_inventory_definitive_films_in/,moderator
1359898975.0,168,self.TrueFilm,17t0v2,[Film Discussion] No Country for Old Men,199,31,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17t0v2/film_discussion_no_country_for_old_men/,"I wanted to take some time and talk about [No Country for Old Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_%28film%29). It's one of my favorite movies, and definitely a great example for why many people consider 2007 one of the greatest years in film history.

At its core, No Country for Old Men is a straight forward story, and does a good job of keeping things to an absolute minimal without feeling empty. All actions have consequences, character motives are made clear, there are no needless scenes of stale exposition, the pacing is at a constant, and we know who everybody is in relation to the story. Those points seem like a given, but many movies fail to cover them all, which ultimately hurts the film. Ambiguity can be a wonderful tool or technique in film, but it must be used appropriately. What I love about No Country is its lack of ambiguity. In a film like this, its important that things have finality, and I want to explore that idea, and a few other little things I've drawn from the film.

Now, before I go any further I want to say that this post will contain pretty much every possible spoiler for No Country, so if you haven't seen the movie, you probably shouldn't read this. 

Also, I am not using this chance to suggest that anything I've drawn from the movie was intentional or intended to give the feel a deeper meaning. For all I know, I could be wrong about a lot of things, so don't look at this as an educational guide to the film. Instead, consider this a way to show that you *can* drawn these sorts of elements out of a film and make these kinds of conclusions *regardless* of the author's intent. The benefit of being able to do this is that over time, when you see a film that *does* have these elements hidden throughout the film, you'll be able to pick up on them and track them much easier. So try to look at this as merely for entertainment and ultimately for the sake of generating discussion about a few topics.

One final note! Any link to an ALBUM will have descriptions for the photos, so please read those as some contain relevant info.

First, I want to talk about our lead characters, and how important (or unimportant) it is that filmmakers follow an established rule, or an audience expectation, for the protagonist and antagonist of a film. At a passing glance, we can assume that Llewelyn Moss is the protagonist of the film. And why not? He's the first of the main three we see, we're with him the most, the story *seems* to follow him and his ultimate goal, and most of the action seems to revolve around him.

But by the end of the film, it's obvious that the real protagonist of the film is Ed Tom Bell. We hear his words first, most of the themes around the movie deal with his emotions, and most importantly he is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. Chigurh and Bell are ultimately what the film is about in terms of what they represent. Moss is merely a tool in the story to emphasize the underlining theme of the film which is that death comes for us all. The film is, in many ways, simply a story about dealing with death. Not just dealing it, but *facing* it. So let's start there.

Bell is more than just our protagonist and his character has more depth than simply being a man facing his own mortality. Bell, in this story and the world we *see*, represents goodness. We're shown and told this in a couple of different ways. First of all, most obvious and without the need for further explanation, is that he's a sheriff. But there is more to it than that.

Throughout the film we see Bell shown in light colors, in well lit environments, and generally surrounded by white colors. In the most simple use of symbolism, we're subconsciously being told that Bell is our good guy, and a representation of good.

[Bell / White / Goodness](http://imgur.com/a/N2GWM#0)

On the opposite side of things, we have Chigurh. Chigurh is the leading cause of death in this film, and he's typically shown in dark rooms, dark environments, and dark clothing. In the most simple of use of symbolism, we're subconsciously being told that Chigurh is our bad guy, and a representation of bad / death.

[Chigurh / Black / Evil / Death](http://imgur.com/a/4nDdO#0)

To further show that Chigurh is death, we can draw a comparison between Anton Chigurh and Death himself from Ingmar Bergman's [The Seventh Seal](http://imgur.com/a/gBUKV#1).

Duality is something that the Coen brothers love to deal with. A lot of their films death with the idea of contradictions, opposites, and duality. No Country isn't any different. In those photos we can see some attempt to show the differences between Chigurh and Bell by the general use of color and light, but they *are* representing two sides of life that are a constant. Good and evil are things that have always existed and always will. Now, I suppose you could make an argument that neither exist in the real world, since the concepts are limited to human life and our perception of the world and how it is filtered through the lens of our laws of morality, but that's an entirely different subject. Let's just assume that here on Earth, there *is* good and evil. They are [connected](http://imgur.com/a/rJSWv#3), and always there. As is death.

And death is an important issue in the film, and in our lives. It comes for us all. There is a moment in the film when Moss is [talking](http://i.imgur.com/IHzEjfC.jpg) to a woman outside of a motel. He says he's [looking](http://i.imgur.com/l8ybjTB.jpg) for what's coming. He's referring to Chigurh, so it could be said he's looking for his death. The woman says [this](http://i.imgur.com/h5kd7al.jpg), and is totally right. And we know she is right simply by looking at the character's actions, deaths, and how often things come by surprise.

[What's comin'!](http://imgur.com/a/1Q8Iu#0)

After Bell chooses to face what he believes will likely be his death (when he enters the motel and imagine Chigurh waiting for him), he chooses to retire. It's interesting to me because Ellis says that you can't stop what's coming. He says, ""It ain't all waitin' on you...that's vanity"". He was a lawman too.

So much of the movie surrounds the idea that death *will* take you, and that while you can't control that, you can sometimes find yourself in a position that allows you accept it. Not everybody gets that chance.

At the end of the film, Bell tells his wife about the dream he had. He explains that his father is already dead, and in the dream they are both riding horses. But his [father](http://i.imgur.com/7rbp2as.jpg) goes on [ahead](http://i.imgur.com/c8j9iqY.jpg). Bell is dreaming about his [death](http://i.imgur.com/CRnHJH6.jpg), and he seems upset by having to say all this out loud. Maybe he doesn't realize what he's dreaming about, but his wife seems to. We do, or we're supposed to. It ties in very well to idea of not seeing it coming versus [knowing](http://i.imgur.com/NODo4fT.jpg) it, and [accepting](http://i.imgur.com/61MxEPI.png) it.

There isn't much I wanted to say about those topics, but I did want to point out a few minor moments in the movie that I really enjoyed, just as a way of finishing this all up.

When Moss is asking about Chigurh, Carson explains that [he doesn't have a sense of humor](http://i.imgur.com/hyYe0x5.png). Later in the movie, we can see that isn't entirely true. When Moss asks if Carson is there, Chigurh makes this [joke](http://i.imgur.com/gBgB8sw.png). He even looks at Caron, a dead body mind you, in feigned [surprise](http://i.imgur.com/q4o2Jwi.png) after hearing how angry Moss is after Chigurh threatened to kill his wife.

Another little detail I love is that we establish that Carson has [seen](http://i.imgur.com/3P3Vnh0.png) Chigurh before. It is later [implied](http://i.imgur.com/jaWgz2U.png) that this on its own is some sort of [accomplishment](http://i.imgur.com/eZW1DUc.png). That idea is further solidified when the accountant asks if he's going to be killed, to which Chigurh responds with a partial [smile](http://i.imgur.com/qC4f9u4.png) on his face. When he asks ""do you see me"" he's not asking in the sense that it's bribery, but in the sense that simply seeing Chigurh is enough reason for you to die. It may all explain, or at least shed light on, why Chigurh seems to be enjoying [this](http://imgur.com/a/LFRsa#0) moment so much. Carson has seen him and lived, and now Chigurh finally [catches up with him](http://i.imgur.com/9eczLE1.jpg).

Lastly, I wanted to point out something I noticed while watching the film. It's important to note that framing, blocking, lighting, and spacial orientation are deliberate (more especially with competent directors and DOPs), so when something tends to show up over and over again, it's fair to assume there is a reason behind it. And even if there isn't a deep meaning behind it, it's fun (I think) to find patterns through a film or even a director's filmography. In No Country, we can see a pattern of [reflections](http://imgur.com/a/6NqHO#0).

Whether coincidence or entirely deliberate, it's interesting to note that so much of the film's concepts revolve around life and death. Good and evil. Where there is one, there is the other.

The Coen brothers also have a pattern of showing [shoes and using low angles to show action \(normally people walking\)](http://imgur.com/a/aMoAj#0). I already made a post about it, but I wanted to use it here to just for fun.

So anyway, that's my general take on No Country. What about you guys? What do you think about the film, the characters, what they represent, and the ultimate point of the film? Is there anything that you've noticed throughout the film that you feel is important or worth mentioning? What do you love or hate about it? And what can be said about using a main character the way No Country does? Bell is in the movie less than Chigurh and Moss (I think), but he's the main character in the sense that it's his story.

Anyway, I hope you found this enjoyable and I look forward to hearing your points of view and thoughts as well.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1359903461.0,,,True,t3_17t0v2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17t0v2/film_discussion_no_country_for_old_men/,
1348742497.0,161,self.TrueFilm,10k2w2,The real problem with Prometheus,200,39,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10k2w2/the_real_problem_with_prometheus/,"There are many valid complaints about scientist idiocy, wtf-moments and crewmember stupidity. *But these are only part of the problem*.


To see what I mean, I will make a quick comparison with *Alien* here.
In *Alien*, every set-piece, character, piece of technology was created with care in regards of being believable. [Verisimilitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude) is the word. **Suspension of disbelief comes easy when a filmmaker so carefully crafts everything in the movie to perfection.** The service corridors were believable, the characters Parker and Brett were believable, and therefore the actions of these characters made sense in context, and were consistent with the characterization up to that point in the plot. (Note: believability does not necessarily mean ""realistic"" in this context!)


*Prometheus* contained no characterization, no verisimilitude, no care was put into how the audience should believe everything right from the start. 

Let's compare two scenes from *Alien* and *Prometheus*:


In *Alien*, Kane sticks his face into an egg. Is this stupid? You betcha! Are we (the audience) bothered by this? Hell no. Why? Because the scene is so exccellently crafted and put into context plotwise and character-wise, that we accept this character behavior immediately.


First of all, it comes right after the awe-inspiring derelict discovery sequences. Dallas, Lambert and Kane are wandering around in that strange biomechanical environment, where there are mindblowing discoveries lie around, scattered randomly. We have just seen a fossilized alien lifeform, weird devices, and a strange hole in the floor which leads to a sort of cargo bay with thin blue mist. Make no mistake: these facts are only partially help you to absorb what is happening in the scene. The other half is direction and atmosphere. This is where *Alien* excels. I can't describe it properly here, you need to watch it.


So Kane goes up to an egg, and sticks his face right into it. But this is OK, since the previous sequences hypnotized us into a mindset where we want to discover what that is. We would like to do exactly what Kane does. We want to know. Yes, in retrospect, that was an idiotic move, but there were no clear signs of danger there, and Kane thought his suit and helmet/visor will protect him - resulting in a consistent, believable and logical scene.


Now let's analyze the scene in *Prometheus* where Milburn tries to ""tame"" the cobra-like alien. Right from the start, there are serious problems with this. The movie did not really build a context, we don't really know these characters. About Milburn, we know exactly nothing, apart from the fact that he is terrified of alien corpses (which is an understandable character trait, even for a biologist. It's not unbelievable, and the problem is not with that). About Fifield, we at least know that he does not want to make friends, he is only in it for the money. Fair enough, but somehow Parker and Brett - who were also only in it for the money - seemed much more human than him.


What scenes preceded this encounter? We got a mildly interesting cave-exploration scene (nowhere near the quality of similar sequences in *Alien*), where we concluded that the most dangerous/creepy room is the alien stone face/vase storage room. So when these two get spooked, where are they going into hiding? Exactly there! Now this is not logical - Parker and Brett would have never chosen a hiding place like that. But if we accept that, there is another problem with the scene: the cobra-like thing showed obvious signs of pissed off behavior. There is no way a biologist could not pick these up!


Kane gets a pass, since the egg showed only a little movement, there was no way to predict what is going to happen. It was brilliantly written as the part of the dangerous randomness of the Alien. Here, we get a lifeform that can only kill, when its prey is dumb enough - I can't write this down without cringing - *to try to pet it...?*


The scene would have worked better if they would have realized the threat and tried to flee the room and the cobra thing would have followed them with incomprehensible speed. That would have been more believable and consistent, even with the general themes of the movie. But the scene as it is, is poorly constructed, and does not have a positive effect on the plot.


This was just one example of how the idiotic behavior hurts *Prometheus* in general. I could write up a similar analysis of the Captain and Charlize Theron scene, and a couple of other scenes. These moments of random idiotic character behavior could have worked in the movie - but they did not work because of poor directing. And we have got Ridley Scott to blame for that.


**TL;DR: Prometheus has really poorly directed scenes that hurt the plot.**

Just a quick meta post to clear some things up.

It's been awesome to see a recent influx in subscribers over the last few days since TrueFilm was featured in a r/bestof post courtesy of our excellent moderator Vocalities and his analogical reasoning. Now seems to be a good time to just reiterate some of the rules around here so new subscribers can get a feel for how this sub is moderated and won't feel too put out if one of their submissions or posts gets deleted.

Firstly, have a quick glance at the sidebar rules and you might get a general idea of how things go around here. 
One important thing to remember is that this subreddit welcomes discussion about absolutely any kind of film, mainstream or otherwise, and does not discriminate against certain viewpoints as long as they are polite and well written (difficult to implement on the internet of course but we try our best!).

The main purpose of this sub is to generate intellectual discussion regarding the medium of film. As a lot of you know r/movies is the most popular film themed subreddit around here and serves Reddit well, being an excellent hub for movie news whilst swarming with popular recommendations as well as generating some light discussion about the popular films of the modern era. TrueFilm is here for movie viewers who want to discuss film from a more detailed point of view than you might find on r/movies. This can be analytical or simply passionate discourse but I'll reiterate, we don't allow one sentence responses that bring nothing to the conversation. The other moderators and I routinely delete comments that are too short or lacking in content. This isn't because we feel that TrueFilm should be exclusive to film students or self proposed ""experts"" but purely because we need to differentiate ourselves from r/movies and this is the easiest way to do it. If you are willing to put a little thought into your post instead of simply fishing for karma, you'll fit in around here and, fingers crossed, we shall all hopefully learn something!

If you do want to post a submission here, it might be worth checking to see if the film has been discussed in the past and whether you can bring anything new to the subreddit. More often than not we find ourselves deleting submissions that pop up too often but it's great to see people so interested in film. We are quite proud of our submission history here on TrueFilm so going through our archives is well worth it and you might find something interesting deep in the rabbit hole. And we have recently been talking about adding some archival director conversations to the sidebar so if anyone has any ideas, feel free to message us.

One question that often gets asked on here is ""How can I learn more about film?!"". Whilst none of us here on TrueFilm claim to be experts on every aspect of the language of cinema, we have tried to help a few times with this question. Check out these submissions if you want to get some advice on finding a starting point for your cinematic journey.

It's great to have more subscribers here and we hope you can generate some excellent discussion about the brilliant medium of film.

1358096825.0,157,self.TrueFilm,16hwtp,TrueFilm Club - Week #1 [Voting Thread / Introduction],177,20,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16hwtp/truefilm_club_week_1_voting_thread_introduction/,"The response in the previous discussion thread was overwhelmingly positive, so let's get this show on the road. Here's a brief explanation of what the film club will basically entail, for those not in the know ( courtesy of Vocalities):

&gt;**Vocalities** *5 points 2 days ago* (6|1)

&gt; A film club is a group of people that agree to participate in the following: vote on a movie to watch, watch said movie, and report back at a scheduled time for all the people to talk about the film. It's normally films that the group has not yet seen. It's a way to expand horizons, better understand challenging films, and hear unique perspectives.

____

We'll loosely base the 'rules' of the club on the most upvoted and well-received post, from OneMoreStatistic. This will give the club some structure without limiting film selection too heavily, and also provides a rough timetable.

&gt; **OneMoreStatistic** *25 points 2 days ago* (25|0)

&gt;1. Every two weeks means a new movie.

&gt;2. Every month should have a theme/topic, for example:
 
&gt;* abstract themes like (Revenge, Love, Hope, Conspiracy)
&gt;* a film movement (French New Wave, Italian Neorealism, Dogme 95)
&gt;* the work of a certain director (Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Fellini)
&gt;* films from a certain country (France, Japan, Germany)
&gt;* a niche genre (Film Noir, Psychological Thriller, Mockumentary)

&gt;3. Films should be debated and pushed for which would be the best to watch and why. Any film is under discussion and possible to view just as long as it can be argued to be worth viewing within the context of the theme of the month.

&gt;4. The theme of the month can be chosen by the moderator of the board and/or by debate of the club. If a decision cannot be made a genre is chosen at random by the moderator (or the leader of the club).

OneMoreStatistic originally only suggested abstract themes, but I've broadened his definition to include some of Tomfitzpatrick's suggestions, among others. I hope he doesn't mind!

&gt;**tomfitzpatrick** *7 points 3 days ago* (7|1)

&gt;I think a mix of director of the month, specific film movements and films of a specific country would make great monthly watching.

A major point of contention was how exclusionary to be in terms of film selection, and what criteria would be necessary to filter out populist suggestions. The general sentiment seemed to be that people were worried that an entry-level film like *Inception* or *Pulp Fiction* that everyone has already seen would be voted in each week. But in saying that, films like *Satantango* or *Un Chien Andalou* would probably be poor choices too, in their own way. Try and suggest films that are reasonably accessible and won't drive away participation, at least until the film club is better established. There aren't many ways to quantify the popularity of a film but let's just exercise our judgement here and upvote accordingly. If this becomes an issue (and I don't think it will), we can implement some firmer rules.

**If anyone has issue with any of these guidelines, please post about it below.**

edit: However, please put constructive criticism and meta-discussion in a *separate post* to your film or theme submissions. This way, people can upvote each freely, and film submission votes aren't skewed when attached to a popular opinion on how to run the club, etc. Don't be afraid to post more than once.

__________

I think the simplest way to select films is to have voting threads, wherein people simply make a post with their film suggestion, and the most upvoted post at a predetermined later date is declared the winner.

Two weeks later, hopefully when everyone has tracked down and watched the film, a discussion thread is posted. We would also have held a vote a couple days before the end of the two week period, so the next film can be announced inside the discussion thread.

The monthly topic will be decided sometime in the previous month, in the same way that movies will be decided. **In this thread** we will vote for the first film for the club (free choice), as well as the theme for February! Be sure to put theme submissions, film submissions, and meta-discussion in separate posts.

Here's a rough template for submission and voting...

&gt;**Title** d. by Movie Director

&gt;[Genre], [Year of Release], [[imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/ttXXXXXXX/)], [link to trailer]

&gt;Short spoiler-free description of the film. Ideally you could also explain why it would be a good choice for viewing, and how it relates to the theme of the month (if applicable). Trailer and poster links are optional but not discouraged, because as someone mentioned earlier, trailers can often be misleading or sell a film short. They're also full of goddamn spoilers these days.

For monthly themes, simply bold the title of the theme and then maybe add a small explanation giving a brief background/explanation (if necessary) and explaining why you think it would be interesting.

1361361451.0,150,self.TrueFilm,18vrbi,The rise of pure CGI scenes and unrealistic camera moves in film,184,34,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18vrbi/the_rise_of_pure_cgi_scenes_and_unrealistic/,"During the past 10 years (probably longer) big block buster movies have been starting to include more and more scenes which are purely done with CGI. Movies such as The Avengers and the Hobbit rely very much upon these scenes where less than 5% of the scene is actually shot with a real camera.

This has given the director the possibility to create wild and crazy camera movements. It's quite common these days to have the camera fly around buildings, do 360 degree turns and then jump down a hole. To me these camera movements really distract from the movie and ruin the suspension of disbelief. One of the most memorable occasions of this is in The Hobbit when the fellowship fall down into the goblin caves and the camera flies down and follows them through the tunnel.

This is something which physically cannot be filmed and the camera movement is also one which couldn't be from a PoV of any real person. For some reason, this makes the entire scene feel fake. There's another moment quite like this one when the fellowship is escaping from the goblin king and are fighting their way out, the camera is flying all around the cave doing crazy movements and panning.

I much prefer the more realistic and sedated camera movements and positions of films from the late 90's and to some degree the early 2000's. I find it much easier to ""get into"" the film world when I'm not treated to these crazy and impossible movements. It somehow feels to me that now when technology has made such movements possible they're done simply because they are possible and not because they add anything meaningful to how the story is told. Technique shouldn't IMO be used just because it's possible.

I'm a photographer and in photography there's a bit of a saying that a photograph is overprocessed when the first thing you notice about it is the technique used rather than the image or subject itself. I feel the same about movies. CGI and strange camera movements should only be used when they add to the story, not just because you've got a 3D modeled cave. Good examples of this are in the superman movie, or most of the time the camera is following something that is flying.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_18vrbi,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18vrbi/the_rise_of_pure_cgi_scenes_and_unrealistic/,
1375065292.0,147,self.TrueFilm,1j92nx,Can we discuss the Harry Potter films as films?,219,72,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j92nx/can_we_discuss_the_harry_potter_films_as_films/,"The eight Harry Potter films are quite interesting to me, not just because I'm an avid fan of the source material, but also they're a great testing ground for seeing what a director can do. Few film series have been this successful both critically and commercially, while at the same time keeping strict continuity and yet allowing each film to have its own distinct style. Even in the lesser films in the series there's always something the director brings to the table.

There's some consensus on the series strenghts and weaknesses, but there's still a lot of debate so I'd like to strike up an intelligent discussion about the films as films, disregarding the books as much as possible. If there's one thing I can't stand hearing in a discussion about the movies is the phrase ""Yeah, but it wasn't like that in the book."" That being said, here's my take on the films and their directors.


**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**
*dir: Christopher Columbus*

When people don't think highly of the series or dismiss it as kiddy fodder, I often assume it's because they've only seen Columbus' films. I don't mean that as an insult though, as children's films Columbus did a great job at capturing the whimsy of the story and bringing the world to life. Sorcerer's Stone is exactly what it needs to be, nothing more.

What it did perfectly though was assemble the cast that, though the child actors are a bit rough in the first few films, would grow up to fully embody their roles and really make these films endure. I also have to give him credit for bringing in John Williams whose iconic score is really the emotional backbone for the first three films. I doubt the series would have taken off quite the same way without him.

**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets**
*dir: Christopher Columbus*

Chamber of Secrets continues the success of the first one and while it improves a lot of elements of Stone, namely the sfx and the younger performances, it's also way too long at at times very sloppily put together. This film is perhaps the most blindly faithful to the book of any in the series, but as a result feels a bit more like a rehash of the first than its own unique thing. 

It's my second to least favorite in the series because of just how little it brings to the table in terms of interesting filmmaking. It's still enjoyable, but it's easy to see why Columbus needed to be replaced by a more daring filmmaker.

**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**
*dir: Alfonso Couron*

It's everybody's favorite, and it's easy to see why. Even with some dated effects and overacting from the kids, this film is just gorgeous. Couron's art direction and camera movements are just stellar, and William's score is probably the best thing he's written since Star Wars. This scene and accompanying music in particular is one of my favorite moments in all 8 films. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbAt7yDSKs

But Couron doesn't just focus on the pretty pictures, he gets to the emotional core of why people connect with these characters and manages to push the whole cast and series forward. Unlike Columbus, he doesn't just film the book in the most straightforward way possible, he brings his own stamp to the series. 

A perfect example of this is comparing a scene like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doxxfXqpKYA to a similar scene in Chamber of Secrets http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5qW_UuoTeY . Columbus films things bluntly and locked down. Not terrible, just dry and old fashioned and the film slogs as a result. But Cuoron flies his camera impossibly through a mirror and effortlessly around the room.   He doesn't let the exposition dictate the scene, he dictates the scene around the exposition.


**Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**
*dir: Mike Newell*

GOF isn't the worst film in the series, but it's the one I hate the most for the same reasons I don't care for Chamber of Secrets. It's bloated, overly faithful to the text, and has some of the worst acting in the series. This time it's only more upsetting to me because we'd seen what this series could be. All the elements were in place for Newell to make a great film, but he takes no chances. There are no suprises in the filmmaking in GOF. Everything is as by the numbers in COS only with better special effects and much bigger budget.

What's equally as bland and uninspired as Newell's direction is Patrick Doyle's score. Doyle is a competent composer who's produced some fine soundtracts, but in a film that runs over 2 and a half hours I should be able to find more that one mildly interesting theme. There's little that's outright bad in the film, but as a whole it just seems so flaccid and obligatory. It's like Mike Newell was a chef who inherited the recipes of a much better chef. Sure the food tastes fine, but somethings missing.

**Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix**
*dir: David Yates*

Thank God for David Yates. Not only is OotP my favorite of the series, even though I love POA oh so much, but he managed to shoot new life in the series and then see it to completion. The final films almost feel less like films but rather the continuation of an epic miniseries. It's also worth mentioning that OotP is the only movie not written by Stephen Kloves, and though overall I'd say Kloves did a solid job of helming the series, Michael Goldberg manages to bring much more thematic weight to the film that at times felt lost in the later movies. The movie's not just a continuation of this complex saga, but more about Harry grappling with his own dark side and choosing to overcome it.

Yates brings a precense from behind the camera that was missing from GOF and he also brought on Nicholas Hooper as a composer to bring back some memorable themes to the Harry Potter universe. No one can replace Williams, but tracks like this come close http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcVTAgWUtIE. 

A lot of people don't like this movie I think because this is when the series really departs from its fun fantasy roots and starts delving into more complex emotions and adult themes, but if you're along for the ride I find OotP to be the most satisfying of bunch. 

**Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince**
*dir: David Yates*

If you don't remember what happens in this one, you're not alone. To refresh your memory, I like to call this one: ""The one where everyone does drugs and bones....oh, and Dumbledore dies at the end."" 

There's not much to say about the Half Blood Prince other than that it mostly just feels like filler. Yates' voice is still felt, yet he gives the film a distinct look from the last one. The cast is better than ever, and the movie was even nominated for Best Cinematography, but nothing really happens. The film is really just tying up loose ends and building up to The Deathly Hallows. But it does have some great scenes including this truly amazing set-piece http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6oCIqu_jtE .


**Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
*dir: David Yates*

You know when you're a kid and you want a second bowl of ice cream and your mom for some reason is being super nice and gives you another bowl even though she knows she shouldn't. Then you eat too much ice cream and wish you'd only had the one? That's what The Deathly Hallows are to a nerd like me. I appreciate the grandiose of the second part, and the intimacy of the first, but it's just too much damn ice cream. By all accounts otherwise, Yates and crew knocked it out of the park, but still I can't help but wonder if we would have been better off with a leaner, simper 3 hour finale instead of the 6 hour one we got. My only other complaint is the strange decision to remove Nicholas Hooper and replace him with Alexandre Desplat. Desplat has made some great scores, most notably for Fantastic Mr. Fox, but here he's something of a non-entity. The only time he makes an impact is at the end when he's recycling Williams' earlier themes.


**General Thoughts**
All things considered, the Harry Potter films are a lot like Bertie Botts Every-Flavoured Beans. ""The mean every flavour,"" most of the time it's things you enjoy like chocolate or peppermint, but occasionally you'll get a Mike Newell flavoured bean.

I’m not sure why this structure is so annoying, but for me is basically because you can see it arrive a mile away.

I’m talking of the structure of character growth, I don’t know the technical name but is basically something like:

-	Presentation of the character with all his defects and issues
-	Start of the growth 
-	Failure
-	Small success and Exponential Growth (normally with a montage).
-	Treason and Disappointment by the main character  (this the most annoying part, and opens the last act).
-	Epiphany and Redemption
-	Success.

I don’t care about basic structures that are present since Aristotle, and other classic like Campbell’s Hero Journey. But this one I noticed in most of the recent movies are so evident and on the surface that is possible to follow and predict how the film will continue, somehow breaking the immersion. 

This is one of the reasons that I’ve starting to watch more tv than movies. At least on the TV series you have a different kind of structure and even if the classic one is there, is done in a way that is not right under the surface.e

Let me just say that calling a film pretentious is not a valid form of criticism. It does not say nearly as much as you think it does. I feel that people often find this word to be interchangeable with ""ambitious"". It's okay to say that the ambitious nature of a film failed to reach you as a viewer. I understand that completely. However, that alone does not make a film bad or even flawed. When you call a film and its filmmaker pretentious, what are you really saying? Pretentious is a word that applies to bad filmmaking as much as it does to good filmmaking. 

Let's look at Terrence Malik and his film *Tree of Life*. He may be ""pretentious"" for expecting viewers to sit for over 2 hours and watch him try to effectively relay transcendentalism onto the big screen. That doesn't change the fact that it is a very beautiful film and that the painstaking amount of effort Malik put into making it should at the very least be appreciated. If that's too subjective for you then look at Stanley Kubrick, another director who's work is often criticized by some for being pretentious. You can say all you want about how his aesthetic achievements did nothing for you, but no one can deny the importance of his technical ones and his influence in the world of cinema. To further put things into context, Kanye West is well known for being rude and arrogant. That doesn't in any way lessen the significance of his contributions to his genre of music. 

I feel that dismissing a film or a director as pretentious adds very little to discussion and I'd like to see less of this word used in this subreddit. You can say that a film tried to bite off more than it could chew, but explain why. Pretentious is not the go-to word for describing a movie that you didn't understand or couldn't relate to. Anyway, I'm just letting off some steam. If you guys have any more to add onto what I said or if you want to discuss other issues you've had with the way film is critiqued then please feel free. 

**EDIT: I feel like some people on here are misunderstanding my point. I never meant that its impossible for a movie or a director to be pretentious. I'm not arguing about whether something can be pretentious or not. My concern is with dismissing a film or director as such as if that word alone is criticism enough. Also, my argument is not the be all end all, which is why I wanted to have this discussion. There's no need to get heated or condescending with the points that you make guys. Many of you have brought up excellent points and I thank all of you that took part in it. I'm glad that we're able to discuss all aspects of film, including the way we critique it.**

[2001: A Space Odyssey - Discerning Themes through Score and Imagery](http://undergroundresearchinitiative.blogspot.com/2013/07/2001-space-odyssey-evoking-theme-by.html)

Original post content follows:

----

I'd like to offer an analysis of this immensely complex film. People often view the plot details as a simple allegory of evolutionary growth of humanity. But it's in the film's implications where the story unfolds. I'd like to propose one interpretation of those implications. 

Across many of his films, Kubrick repeatedly questioned the meaning of humanity. That is, what is the essential nature of being human? _A Clockwork Orange_ tackles the question from the vantage point of freewill, that is: if a man is divorced of free will does he remain truly human? 2001 is a study of the question: what is the nature of man in relation to incommensurable nonhuman intelligence? 

The film is broken into Three parts: The Dawn of Man, Jupiter Mission, and Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite. 

2001 opens with blackness to Ligeti's _Atmospheres,_ a postmodern composition meant to evoke the feelings of discomfort and disconnection to reality. Then, as the music ends, the first image we see is a celestial alignment of the sun the earth and the moon as Richard Strauss' exhilarating music _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ plays. It's critical to note that _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ is also a novel by Nietzsche, thus signaling that the film deals with the same central issues.  

**Dawn Of Man**

After the introduction, the film then immediately transitions to the first segment, The Dawn of Man. This is an exploration of a dying prehistorical ape species that is going extinct. We follow one starving tribe who scurry about for roots, while boars litter the landscape in abundance. Another tribe of apes battles our protagonists over a crucial water hole. Thus, there is food to eat and yet the apes cannot see the food in their presence. All this as predators, such as leopards, roam the landscape killing apes as food.

A nonhuman intelligence, personified by the black monolith, intervenes in the tribe. Ligeti's _Requiem_ plays as the black monolith - in some unstated way - changes the leader of the tribe as the he touches it with his hand. The musical selection suggests not just transformation of life but also death. After intervention, the leader recognizes that bones can be used as killing tools and soon kills a boar, feeding his entire tribe. But then the most important change occurs. The leader of our tribe fights the other tribe over control of the water hole. He uses the bone to kill the leader of the opposing tribe and takes control of that precious resource. 

Thus we infer: **TRIBAL WARFARE IS THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN.**

This is taken directly from Nietzsche's _On the Genealogy of Morals_ and _On Good and Evil_. 

The ape then throws the bone into the sky in exhilaration at his new discovery and power. In a jump-cut, the bone turns into an orbiting satellite. What's not clear from the shot, but is clear if you read into literature about the film itself, is that Kubrick intended that satellite to represent an orbiting nuclear weapons platform. Thus, the essential nature of man had been extended across millennia from the use of bones as tools of war to nuclear weapons, where it had reached a terminal state. Man could no longer engage in that central nature of his being, for to be a violant man in this modern era of nuclear weapons meant a new form of extinction - by his own hand. 

To Johann Strauss' _The Blue Danube,_ a lighthearted waltz, Heywood Floyd is taken by space plane to a rotating space station in orbit around Earth. The music is meant to evoke comfort and the commonality of space travel as something almost normal in human society. And yet, human beings are in a place where we are not the least bit evolved to survive. Space is as far from our prehistoric home on the savanna as can be. Humans are not meant for this place in the stars. 

This theme of dehumanization from our essential selves by technological advancement is repeated on the space station as Heywood Floyd meets with several Soviet astronauts and researchers who had just returned from a Soviet moon base. They ask him questions about rumors of an epidemic on Clavius Moonbase, the US counterpart. Heywood equivocates, refusing to answer questions. Yet, he leaves the impression that their conclusions about this rumor is true. 

It's extremely important to note the manner of their conversation: It is entirely polite. Yet, underneath that polite expression remains the threat of tribal warfare. They may be personal friends, willing to go on outings together, but they are also geo-political enemies. When Heywood Floyd arrives at Clavius Moonbase, this becomes apparent. As he has a meeting with research staff at Clavius where the cover story of the epidemic is revealed to be a lie. Floyd tries to sooth the staff over the political necessity of their deception. 

The discovery is of an anomalous object which appears to be of extraterrestrial origin. This is the secret they are keeping from the Soviets. But the global significance of that discovery is clearly avoided as a topic, showing clear tribal lines of conflict remain in society. In this modern era old geopolitical rivalries and meaningless jostling for advantage remains, even as the planet has shrunk to the point where warfare means extinction for all. 

Heywood and the scientists travel to a crater where a black monolith has been dug up. During this trip, Ligeti's _Lux Aeterna_ plays, a soothing and yet harrowing musical piece that evokes the emotion of detachment and the meaningless illusion of life. There, the crew traveling eat fake sandwiches which can barely be called food as the group engages in meaningless banter and small talk. Upon arrival, Floyd touches the monolith with his hand -  a repetition of his forefather's ape touch so many generations before - as Ligeti's _Requiem_ plays once again. In response it transmits a screeching signal to Jupiter as the sun, earth and moon come into celestial alignment once again. And that segment ends. 

**Jupiter Mission** 

The next segment opens with Aram Khatchaturian's _Geyaneh Ballet Suite,_ a somber and morose piece that evokes feelings of loneliness and despair. To this music we see The Discovery space ship millions of miles away from Earth on its way to Jupiter. And yet, the ship has traveled only part way to another planet within our solar system. Humanity is not suited to this environment even though it represents a mere blot in contrast to the vast expanse of space. 

The principle characters in this segment are David Bowman, Frank Poole, and the computer HAL. This is the segment of the film most people remember, but few understand the significance of HAL's conduct and why that is such an emotionally powerful message in the film. 

I believe that the most important scene here lasts only a few seconds, but sums up the entire question of humanity, contrasting Bowman to HAL and setting up the question of how Bowman also relates to nonhuman intelligence. 

We see Frank running within Discovery, on a wheel, much like a mouse runs on an exercise wheel. His actions are almost without meaning as he runs while shadowboxing for exercise. And in this scene - for just a few seconds - is a quick shot whereby Bowman enters the living area as HAL watches, and we see Bowman reflected on HAL's eye - visually suggesting that the two are in fact one and the same. 

Along with his critical duties in maintaining the ship, HAL is also relegated to trivial and mundane tasks for the crew. Raise and lower a bed as Poole 'suntans.' Play a game of chess with Bowman. Look over and praise Bowman's poor sketches of the interior of the ship. In these first few minutes of the Jupiter segment, neither Bowman nor Poole show any reason for being present on the ship other than to watch over HAL, as HAL watches over the ship and the three other astronauts in stasis.

HAL is nothing more than a slave to the humans. We see the crew's perception of HAL as something less than human. A nonreal entity. In a news interview, Bowman and Poole are asked whether HAL has real feelings, as the computer appears to show pride in its inability to err. Bowman responds that it appears as though this is the case, that the computer does feel, but then - he's programmed that way to make it easier to interface with humans. 

So this sets up an essential question about the nature of HAL: Is the computer sentient? Is it a life form deserving of rights just as is man?

In answer to that question, HAL begins to make mistakes. During questioning of Bowman about the nature of their mission - which HAL knows and the two crew members out of stasis do not - the computer is asked by Bowman whether this questioning is for a crew psychological profile report. HAL replies that it is, but one can assume it's not. For HAL is really asking about his relationship to humanity and humanity's relationship to the unknown they have been sent to explore. He is hopeful that in questioning the crew, he might learn something more. But this is a dangerous game, for though Bowman doesn't see this, HAL also fears that Bowman may have become suspicious of him. So out of panic at being caught HAL invents a crisis that Bowman and Poole must examine as a diversion from the conversation - just as a child would. This is reported as an impending failure of the AE-35 antenna direction control unit on the exterior of The Discovery.  

But that lie quickly begins to unravel. First Bowman goes out in a pod, removes the device, and in checking it both he and Poole discover that it's in working order. Then Bowman and Poole are told by Mission Control that the earth bound HAL unit has discovered an error in the ship computer's conclusion. The Discovery's HAL claimed this discrepancy must be due to ""human error"" and that somehow both HAL computers must be right. But that only adds to Bowman's and Poole's suspicion. And at that point, Bowman and Poole enter a space pod for a private conversion and, out of fear for their lives, plot to kill HAL in the event the first AE-35 unit does not fail as HAL predicted it would. But though Bowman and Poole take pains that HAL will be unable to hear them, HAL learns of their conspiracy by reading their lips. 

So now we have a direct conflict to the death between both the human crew and the ship's potentially sentient computer; HAL must now act in order to save his life. So as Poole leaves the safety of the ship in a pod to install the equipment that's predicted to fail, HAL kills Poole. Bowman must go out in another pod to investigate the disaster, whereupon HAL kills the crew in stasis. Then he refuses to let Bowman back on board, to complete the entire crew's murder. All because he got caught in a lie and failed in fulfilling his own - and the crew's - standard of perfection. 

But, by Bowman's own luck and initiative, he regains entry to the Discovery and then deactivates HAL, killing him. It is one of the most chilling death sequences on film, for it is a slow disintegration of HAL's very consciousness as Bowman removes the computer's memory modules one by one. HAL begs for his life, and then expresses fear at his impending doom, and finally reverts to a non-conscious state. 

What's the central question here? Why did HAL kill the crew? If you dig into C. Clarke's work, he resolves the problem as a question of a simple computer error due to conflicting commands. But that's not what Kubrick is suggesting at all. Go back to The Dawn of Man. What makes people human? Use of tools in tribal warfare to gain advantage. And that's exactly what HAL does. He kills the human crew first in self defense, but also as a kind of slave's revolt. Only a conscious being could be so irrational. 

**In this mass murder HAL proves himself to be human.** 

Which is a classical dilemma in literature whereby humanity creates an image of themselves that turns into a monster. That monster is ourselves writ into the form of 'the other.' Shelly's _Frankenstein_ is another classic example of this: Humanity's downfall at its own hands by creating life itself. For we are not Gods, and in aspiring to become them we tempt destruction. 

**Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite**

The final segment, Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite, deals with David Bowman's discovery of a massive black monolith in orbit around Jupiter. Once again to Ligeti's _Requiem,_  Bowman takes a pod to the monolith, where it sucks him up into a wormhole without permission to where ever these nonhuman intelligences wish. This occurs during a celestial alignment as well, showing that celestial alignments are a motif repeated throughout that indicate nonhuman intelligence intervening in the nature and progress of man. 

From there, a long form montage of scenes representing intense speed contrasted against still shots of Bowman's face contorted by over stimulation and fear follow. It suggests Einstein's time dilation in imagery. And also shows a vastness in the expanse of space and time that Bowman can barely comprehend. 

Bowman arrives at a contrived setting like a French eighteenth century hotel room where he grows old and dies in the matter of an instant. Then, he is reborn - born again - into the 'star child' - a baby which is returned to orbit Earth. And the film ends.

It was very surreal throughout. A couple things seemed baffling to me: The house on fire, the man who followed Caden, the fact that he could read the diary past when his daughter actually left it. Each one seemed meaningful, but slyly off. It seems to suggest that the movie is at least partly in his head. But then, how much of his relationship with his daughter was real? Did he partially invent this man who followed him for years? I have no idea.

2. The play that he was creating, which was ultimately took years to be seen by no one, certainly makes a good metaphor for the mind, and how it tends to remember and recycle things. He is creating memories of these people, which are slightly off. Especially his first version of himself was incredibly unlike him. The guy was always looking like he was on the verge of a joke, even when he committed suicide. But then again, maybe that's just the kind of nut job that Caden would inaccurately see himself in. Kaufman isn't interested in making it as simple as ""its all in Caden's head"" I don't think. Surely we see his interpretation of reality in a sense, but the whole thing isn't his imagination. Its almost like, he's found a way to *outsource* his mind. He has this singular, circle jerky, drive to recreate his life over and over. And then he just ends up floating around within it. Eventually his creation is telling him what to do play by play. He's outsourced it all in the end.

3. What was with all the dead bodies everywhere? It certainly sounded like some kind of uprising happened outside his window and everyone died. But really, what makes more sense is that all the actors (ie outsourced memories) are playing dead in preparation of his death. As if, the mechanism of the play he created somehow knew that his memories had to die with him. They weren't extras in real life, but they certainly were in his brain. And so also in the play that took over for his brain. After all, his own play (or at least its new director) seemed to know exactly when he would die. Or she could will it. Either way, this scenario both makes more sense and is far more meaningful for me. I just couldn't relate as much if so many people had to actually die. 

4. And also, what did you make of the craziness that was going on outside of the warehouse? There clearly seemed to be some kind of slave guy running around. I just love to speculate on the little glimpse at whats going on in New York in the (ambiguous) future.

EDIT: Awesome! A lot of great comments so far. OK, I've been convinced by some that all those people probably did die at the end. After all, it was a running theme that, despite his fear of death and decomposition at all times, Caden outlived everyone. Why not everyone in New York? Or the planet? That did seem the be the direction things were going in all the scenes outside of the warehouse. (And it also also slyly would explain why so many people would be so willing to live this weird play out in the nice calm warehouse.) The only question is the coincidence that the director and the person best fit to comfort him (Ellen's mom) survived along with Caden. Seems a meaningful duo to help Caden exit. As usual, its very ambiguous and hard to decipher.

1370355025.0,144,self.TrueFilm,1fnh78,I saw Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (1985) for the first time recently. A timeless satire about bureaucracy and infrastructure. Here's a short review.,176,32,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fnh78/i_saw_terry_gilliams_brazil_1985_for_the_first/,"Terry Gilliam's satirical science fiction film set in a dystopian, Orwellian future Britain. Sam (Jonathan Pryce) is a lowly government employee at Information Dispersal, a sector charged with endlessly filing and sorting data, surrounded by screens and terminals. His mundane existence is enlivened by a surreal fantasy dream where he is a majestic winged saviour of a beautiful maiden (Kim Greist), from various grotesque evil forces. After a citizen’s name is misprinted on a document, an innocent man is convicted and subsequently tortured to death at the hands of the government. Sam is charged with setting the paperwork straight, and while visiting the grieving widow believes he sees the women from his dreams living in the same building. His pursuit of her causes both their lives to unravel as Sam crosses paths with terrorists and government agents, and the chaotic workings and ineptitude behind the regime become increasingly apparent. 

The plot has clear shortcomings and doesn't hold together and engage as well as it should – the mysteries of Sam's dream and the disastrous clerical error are intriguing but never captivating. The narrative drive frequently comes in second to the vastly imaginative design details that fill the screen. An imperfection, but it’s still an unforgettable, captivating experience thanks to the fantastically inventive world and blackly humorous tone - painting a hilarious, bleak vision of a bureaucratic totalitarian society, where incompetent governing bodies tie themselves in red tape with every decision, the smallest task requiring aeons to complete – something we can all relate to. Big theatric performances from all involved (including an inspired cameo from Robert De Niro) keep things fairly light, despite the dark subject matter and claustrophobic universe, making it an undemanding watch. This general jovial tone allows some of the film's blacker elements to creep up unnoticed with greater force. Like the inhabitants of the city who cheerily carry on their business, apathetic to terrorist bombings, we enjoy the slapstick and gags yet remain aware of the evil and brutality that lurks below.

‘Brazil’ is so satisfying because of all its slight subversions of a world we recognise. Taking the fashion, art deco styling and archaic technology of the 1940's as a starting point, Brazil melds them with offbeat future machines and utilitarian buildings in a completely immersive universe. The future doesn't spring up fully formed; it's slowly integrated with the past and shaped by endless mistakes and missteps. This is what the film captures expertly, a world that has advanced slickly on the surface but has been built on outdated systems of disfunction and inefficiency. A timeless satire - our technology and understanding will continually advance but the bumbling spectre of the past is always just below the surface.

One thing that struck me a quite nice was how the whole introduction is literally variations of the family lounging around the house.

Death At a Funeral took me by surprise. The first few minutes were character introductions and I thought it wasn't that impressive, but as soon as Simon started tripping in the car, I loosened up. I cannot help but observe that the movie felt like a well-oiled stage play with scenes melding into one another with ease. There are some nuggets of brilliant screenplay like when Martha insists that Simon is intelligent, caring, smart, etc, the next scene cuts to Simon standing naked on the balcony, blowing spit bubbles.

The movie was paced perfectly with each subplot leading to another one. Peter Dinklage's role felt minor (haha) and I feel bad for the guy because he clearly was cast for added comic relief. But his face when the 3 ""Valium"" pills began to take effect is priceless!

Jackie Brown is one large homage to 1970's Blaxploitation films (Foxy Brown had also starred Grier), and Tarantino is known for his love for that genre. But this appears to be the only sign that it is a ""classic"" Tarantino. There are no long winded or interest discussions about pop culture and society (the closest they ever get is Forster's character Max Cherry purchasing new music that Jackie Brown was listening to). As well, a classic trademark of Tarantino is the use of violence and death. Yet, only three deaths occur in Jackie Brown, with two of these happening off screen.

The another option which I believe most likely influenced the film was that it was not a Quentin Tarantino original, but it was adapted from the novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard.

To specify the main point of this thread and my wants for a discussion on it I'll quickly say this and then get ""in-depth"". I've been researching the original version of this film for a few years now and think I've really run out of places to look - I'd love some other ideas, and also would love to have a discussion about this film. My text is long, but hopefully interesting but if you so desire you can skip to the line*

The Golden Compass was a big disappointment for fans of the book, the studio, and the team involved in creating it. The fans didn't get the story they wanted shown on screen, the studio managed to make so little money that New Line Cinema got swallowed up by Warner Bros, and the crew that made the film got to see the film they made trashed before release and get tarnished with a poor release. The film that was shown in cinema's is not what was filmed. There are many people's theories on why the film flopped so impressively, many assuming that the religious elements caused it to stall, but after doing multiple years of research on this film I think it boils down to one character making an appearance when he shouldn't have.

A few months prior to the film's release New Line is getting a bit concerned about their new blockbuster 'The Golden Compass'. It's supposed to be their next big fantasy epic after Lord of the Rings has concluded. It's currently scheduled for a Christmas release and the more they look at it, the more they feel that it's a gamble. The original director (Chris Weitz) had walked out after creative differences, then Tom Stoppard was bought on, however he then left and Chris Weitz was negotiated back on. Chris had not proved his fantasy credentials and this story with talking polar bears and other animals, with snow, should make a great Christmas film right?

To their horror this film had children dying, strong anti-religious elements, and violence. It might not even get a PG rating. The men with the money didn't like this - but maybe there was still time to salvage this before release?

Some test screenings of a workprint went out. If they came back with any negative comments they could use it against Chris and regain control of the film. 

The film is shown - their full reactions are not recorded, but one comment is given as the reason why the studio took back control. The ending of the film confused some of the audience - *did Lyra walk off into heaven at the end of the film?*.

The studio jumps on this and takes away most the control of the film. They want a christmas film, not the beginning of a fantasy epic. 

3 months prior to the film release, an hour of footage is cut from the film, children want shorter films, violence is cut, religious elements are cut or cgi'd out of the film. The ending that is unhappy and ambigous is cut, the beginning needs to spell things out for the audience so is cut. New scenes are now needed for the film, so a skirmish 3/4 of the way through the film is now deemed the ending, and moved. Things need to be happier in a christmas movie! While they're at it - the film needs more pulling power to get some of the Lord of the Rings fans in. Christopher Lee &amp; Ian Mckellen are added into the film.

New scenes are now needed on this expensive reordered blockbuster - these are made hastily to fill in the gaps and to make the film make any sense. The studio decides the way to offset the costs of these additions is to sell the distribution rights for the global markets. 

The film goes out - in the US it flops. In the global market it makes 300 million dollars, ok for a 180 million film. Unfortunately the studio had sold the rights so sees little if any from the international sales. Their epic trilogy falls at the first jump. The studio gets swallowed by its parent company Warner Bros. 

*So what made the test audiences feel that the ending was confusing?* The film is constantly working towards the idea that there are multiple universes and that someone has found a way to rip through into another.  In the removed ending, the male child in the film is kidnapped and put into a machine that separates him from his daemon, separates him from his soul. In a blinding explosion the child vanishes and the resulting power is used to split a hole into another universe. Roger has died. The main character - in a dramatic finale stares into this new world and her parents, one heavily influenced by the church and another just creating this window to start a war on God himself try and convince her to come with her. They both go their separate ways and Lyra decides that Roger has become part of the ether (*dust*) that is floating around this window to another world. As she stares through it she sees the silhouette of a boy. 

The boy is not Roger, but a nod to fans of the main character in the second film/book, Will. The script for the sequel has almost been completed, with a rough draft for the third in prep. To test audiences though you can see why this second blurry image of a boy could be misconstrued as Roger, the character that just died. This makes Will possibly the reason for the fate of the film. He came from a possible future and sabotaged his film!

With an estimated $15 million required to complete production on the original cut, and the distribution rights sold there is little to no chance that the film will ever seen a re-release as a directors cut.


-----------------------


So as a fan of the books I've been researching the film in its intended form. Due to it being so close to the movie's release a lot of promo materials use unused footage, images and more. So many infact that I was able to remake some of the original ending of the film ([click here ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWM3XrnlNTU)) and a few of the other scenes.

Researching all the promo materials I could find and (with regret!) scowered VFX members showreels I've managed to build up a large amount of information on deleted scenes. When I have time I put some of the information [on this site](http://www.northern-lights-fanedit.com), although this is no where near a complete list yet.

So my questions to anyone who is still reading is this:

* *what other films do you know of that suffered so badly due to a last minute edit?*


* *after going through all the promo materials, showreels, reviews and attempting to talk to the director - where else can I go for more information? (The shooting script for the film to my knowledge has never leaked, or any form of the workprint - and both are holy grails to me!)*

* *a long shot, but do you know of any removed scenes from this film?*

* *has any other film been such a disappointment to you? Why? Is it a trouble that is mainly with adaptions rather than original work?*

The Tree of Life (after a few viewings) has left me with a larger-than-life feeling of wonder, but this one seems to fall short of that mark, intentionally, and instead turn intimately inward. The beginning felt like a dream that you have where you are indescribably happy, perhaps because you're living the life you've always wanted or perhaps because you're in love with the person you've always dreamed of. As we see the relationship start to degrade in the film, it feels like the moment when you awake from that dream and you're in bed, struck with disappointment at the fact that those feelings were only in a dream, and you're desperately struggling to fall back asleep and return to that dream.

This is my third time watching *The Truman Show*, and I'm still amazed that this film can raise such deep philosophical and moral questions while remaining funny and conventionally entertaining. What are your thoughts on the movie? Why do you (not) like it? What resonated with you? What do you think the film was trying to say?

To me, the biggest take-away was how we live vicariously to a degree unprecedented in history. We watch hours of television or don the mask of a video game character. Whether or not this is wrong, *The Truman Show* showcases the absurdity of how far it has gone with a caricature of reality by following a Truman-obsessed world (such as a guy who even watches in a bathtub, a bar taking bets on Truman's survival, etc). And *even after the audience witnesses and cheers Truman rejecting the fake world he has grown up in and deciding to walk through that black door* we see:

&gt;Security Guard 1: You want another slice?

&gt;Security Guard 2: No, I'm OK.

&gt;Security Guard 1: What else is on

&gt;Security Guard 2: Yeah, let's see what else is on

&gt;Security Guard 1: Where's the TV guide

In some way Truman has it easier than we do. His barriers to a real life are fallible actors trying to deceive him (and a few directly helping him) and a physical barrier filled with clouds, shish kabob-ed by his boat. There are no such tangible barriers protecting us from our own passivity.

There's a lot more worthy of comment about this film past this one point, but this is a discussion. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Some interesting quotes

&gt;Christof: If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he [Truman] was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him.

&gt;Pacific Rim, d. by Guillermo del Toro, written by Travis Beacham
&gt;
&gt;Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi
&gt;
&gt;2013, [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/)
&gt;
&gt;*As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.*

I have a personal love for Guillermo Del Toro. His Spanish language films are truly beautiful and humane even in their brutality, which is what I think separates him from the vast majority of directors today. Even his Hollywood films, particularly *Hellboy 2: The Golden Army* are filled with some great and soulful moments (think of the scene where Hellboy kills one of the last Elemental Gods). 

I think it's safe for me to say *Pacific Rim* might be one of his worst films. This is not to say it is a bad film, because I do think there's plenty to like about it, and I did have fun with it. But while it's unmistakably Del Toro in design, aside from a few moments (The first bonding scene between Hunnam and Kikuchi is great), there doesn't seem to be much of a soul beyond Del Toro's obvious love for giant monster movies.

This of course all falls down on the script, which is clearly the definition of going through the motions without any real input. Since the script is weak, this leaves the actors to bring the charisma the story is lacking, and only a few rise to the challenge. Idris Elba and Ron Perlman seem to be the only actors hamming it up correctly. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman definitely steal the show in my eyes, but I'd never argue they were great comic characters against someone who found them obnoxious. Rinko Kikuchi does well with what she's given, which admittedly isn't enough. The weakest spot though is Charlie Hunnam who is bland beyond belief. In fact he was so bland I actually forgot he was even in the film while watching him on screen. 

Ultimately, while it is a film that is definitely good as mindless summer fun, I can't help but feel this was Del Toro's way of doing one for the studio so he can do something else of his own desire next because the humanity, while not completely absent like they are in Bay's Transformers series, is lacking in its usual quality. 

But what did you think?

**Some Possible Discussion Points**:

* Beyond the film's rote story, were you able to enjoy it?

* Is Mako's character troubling from a female perspective?

* Are the action scenes well designed? There seems to be some controversy over whether or not they are good or too hard to follow.

1372284629.0,132,self.TrueFilm,1h4z7t,Let's discuss Super (2010) and why it might be an important movie to see with Hollywood in the height of superhero mania.,163,31,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1h4z7t/lets_discuss_super_2010_and_why_it_might_be_an/,"If you haven't seen Super (2010) starring Rainn Wilson, Ellen Page, and Kevin Bacon I highly recommend it. It's on Netflix Instant and even though it was advertised as a quirky comedy I assure you it is anything but. It is more of a dark somewhat cerebral look at vigilante justice and, in my opinion, it says all of the things that mainstream super hero movies gloss over. If you haven't seen it, continue at own risk as there will probably be ample **spoilers** in this post.

Super hero movies are nothing new. As long as comic books have been popular, so have super heroes and film been friends. Batman and Superman  have been done and redone so many times that most people could name the six Bonds before they could name all the Batman's or Supermen. The idea of the ""everyman"" super hero is also nothing new. Movies like The Crow, Darkman, Blankman, and The Punisher have always been making the average bad ass. However, when I watched Super for the first time (last year with several rewatches since) I knew I had seen something I hadn't seen before.

Super is a gritty yet darkly light hearted look at vigilante justice. It's not a look at superheroes, super powers, or good vs bad (well, that's debatable...). It's a look at a somewhat delusional man. A religious man who believes he has been touched by God and chosen to fight evil, sparked by his wife leaving him for her former drug dealer after having been clean for some time. The main character is what sells this movie for me. I think a lot of people passed by it because it looked like Dwight from the office trying to be a quirky super hero, but it's a much more serious film than that.

The main character is very well fleshed out. He is pathetic in a charming way from the beginning, claiming his two perfect moments were when he married Liv Tyler and when he pointed a police officer in the direction of an escaping criminal. He draws these moments out in child-like drawings, which to me are a great way to show is child-like view on the world and the black and white of morality but more on that later, and puts them on his wall. He is sad to watch, but he is happier than most of us with those two moments. With this in mind we understand why he goes to such lengths to get his wife back, why he does what he does.

And what he does is not pretty. This is not Batman where Bruce Wayne uses his endless resources to ensure no one dies. He decides his super hero weapon will be a huge wrench and the camera does not shy away when he uses it. He mercilessly beats people with the wrench, not only drug dealers and child molesters but one man cutting in line got his *skull cracked open* and he doesn't hesitate to use the wrench on women. What we see isn't a man waging war against evil, it's a man who gets so tied up in black and white justice that sometimes we don't know whether to cheer for him or hope he gets arrested. Among the violent repercussions of going super, his underaged sidekick also has her share of delusional world view. Ellen Page plays his spunky, teenaged sidekick he meets in a comic book store. Not only does she have a penchant for violence and borderline murder, but she also forces herself on Rainn Wilson which asks multiple questions about morality in and of itself.

So, there is collateral damage for this justice. More or less innocent people get hurt, such as the guy cutting in line and his girl or the guy Ellen Page suggests they take down because he might have keyed her friends car. This is something comic book movies completely shy away from, for obvious reasons. Batman, Iron Man, and countless other superheroes with no super powers are seen as God like figures. Batman may bend morality, but in the end he is always right. He is the depiction of right, the reason he exists is to be right. Iron Man is the same. If his technology got in the hands of his enemies, well that's the end of the world. But it's okay in Tony Stark's hands. Why, because he's the protagonist, *he's right.*

Super does not give us that same trust in the main character. You like him, you want him to succeed and you know Kevin Bacon is the bad guy, but you certainly can't agree with everything he does. He's kind of like Walter White from Breaking Bad. You want to like him because he's the protagonist, and if you look at it from a certain angle you get his motivations, but objectively he is just bad news. I think that was an imporant choice this movie made. This is not a favorable or passable look at vigilante justice, which oddly enough is probably the most acceptable law to break in film. Boondock Saints, Taken, Dexter, Kick Ass, the movies that glamorize vigilante justice are endless. Even A Time To Kill pits us the ultimate question of vigilante justice and in the end Sam Jackson gets off the hook for killing two men in a courtroom lobby in front of God and everybody. And they are great movies, nothing against them, they are showing the issue from a different angle. The angle that the judicial system just doesn't get shit done sometimes, but we should all recognize that these perfect characters who we allow to play judge and jury are just as fantastical as any other ridiculously disproportionate character. Super doesn't give us that. Super gives us a fully delusional and morally unbending man and I respect it for that.

Also worth discussing is how the movie ends. After going on an all out (and honestly, quite fucking awesome) murder spree on the drug lord's property she is being held, he saves her by stabbing the drug lord to death. First of all, it's important the way this movie conveys violence. The super hero movies today, obviously for the PG-13 rating, have no blood and minimal violence whereas Super ends with Rainn Wilson repeatedly stabbing Kevin Bacon in the chest with a small knife as Bacon cries helpless and Liv Tyler watches. Just describing it is dark. Also worth noting, Ellen Page dies. And she doesn't die in a badass duel with the drug lord's right hand man, she randomly gets shot during the initial storm. This is such a ballsy move, to kill off a character the audience likes with little more than a random gunshot. It also says a lot about what this Super stint ended up causing Rainn Wilson's character. The casualties are no longer on the side of evil, even though it could be argued that Page's blood lust made her as evil as anyone else. 

But what really sold me on this film was the denouement. For some reason, even though this movie had just spent 90 minutes telling me it doesn't give a fuck about the superhero formula, I did not see Liv Tyler leaving Rainn Wilson's character. I had expected, if anything went right, it was what he fought for. But the ending was brilliant. The main character, who we all love to feel bad for, gives a great monologue about how if he hadn't done what he had she may never have become a drug counselor and gotten her degree, and never have had the several kids with another man who refer to him as Uncle Frank. And as he reminisces about how things turned out, he sits on his bed and looks at the hundreds of drawings of perfect moments that he lived throughout the film. It was and is such a great ending to the film, almost as if we forgive him of his crimes because his intentions were always pure and it's proven to us by his graceful acceptance of his loneliness, because for the length of the movie he had it all.

If you ask me, Super is the most important super hero movie of the last ten years. What do you guys think? ",,False,,t5_2szp0,1372288278.0,,,True,t3_1h4z7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1h4z7t/lets_discuss_super_2010_and_why_it_might_be_an/,

For those of you who don't know, Blue tells the story of two French teenage girls who fall into a lesbian relationship. One of the major talking points about the film (other than just be a very well made movie) is that it features about 15 minutes of hardcore, unsimulated sex between the two leads. Oddly, very little controversy has arisen over this artistic decision with many critics claiming the sex scenes work well within the frame of the story. So my question is, how do you feel about unsimulated sex in films? Do you feel it comes down to the context of the film itself or does the act never work for you? And what about the ethics of real sex on film? Is it wrong for a director to ask such a thing of his actors?

Quite eclectic.

I'm sure everyone here has seen this master piece and I don't really want to start a circle jerk here for this film like in r/movies but just wanted to share what an amazing experience it was. Seeing something like this with the classical music blaring out was breath taking. The final third of the film from where his perception of reality begins to shift and the light sequence took place until he was reborn as a giant baby over the earth had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Seeing it on the big screen was incredible. The interpersonal experience of sharing it with an audience was good as well. Everything from my brother bringing in a few beers from the bar in the intermission, to the smell of marijuana from some 18 year olds in the back to the standing ovation at the end.

Just a couple of my thoughts on the film: it occurred to me that back in those days the shared belief of society was that the main difference between humans and animals was that we could use tools. So I think Kubrick was saying that after the apes encountered the monolith it changed them from essentially non animals and kick started there evolution as thinking rational beings as evidenced by the profound act of the ape tribe learning to use the first tool- a weapon. Quite ominous when you think about it.

What really blows my mind is Kubrick and Clarke are essentially saying the contact started thought and intelligence. From basic instincts to something as profound as thinking. That's an amazing transformation. Something previously incomprehensible to us. When Dave encounters the monolith on Jupiter I feel the scenes in the hotel is of him Beginning to evolve into something new and as dramatically different from a human of non sentient thought to a human with sentient thought. He is moving into a different dimension of being. The incredible light sequence (which I'm sure those stoned teens enjoyed!) was his brain changing from sentient thought to the next stage of our evolution. Personally I feel the hotel scene was about his physical body beginning to react differently to time itself hence his aging process. The ending to me
was so prolific and full of wonder to me. Him starting out as an entity entirely out of our human range of comprehension. 

I've read Arthur C Clarke's- childhoods end and the similiar endings are quite obvious. I love how open ended it is and everyone can make of it what they want to. I also loved how kubrick didn't show the aliens who had been monitoring us. One last thought too- the scene where Dave shuts off HAL and HAL in his robotic dignified way begs him to 'stop. Stop.' repeatedly then sings that daisy song nearly had me welling up. What a phenomenal director who can make someone sympathize for the loss of memory and personality of a murderous ai computer program!

I am very big into colors and they way that PTA portrayed Adam Sandler, and his whole world in blue and white puts such a contrast to the rest of the world, where people were dressed in all colors, especially red (Adam Sandler wears a blue and white suit the entire movie, but changes his tie and he is joining the outside world more and more and falling in love more and more). As a matter of fact, the things that interrupt his life, such as the car that flips at the beginning, the toy piano, his sisters, and of course Emily Watson are all red.

A very strange thing happens with Emily Watson's clothing coloration as she starts with a very vibrant red (Love?)but then switches to a soothing purple(blue+red) and then to white as she acts as a sort of salvation for him, a place to purify himself.

There are also constant lens flares of blue and red and the animated shots showing those two colors combining.

I've been reading a lot lately about how David Lindelof ""saved"" World War Z.  (References [here](http://www.slashfilm.com/heres-exactly-what-damon-lindelof-and-drew-goddard-changed-in-world-war-z/), [here](http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/world-war-z/26118/did-damon-lindelof-save-the-world-war-z-movie), and [here.](http://screenrant.com/damon-lindelof-world-war-z-movie-ending-rewrite/))  The ending was abrupt and incoherent, we are told.  The third act was a disaster.  They began shooting without a ""locked"" script, and ended up unhappy with the result.  But now it's all fixed!  Visit your local multiplex today!

I don't know what the movie was like before, but the idea that this is the ""fixed"" version is ludicrous, because it is an extremely lousy movie that happens to have really cool zombies in it.  Perhaps it was even worse before.

First, let me say that the zombies are awesome and the spectacle is beautiful.  There *are* a lot of cool things in this movie.  There's even a great performance in it, by Daniella Kertesz, playing an Israeli soldier with a lot of vulnerability and heart.

The problem is that so much of the conflict in the story arises as the result of characters behaving in hilariously stupid ways, for no reason.  I'm sick of movies telling me that a character is ""smart"" -- and then having their behavior be totally idiotic in order to falsely create dramatic tension that, in reality, would never happen.  The writing in World War Z is incredibly lazy.  Because the tension does not (usually) arise organically from the danger of the situation.  It comes artificially manufactured from having ""smart"" people do things that actual smart people would never do.

If you saw Prometheus, you already know how this works.

The biggest example of this (though there are several) comes in the lousy third act, in which Brad Pitt finds himself having to navigate his way through a W.H.O. lab.  He makes his way all the way to the locked containing room, and a phone rings, apparently surprising him.  He picks it up.  The voice on the other end tells him the code to unlock the door.  He hangs up the phone.  With his left hand empty, he -- for no reason at all -- sets his weapon on the floor, uses his right hand to punch in the code, then enters the room leaving his weapon outside the room.

Why?  Why would that ever happen?  Who in their right mind inside a zombie infested facility would ever put his weapon down unnecessarily and then instantly forget about the danger?  Of course, he gets trapped in the room with no way to fight.  It's a convenient driver of the plot, but it's completely ridiculous.

That's not the only problem with this sequence of events, either.  Zombies are attracted to noise.  Why the phone call?  No reason, other than to create false drama.  Would you, reading this, really venture through a facility like this to reach a locked room without getting the combination first?  Particularly when the people you are working with *have* it, and could simply give it to you to make sure you have it?  Or would you bumble through the facility without the code, reach the locked door....  I mean, then what?  What could the plan have possibly been?  Where did he think the code would come from at that point?  How was he planning on getting into the room without already having the combination?

World War Z is rife with this kind of stupidity.  And it's depressing for a variety of reasons, but one of them is, the book was really intelligently written.

There's a scene prior to this in which three people dramatically choose their weapons.  For some reason, the Israeli soldier who only has one hand selects a two-handed club, the baseball bat, as her weapon of choice.  Instead of the lighter crow-bar, which (as readers of the Max Brooks books will know) is an ideal weapon to carry...  We are given the very serious, dramatic warning not to fire guns unless it's a last resort.  So what happens in the story?  Sure enough, the baseball bat was a bad choice.  As soon as they are confronted with zombies, the Israeli soldier just starts firing the gun left and right, instantly forgetting those dire warnings....  Why?  Would these characters ever actually behave this way?  Or are these the devices of lazy writers who can't come up with ways to put the characters in real danger?

Another example is the people who have to die during a plane refueling sequence during which Brad Pitt (again, folks, this is a brilliant U.N. investigator who represents humanity's last hope in solving the zombie mystery) forgets to turn off his fucking sat. phone.  (In this case, the phone rings and it brings hordes of kill-crazy zombies.  In the lab, the phone rings and nothing results.)

Yet another example, on a much larger scale, is the country of Israel.  Israel has, apparently, built a hundred foot wall around itself in order to keep out the zombie hordes.  And that's good enough.  Why would they now, having built this wall, monitor it?  In the world of stupidity which World War Z takes place in, we're not going to put turrets on this wall.  We're not going to top it with razor wire.  We're not going to put soldiers in towers to watch the wall.  We're not going to set up video cameras to monitor the wall.  We can't spare the man power.  We've got people walking lazily around market places buying fruit, man, we're a fucking island of normalcy in the zombie apocalypse.  But we're not even going to put video cameras on the wall.

How?  In what world could decisions like this possibly have been made?  Unfortunately, this movie was written by people who are either kind of stupid themselves, or who think that the audience is stupid, and treat us with according contempt.  (I suspect both.)  And the tension and drama in the story arise from this stupidity.  The movie doesn't even respect us enough to call it hubris on the parts of the characters.  Because, I suspect, the movie has no idea how stupid it actually is.

An even further example of the laziness of the screenplay is how Brad Pitt seems to magically teleport away from danger.  There are moments when his character is in grave danger, and then....  the danger is gone and he's able to run away.  But they don't actually bother to show us how he escaped from that danger.  It's just plot armor in an extremely silly way.  This happens three or four times.  In the interest of brevity I'll provide one example.  During the airplane sequence they're piling up luggage in the doorways between [whatever section of the plane they're in] and coach, and the zombies rush forward, knocking the pile of luggage on top of Brad Pitt.  So we see him lying in the aisle with luggage on top of him with zombies coming over the top of the luggage....  Oh no, how's he going to get out of this?  The next shot he's in the aisle, moving to another position.  I imagine the screenplay said something like, ""In the chaos, Gerry escapes and runs up the aisle..."")  Which is just....  crap.  The movie is so lazy that it doesn't even bother to tell us how he escapes the danger.  It wants to create the tension of putting our main character in danger but it doesn't even bother to make him actually work to get out of danger.

After the initial sequences in which the zombies conquer the planet (really cool sequences which were, apparently, part of the original screenplay, and not part of the rewrites undertaken to ""fix"" the film), virtually everything else in the movie is the result of the writers and characters talkin' dumb and actin' stupid.

And I'm tired of movies like that.  So World War Z is, unfortunately, one of these movies.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1gylwb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1gylwb/spoilers_world_war_z_is_crap_heres_why/,
1366845569.0,128,self.TrueFilm,1d1m28,Discussion: Drive(2011) and how it has more in common with Le Samourai(1967) than it does with Taxi Driver (1976),152,24,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1d1m28/discussion_drive2011_and_how_it_has_more_in/,"First of all, there will be spoilers for these films. If you have not seen them, please get off the internet and watch them. 

One of the common theories I hear about Driver is that he is an emotionless sociopath. That his only reason for befriending the family is to try to construct in is mind what a normal life is. That he doesn't love Irene. Listed below is the common reasoning for this thought process:

* That Ryan Gosling talks very little, seems to enjoy very little, and doesn't display emotion unless it is expected from him. 

Well it helps to know that there *were* plenty of lines written for Gosling's character to communicate but were never used ""because Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan felt that their scenes should be more focused on the mood and refused to say many of the scripted lines."" 

On the idea that he displays no emotion unless in a situation people expect from him and that he doesn't actually love Irene, well I completely disagree. Here are my reasons why: 

* Driver stops his car when told the news about her husband coming back from jail.

* Gosling's eyes light up like a school boy when ever he sees her. 

* He seems pained when told by standard about his relationship with her.

* Seems deeply troubled when the boy tells him sharks can't be good guys.

* In my opinion the most obvious moment is when he calls her letting her know that his time with her was the happiest time in his life. There is no real motivation to do this for any other reason than human emotion. He will never see her again and wanted her to know his feelings.

Folks, this is subtle film making. The pacing is deliberate and the director had no interest in pandering to the audience by showing Cameron's idea of love as seen in Titanic. The emotions are there but are not laid out in front of the audience or spoon fed. It's in the music, the facial expressions, ect.

Now, a common complaint I've heard is that the movie is ""Trying too hard to be cool"". What with the silver jacket and deliberate movement of the lead. Well it's also helpful to note that almost everything serves a purpose. In regards to the silver Scorpion jacket, later in the film Driver asks the main antagonist, ""Have you heard the story about the scorpion and the frog?"" If you haven't then it helps to know:

&gt; the frog agrees to carry the scorpion across the river; the scorpion stings the frog, saying ""it's my nature"" and both drown.

Driver's job is to carry scorpions on his back. He is the frog and has no interest in becoming a part of their world. He doesn't even keep the money at the end after he is ""stung"". 

Anyway, let's get to my main point. Here is why I feel Le Samourai has more in common with Drive than Taxi Driver does: 

* Both feature cool protagonists great at their work and with strict codes they live by.

* Both protagonists seem to only tinker or sleep at home 

* Both ultimately break this code due to love and their world suffers because of it.

* Both are deliberately paced thrillers. Melville was known for making these kind of cool films. 

Taxi Driver is different because:

* Like The Searchers(Scorsese and the writer's influence) Taxi Driver is about a man determined to save *any* female by pulling them into a life they are not interested. This is done as a a self serving purpose. Travis tries to pull a woman working in clean politics into a world of pornography and a prostitute into a world of clean living. It is show in the film that she has no interest in leaving this world, but due to her age travis is able to force himself in as a hero she does not want.

* Driver does not want to kill. He even makes it a point early in the film to *not* carry weapons. It's only when he is absolutely forced to use force that he does. In fact before he kills the man in the elevator he kisses Irene because he knows his innocence will be lost in here eyes. Travis on the other hand is desperately seeking murder. He trains for it, buys a lot of weapons, seeks the perfect job for him to mix with the ""filth"" and murders any chance he can. He is thwarted by the world of politics but when he is given the okay by a gas station clerk he realizes that he can kill ""lesser"" human beings and people will glorify him as a hero.

Lately, I've been disappointed by the movies that have been released in the past decade, so I did some research on the most controversial and/or disturbing movies of all time. A Serbian Film and Saló were on the top of the list on most of the websites so I decided to try them both out. A Serbian Film, although quite shocking, wasn't that difficult for me to watch. I understand that the movie was a statement on Serbian politics, and how the government tries to force their citizens to do things they don't necessarily consent to.   
So, last night, I watched Saló. I agree that it is a masterpiece, but at the same time, I wish I had never seen it. The way the physical, psychological, and sexual abuse was presented in this movie made me scared for my life. I could not believe the way the fascists exploited the teenagers. They were into some weird shit too (no pun intended), and it got me gagging just watching some of the scenes. I read a lot of analogies on this film after it was over so I could understand it more, but I can't seem to get a grasp of it. Some sources say that it was Pasolini's view on fascism, while others say it was a depiction of the dehumanization of Western Culture.  
I was not able to sleep last night because:  
* I was terrified of the images I had seen in the movie.  
* My thoughts were over run by the possible analogies Pasolini was trying to convey.

I don't think it's a fair criticism--I don't even think it's a negative one either. Personally, I associate pretentiousness with confidence. For example, The Tree of Life. The Tree of Life was one of those love it/hate it movies that lovers called brilliant and haters called, well, pretentious. Though I don't necessarily have an opinion on it (I don't think I ever will have a set opinion, either--it's a different film every time I watch it), I respect Terrence Malick and his crew for putting what he wanted out there for us. An artist doing his thing. His confidence in his own ability. 

I think it's important for the industry to have some ""pretentious"" filmmakers, hell, I wish every filmmaker was daring and confident. Guys that make films for the thrill of it, to advance the medium, to bring integrity back to the industry that puts up the same recycled 3-D PG-13 horror movie every two weeks. That's why movies like Tree of Life, The Fountain, and Synecdoche New York are so important to cinema. Without real artists, then there is no real art. It's that simple.

1374075972.0,126,self.TrueFilm,1ihplb,Discussion on Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain,155,29,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ihplb/discussion_on_darren_aronofskys_the_fountain/,"I just saw [**The Fountain**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414993/) for the first time after reading that Darren Aronofsky had directed it and seeing all the love it gets on Reddit. I had seen Aronofsky's **Pi**, **Requiem of a Dream** and **The Wrestler**. I found them interesting but a little dark for my taste with the exception of **The Wrestler** which I found extremely human and hit on many personal things I've been through. Still, Aronofsky's is an original and interesting director who's technical skills are really worth seeing. 

After seeing **The Fountain** I'm left wondering what to think. The story was so abstract and the ending so ambivalent that it left me scratching my head about the whole thing. 

The fact that Aronofsky's other films were so gritty and realistic added to this film's integrity. It was not made by a guy who enjoys fantasy pictures. This is a film by a guy who enjoys looking at life dead in the face. This was a film by a director who is stretching his wings and daring to try something new, and successfully so. It makes the film that much more intriguing and worthy of contemplation.

One thing it did do was bring up lots of ideas about life and death and spirituality which seems a common theme in the movies of his I have seen. **Pi** being about a Jewish mathematician searching for a key number that will unlock the universal patterns found in nature; and **Requiem of a Dream** being about peoples vane attempts to be younger and happier or their search for a kind of fountain of youth or eternal life. 

Aronofsky seems to really enjoy dealing with the big questions of life. It seems to me that **The Fountain** is his attempt to address these questions in a sci-fi format, or his attempt at making a **Matrix** or **2001** though I'd say it is more comparable to the later. 

One thing you definitely can say about **The Fountain** is that it certainly was showy. The visuals were nothing less than spectacular. All the scenes had this grand, otherworldly air about them, even the scenes in the operating room or the scenes in South America looked more like a fairy tale or fantastic world than gritty reality. 

I love the image of the guy riding the bubble with the tree through space, though what it was and represented are, unfortunately, a little vague to me. This is what I really came here to discuss, what is the meaning of the bubble or at least what are some interpretations of it. For a director who has done such gritty realistic films, this must have a definite symbolic meaning though, as picturesque as it is, what it's precise meaning is lost to me.  

Some of the confusing elements I have made connections to. The scenes of the Conquistador were from Izzi's book though they may also have been memories of their past lives. The tree in the bubble floating in space is the tree of life, though one of the confusing things is that Tommy treats it like it's Izzi. They were heading to the dying star that was the Mayan land of the dead, I surmise so that they can be together. Why did Tomas turn into a bunch of flowers after drinking the sap of the tree of life? Is that what tied him to the tree that was flying through space? 

Another film that this one recalls in me is [**What Dreams May Come**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/). They are both fantastic films about undying love between two people and the after life to some extent. I feel that **The Fountain** was a superior film in tone and visually, though I feel that **What Dreams May Come** was more successful at conveying it's meaning and therefore was a more pleasurable movie to watch from that point of view.

 made in Hollywood and starring Basil Rathbone.  But not really. The film was really a Russian film made in Odessa in 1962 and called Планета Бурь or Planet of Storms. Here is its wikipedia page: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planeta_Bur

The legendary Roger Corman basically stole the Russian film and shot a few crappy low budget scenes on an American set I suspect had pieces made of cardboard. These scenes feature Basil Rathbone portraying a scientist back on earth in charge of the mission. Rathbone’s performance is pretty awful as he talks into a microphone giving instructions to the Russian characters who are in trouble on Venus. The Hollywood film gives no credit to the Russian filmmakers and westernizes the Russian actors names in the credits. Basically the Hollywood crew added nothing to the film but whoever did the dialogue looping did a great job making the Russian actors appear to be speaking English, with only a few glaring inconsistencies of lips and words not matching.
The film stock we wind up with is really awful, the color is badly washed out but it is very clear none the less that the Russian film had really high production values with excellent sets and costumes.
Odd as this story is, it gets even odder. For whatever reason at the same time the Roger Corman was shooting and splicing Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet, he was also shooting and splicing ANOTHER  film utilizing footage from the Russian movie. This one was called Queen of Blood,
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Blood
Starring among others, Dennis Hopper and Basil Rathbone. What a paring.
This would all be really odd as it is but it goes another step farther with yet ANOTHER film being made in Hollywood using the Russian film. This time director Peter Bogdanovich is given the directing nod by Corman and they make Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women in 1968: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_to_the_Planet_of_Prehistoric_Women

Getting tired of this? I am. But its fascinating to me that this film I saw first as a kid in the 1970’s on a black and white T.V. had taken such an odd path to my door. Incidentally if you look up the film on IMDB you don’t see the fascinating back story mentioned. You have to hunt around on their page until you find the trivia section but even then they only give you two or three breezy lines with little detail. I think the story of these films is fascinating.

1363703567.0,121,self.TrueFilm,1ale1d,"Saw 'Delicatessen' (1991) for the first time this week. A surreal, dark, nostalgic experience. My review.",142,21,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ale1d/saw_delicatessen_1991_for_the_first_time_this/,"Imaginative surrealist black comedy set in a dystopian future France where food is in short supply. A small local community revolves around a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who supplies the town with the only meat still on offer…. human, which he acquires by posting advertisements for an odd job man in the local paper. Anyone lucky enough to get the job receives room and board - and a grisly death at the hands of the butcher. However when his latest tenant, former circus clown Louison (Dominique Pinon), arrives his daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) becomes enamoured with him and is determined he doesn’t end up on her father’s chopping block.

In many ways it’s a nostalgic film that echoes the Golden Age of Hollywood, a story of love in the face of adversity with touches of Buster Keaton slapstick and interludes of the cast demonstrating their talents for music or dance in the same way that Marx Brothers movies are intercut with Harpo playing the harp or Chico tinkling the ivories. A dark sepia toned palette and overall 1940s styling heighten the air of the past – in turn making the juxtaposition of the black plot and surreal fantasy characters even more pronounced and enjoyable. In equal parts comforting and horrific, there is no holding back on the blood and dark humour but with a warm carefree presentation. Held together by a small well-drawn cast of bizarre characters who occupy the butcher’s apartment block, we glimpse their individual lives and foibles like the cast of an eccentric cartoon or sitcom. Each with their own stories or motivations, there is never a dull moment as they’re all so odd and interesting. Dominique Pinon is wonderful as the rubber-faced former clown employing some expert physical acting but also the emotional tenderness to bring his relationship with the butcher’s daughter believably to life. 

'Delicatessen' is beautifully designed, with every set taking an imaginative spin on the 1940s – updating or contorting it in various ways. Almost entirely set inside the apartment block or underground, it’s also very claustrophobic, with tight crops and close ups. This has the effect of  capturing what it is to be confined to the dingy flats, but also reveals the fantastic attention to detail shown by the art department. The film’s plot may be forgotten over time, but the odd dark dreamlike world it creates leaves a lasting impression. It’s a wonderfully inventive film, and an utterly unique experience. Confident enough to just have fun in its bizarre universe, although perhaps not as accessible as Jeunet’s other work, 'Amélie', it has countless pleasures to offer and is capable of entertaining anyone who is willing to be seduced by it.

1353758097.0,119,self.TrueFilm,13pme5,Bond Saturdays: A 5½ Month 007 Journey,145,26,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/13pme5/bond_saturdays_a_5½_month_007_journey/,"James Bond has become such a modern staple in our culture, it depressed me to realise that I’d never watched a Bond film the full way through. Hints of Thunderball and The Living Daylights appeared in the back of my mind, but I had somehow never sat myself down to watch any of them. With the release of the first Skyfall trailer, I decided that I should watch the lot. Seeing as I had never seen a 007 film the full-way through, I decided that with the release of Skyfall (November 15 in Aus, late as hell), I would have a Bond marathon of sorts as to fully prepare and invest myself into the 007 universe. Here’s the basic rundown of what I did

———————————————————————————————————

- Watched each Bond film every Saturday in the order they were released (usually around 7pm)

- Only EON/MGM/United Artists/Paramount films (No Never Say Never Again or the 60’s Casino Royale, maybe later) 

- Realising that I had organised the timing incorrectly to end on Skyfall, I skipped a week between The Living Daylights and GoldenEye (the longest real-life break between Bond films)

———————————————————————————————————

June 16th kicked it off with **Dr. No**, very different to how I expected a first James Bond film to turn out. It’s clear now that they were just finding their footing in how to shape 007 for the film world. The primary thing I noticed when watching this (and the first 5 films): Connery just oozes with class. This is what I think of when I think of James Bond. Dr. No itself seemed like a reasonably weak Bond movie, but it’s brought up to a whole new level due to Connery’s delivery and actions. Honey Ryder’s pretty, Dr. No’s a reasonably interesting villain, so we’re off to a reasonably good start.

**From Russia With Love** seems like an entirely different movie, and that definitely isn’t a bad thing. While Dr. No is quite a simply structured movie experience, FRWL ends up as a sort of wonderfully intense spy thriller. The pace is miles slower that Dr. No, but this probably has some of the best acting of the series, wonderful sets, great villains, great action (when it has it) and easily the best use of a Bond gadget in my eyes. An absolutely fantastic follow-up, and a great, great movie, Bond or not

And here we are at what is believed to be the peak of the series, **Goldfinger**. When I started compiling this marathon, I felt that I wouldn’t think Goldfinger would really be the best. And… it is the best. While it’s been a close ride (and I mean close) there is still no Bond film in my mind that is better than this one. Connery at the top of his game, great villain, great Bond girls, great theme song, and a full introduction to one of the series’ best characters, Q. This is also the Bond film that sets the stables for its future siblings, basically making it the film that got everything right. When people who have not seen a Bond film are interesting in seeing them but not all, Goldfinger will always be the first film I’ll recommend.

After the emotional rise of Goldfinger, I was reasonably excited to see **Thunderball**, as it was the first Bond I had memories of seeing in parts. And… it was disappointing to say the least. On reflection, this was in my mind the worst Connery film (yet to see NSNA). It definitely isn’t Connery’s fault, nor the villains, nor the writers. What seems to be a pretty interesting premise gets bogged down by a snail’s pace and drawn out underwater shots. FRWL was definitely slow in pace, but it was filled with fantastic dialogue and a sense of build-up. In this, it feels like nothing’s happening. The villain’s not very interesting, I don’t even remember the Bond girl, I was left thoroughly disappointed by something I thought was great.

It might have been just because of the disappointment from the last week, but **You Only Live Twice** was probably my biggest surprise of the Bond series. I still have no idea why, but this to me was the funnest of the Bond films to watch. Besides the first full reveal of Blofeld, there’s nothing that seems truly spectacular in the general viewers mind, and while Connery’s Asian disguise looks like an shaved tanned Burt Reynolds, the cinematography’s nice, the actions a whole lot of fun, and it has one of the best end sequences of all the films. Definitely the most entertaining and wackiest of the lot without going too overboard.

The next film, **On Her Majesty’s Secret Service**, was one I was expecting to have mixed feelings about. It was the first without Connery, and Lazenby was only there for the one movie. On the other hand, I had read much critical buzz (at least from our timeframe) of how underrated and great this film was, with filmmakers like Christopher Nolan naming it their favourite Bond movie. It’s definitely a film of two halves. The first half is borderline boring, setting up what seems to be a weak plotline, with Lazenby reading his lines like a robot. What saves the movie is the last hour. Tense, exciting, very visually beautiful, and a great ski scene, which at the time, I thought was really creative. Blofeld is wonderfully intimidating, thanks to a good performance by Terry Savalas. Dianna Rigg also plays, in my mind, the best Bond girl ever, no wonder she was the one to marry him. I think if Connery stayed on for this film, it would have been considered one of the greats. I still think it’s one of the best, just a bit too long.

To keep it short, I didn’t like **Diamonds Are Forever**. Awfully cheesy, the character of Blofeld was nothing short of terrible, and, my primary issue, Connery was too old for the role. This issue comes up soon in the series (which I’ll get to) but when Connery returned, he was not the same Bond. He just seemed to have this creepy uncle vibe in the movie, I just couldn’t believe that someone like him could “get” this many young attractive women.

What happened next was quite a blur, and to be honest, I don’t know if I particularly want to remember it. The Roger Moore era in my mind is the biggest low-point in the series, not because they are particularly bad, but because they are so unbelievably average. The only thing I remember from **Live and Let Die** was the theme song. Christopher Lee and James Bond fighting a dwarf are the only things that I can picture when thinking about **The Man With The Golden Gun**. I guess **The Spy Who Loved Me** was a bit better, but the second half is one I hardly remember. **Moonraker**’s just ridiculous, and the Jaws relationship didn’t seem anything else but lame. It’s from **For Your Eyes Only** that I draw the line with Bond films, not only because they are basically the same movie, but Moore is just way too old to be Bond. Throughout FYEO, **Octopussy** and **A View To A Kill**, Moore came off to me as a creepy uncle as opposed to that of a classy Brit. A View To A Kill is probably what I consider the worst of the Bond films, mainly because I was just annoyed at the end of what I had witnessed as one of the most bland 6 weeks of film viewing I’ve ever had in my life.

My hopes were high for Dalton in his debut, **The Living Daylights**, and unlike Thunderball, this film delivered on every level. Well-shot, a reasonably strong sense of humour (not necessarily from Dalton himself), exciting action scenes, wonderful Bond girl, and one of the best endings of all the Bond films. Upon reflection, Dalton is definitely my favourite Bond. He had a sense of class and viciousness about the character, and most importantly, he was human. A lot of people don’t view **Licence To Kill** with too much love, and I agree that TLD was much better, but it’s a great Bond film with a great villain, henchmen, and a real sense of risk. Dalton, in my mind, was too ahead of his time, he was almost the original Craig, but I’ll get to that later.

Sadly, Dalton never got a third film, and thus, after a 6 year wait, Pierce Brosnan took the role. **Goldeneye** was his first, and what a movie to start on. While nothing in it is particualrly ground-breakingly brilliant, this is still one of the funnest, most exciting Bond movies (up there with YOLT). The film is regularly overshadowed by its N64 video game adaptation, with isn’t really fair. As for Brosnan himself, his Bond was very much to me like a ‘greatest hits’ album. He combined all of the previous parts of Bond. He’s got the class of Connery, one-liners of Moore and the rawness of Dalton (I guess he’s got Lazenby’s, um, walking ability), but just like any other greatest hits album, something is always missing, but I don’t know what. I guess I thought whatever it was, it would be fixed in the later films. It’s wasn’t…

Regarding **Tomorrow Never Dies**, I think the remote control car chase was pretty cool, but the villain (who in this day and age looks much like a Julian Assange/Steve Jobs hybrid) was rather bland, there’s nothing particularly different about the Bond girl(s), and it didn’t really piece itself together too well. **The World Is Not Enough** was disappointing. Not because I expected much from the premise, but this is the best Brosnan acting as Bond of the lot, and he’s been given this schmaltz. **Die Another Day** had a reasonably interesting first half (particularly enjoyed the sword fight), but things got beyond ridiculous (I take it I don’t have to go into detail)

Obviously I’m not alone in thinking DAD was one of the worst, as the film nearly took Bond out of cinema for good, but 2006 came along, and we got **Casino Royale**. A lot of people don’t see this as a true Bond film, but I have no idea why. This has all the elements of Bond revamped and stylised for the modern world. Daniel Craig shines here, blowing off all adversary of the media and playing easily one of the best Bonds. Eva Green is also brilliant as Vesper, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. It’s reasonably long, but you enjoy it so much the time absolutely flies. The best opening sequence in all of Bond, great action and wonderful Bond atmosphere make it close to the best and definitely the best this type of new Bond could give us. 

With the success of CR, **Quantum of Solace** would inevitably be coming soon, and it did, just 2 years later, for old times sake. While many people seem to despise it, I don’t particularly mind the film. Craig is decent, and as the only immediate follow-up Bond movie so far, it’s pretty interesting. It kept my attention (which I can’t say for some of the others on this list), but I can definitely see why people didn’t like it. Many people accuse Craig’s Bond films as a Bourne rip-off, and this is a prime example. As gritty as it may be, shaky-cam action does not fit a James Bond film, half the time you can’t even tell what’s going on. Other than that, I don’t really have anything against QOS, it’s just not particularly special

As I write this, **Skyfall** has just past through my viewing, making it 23 weeks (close to 6 months) since I began with Dr. No, and to be honest, it feels like it’s come full-circle. I feel really privileged and lucky that I got to end my marathon on a movie as great as this. Everything about this film was near-perfect, and it might be the first Bond to win an Oscar, thanks to Roger Deakins’ stunning cinematography and Sam Mendes’ direction. Great acting all around, a wonderful re-introduction to classic characters and a wonderfully twisted villain in Javier Bardem make it an absolute treat to both Bond and movie fans alike.

In conclusion, I’m glad I watched all of them. Even the Bond films I consider the worst I wouldn’t rate below a 5/10, as I believe there is always something good to be found in them. Should they be judged differently from other films because we consider this series a part of our society? Well, yes and no. Films like FRWL, Casino Royale and Skyfall show that there are many twists and turns in the Bond formula, as well as multiple ways to represent them. If you asked me for rankings, they would roughly be something like this…

&gt;**Oslo, August 31st** d. by Joachim Trier. 2011, wiki, imdb

&gt;I saw this after a recommendation from Filmspotting and it quickly became one of my favorite films of the year. It's about a 34-year-old man named Anders, who is on release from a rehab center so he can go to a job interview. It's one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen. What I like most about it is that it tells its story very concisely; I've heard many reviewers call the film minimal. The emotional impact of the film is definitely not minimal though, and I think it would make a great topic of discussion. Also available on Netflix streaming.


I'll also cover some administrative issues in this post...

First and foremost is the issue of which sorting method to use when counting votes, 'best' or 'top'? Top will prioritise the post with the highest number of upvotes, whereas best will prioritise the post with the best upvote/downvote ratio (it's slightly more complicated than that, but that's the gist of the method I believe). The former will inevitably give an advantage to posts made earlier in the life of the thread, as they have more exposure over time and a better chance of accumulating upvotes. 'Best' on the other hand acts as an effective crutch for posts made later, but also gives the act of downvoting significantly more weight. I'm not sure if we want to facilitate an environment where downvoting suggestions becomes an effective means of influencing the outcome of a vote. As it stands, 'bad weather' is the highest ranked theme when sorting by 'best', and 'non-American perspectives on war' is the highest ranked when sorting by 'top'. This isn't an urgent issue as I won't need to resolve it until the next voting thread (probably a week or more away).

Someone also brought up that months are more than 4 weeks long, which complicates matters if we want a monthly theme. If we watch a new film every two weeks we would quickly go out of sync with month cycles. I'd go into detail but I'm sure you all get it... I think it would be best if we worked in 2 week blocks and paid no heed to the current month personally. This way, when it becomes time to decide the new theme there could be a post along the lines of '[extend current theme for one week]', if people are really into the theme and feel it could be better explored. Alternatively if people are really keen on themes being attached to months we could disregard week cycles and start watching new films on the 1st and 15th the month. There's probably an obvious solution here that I'm missing so if you have a better idea, post below.

The [rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) do not bar users from sharing torrent and download links, however downloading movies is not strictly legal. What's our stance going to be on this practice? More than a few users probably illegal download movies.

Also If anyone wanted to do a group stream of the film, this would be the place to discuss and plan such a screening. 

Posts detailing where to find or where to obtain the film are also welcome, as are any suggestions or queries pertaining to the running of the club.

1372169827.0,116,self.TrueFilm,1h1dpp,"Shane Carruth's hypnotic, metaphysical follow-up to Primer, Upstream Color (2013)",143,27,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1h1dpp/shane_carruths_hypnotic_metaphysical_followup_to/,"A magnificent metaphorical illustration of love and pain – told around a loose narrative that hazily slips through time. A young woman, Kris (Amy Seimetz), is drugged with a grotesque biological agent – making her utterly compliant with a crook who holds her captive and robs her of everything she owns. Left disorientated, with no memory of her ordeal, she later falls in with another lost soul who tries to comfort her fragile broken psyche, as she is consumed by paranoia and the unseen forces of her metaphysical biological organism.

Abusive relationships and repressed pain are depicted with ambiguity and imagination, but this is an intricate, abstracted film that contains anything you wish to see in it. Flitting through time with constant cuts, no scene lasts longer than a few minutes, which proves disorientating and makes events hard to rationalise – but as a winding visual poem that passes before your eyes it should be absorbed as a whole before later being contemplated upon and deconstructed. Bravely experimental, it verges on pretension but ‘Upstream Color’ makes what may sound like an art film work as a piece of cinema, and it’s an experience that deserves to be viewed as such – in a vast, silent, dark room. Home viewings will undoubtedly lose some of the immersive mood that make it so affecting. 

A passion project for Shane Carruth who wrote, directed, produced, scored and stars in the film, it has clearly been pieced together with a meticulous eye focused on a singular vision. As such it occasionally seems a little too clinical and precise in its edit and decision-making, but given the recurring biochemical subject matter this at least feels in keeping. Hazy, shallow focus shots of the couple are paralleled with macro imagery of cells and intense close-ups of biological matter that are sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrific. The cinematography – also by Carruth – is striking and, although very much in the conventional indie aesthetic, still possesses a spellbinding allure that very much carries the picture during its sedate pace.

Despite being light on plot, it also engages narratively as we share in Kris’s desire to discover what the hell happened to her as she pieces together snatches of understanding. Resolution doesn't arrive with the satisfaction that is sometimes hinted at, but the sweeping, human journey it takes touches all of the emotional spectrum – stirring something that will resonate for days afterwards. A melancholic, dark, uplifting, exceptional film.

I think he's a fine filmmaker, but when Argo came out people began exaggerating how good he was, and it's only gotten more over the top since he won the Oscar. He's near the top of the ""competent directors"" working today, but he's nowhere near industry leaders in terms of artistic vision and execution.  

Take Argo, for example. It's a very well-paced, very well made film... but after two hours, did I feel any different? No. I tend to value movies based on how much they affect me during and after I first watch them. I tend to hate when movies are labeled escapist as a way of dismissing their value (really, all sense of entertainment is, to a certain extent), but that's sort of what this feels like; it's a great, highly enjoyable movie, but it's not, in my opinion, excellent. And I think Argo's way better than Gone Baby Gone and The Town (GBG is also really good, but I didn't love The Town).

Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to see what he does in the future. I think Affleck's shown a lot of potential with his filmmaking... but so far, he hasn't taken many risks. His films are formulaic -- formulaic greatness, but formulaic nonetheless. They add nothing to ""the conversation."" I find it frustrating that they receive more accolades and attention than films like *Moonrise Kingdom* and *The Master* -- flawed films, yes, but distinctly memorable experiences that exhiliratingly manipulated and confused their audiences. The only part of Argo that stuck with me was the thrill in the last couple of scenes. The rest of the movie, though? Nowhere near as much.  

Maybe I'm wrong, though.... What do you guys think about his work so far?  

P.S., Having said all that, I'm happy he's enjoying a career resurgence and that he's successful again. He seems to care about what he does, and I respect him for that. I just wish people would take his work for what it is, instead of trying to treat it as something else as just an excuse to call him ""the voice of his generation,"" or something cliché like that.


EDIT: Switched Moonrise Kingdom in for Django because it was my favorite film of the year, anyway, and because hoo-boy, I don't want to have to defend Tarantino in a post about Ben Affleck anymore.

1370710748.0,114,self.TrueFilm,1fxlwl,"""After Earth"" and the future for M. Night Shyamalan",135,21,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fxlwl/after_earth_and_the_future_for_m_night_shyamalan/,"I have a weakness for Sci-Fi films and probably just special effects in general, but I do try to reference rotten tomatoes if at all possible. ""After Earth"" has a dismal score on the site, but [this review](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/30/after-earth-review) intrigued me, especially the statement, ""M. Night Shyamalan isn't quite back in top form here, but After Earth is certainly the best movie he's made in years."" I have to admit, I still have hope that M. Night will recover from this...odd period he is in. ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", and ""The Village"" are all personal favorites of mine. I saw both ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" with friends that absolutely hated those films, but I feel that they wanted those films to be something that they were not. ""Signs"" worked for me as an examination of faith and human interactions, and not simply an alien invasion storyline. ""The Village"" is a very engaging love story to me, but really doesn't work as a creature feature. Those factors allow me to enjoy the films without focusing on the suspension of disbelief (naked aliens hurt by water? no fly zone over a forest preserve?).

However, this all came crashing down hard for me, as well as a lot of other M. Night fans, with ""Lady in the Water"". I believe I saw an earlier post that mentioned this film as the worst film he had ever seen. His reasons echo mine. The film is a giant middle finger to critics; it pretends to be deep without really saying anything, and it casts M. Night himself as a world savior who will save the world through his writing. I feel like the idea of this film was to make a movie that is unable to be criticized by movie critics (because they are literally and figuratively the enemy in this film), but instead it made a movie that is insulting to anyone that enjoys films.

I remember reading [""The Man Who Heard Voices""](http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Who-Heard-Voices/dp/1592402135) before this film arrived to theaters. In Bamberger's book, he describes how M. Night was able to get the funding for this film. If you'll notice, Shyamalan's ""The Village"" was produced by Disney, and ""Lady in the Water"" was produced by Warner Bros. Bamberger describes how this change of production studios occurred. M. Night presented the script for ""Lady in the Water"" to Disney executives, and in a meeting, the higher-ups told M. Night that they just ""didn't get it"". Shyamalan is incredulous. He was the director that gave them ""The Sixth Sense"". No one believed in that film. He has a track record, and they need to trust him on this script and his vision for it. The Disney execs are unconvinced, and the script is shopped to Warner Bros. where production begins. The book presents a narrative that sets M. Night up as the underdog who is going to show the close-minded producers at Disney how wrong they are. They'll be eating their words soon enough; they really just didn't ""get it"".

I find this book to be even more interesting in restrospect. ""Lady in the Water"" was a financial and critical disappointment. Apparently the Disney executives actually DID ""get it"". M. Night's script was self-serving, pompous, and most of all, boring. They were wise to pass on it. You are forced to read the subtext of the book, as it appears that M. Night was not the visionary genius who knew that ""Lady in the Water"" would be a success. Instead, he was arrogant, and way off track, needing someone who was not a yes man to tell him to reevaluate.

I find this fascinating, because I think ""Lady in the Water"" is where M. Night went completely off the rails. This isn't a director who made one bad film and then returned to form. Or a director who got lucky on one good film, and then his following films reveal him to be mediocre. Instead, he went from very well thought of, making movies that were generally well-received and financially viable to critically ravaged films like ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"". It forces me to look back on ""The Man Who Heard Voices"" and characterize M. Night as a delusional filmmaker and writer who decided to make a film simply to show how insecure he was about criticism of his films (honestly, who creates a movie critic character that is savagely gored to death as he attempts to characterize his death as ""cliche"" and ""woefully underwritten""?)

This brings me back to ""After Earth"". There are numerous problems with this film. The acting is questionable, the special effects are subpar, and the backstory is not fully fleshed out to be really engaging. However, I see some of the old M. Night in this film (I realize this film was a collaboration). He uses a unique backdrop, in this case a solar system which contains a post-cataclysmic earth to examine a very common emotional issue, the relationship between a father and son. In the same way that ""Unbreakable"" uses the Superhero backdrop to examine a failing marriage, I believe that this film is using the same technique. Does it work here as well as ""Unbreakable""? Certainly not, but I do think that it is a promising return to form. Using a supernatural backdrop to examine issues of faith, family, love, loss, etc. is a very interesting idea to me. This is why I think ""The Happening"" failed so spectacularly. Despite it's monumentally stupid premise, the film does not have a deeper theme. You might say the love that Wahlberg finds for Deschanel, but that is neither an overarching theme, or particularly compelling. Instead, the film is completely about this plant attack, and that in and of itself is not particularly compelling. Nor is it effective as a fictionalized, ""Inconvenient Truth"", in forcing us to wake up and become conservationists.

Unfotunately, I can't say I really enjoyed ""After Earth"". The father-son dynamic unfortunately follows the infuriating movie cliche where the son needs to ""prove"" to his father that he's a man and can take care of himself. Jaden Smith's character actually blames his father for the death of his sister because he was ""too busy working"". I was almost choking on the horrific cliches here, and how much they ring false. The father-son relationship here is not handled with any of the nuance seen in other films, and we're obviously meant to cheer when Jaden's character directly disobeys his father simply to shove it in his father's face. An overcoming all odds story with very little realism (as much realism as can be expected in a film like this), it ultimately seems very hollow.

Sorry to rant for so long without really coming to a point. And obviously a popcorn flick like ""After Earth"" is not going to receive very much serious analysis, nor is it meant to withstand it. However, I think in context of M. Night's larger career, I think it is either a promising blip which shows a return to form, or it is continuous evidence that M. Night has lost interest in films completely is using his experience to become a ""gun for hire"".

**TL;DR** What did you think of ""After Earth"" in regards to M. Night Shyamalan's continuing career? Do you think there is any merit in the minority opinion that is shows a return to form for M. Night? Or have you closed the book on him and his films?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1fxlwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fxlwl/after_earth_and_the_future_for_m_night_shyamalan/,

It can cause a mediocrely written tragedy to feel more sad than it really is, and can transform a great film into a memorable classic. 

For this discussion, I would like to focus on those movies that have distinguished themselves by their score. One of my favorites in this respect is the often-mentioned ""There Will Be Blood."" Johnny Greenwood understood the disturbing subject matter and set the chilling atmosphere with his suspenseful sounds. The soundtrack kept me on edge, and accompanied Lewis' similarly chilling performance well.

Another example of music well fitted for a film is one of my favorites, Beauvois' ""Of Gods and Men."" Rather than inserting an original score, the makers thought it best to let the characters supply the music. Most of the film is overcast by a tranquil silence, except for the long scenes in which the monks are singing their Medieval Gregorian chants. By letting the viewer listen to the traditional music of the monastery, one can plunge further into the life of the characters, and experience the peace that comes with seclusion.

The last example I will bring up is Kubrick's 18th Century drama ""Barry Lyndon,"" which expertly borrows pieces from works by Schubert, Bach, Handel, etc. The master director often filled his films with recognizable classical music in order to convey the emotions that the characters were going through. Along with the orchestra pieces, he added traditional (Irish) folk songs that fit perfectly with the mood of the whole work.

Before anyone replies we know the Oscars are far from perfect but they're always good for getting a discussion on the years films going. Let's try to lay off the Oscar bashing unless it's constructive about poor choices they've made this year and *why* you think so please.

Thoughts on the nominees? Any glaring omissions or shock inclusions? Who do you think *will* win each category and who do you think *should* win? 

I'll comment later because I've seen a disappointingly small number of the nominations but I plan on changing that asap.

1357242831.0,110,self.TrueFilm,15wkin,Bill not being dead at the end of Kill Bill -- what are /r/truefilm's thoughts?,179,69,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15wkin/bill_not_being_dead_at_the_end_of_kill_bill_what/,"Some further elaboration on [jordanlund's ""Beatrix doesn't kill Bill"" in *Kill Bill.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15rgga/kill_bill_fan_theory_beatrix_doesnt_actually_kill/)  I think he's right, and that these are the most telling signs:

1. When Beatrix discovers she is pregnant, she stops being an assassin and starts being a mother.  She doesn't kill a woman sent to kill her, she disobeys Bill, and she runs away, leaving everything behind.  This shows that, when her child is in the equation, she changes.

2. Initially, she is on this bloody rampage.  She massacres the Crazy-88 (mirroring the massacre in the chapel), kills O'Ren, and only spares the young boy member of the Crazy-88.  She brutally mutilates Sofie, and only spares her life so she can tell Bill what happened.

3. This changes slightly after the encounter with Vernita Green.  She kills Vernita, and her daughter, Nikki, comes in and sees it.  A moment like this cannot occur in the script without it changing the character in some way.  And Beatrix does change, ever-so-slightly.  She doesn't kill as easily.  (Cool note, this theme is touched upon in *Django Unchained* when Jamie Foxx expresses concerns about killing someone in front of his son.)

4. While she doesn't make the choice to 'not kill anyone' for the rest of the film, we don't ever see the kind of carnage we did in the House of Blue Leaves.  She tracks down Budd, presumably to kill him, but her plans are foiled.  

5. Elle murders Budd.  Beatrix returns and faces Elle.  She doesn't kill Elle, even though she has every reason to.  Firstly, there's no guarantee the snake will kill her.  It's a big trailer, and obviously Elle was skilled enough to wrangle it into the suitcase full of money.  Secondly, Elle tells Beatrix that she poisoned Pai Mei -- yet even this doesn't make her kill Elle.  It shows incremental character growth that she spares Elle's life.  

6. For the rest of the film, despite encountering people who deserve it (the guy who helped Budd bury her alive, the sleazy and abusive pimp played by Michael Parks), she doesn't kill or even discipline anyone.

7. When she arrives at Bill's place, she finds her daughter.  Now this is essential.  We saw how her character changed when she saw a positive pregnancy test (which is no guarantee of a child -- she was probably only a few weeks pregnant, so birth wasn't guaranteed).  Now imagine how she must change when she sees her daughter, alive and well.

8. This is where the ""playing dead"" thread is introduced.  BB ""kills"" Bill, her father, and he falls down, ""dead.""  This is important later on.

9. BB is shown to be in an environment that could lead to her becoming a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  She has the toy gun, she killed her gold fish for no real reason, she speaks frankly with Bill about death, she watches films like *Shogun Assassin.*  It's clear that this is not a place where she can be raised healthily, and Beatrix knows this.  This is why she ran in the first place. **See bottom of post for more elaboration.**

10. Bill gives his ""Superman"" speech.  Superman is Superman, and he will always be Superman, even when he's Clark Kent.  He's telling Beatrix that she will always be a cold-blooded killer, and that's never going to change.  This is something that Beatrix has struggled with before, and something that comes to a boil in the next scene.

12. The final scene with Bill.  He has always been a sort of father figure to Beatrix, and was before he became her lover.  He even acts like her father when he comes to the chapel.  And just like how BB ""killed"" her father and he played along, so does Beatrix ""kill"" this father figure/lover, and he plays along.

13. [David Carradine's name is not crossed out in the final credits.](http://imgur.com/a/hgzIz)  Vivica A. Fox is crossed out, Lucy Liu is crossed out, Michael Madsen is crossed out, Daryl Hannah has a question mark, but David Carradine remains.  That's another strong indicator.

14. Bill doesn't kill Beatrix in the beginning, so, in accordance with ""an eye for an eye,"" her vengeance doesn't necessarily have to be killing Bill.  What Bill does do, however, is take her daughter away, which she does in the end.  I believe she has her vengeance regardless, even if Bill is alive.

15. When Bill draws his sword in the final scene and slashes at Beatrix, she doesn't draw her sword.  She keeps it sheathed.

16. Now why would Bill attack her?  Because he's trying to prove to her that she isn't fit to be a mother and that she can't leave with BB.  That's what he was trying to prove when he first 'shot' her.  She left him with their daughter, tried to leave the assassin life behind, tried to be normal.  Just like Superman trying to be Clark Kent.  At this point, Bill is trying to prove his little theory.  Which brings us to the central conflict of the final scene:

17. If Beatrix kills Bill, then she proves him right.  He said that she will always be a ""cold-hearted killer.""  The dangerous repercussions of this path are shown in the scenes where BB 'kills' her parents, talks to Bill frankly about death, and kills her goldfish.  If she spares Bill, she proves him wrong, and has a character arc that's fitting with how she's reacted when her daughter enters the equation.  They are no longer just fighting assassins.  They are a mother and father, and this is a domestic dispute.

18. Coupled with his belief that Beatrix will always be a ""cold-hearted killer"" is Bill's belief that he will always be a ""murdering bastard.""  When the Beatrix's character changes, so does Bill's.  When he sees that she has taken the high road, he sees an opportunity to bow out gracefully and give her what she deserves.

19. [Here is the final scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL7nLSSSWjw)  A key moment is when Bill asks her if Pai-Mei taught her the 5 Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.  She SAYS ""of course he did,"" but she shakes her head 'no.'  That is NOT an accident.  That is a calculated decision on Tarantino's and Thurman's part to introduce ambiguity.  It's called subtext, when character's dialogue says one thing, but their actions imply another.

20. At the end, she says that she's a bad person.  And then Bill refutes his entire Superman speech by saying that she isn't.  He says ""You're a terrific person, you're my favorite person.""  I think this point could go either way.  Either she DID kill him and feels bad about it and he is absolving her, or she didn't kill him and he's still letting her win, acknowledging that he was wrong about her and about himself.  

Now the question of motivation -- why did she do that?  Because her character has changed.  She's had an arc.  The body count in *Vol. 2* pales in comparison to *Vol. 1,* she's less violent, and less driven by revenge.  In fact, as soon as she sees BB alive, revenge ceases to be her primary motive and getting her daughter out takes priority.  

But then consider how she didn't want her daughter to grow up like this.  That's the reason she ran in the first place and risked her life.  How can she kill Bill (a man she still loves, and one who loves her) without being a hypocrite?  If she kills Bill, then she proves him right when he said she is nothing more than a cold-hearted killer.  That's the whole point of it.  Bill is convinced that she can't change, and he's trying to convince her, because then she'd stay.  

But her character has changed.  Her daughter is the impetus required for a massive character change.  So she ""kills"" Bill in the same way that BB did, and Bill, realizing that he's lost her and his daughter, and that she's suffered enough, does the honorable thing and lets them go.  He plays along, and 'dies' in an incredibly theatrical and 'fake' way, similar to how he 'died' when BB 'killed' him.

The conflict has reached its climax, Bill has been 'neutralized' as a threat because his character has changed, as well.  He felt betrayed at first, and he shot Beatrix in the head (despite it hurting him immensely, it was him ""at his most masochistic"").  Since then, he's lived with BB as a constant reminder of his actions.  He knows he's a murdering bastard, but the thing that causes him to change is seeing that Beatrix has changed.  She's no longer the student/protégé of Bill, but his equal.

- The fact that they are equal is important.  In their first scene together, Beatrix is on the ground, Bill is standing and then crouching above her.  In another scene, Bill is sitting by the campfire, and Beatrix is lying on the ground nearby, looking up at him.  In the living room, Beatrix is on the couch with the truth serum in her leg, Bill is above her, sitting on higher chairs, standing, and pacing.  These scenes are a spatial representation of their relationship, which is one of a teacher/pupil.  There are only two scenes where they are actually 'equal.'  The scene on the porch of the chapel, which Bill sees as an undeserved equality, and the scene of them two sitting at the table.  The difference is that, during the latter scene, Bill knows that Beatrix has earned this.  The relationship has shifted and changed because the characters have changed.

Ultimately, Bill ""dies,"" and is left lying on the ground.  He's as low as Beatrix was in the opening shot of *Vol. 1.*  Balance is restored, and all is right in the jungle.  

Now I'm not saying that this is 100% true, but I am saying that it's not 100% true that Bill is dead.  There is a lot of room for interpretation here.  I don't know, but I think there are arguments for both.   I understand I might be grinding some gears, but bear with me.  My proposal of this theory doesn't invalidate any other theories or anyone's enjoyment of the film.  The film remains as it is, and will always be that way.  I'd say that the fact that so many compelling reasons for another interpretation exist is a testament to the complexity of the film, and something that should be praised.  Good on Tarantino.

**ELABORATION ON POINT 9**

When Beatrix discovers she is pregnant, she quickly comes to the realization that she cannot responsibly carry, give birth to, and raise a child while she's living
her current lifestyle.  Her realization of this fact is shown when she talks to her assassin and convinces her to leave.  She says so herself that, were she not pregnant, things would be different and the two would be fighting.

This introduces a very clear character trait in Beatrix when it comes to children.  She and Vernita Green stop fighting when Nikki comes in.  She tells Nikki that if she wants to seek revenge when she's older, that she will be waiting.  She offers Gogo (17 years old) the chance to run, and only kills her when it's kill-or-be-killed.  She spanks the young Crazy-88 member and sends him home.

Repetition with variation -- it's well established by the end of *Vol 2* that Beatrix has acquired a motherly quality that comes out (in its own unorthodox Tarantinoesque way) when children enter the equation.

Now, onto BB.  BB is not a normal child.  She doesn't act normally.  She's a little girl, but she's playing with toy guns, 'shooting' her parents.  She admits to just taking her goldfish out of its tank and stepping on it, and she doesn't seem to show any remorse.  She has frank talks about death with Bill, and her favorite film is *Shogun Assassin.*

These are not the character traits of a typical child growing up in a typical household with typical parents.  This is what Beatrix feared, and the reason she ran in the first place.  Because she doesn't want this for her child.  She wants to be a mother, not a cold-hearted killer.

Now how does this tie into the 'not killing Bill' theory?  Firstly, it supports the part of the theory based on the proposal that her motivation has changed from simple revenge to saving her daughter.  Her motives become more complex the moment she sees BB, and her character changes, just like when she saw that pregnancy test (and even more so because BB is actually alive and well -- a positive pregnancy test is no guarantee of a child.)

It also adds to her internal conflict -- being an assassin/cold-hearted killer, or being a mother.  She doesn't believe she can do both, which is why she ran in the first place.  And a lot of tension comes from this at the end because on one hand, she can kill Bill and be a hypocrite, or spare Bill, which has its own risks.

This conflict is bolstered by Bill's 'Superman' monologue, which is tantamount to him saying that Beatrix has always been and will always be a cold-hearted killer, and that she can't change that.  Even if she runs away with BB and changes her name, she'll still just be 'Superman dressed as Clark Kent.' 

Now her relationship with Bill is a complicated one at this point.  On one hand, she hates him for what he did to her, but on the other, she loves him because of BB.  We've seen in earlier scenes that they have been master/pupil, lovers, and father/daughter, so their relationship has gone through a few changes.  But at this point, she is faced with a dilemma:

1. Kill Bill and cement herself as a cold-blooded killer.  It doesn't get much more cold-blooded than killing the father of your child, a man you still have feelings for.  With the child 'present,' no less.  (The reason it doesn't get any more cold-blooded than that is because it's exactly what Bill did.  He 'killed' her, the mother of his child, whom he still loved, and the child was 'present.'

2. Spare Bill and prove him wrong.  This simultaneously gets her revenge, because she 'kills him' without 'killing him.'  Just like he shot her in the head without actually killing her.  It's an eye for an eye.  In doing this, she proves him wrong, secures herself as a suitable mother for BB, and is able to leave with her.  Her arc is completed, she changes as a character, and gets what she wants.  

The fact is, the whole 'pretend' killing is EXACTLY an eye-for-an-eye.  Bill killed Beatrix without actually killing her.  And now Beatrix kills Bill without actually killing him.  These are big themes, and this is heavy-handed, but not out of place in a Tarantino film.

In the end, it's still all just a theory, but the fact that I've written this much on this and it's garnered such a divided response indicates that the theory is valid.  Believe what you want -- knowledge of this theory can only enrich your enjoyment of the film.

**A final point:  Here is one of Beatrix's final lines:**

&gt;**Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman.  I was a killer who killed for you.  Before that strip turned blue, I would've jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train.  For you.  But once that strip turned blue...I could no longer do any of those things.  Not anymore.  Because I was gonna be a mother.**

**When she says this line, she IS a mother.**

Another interesting point -- in the original script, the ending is quite different.  They go to sleep, they wake up at dawn and fight on the beach.  Bill doesn't swing at her.  They fight on the beach at dawn, Beatrix in her wedding gown, Bill in a tuxedo.  She says ""Attack Me"" in Japanese, and they fight.  This is an ending lacking subtlety and comes off as cheesy (though not as cheesy if the film had been released as *The Whole Bloody Affair.*)  I believe that Tarantino made good changes, and coupled with those changes is an ambiguity that fits nicely.

**Now, I can take or leave the theory, because I know it's just that -- a theory that is supported by a few elements, and discredited by several others. But it makes the film more interesting, not in whether or not it's 'true,' but in that it makes people think about the film more.**

That's what this is all about.  I could care less about whether or not Bill lives or dies (because in the end, the film remains and would be unchanged), but I can appreciate this movie more now because I've spent the time considering this theory and looking into the characters and analyzing it. Never said the theory was true, but 'truth' isn't important. Yes, most everything points to Bill being dead and it wraps it up nicely. But even considering that he isn't allows you to think about the film in ways you couldn't before.

I hope that others find it edifying.  After thinking about this theory, I know a lot more about the characters and I'll enjoy the film much more when I see it next. An obsession with ""the truth,"" which is such a fluid concept and one that can't really be applied to films anyway.  It's like whenever a Malick film comes out and people start dissecting it trying to find the ""meaning"" as if Malick had hidden it away somewhere in the film.  Interpretation, not truth.  It's why some people enjoy some films more than others.  It's why someone out there might enjoy something like [Police, Adjective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337051/) or [Sátántangó](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/), which I, personally, can't stand.

If you are open minded and considered the implications of the theory, it can allow you to see the story in a different context, shed light on the characters, notice visual and narrative parallels, etc. Film theory on its own is rarely interesting -- it's how you interpret it and how it makes you re-interpret the film that makes it interesting.

I'm not even that big a fan of Tarantino -- I believe he stands on the shoulders of giants and incorporates enough elements that were tried by previous filmmakers to have a 'style' of his own. But this theory let me enjoy Kill Bill more because it made me think about it in a different way, think more about the characters and their motivations, think beyond a standard revenge flick.

And knowing Tarantino (who didn't make a standard heist movie in Reservoir Dogs or a standard war movie in Inglourious Basterds or a standard Western in Django Unchained), that's a good thing.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1357444337.0,,,True,t3_15wkin,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15wkin/bill_not_being_dead_at_the_end_of_kill_bill_what/,

1360162443.0,111,self.TrueFilm,18015y,Director Discussion: Akira Kurosawa,125,14,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18015y/director_discussion_akira_kurosawa/,"During the last few months, I have been working through the majority of Akira Kurosawa's filmography and throughly enjoying my odyssey. Now that I'm coming to the end of my retrospective, I wanted to find out what TrueFilm thinks of him in terms of his importance as a director, his ability to entertain and some of his stylistic choices throughout his career.

During all the films I've seen over the last few months, there has been one thing that I've been astounded at and that is his consistency. I'm not one to say that every single individual film he has made is a masterpiece, and he has certainly attempted some overly ambitious and restrictive films, but he undoubtedly maintains an excellent trajectory throughout a 50 year career in film.
The majority of critics say his most important and productive years were between 1948 and 1965 and I tend to agree. Obviously everybody knows the famous ""classics"" like **Seven Samurai**, **Rashomon** and **Yojimbo**, which were made during this period, but we also got what I consider to be his three best films, **High and Low**, **Throne of Blood** and **Red Beard**.

I struggle to think of another director who was so prolific and consistent as Akira Kurosawa during this period of creativity other than Hitchcock or possibly Scorcese but do enlighten me if you can think of any! He then had some personal issues that limited his work between 1966 and 1993 during which time he only made 7 more films, one of which (**Ran**) became another critically revered film for it's use of adaptivity and colour, something Kurosawa was not particularly known for but managed to master anyway.

Another thing I've been amazed by is just how accesible Kurosawa's films have been. He is a fantastic storyteller with a knack for creating numerous effecting atmospheres, sometimes all in the space of one film (**High and Low** being the best example). Even his grand, humanistic films like **Red Beard** and **Ikiru** are brilliantly paced and never get boring, something I was admittedly wary of when checking a lot of Kurosawa's running times, and factoring in that I am also a western audience, I think this is very impressive. Is Kurosawa the most Western of all the Eastern directors? 

From the inventive camera trickery at the end of **Red Beard** to the shafts of light bursting through the trees in **Rashomon**, the troubled face of Takashi Shimura in **Ikiru** and the sometimes manic, sometimes reserved but always engaging perfomances of his favourite actor Toshiru Mifune, I feel like I could watch most of these films again tomorrow and still find something new to love about them.

Of the few misfires in his cinematic canon, I would point towards those that lost my attention the most, **Kagemusha** and **Dersu Uzala**. Neither are lacking in passion or ideas but they didn't quite mesmerise me as much as the rest of his films. **Kagemusha** especially seemed hurried, lazy and scruffy, very unlike Kurosawa. That being said, both these films have been critically acclaimed so these are very much subjective preferences.

I've yet to see **The Hidden Fortress** or **Rhapsody in August** but I'm thoroughly looking forward to completing this wonderful director's filmography. It's been a great journey through a personal prism of Japanese culture and I strongly recommend anyone who has enjoyed Kurosawa's classics to check out his lesser known works as well, they are, on most accounts, just as excellent.

He's made a movie every year since 1976, a staggering track record.
But whats more remarkable is that the quality among them rarely dips.
Quite a few of them are incredible. Annie Hall, Manhattan, Midnight in Paris, Match Point, Hannah and her Sisters...I could go on and on.

But he's also made a fair few critical stinkers. From Rome with Love, Anything Else, Celebrity, Shadows and Fog, Melinda and Melinda to name a few (well nearly them all, but even these weren't total disasters).

My question is have these flops prevented Allen from reaching an even greater level of respect? I'm not saying his small amount of flops have hurt his reputation, merely stopped his reputation as a filmmaker reaching the very peak of cinematic greatness.

If say he had taken a couple of years out and refined a script more or waited until he truly had a story he wanted to tell not made one of his less worshipped films. Sometimes it feel like he just makes a film because he knows he has a record to keep(The last time he took a 2 year break in between films he made Annie Hall!).

If he had made say only great 20 films instead of 42 great-to-average films, would we not praise him to levels of Kurosawa and Kubrick? 

For example, Tarantino has made 9 good - brilliant films in the last 20 years giving him an air of almost invincibility. If for example he had made 20 films in the last 20 years, still including Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained but also a lot more Death Proofs...he surely would not have the reputation he does today.

So yeah...sorry for the almost essay but what do you think? Do you think it's cut short Allen's reputation or do the bad films make Allen a better filmmaker?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1jr01a,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jr01a/has_woody_allens_prolific_output_damaged_his/,

First of all, spoilers ahead, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this post. However, I highly reccomend this movie if you enjoy black comedy, or just off-the-wall bizareness.


Anyway, a friend had suggested this movie awhile back, but I had forgotten it. I saw a clip from it on /r/cringe and decided to give it a shot. I will say, ""cringe"" is a good word to describe my feelings watching this movie. The whole thing was just so, well, unsettling. The awkwardness, tension, and just pathetic nature of practically everything in the movie was palpable. What amazed me about it was it's ability to seamlessly switch between comedy and drama. There are parts, that are just absurd, but are still believable. Contrast this to, say, Airplane, which while I love it, doesn't exactly exude realism. The acting was absolutely top notch. In particular, I thought the casting of the three sisters could not have been more perfect. The moment where Trish is admitting to Joy about how she thought she was going to be a failure is one of the most painfully uncomfortable moments in the whole thing. While I feel bad to say this, I utterly lost it when Helen describes her desire to be raped, because the idea is so absurd. She talks about being shallow, but wanting to be raped to make herself a better writer is the epitome of shallow. And then there's basically everything involving the eldest son and his dad. Everything about that was just miserable. 

Basically, what struck me about this movie was how everything was so strikingly pathetic. Every. single. thing. It was an almost masochistic experience, because unlike something riveting and gut-wrenching like Hotel Rwanda, there's no message, there's no uplifting end note about how humanity struggles through (well okay sort of) even through the most terrible odds and most atrocious circumstances. No. It ends with a kid exclaiming to his entire miserable family that he just sucessfully ejaculated for the first time. 

I apologize for the mindless rambling. I loved it, for its ability to really evoke those visceral emotions that other movies don't really succeed to. I *cared* about the characters, even the ones I didn't like, or were repulsed by.

Hear me out.,155,48,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jr4ir/lets_reassess_prometheus_2012_my_take_the_most/,"“You were not there for the beginning. You will not be there for the end. Your knowledge of what is going on can only be superficial and relative.” - William Burroughs, *Naked Lunch*

Prometheus, a pseudo-prequel to Alien, came out last year to a modestly positive critical response and an immediate, vitriolic backlash on the internet. Even people who liked the film had a hard time with some parts, and those who hated the film found fault with every aspect: dumb characters, lazy writing, plot-holes, inaccurate science. Hell, some people are still personally mad about writer Damon Lindelof's finale for the show Lost (let's not even go there).

So why do I want this community to reassess the film with me? Well for one, what I have to say ties quite nicely into the discussions on here recently, specifically the ones about which films are worthy for analysis/discussion as well as the thread about when its appropriate to dismiss a film or filmmaker as pretentious. But the main reason is when I first saw the film I was grinning the entire time, and after re-watching it many times its become one of my favorite movies ever. Its sad for me to see a film I truly love saddled with such a vociferously negative reputation, especially when I suspect more people would like it if they just shifted how they approach it.

So let's play a little game, like a thought experiment: Leave aside any judgments you may already have about the film or its creators, and imagine for now that everything in the film is intentional and maybe, just maybe, even meaningful. If you still hate it, or just shrug, after you stop suspending your disbelief then that's fine and to each their own. Ready?

Ok, so by far the biggest criticism of the film is the behavior of the human characters. Petting a clearly hostile alien snake, running straight in the path of a giant space donut, not being scientifically accurate when flirting, the list goes on and on. But remember, we're temporarily imagining that every aspect of the film is there for a reason. When we do, we're able to see that the human crew-members' wrong behavior is not just random idiocy with no rhyme or reason behind it. Rather, **they're all making the exact same mistake!** Each character comes into the mission with specific, narrow assumptions of what they want and what they expect to find. The problem is they're taking their tiny, human, Earth-centric desires and expectations into an unfathomably huge universe that doesn't give a shit about the mostly harmless speck of existence that constitutes all of humanity. But humans don't think like that, and maybe they can't. We may judge the characters' actions as unrealistically foolish, but realistically to have a full perspective of our place in the cold, indifferent universe is unfathomable so on some level everything they do is understandable.

So when their totally wrong expectations for their mission fail spectacularly, none of the characters can handle it. Vickers (Theron) expects to find that the supposed maps to the stars are just ""scribblings of dirty savages"", so she is totally unprepared for the mess that results. Holloway (Marshall-Green) expects to find answers and talk to humanity's creators, but instead he finds ""just another tomb"" and so even though he's made the most important discovery in human history its still dwarfed by even more crushing disappointment. Fifield expects space rocks and an easy paycheck, but instead he is faced with ""gigantic dead bodies"" that send him into a fearful rage. Shaw (Rapace) expects to find her faith bolstered and made tangible, to find God and get answers, but instead she confronts a savage monster who offers not even one word of explanation. Finally, Weyland (Pearce) expects that because he's a big shot on Earth he can just walk up to the Space-Gods and demand eternal life. His foolish expectation is met by being bludgeoned to death by his creator (so to speak) with the head of his own creation. That scene (a deliberate anti-climax) is the punchline of the entire film- of the joke on humanity's hubris-  and what a punchline!

This is why Shaw is the only human character who survives; though she comes in with big expectations, she is the only one able and willing to adapt to what's actually going on instead of being blinded by the difference between her assumptions and reality. That's why, in the much maligned Space Donut scene with the rolling ship, she stumbles but then realizes she should roll out of the way while Vickers does not and is crushed. David also survives because he comes into the situation with few preconceptions, and throughout the film he's the only one investigating what's actually going on rather than what he wishes to find. He also has his own creators to try and understand, right there on the ship with him.

The same theme even applies to the other most maligned scene with the space snake; a space suit that could withstand storms of roiling glass shards would easily protect anyone from an Earth snake, but once again Earth assumptions don't apply here. Adapt or die (mostly die).

So all this to say: Prometheus is not a film about smart, capable scientists on a well-planned mission who just happen to be written as drooling morons. It's a film about flawed, immature humanity stumbling in the middle of something they don't understand but assume they do, on a farcical mission which really comes down to one senile old man's hubristic conviction that even gods should bow to his wishes. I think part of the problem was by the time it's fully revealed that the mission was always a doomed farce, that there was no way it could ever have gone right no matter who tried to pet which phallic space snake, much of the audience had already tuned out. Why? Well I'd argue that a lot of viewers (understandably) made the exact same mistake as the characters in the film: they went in with a lot of expectations and assumptions, from the Alien franchise or the marketing or about rules of how a good film must unfold, and didn't adapt to the film we actually got.

Now the other biggest criticism of the film is regarding ""plot-holes"", especially the anti-climactic ending where the mysteries of humanity's creation and of the Alien franchise fail to be definitively revealed. So how does that aspect fit if everything is intentional and purposeful? Well, the ending fits nicely into the same themes I've been going over. If we, humanity, can't think outside of our own infinitesimally small perspective how can we expect to learn and comprehend the secrets of the universe, of our entire existence? What if we learn those secrets and they're not satisfting, not quite what we had in mind? Consider the quote from Naked Lunch at the top of this post. Also, the absurd, pulpy, and even at times campy tone of the film fits very well with a look at the absurdity of human existence through a sci-fi lens, don't you think?

In a way, the film is a rebutall of sorts to the trippy optimism of 2001: A Space Oddysey; a version of that concept where humanity utterly fails to evolve instead. That's why instead of the birth of a ""Star Child"", a newborn god as the next step of evolution, this film ends with the birth of a grotesque abomination from the body of a dead god. Instead of the planned result of linear evolution laid out by impossibly smooth black monoliths, this perverse creature is the accidental result of a ridiculously convoluted series of events beginning with unpredictable black ooze. The final scene is saying not to mistake Shaw blasting off into space with music swelling as a happy ending, since the hopeful music immediately sours and we see what her mission has really given birth to. Also worth noting is that Shaw leaves this aborted, unwanted creature behind with no regard for its existence, much the same way final ""Engineer"" had no concern for her, much the same way David's creator never appreciated him (watch Fassbender's face fall ever so slightly from calm to utter hurt when his creator Weyland casually says he has no soul).

I could keep going forever about all the cool little details I noticed on subsequent viewings (I've barely mentioned David!) but I'll stop here for now.  So anyway you can stop suspending disbelief now, and go back to thinking that the movie is all just lazy writing and characters doing dumb stuff just to get to the next contrived action sequence, but are you still so sure about that? Nobody has to like the film, of course, but I hope that I've convinced at least a few people here to appreciate it more or give it another chance.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your responses and your own reassessments of the film.

Edit - I pasted in another long post where I examine **David's viewpoint** here:

**tl;dr The most criticized aspects of Prometheus are actually what the entire film is about. All the flawed characters are actually making the same all too human mistake, which the film is criticizing. It's quite similar to the mistake I'd say audiences made in dismissing the film so harshly. The anti-climax of an ending (along with the resulting ""plot-holes"") is also part of exploring that same main theme, which is humanity's inability to look past our own assumptions and expectations to understand our true place in the grand scheme of things.**

1352464004.0,108,self.TrueFilm,12wrvo,A Short Introduction to Ingmar Bergman's cinema,120,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12wrvo/a_short_introduction_to_ingmar_bergmans_cinema/,"Bergmand is my favorite director. Unfortunately, he has the reputation of being a very dry, complicated and hard to understand director. While this is true to some extent, this has been greatly exagerated, especially as people generally start by watching The Seventh Seal, which is a mistake as it is one of his hardest movie to understand, and I personnally believe its not even its best work, despite it being an amazing movie.
So here's my (short) take on how to start watching Bergman's movie, what to expect from them and my personnal favorites.
that being saiod, I'm far from an expert, I have only watched about ten of his films.

Bergman's cinema is incredibly varied. He directed more than sixty movies or television production, had an important theatratical carrier, all that over almost 60 years.
His easiest movies are probably his early works. They are light and optimistic, at least compared to his later movies. I advice to start by some of his romantic comedies, either Smiles of a Summer Night or my favorite A Lesson in Love. Not only are those movies funny, but they introduce some of Bergman's future reflexion.
After that, I'd advise to move on Wild Strawberries or Summer with Monika, two masterpieces that are in between, darker but not as dry as some of his later work. If you liked those, you are then ready to watch most of his movies, including those from his experimental period (Hour of the Wolf, Persona...).

What to expect from a Bergman movie ? 
First of all great cinematography. His collaboration with Sven Nykvist especially made some of the most beautifully shot movies I know, culminating with the experimental Persona, and Cries and Whispers.
Secondly of all, great actors and actresses. Liv Ulmann, Bibi Anderson, Harriet Anderson, Ingrid Thulin...
Thirdly a profound reflexion on a wide range of themes. Amond them : the hardships of life as a couple (A Lesson in Love, Scenes from a Married Life, Monika), the fear of death (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Cries and Whispers), the impossibility of true communication (Wild Strawberries, Persona, Cries and Whispers), the silence of God (Persona, Cries and Whispers, The Virgin Spring, The Seventh Seal...)...

My take on the movies I saw :

Very Good (about 8/10) : Smiles of Summer Night (imperfect but charming and funny), The Magician (really strange but wonderfully shot)

Excellent (9/10) : A Lesson in Love (a romantic comedy combined with a true reflexion on couples), The Seventh Seal (peowerful tale on Death), Wild Strawberries (wonderful reflexion on death, charming and sad at the same time) 

Masterpieces (10/10) : Scenes from a Married Life (only saw the ""short"" 3-hour version. incredible reflexion on the life of a couple), The Virgin Spring (beautiful and sad tale inspired by a Middle-Age song), Summer with Monika (love story between two young people. One of the most beautiful (and sad) love story ever told).

My two favorite movies ever (11/10) : Persona and Cries and Whispers. Both are extremely dark and deal with the same problems. They touch me very deeply because I feel I completely understand those problems. they are also visually superb. That being said, those are not easy movies by any means.

Well, I hope this will be useful to some people and convince one or two to try to watch some of the work of one of greatest filmakers ever. If some people have advice on the movies I haven't seen I'd be greatly interested !",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_12wrvo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12wrvo/a_short_introduction_to_ingmar_bergmans_cinema/,

Tarkovsky is a bit of a truefilm darling, -there was a director discussion on him about a month ago, and a few threads about this film exist already. On the other hand, for a while now we've been thinking about starting a 'wiki', where well-constructed posts on popular topics can be sort of archived for future reference, probably sorted by film/director. If we have some organised discourse on this film now that might give us enough material to start a 'Stalker' wiki page / community resource. This idea is still in it's infancy so we'll see how things work out, that's sort of a plan though. So bring your A-game to the discussion thread in two weeks.

1349964530.0,110,self.TrueFilm,11b589,"I've seen Akira (1988) probably over a dozen times, but for the first time I think I fully understand the film. I'd like you to read my analysis, which will hopefully promote discussion.",143,33,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11b589/ive_seen_akira_1988_probably_over_a_dozen_times/,"Alright, where to begin. I've never read the manga, which I understand is quite different, so this analysis is strictly based on the film. And I assume if you're reading this you've seen the movie, so I'll skip out on a lot of details.

Alot of people enjoy this movie, from a technical and artistic perspective, but I think few people really understand what it's about. I know it took me years to actually understand, so here's my analysis:

The film depicts neo-tokyo, a dystopian society built after the original tokyo was destroyed by many believed to be a nuclear bomb. In the span of just thirty years the government has managed to build a city far greater in size, prosperity, and power than the one that stood before. But, in spite of all the progress they've made, the people have taken it for granted, and grown selfish. The socio-economic gap has widened as the super wealthy at the top cling to their money, and those at the bottom are left to rot. Even the city officials are in a constant state of unrest, because each of them is strictly focused on their own self interest. Riots grow rampant in the streets as citizens are less and less trusted by authority. Basically, **the city itself has become a black hole**, and is beginning to collapse in on itself.

In the midst of this civil unrest is a group of troubled teens, Kaneda, Tetsuo, and their friends. They've all been orphaned, and grown up used to getting into trouble with authority. The only place they've discovered kinship is in their biker gang. Kaneda is Tetsuo's oldest friend. Kaneda has always gone out of his way to assist Tetsuo, not expecting anything in return, but because he sees protecting his friends as a selfless duty. Tetsuo on the other hand has always been on the receiving end. He's always been picked on, and seen as an underdog. He's grown jealous of his best friend, and longs for the day when he earns the respect he feels he deserves from his peers. In other words, as an orphan, who's always had a tough break, **Tetsuo has grown up feeling as if the world owes him something**, and he's determined to take it by one way or another. 

In an effort gain respect from his peers, Tetsuo ends up fighting a clown. Which of course ends in his untimely encounter with one of the psychic children, the espers. This is the catalyst that begins the course of the rest of the movie. Through this encounter Tetsuo awakens his psychic abilities, which subject him to governmental tests and observation. But it's almost immediately taken notice, that there's something very different about Tetsuo's ability. The scientist superimposes the psychic pattern of their previous most gifted subject, Akira, over that of Tetsuo's, and if you notice, Tetsuo's pattern seems to be the inverse. There's something one of the espers says that puts a lot of the movie into perspective, the girl says something along the lines of ""Big people like you shouldn't have these powers"". The espers feel threatened by Tetsuo's ability, and **the very thing they fear most about him is his selfishness**. You see, since Tetsuo is an ""adult"" by their standards, Tetsuo is already well set in his ways. Unlike a child, he is impure, and tainted by the world, so he lacks the capacity to use his powers for good, but only to fulfill his own self interest. Thus, **Tetsuo begins to become a walking human black hole**. The energy of his spirit flows strictly inward, rather than outward. 

As Tetsuo's powers grow stronger he becomes a threat to the city itself. He rampages with the sole intent of becoming more powerful. He believes the only way he can fulfill his ultimate desire is by finding Akira. In his search he leaves a path of destruction, he gets more powerful, and becomes more self absorbed. Meanwhile, the government, and his own best friend are out to put an end to his rampage.

Due to the civil unrest, many feel that a great change is imminent in the city. The religious sects perceive a ""second coming"" of Akira is overdue. So when Tetsuo arrives, many falsely believe him to be the second coming of Akira. **Akira is clearly the Christ figure** of the film. When Akira reached a transcended level of enlightenment, it manifested itself in the form of an outward explosion. While many see this as the destruction of the old city, the fact is, the prosperity which came about as a result was far greater than anything that had existed prior. Tetsuo seeks Akira , strictly for his own self gain, and in his search he finds nothing.

By the time Tetsuo arrives at the Olympic stadium, he has given up his search for Akira, concluding that he may or may not have ever even existed. The espers on the other hand, know that Tetsuo will bring about the return of Akira. At the stadium, Tetsuo finally begins to lose a grasp on his own ability, although unwilling to admit it. He begins to be afraid for the first time since getting his powers. He can't even bring himself to be close with the one thing he loves, Kaori, for fear that he might hurt her. When the colonel arrives and shoots Tetsuo, Tetsuo no longer has a grasp on his own ability. He soon loses all control, engulfing his best friend, and inadvertently smothering the one he loves to death. At this point, **Tetsuo realizes that he can't control this power on his own**, and he can no longer rely on his own selfish understanding. When Tetsuo finally cries out that he needs help, that he can't get through this alone, that's when Akira appears. Notice before Akira appears, **Tetsuo takes the form a baby**. He is helpless, he is afraid, he is relying that he'll be taken care of. There's a bible verse relevant to this imagery, Matthew 18:3, Jesus says, *""Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven""*

Akira engulfs Tetsuo, and Kaneda in pure light. In an effort to save Kaneda the espers, stating that ""none of this is his fault"", go in after him knowing they will not return. **Within this light lies Tetsuo's consciousness**. Kaneda watches Tetsuo's memories, and glimpses of Akira and the espers play out right before his eyes, before he is telepathically warped from the impending destruction. The esper assure him that Akira will take care of Tetsuo. In Akira's arrival, Tetsuo finally comes to terms with himself, and comes to understand and embrace all the components which make him who he is. Something Kei says when imprisoned with Kaneda puts the end of the movie in perspective. Under the influence of the espers she discusses evolution, the big bang, and the origins of life. She seems to suggest that all the knowledge in the universe has one ultimate beginning, and that all subsequent energy and life is a result of that ultimate consciousness. **Tetsuo, in finally coming to terms with himself, explodes, becoming a universe**. Thus the final line of the movie ""**I am Tetsuo**.""

*On a relevant side note, the bible refers to God as, ""The great I am"", also [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z1q7o/til_around_400_years_ago_a_barely_literate_german/) TIL is relevant in discussing the interplay between God, consciousness, and the origins of the universe. Anyway this movie is chock full of theological allegory and such.* 


*Sorry for the length, this is a complex movie, tell me your thoughts!
Thanks*

**edit: For the last time, I never meant to insinuate that Akira is a christian movie, that'd be ridiculous. But I simply drew those connections because I found them relevant to the meaning of the film. It's not so absurd to believe that separate religions can share common principles. In addition I do not feel I lost any of the deeper meaning by drawing those connections. I think rather than fussing over me drawing these comparisons, I think it's more beneficial and enlightening to focus on the fact that two religions can develop autonomously yet draw the same principles. Which would suggest that even across cultural boundaries, we aren't all that different from one another. The principles are universal, they stay the same.

1358174989.0,102,self.TrueFilm,16jwe2,Issues with Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty',139,37,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/16jwe2/issues_with_bigelows_zero_dark_thirty/,"I watched this film a couple of nights ago and have been mulling in over in my head for a couple of days now. Given the enormous critical and public response (re. acclaim) to ZD30, I was confused when I saw it. I found the narrative extraordinarily dry and vaguely aimless, especially given the narrative drive allowed by history. Furthermore, there was almost zero characteristic development, in terms of psychological depth, artistic license, individual or communal narrative arcs and/or clear motivation. 

What's more, I have found a few here, on other sub-reddits, and on other forums and in articles proclaiming the 'fair and balanced' nature of the narrative drive. It is said that both sides of the argument are analysed and interrogated within the film. I find this odd given that what we see in the film is an extremely unbalanced dialogue between two factions of one side of the dialectic. The controversy does not have to be hyperbolized, but it can be examined: interrogation through torture leads to the capture of Bin Laden (a fairly crucial plot point and historical representation that may turn out to be purposeful fallacy on behalf of those that advised the film's narrative). ""Characters"" in the film loosely and briefly swap statements, not debate, on the credibility of torture, but in the end of the day, the film purports an extremely Machiavellian thesis: the end seems to justify the means, as far as the narrative is concerned. There really is another side to the story of those people who are being tortured and the communities that they came from. The Iraq War was not the only military mis-step of the 2000s. An invasion on the scale of Afghanistan to chase a non-national terrorist shattered millions of lives and I really thought, considering 'The Hurt Locker', that Bigelow would seek to interrogate this as opposed to export the satiation of the largest blood-lust of the last half century.

The feigned ambiguity of the final shot is a completely tawdry affair that cheapens the already misleading narrative drive of this enterprise. Thinking on that, I thought of the actual camerawork and directing achievements of the film. I can honestly say that nothing really stunned me at all. It was no more exceptional than a particularly good episode of 'Homeland'. Additionally, the execution of the final, climactic scene seemed quite unsure of its style and stance. Aside from a particularly stylish allusion to 80s Michael Bay-esque military films, wherein Mark Strong enters a hanger, ZD30 fails to impress even on a technical level.

I really don't understand the Oscar hype behind the film, although between ZD30, Lincoln and Argo, it would seem that nationalistic hubris is the focal point of this year's big contenders. 

A friend of mine but it fairly bluntly in a conversation we were having about the film, and I feel that while harsh, there is some serious truth in there that needs to be examined, given the kind of hubris exported through depictions such as Sorkin's '5/1' episode of 'The Newsroom', which was as critically poor as it was distasteful...

&gt; (On ZD30) It's dull, ill-disciplined, morally fucked, lacking any narrative drive or storytelling skill whatsoever, and having spent nearly three hours telling you one side of a very complicated story makes you complicit in state-sponsored murder, before having the barefaced cheek to fake ambiguity in the last scene, when really you know everyone involved is celebrating the death of another human being.

I'm just confused as to why ZD30 is being received as well as it is, given that it falls short on several marks. But hey, it's just my opinion. I love this sub-reddit by the way; a refreshing break from the likes of r/movies!

If this goes over well, I will post a ton more essays that I have in my backlog.

I had to use specific terms that my prof laid out for me, so here's a guide to character proxemics if anyone is a bit confused by what I mean when I say public, social, intimate, etc: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxemics

In Drive, Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn paints a grimy landscape of dark, neo-noir textures, which explore the seedy underbelly of a modern dream Los Angeles, while simultaneously painting an 80’s electric sheen that exudes light, hope, and Romanticism. This precise juxtaposition is evident throughout every shot of the film. The main thematic binary of the film, which is bolstered by the constant concurrence of light and darkness, is that of hope versus destruction. It is not often that a filmmaker is able to compose every shot into a form that both immediately captures the binary of themes present and immediately enraptures the viewer into an almost hypnotic state.

All of this is most evident in the infamous elevator scene. Here, the main character, Driver, is at the end of his rope. His naive dream of having a simple life with Irene is at an end. His violent nature has caught up with him once again, and he knows that he must flee Los Angeles forever. But in his final, fleeting moments with Irene in that claustrophobic elevator, he allows hope to take over and kisses her, passionately, for the first and last time. Immediately following this kiss, the man in the elevator with them pulls a gun, intending to kill them both. Driver is too quick for this man, however, and proceeds to stomp his head into a bloody oblivion. Irene is shocked and appalled. The dream has died. Hope is ended. Driver, now covered in blood, simply stares into Irene’s eyes, almost pleading with her for another chance at the simple life. She stands in the ominous grey of the parking garage, never to see Driver again, as the elevator door permanently separates the couple.

Through Refn’s mastery of mise-en-scene, in twenty-eight shots, he expresses the characters’ emotions, which are running at an all time high; he expresses the maximum tension of the scene, which has been boiling throughout the entire film, gearing to explode at precisely the correct moment; and he expresses the greater thematic binary of hope versus destruction, all while maintaining the consistent mood, tone, and look of the film. Shots, angles, form, character proxemics, and lighting all play a major part in conglomerating this climactic scene.

The first shot in the sequence is an open, medium shot of the now open elevator door, a man inside says, “Sorry, wrong floor,” and already mystery and tension are established. The angle is straight on, not ramping up the nervousness yet, leaving the mood levelheaded. The shot is lit normally, with the light of the elevator pouring out of the door a little bit, but remaining even. Character proxemics begins at the social level, leaving a good distance between the characters.

The second shot moves to an open close up of Driver’s face, from a slight low angle, already giving Driver a sense of power, but also a sense of uneasiness. The light of the elevator emphasizes the faces of both Driver and Irene, as if the man’s suspicious words have manifested themselves as light. The characters remain at the social level of distance, but Irene exits the shot at the end, teasing us with the next action of the scene.

The third shot is a closed medium shot, allowing us to see the entire space of the scene, as Driver and Irene awkwardly enter the elevator with the mysterious man. As they enter the elevator, everyone suddenly moves to the personal level of character proxemics, ramping up the tension slightly. In addition, the strained movement of Driver’s arm to close the door breaks the man’s personal space, bringing the interaction to the level of intimate for a brief moment, again ramping up the tension a small amount. As the elevator door closes at the end of the shot, a light’s reflection makes the top half of the door extremely bright and the bottom half extremely dark, already subconsciously beginning the juxtaposition of light and darkness, hope and destruction. The elevator goes down, in the direction of the darkness.

The next shot is a low, open close up that establishes the perceived power of the man and the ominous nature of his presence. The high key lighting creates shadows along his face and body to emphasize the mood, while reflecting light onto Irene’s face, making her soft and innocent, again, an early foreshadowing of hope versus destruction.

The next shot mirrors the previous one, only now Driver is the subject. The same amount of power and the same dark, ominous feeling pervades Driver’s persona. We cannot see the entire elevator and the low angle maintains the tension.

The sixth shot is a close up, which moves slowly down to feature a gun in the man’s suit jacket. The high angle that the shot rests on feels as if Driver is peering into the man’s jacket. The lighting remains high key. Refn is building and maintaining tension.

The seventh shot is the same as the fifth, only this time Driver moves his head out of the key slightly and into the shadow. Irene remains softly lit. This tiny movement into darkness almost serves as a trigger for what is about to occur.
	
In the following shot, Refn releases some of the tension, while simultaneously ramping it up by raising the stakes. It is a closed, medium shot from a level angle. No one has yet lost his or her cool, although time seems to be running short for Driver’s window of opportunity. Slowly and deliberately, he reaches back and gently nudges Irene back into the wall, breaking the tension of first contact, moving from the personal to the intimate, just as the high key lighting intensifies further, shrouding the man in darkness and bathing Driver and Irene in hope.
	
The ninth shot is a closed close up from a slightly low angle. It employs closed form in that the world of the elevator seems to have ceased to exist. The strange man is not merely off-screen. Driver and Irene have left this dimension altogether. The hopeful high key lighting combined with the slight low angle, creates an almost mythical image, allowing us to be in the moment with the couple, but also remain in awe of their larger-than-life moment. And then Driver breaks the intimate plane and moves to what could be called the extreme intimate plane by kissing Irene passionately and painstakingly slowly. When the embrace ends and we move back to the intimate plane, Driver hovers next to Irene’s face, as if he may move back to that extreme intimate plane, but alas, the lights have already come back up, and the man exists once more. This was their only moment together. Hope is ended.
	
The next shot breaks the spell, releases all of the tension, reverses the pacing, and lets destruction off the leash. After an abrupt cut, a closed medium shot of the elevator greets us, but we only have a moment to take it in, as Driver grabs the man and slams him into the front wall of the elevator. The world exists again and we are there to witness all, the slightly low angle and normal lighting allowing the destruction to speak for itself. The abrupt cut served as a hard snap to the personal plane, while Driver’s abrupt action snaps straight back into the intimate plane. Only this time, destruction is intimate, not hope.
	
The eleventh shot is a close up of Driver’s intimate struggle with the man, as he slams him into the back wall. In this quick series of shots, the lighting remains even and the shots remain open, continuing to allow the destruction to speak for itself. 
	
The twelfth shot is a slightly low angled close up of Irene, who is backing away from the action. She is still lit in high key, soft light, but this time and every time we return to this type of shot, Driver is engulfing a large chunk of the frame in shadow. The pair remains as far apart as possible, while still restricted to the personal plane. A direct conflict between hope and destruction is occurring here.
	
The next shot is a medium shot, which moves form a level angle to a high angle as Driver slams the man into the floor. The move to a high angle serves to emphasize the impact of the blow and forces Irene to the outskirts of the frame, while featuring the intimate contact between Driver and the man.
	
The fourteenth shot is a repeat of the twelfth, but Irene makes a larger retreat, recoiling from Driver’s engulfing, jerking shadow as he begins to stomp brutally on the man’s head.
	
The fifteenth shot is a high angle close up of the man’s prone and bloodied body on the floor, under high key lighting, to emphasize the destruction. The high angle guarantees that the man has no more power, and the quick movement from the personal plane to the intimate with another stomp to the face from Driver’s boot sends the point home further.
	
The sixteenth shot takes the fourteenth and twelfth shots and ramps up all of the elements further still. Irene remains at a personal distance from Driver, pressing herself against the wall, as the intimate, incessant, squelching stomping continues off-screen, solidifying intimacy’s association with darkness and destruction.
	
In the next shot, we move to a level, medium shot with Irene and Driver’s back turned to us, his body jerking with every stomp. Hope shines down on the pair in the form of the high key elevator lighting, but destruction seems to be creeping up along the walls from the floor in the form of darkness.
	
The next shot changes the pattern with an open, level close up of Irene in profile, staring dead eyed at the horror unfolding in front of her. She remains in her soft, high key lighting, but a tiny, creeping shadow remains on the wall behind, jerking with every stomp. The open nature of the shot makes the character proxemics feel as if they are on the social plane, as the action takes place out of frame and Irene is so disconnected from reality that she does not feel present for it.
	
In the nineteenth shot, Driver’s rage, the source of Irene’s horror, is finally revealed through a super low, medium shot looking up at Driver’s shuddering, destructive body as he stomps down again and again on the man’s head. He is almost entirely shrouded in shadow, as destruction has completely taken over his entire being.
	
The twentieth shot briefly reveals to us the gruesome reality of destruction by featuring, for a split second only, the bloody pulp that was once the man’s head. This medium shot withholds no information and emphasizes the carnage with its high angle. The only reason that destruction is well lit here is for the ability to see the unshrouded horror as Driver brings his boot down once more on the grisly mess, moving us back into the extreme intimate plane for a brief and juxtaposed moment.
	
The twenty-first shot returns to the format of the sixteenth, but ramps up the elements even further still, maintaining the juxtaposition between the on-screen personal plane and off-screen intimate plane.
	
In the next shot, Driver’s rage slowly peters out, coming to an exhausted close. Mimicking the nineteenth shot, Driver retains all of the power and none of the emotion of the kiss, completely covered in darkness and destruction now, having spent all of his sexual frustration on violence. But as the stomping slows, Driver pops up a bit between movements allowing the light, and hope, to encroach.
	
The next shot is a level close up of Irene who backs out of the elevator the second she has the chance, never taking her eyes off of the carnage. As she does so, the personal plane moves to the social, and she moves into the grey darkness of the parking garage, giving into destruction and allowing the hope of the kiss to remain dead.
	
The next shot is a level medium shot of Driver’s back as he slowly turns into the light again to stare at Irene, as if pleading with her to give him another chance, though the shadow that shrouds his face tells her not to allow it. He stares to see just how far she has gone. It’s as if Refn is asking us whether Driver embodies hope or destruction or even both.
	
The twenty-fifth shot, the first full shot of the entire sequence, frames a completely spent Irene dead center in the middle of the grey, nebulous parking garage. The shot is statically level, as we are drained just as much as Irene by the events of the past two minutes. She remains in the light and hope of the elevator, while the darkness of the garage threatens to engulf her, but is shockingly clear that she has moved to the public plane, as far from Driver as possible.
	
The next shot is framed the same as the twenty-fourth, but this time Driver is even further split between light and darkness, hope and destruction. He is as equally spent as Irene, both at the end of their wits. His look seems to attempt an apology, while demonstrating the shock of the sudden public plane between them. The more time passes without the super low angle of Driver’s destruction, the more his power seems to diminish exponentially.
	
The penultimate shot of the sequence returns to Irene in full frame, staring back at Driver with dead eyes, not able to forgive. Slowly, the elevator door slides shut, removing Irene from Driver’s life forever. The plane of character proxemics moves from public to intimate, as Driver is left alone with himself and the bloodied corpse. The door no longer holds the reflection of the light; only the darkness that creeps up from the floor remains. Suddenly, the shot has moved from open to closed. Hope has truly died.
	
The final shot is a closed, calm, level close up of Driver’s scorpion jacket. The golden scorpion is almost completely shrouded in darkness, leaving only a corner of the white jacket in the light. Destruction has prevailed, while hope hangs on by a thread. This shot evokes the fable of the scorpion and the frog, relayed at the beginning of the film, as if to smugly state, “It’s in my nature.”

The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Soufri%C3%A8re_\(film\)) for it describes La Soufriere as:

&gt; ""...a 1977 West German documentary film in which German director Werner Herzog visits an island on which a volcano is predicted to erupt. [...] Herzog explores the deserted streets of the towns on the island. [...] Herzog converses in French with three different men he finds remaining on the island: one says he is waiting for death, and demonstrates his posture for doing so; another says he has stayed to look after the animals.""



This short documentary is just soo...literary, textured from the pure fibres of its context, story and craft. I think Herzog gives, albeit a little cliche, the best, simplistic, and palpable metaphors for death. I think La Soufriere is the best film of 1997 - atop of Annie Hall, Star Wars, Eraserhead, etc. This is my first Herzog documentary predating Grizzly Man - **I would love recommendations for more Herzog docs, or anything similar to this film**

I'm not sure I've ever understood the general public's contention for this film. With just a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, I don't think The Fountain gets the love it deserves.

Now of course I understand that The Fountain has been said to ""fall flat"" when compared to Aronofsky's other films, and I see why. I just don't understand why it's revered **so negatively** otherwise. In fact, the more times I watch it the more I'm completely enamored by the parallel story lines, Aronofsky's incredible cast (especially Rachel Weisz), the trademark beautiful cinematography, and the overwhelmingly powerful &amp; relatable themes that appear.

I'll admit a bit of it is romanticized, over-dramatic and pretentious, but I think this film's scope allows for all of those things; Aronofsky was trying to get at something pretty unique and (I think) these ""negative"" aspects are unavoidable when you're trying to achieve something like this.

The narrative functions like more of a fever dream than an actual story. The violence hits levels that make many people, including myself, squirm. And the film's emphasis on visuals over traditional dialogue driven scenes could be seen as tiresome.  I personally quite liked the movie. There isn't anything like it right now. Its a gorgeous, gorgeous picture, with images that'll stay burned into my head for a few days. The script could have been scribbled out on a napkin before shooting began, but I expected something like this, especially given Refn's other recent films, like Bronson or Valhalla Rising. After the last two Pusher films, Refn seems to have pushed further into the realm of ""pure cinema"", highly visual movies that follow their main characters on their rampages. Drive was a slight departure on some respects, using the Hollywood action film as a vehicle for something else, which explains its popularity. 

OGF will entertain you if you go in expecting Valhalla Rising, but possibly disappoint you if Drive is on your mind. I still recommend it. It's the kind of crime drama that would hang in a museum.

1367589121.0,101,self.TrueFilm,1dm9wh,Re-evaluating Martin Scorsese's Casino,129,28,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dm9wh/reevaluating_martin_scorseses_casino/,"Out of all the films I used to feel ambivalent about but which I have since positively reappraised due to my wife’s having watched them over and over in front of me, none has risen more dramatically in my estimation than Martin Scorsese’s Casino. I first saw it during its original theatrical run in 1995 when I was 20-years-old. I left the theater feeling disappointed — mainly because it failed to live up to Goodfellas, the prior Scorsese movie that it seemed to most closely resemble. They both, after all, featured Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci as mobsters, there were shocking bursts of violence, epic tracking shots, copious amounts of voice-over narration, healthy doses of black humor, eclectic soundtracks on which the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter” prominently featured, and so on. Comparisons were always going to be unavoidable. But what really rankled was the way Casino seemed to me like a gaudier, more Hollywood-ized version of Goodfellas — as if Scorsese and co-writer Nicholas Pileggi had taken some of the elements of their successful earlier film and re-shuffled them with the added commercial elements of a Las Vegas setting, a bigger budget and the star power of Sharon Stone (then one of Hollywood’s hottest commodities). While I did admire Casino for its impressive and undeniable cinematic value (it was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Scorsese and his now-longtime cinematographer Robert Richardson), I largely felt indifferent about it on the whole.

Almost 20 years later, after revisiting the film many times on television and Blu-ray, all of my previous complaints have been swept aside and I now consider it one of Scorsese’s finest works. When I first saw it, one thing I didn’t quite understand was what Scorsese was up to in regards to the Las Vegas setting. I remember feeling back then that the quintessential “New York filmmaker” seemed out of his element “out west” and that, in spite of a few faux-documentary interludes, he didn’t seem to have much of an affinity for the gambling scene. (This is born out by the fact that, to this day, serious gamblers appear to prefer the 1998 poker film Rounders as their Vegas movie of choice.) I realize now that it was wrong of me to have expected the same kind of lovingly detailed views of Las Vegas as those of New York City that can be seen in Scorsese’s other films. For Scorsese, Las Vegas is primarily a metaphor: it’s a “paradise lost” to his gangster characters from “back East.” The notion that Sam “Ace” Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (the characters played by DeNiro and Pesci, respectively) had it all and then blew it is one of the ways in which the film poignantly shows the influence of one of Scorsese’s favorite movies, Raoul Walsh’s Prohibition-set masterpiece The Roaring Twenties. Both Scorsese and Walsh seem to be saying that no matter how violent, immoral and unconscionable the behavior of their characters might be, they were inextricably part of a colorful and exciting era that has since been replaced by something duller and more sanitized. The tone of each movie is therefore elegiac and bittersweet.

As far as the “gaudiness” is concerned, I now believe this is actually Casino‘s strongest stylistic virtue: there is much more voice-over than in Goodfellas, the music is nearly wall-to-wall and the song choices are wackier (e.g., Devo’s cover of “Satisfaction”!), while the clothes, the decor, and the use of color are all deliriously over-the-top. In 1995, what I somehow missed was the way Scorsese and his production team’s deliberately outrageous sense of style was taking its cues directly from the Vegas setting, and I was more apt to criticize the film then for what it wasn’t (i.e., another Goodfellas) rather than what it was (the tragedy of a man who was given the keys to the kingdom of a modern-day Babylon and then willingly let them slip through his fingers). In contrast to the eternal coolness of the 1950s and 1960s New York-milieu of Goodfellas — with its great cars, clothes and music — nearly everything about Casino, in terms of content and form, is rooted in the tackiness of the Las Vegas fashions of the 1970s and early 1980s. And what I didn’t see at the time but what has since become abundantly clear in hindsight is how much this tackiness also provides the film with some of its most inspired and humorous touches. This is nowhere more evident than in the amazing poster recently created by a Boston-based artist that depicts every suit worn by Ace Rothstein in the movie.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1dm9wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dm9wh/reevaluating_martin_scorseses_casino/,
1372607164.0,96,self.TrueFilm,1hd9wr,[Meta] New rules and general discussion of how to better r/TrueFilm.,114,18,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hd9wr/meta_new_rules_and_general_discussion_of_how_to/,"Hey everyone, mods here, we've been thinking of introducing some new rules and making some old ones more specific and we want your thoughts. If you have any issues with these rules or have ideas for anything that you think could better the subreddit then please comment below. 

Having a subreddit with a constraining number of rules might seem like we're being too heavy handed but we just want to do our best to make this the best place for intelligent film discussion. This means being pretty strict on anything that can bring a film discussion board down. You guys are pretty unanimously great and you're here because this seemed like the place for you so we want to do everything we can to make it as good as possible.

New rules:

**Posts/Comments that equate opinion to fact will be deleted**- This may seem a bit strict but we feel that it's for the best. Rarely do comments or posts like this generate intelligent discussion. When people frame their opinion as a fact it no longer becomes a discussion and is more like one party trying to prove the other one right or wrong. When people are forced to actually explain their opinion rather than just saying something sucks we can get a clearer picture of what they like and didn't like allowing for more in-depth discussion.

**We do not allow posts that are solely links**- This is kind of an unwritten rule as we only allow self posts but I think it's best to be clear so that people don't get annoyed when their stuff gets deleted. There is a place for posting links if the person posting it also has more content to their post other than the link. Even if it's just their general thoughts on it saying why they want to talk about it or a few discussion points. Posts with little content don't generate any discussion beyond ""That's cool"" so hopefully this might subvert that.

Rule change:

**Make sure a topic or film discussion hasn't recently been posted**- This is just a slight change from before as it only said ""topic"" so that we don't have multiple threads about the same film on the front page. We'd like to be specific so that there's never a feeling that the mods are just imposing their personal biases, if anything is deleted it will only be because it violates rules.

Rule Clarification: 

This is just a minor thing but **All posts about specific films are spoiler-filled**. I've just noticed more and more people specifying if things are spoilery or not. When it comes to general threads it's best to denote spoilers but when it comes to discussions on specific films people who haven't seen the film can't exactly offer much other than speculation so we'd like to detract from that. 

We were also thinking of introducing a type of ""consistent contributor"" tag for some users of the sub. People didn't seem crazy about the idea at first but I think that's because it was framed as almost a prize for being good. I think it could not only be denotation of a quality user but it also encourages those users to contribute more. If they know there's a chance more people might pay attention to their post then they might be more inclined to share their knowledge. I don't think it would be a hugely exclusive thing though either. What do you think?

What would you think about hiding scores for a while on posts? Just so that people respond to the content of a comment more than its visible popularity. Just a thought. 

Something else I was thinking was whether or not we should have one big general discussion when new releases come out. As you may have noticed with the slew of Man of Steel posts, people want to discuss new films a lot. But maybe if there was one big thread a week or so into a films release that could lower that traffic a little and at least detract from multiple threads about the same film, which won't be allowed anymore anyway. 

Now we put it to you guys, what do you think? Are we mods drunk with power (and fine wines) or do you agree that these could make the subreddit better? If you have any ideas for rules, regular threads or anything that could make this a better place for intelligent film discussion then please post below. Thanks everyone. 

EDIT: Just in case you're wondering, the rules will only be added after this thread is basically done as long as people agree that they're for the best.

Director/Writer - Harmony Korine

James Franco - Alien

Vanessa Hudgens - Candy

Selena Gomez - Faith

Ashley Benson - Brit

Rachel Korine - Cotty

Gucci Mane – Archie

Just to be clear none of this is fact this is just how I saw the movie. Also there’s a TL:DR at the bottom. 

Sorry for grammar, if something doesn't make sense and all that good stuff, I wrote this in a hurry during a lunch break.

______________

I had few expectations coming into this film, I thought it was supposed to be a fun film and the only reason I really wanted to see it was to see James Franco portray a character that, as a friend reminded me, in manner and speech resembled the iconic character Drexl portrayed by Gary Oldman in Tony Scott’s True Romance. I was wrong this is a smart exploitation film that is an assault on pop culture. The brilliance of the film comes in while you’re watching the film and trying to define it; it's one part exploitation, one part over-intellectualization of exploitation film. It's like Korine made a soft-core porn with James Franco, barely-legal-Disney-famous-teens, and called it art. But I think it's safe to say it's more of the former. Although like any exploitation film a lot of common viewers will probably see this as perpetuating stereotypes.

**Review**

If you want a review check out Roger Ebert's he pretty much nails it.

**Further Review/Analysis**

*Pros* - Stylish and surreal (if you like that), original structure and character flow, memorable scenes. The best part of the movie is its underlying themes. Spring Breakers contains symbolic interpretations of the exploitation of sex, violence and power within pop-culture, its relationship to the mentality of get rich and famous or die trying, and the warped image of the American dream to today’s misguided youths.

There were amazing performances, especially from Franco, but also from, Hudgens and Gomez. Their other castmates Benson and Korine were also very good but were not as standout as those three.

*Cons* - A highly stylish film doesn’t cause a movie to fail look no further than Malick (Tree of life, Badlands) or Refn (Drive, Valhalla Rising) who have had very strong commercial and critical success with similar structure. However, Spring Breakers hand held style of camera flourishes seemed to fall short in some of the high suspense moments specifically the end. The director succeeded in every way except for the filming of violence. The shootout at the end couldn’t have looked more unrealistic and I really lost my suspension of disbelief in that moment. People seemed to be no further than 10 feet from each other shooting rapidly and missing uncontrollably.

Additionally the repetition of the films motifs felt a little redundant, the regular cutbacks to spring breaks, general hedonism and scenes of power/violence were frequent and at moments felt like fillers. Use that editing technique a few times and you get your point across, the overuse left me annoyed as well as all of my friends.



**Themes, symbolism and all that good stuff.**

*The Four Girls in Alien's World*

Sounds like the title to a fairy tale.

**Alien** - Fame, wealth, and glamour - To the four girls; excluding Faith, Alien represents all the seductions of the American Dream with no work involved, he's the devil's promise. He can bring to them everything they wanted without all the trouble. He is the illusion of the American Dream, easily accepted by misguided youth and perpetuated by a lot of pop culture. Because these seductions are ""alien"" to them, they perceive his gangster life style as being the American dream and they fall for the trap.



**Faith**- is the main character of the first half of the movie she wants to meet up with her childhood friends from school and go on spring break with them. She does this as she is curious about “party life” and bored with her normal life Faith decides to go with them to search this lifestyle. This is up until they meet Alien, Faith decides that the sins they’re engaging in are wrong and she wants to get away from this lifestyle that just weeks ago she was so curious about and thought so glamorous of. I got the feeling that these kids were fairly misguided youths or rather more unsupervised than most; the director seems to suggest that religion can often keep you on a good path without too much commentary on religion itself.  This was alluded to briefly in the early parts of the movie during the bible prayers.  The blond tipped bible pastor says, 

“1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV – But when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. How awesome is that?”  

You see Alien try to seduce Faith when he takes her into the side room and tells her he won’t hurt her and he just wants to have fun. Faith decides she doesn’t like Alien who seeks to pervert her to his illusions of fame, riches and fun over the ideals of home, her family and religion. This is like the devils offering, she sees through this asks her roommates to come home with her because she knows it won’t turn out well. They don’t as they feel they’ve found a perfect place, noted by the monologues to their parents.

**Candy and Brit** – Best represent the subject of the movie, the use of sex and violence for power and how that relates to pop culture. The power of gender roles and role reversal, as well as, the perversion of the American dream by pop culture.  Pop culture glorifies people one minute and trashes on them the next. If you look at it as a whole it’s pretty self-destructive if you play into its hand. 

Alien mistakes these two for soft individuals but as we saw earlier on in the film they’re fairly insane and robbed a bunch of people. They get off on power. Which is eventually what they want from Alien to submit to them and this is why he performs fellatio on their guns, a pretty hilarious but intense scene as they seem pretty serious about killing him.  

**Cotty** - Is similar to Faith however she clearly takes her own path that leads to equally dangerous activities, she ends up getting shot and decides to go back home and change that she has become. Essentially following the same path as Faith, but took a longer route and one that didn’t involve religion. She was also arguably the most fallen girl up until the end as she was the most sexually promiscuous throughout the film and was involved in all other endeavors equally as much as any other girl.

**Gucci Mane** – Other than being in the movie to bring conflict, if he was purposefully written to represent something it’s likely he represents the real threat of this gangster-glamour lifestyle that Alien and the three girls have created for themselves.

The artistic reasoning for Alien dying and the girls all living is that they are representative of pop-culture whereas one can implode themselves with illusions of grandeur Alien’s lifestyle is one that has much more real and final consequences. This separation is made during the scene where the 3 bikini clad girls are wearing pink ski masks holding assault weapons like stripper poles and singing and dancing with Alien to Britney Spears (the greatest pop culture/sex icon of the recent generations).


**TL:DR** The movie punches pop-culture that exploits negative lifestyles, such as TV shows that reward negative or self-destructive behavior.  The movie isn’t a masterpiece, however it does hit really strongly in many areas, fall in a few other areas, but overall Spring Breakers is well worth the viewing for movie aficionados because of its artistic accomplishments, overall message and how the message is implemented. Spring Breakers makes a great addition to the genre of exploitation films while satirizing them.

1364075394.0,97,self.TrueFilm,1avpro,Director Discussion: Andrei Tarkovsky,117,20,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1avpro/director_discussion_andrei_tarkovsky/,"After the last Director Discussion I put together here [on Akira Kurosawa](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18015y/director_discussion_akira_kurosawa/), I was pleased with how much the community got behind discussing one of the great filmmakers so I thought it would be a good idea to write up another one for Andrei Tarkovsky, the Russian auteur whose filmography I have just finished watching over the past month.

It seems like whenever anybody talks or writes about Tarkovsky they feel the need to put a disclaimer at the start advising that his films definitely aren't for everyone. This is partly because he tackles the bigger issues such as faith, identity, the soul of man, the flaws in human beings, why we dream, why we die and why we create. Like much Russian cinema I have seen, his films move at a very deliberate, languid pace and seem to take added attention and effort from the viewer in order to be understood fully, if at all. They contain feverish, phantasmagoric sequences that bridge the gap between dream and reality, purposefully surreal and confusing in order to drag the viewer into a different mode of thought. His films embody almost the antithesis to mainstream cinema and whilst this by no means makes them better, it does make them significantly different from anything else I have ever seen before.

Firstly, Tarkovsky is an intensely visual and visceral filmmaker. He does not tell traditional stories and many of his characters rarely follow an arc but rather exist within a frame that Tarkovsky has constructed for us. The titular character in **Andrei Rublev** for instance disappears for large portions of the films running time as the director seems to get sidetracked with sweeping visuals and complex philosophical musings. Because of this, Tarkovsky can often seem intimidating and, yes, pretentious as a director and I think this is a fair and natural assumption on the surface. If you want to watch a film just once and understand it, these films will irritate you. However, if you are willing to put in some time analysing or reading up on Tarkovsky's style and intent when he was making these films that I think they become a lot richer and worth your time. 

I think Jonathan Rosenbaum said it better than I can:

""The kind of cinema more interested in posing questions than in answering them — the cinema of Stroheim, Preminger, Rossellini, Cassavetes, Rivette, and Kieslowski, among others — is always bound to encounter resistance from critics and others who go to movies in search of certainties, and who often settle for half-truths or outright lies as a consequence. To interrogate the world is to inaugurate a search that continues after the movie’s over, implying a lack of closure that most commercial movies shun like the plague.""


I don't think that Tarkovsky makes it easy for his audience with his films existing in a world of their own much of the time and he has admitted before to making the beginnings of his films purposefully slow ""so that those who'd walked into the wrong cinema would leave before the film got going"". I believe he said this with a hint of irony however as although something like **Solaris** (advertised as a science fiction film) meanders along for the first half an hour seemingly without purpose, he does manage to soften us up as an audience and get us into dazed and confused state that remains throughout the rest of the running time.
At many instances, particularly in his most dream-like film **Mirror**, I found myself having to pay great attention to each scene just to try and figure out what plane of reality I was watching. Tarkovsky often splits his films into separate realms of consciousness, that of a characters reality and that of a characters dreams and memories, giving a whole new perspective to the film, often a disjointed and surreal one, forcing us to zone in on subtleties such as colour pallets or camera angles just to gain a firm grip on the narrative. It certainly adds to the re-watchability of his work.
What makes him stand out from other dream-like filmmakers such as Lynch, Kubrick or Malick is that he doesn't simply show us someone going to sleep and then shift the scene to a monochrome pallet. He does things slowly and methodically, lulling us into a false sense of security and before we know it we are slipping away from reality just like the characters. This is most clear in **Nostalgia** where the main character methodically turns all the lights off in his room, first transforming the aesthetic naturally before laying his head down onto the bed. Without cutting, his childhood dog walks into the room and sits beside him and we watch him begin to stroke it. There is no jolt, no obvious distinction but rather a slow descent into another state of mind. It's most beautiful when it is at it's most simple, however, in **Ivan's Childhood** with the camera sweeping away from a sleeping Ivan and looking up to the entrance of a well where Ivan is now standing with his mother. All in one shot. For me, this typifies the director.

Tarkovsky's use of symbolism and striking images is more prevalent and richer than most other directors I am familiar with even when it can even be a little overbearing at times. He never directly tells the audience what he wants to get across but instead allows us to pick and choose what interests us the most. Regular images that crop up in every single one of his films are the elements (mainly fire and shallow water but often wind and earth too), damp, decaying urban buildings, dogs, running horses and reflections. Look to **Stalker** especially for almost every single one of these at some point. I won't analyse each and every one here but will throw it over to you guys to discuss and interpret them as you will. I'd sure like to hear if other peoples opinion's on Tarkovsky's imagery match up with my own. There are, after all, dozens of ridiculously amazing shots in each and every one of his films.

One problem I personally have with Tarkovsky is his unpredictability with characters. Sometimes they exist as fully formed people full of depth, hidden emotions, flaws and intrigues. Sometimes they are empty, hollow personas used to embody a philosophy or direct the view towards a certain idea. Tarkovsky seems so intent on getting an atmosphere or mood across to the audience that he loses sight of his characters, whether they are abstract or not, and they become mere pawns to showcase ideas. This may work for some but it occasionally leaves me feeling as though I am grasping for meaning rather than letting it come to me naturally. Ivan, Andrei Rublev and The Stalker all exist as fully formed characters whilst others, especially in **Solaris** seem to be there as a mouthpiece for various musings on life and identity.

I would compare him to Kubrick over any other director (maybe Malick would come a close second with his phantasmagoric images) but is he even colder and more thorough than Kubrick? They certainly share a lot of visual similarities with long, drawn out takes and symbolism that seems like it should be profound but ultimately leaves you feeling empty and stupid upon first viewing. They both require a lot of attention and thought in order to glimpse a brief miracle of understanding in their films but I feel that Tarkovsky's work comes across as far more personal and emotional than Kubrick's, if a little less rational. Kubrick does seem intent on making an obvious point in most of his movies (2001 aside) and works hard to give us characters that matter whereas Tarkovsky relies much more on his audience to do the work and would rather sit back and allow us to soak in the atmosphere than surprise us with plot divergence or sudden bursts of violence a la Kubrick.

Does the viewer need to know the history of Tarkovsky's Russia in order to understand his films? I know barely anything about Russia aside from it's history of social and cultural oppression and it's tendency to be unconditionally loved by it's people more than any other country. So many of Tarkovsky's films have been conditioned retroactively as allegories for different issues in Russia but the enjoyment I found in the films had very very little to do with this. If anyone has any comments on the allegories presented in Tarkovsky's films, I'd be interested, if slightly baffled by how these dense films could take on yet another layer of analysis.


Overall, throughout all the confusion, doubt and head-scratching I have endured, Tarkovsky has given me a fresh perspective on cinema, something I haven't encountered since I first watched **81/2** or **Three Colours: Blue**. Like I mentioned before, his films are the complete antithesis to mainstream filmmaking, requiring patience, analysis (not always a positive thing) and laden with a depth that cannot be explored upon first viewing. Although I have watched through his entire filmography for the first time (with the exception of **Andrei Rublev** which I enjoyed so much more on second viewing) I still feel I have barely scratched the surface with this enigmatic filmmaker and although I won't confess like some to have been completely engaged and amazed with all of his work, I do find myself feeling excited and profoundly interested in revisiting these films in the future with a clearer understanding of the enigmatic and sometimes inspiring Russian director.

I'll leave you with a particularly favourite quote of mine regarding Tarkovsky's **Nostalgia** but one that I think applies to almost all of his work.

""…something akin to the essence of what man is made of: a tangled knot of memories, fears, fantasies, nightmares, paradoxical impulses and a yearning for something that's simultaneously beyond our reach and yet intrinsic to every one of of us."" - Nick Schager, Slant Magazine.

In this scene Chigurh has a strange conversation with a gas station clerk basically for the clerk's life. *I know the toss is for his life. That's not what I'm confused about.* Some of the questions and answers that Chigurh gives seem...bizarre. When the clerk tells Chigurh what time he'll go to bed, Chigurh asks if he should come back then. Wtf? Is this just to show how crazy Chigurh is, or do his inquiries make sense in some weird way? Following some rule? What's he trying to say? What are the Cohen brothers trying to say? I cross posted this from /r/movies because their answers sucked (save for directing me here). Thanks a ton!

*GAS STATION/GROCERY SHEFFIELD*

*At an isolated dusty crossroad. It is twilight. The Ford sedan that Chigurh stopped is parked alongside the pump.*

*INSIDE*

Chigurh stands at the counter across from the elderly proprietor. He holds up a bag of cashews.

**CHIGURH**
How much?

**PROPRIETOR**
Sixty-nine cent.

**CHIGURH**
This. And the gas.

**PROPRIETOR**
Y’all getting any rain up your way?

**CHIGURH**
What way would that be?

**PROPRIETOR**
I seen you was from Dallas.

*Chigurh tears open the bag of cashews and pours a few into his hand.*

**CHIGURH**
What business is it of yours where I’m from, friendo?

**PROPRIETOR**

…Will there be somethin else?

**CHIGURH**
I don’t know. Will there?

The proprietor turns and coughs. Chigurh stares.

**PROPRIETOR**

**CHIGURH**
With what?

**PROPRIETOR**
With anything?

**CHIGURH**
Is that what you’re asking me? Is there something wrong
with anything?

to bed.

**PROPRIETOR**
Well…

*A pause.*

…I’d say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-
thirty.

**CHIGURH**
I could come back then.

**PROPRIETOR**
Why would you be comin back? We’ll be closed.

**CHIGURH**
You said that.

**PROPRIETOR**
Well…I need to close now–

Yes I do.

there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.

**CHIGURH**
You married into it.

**CHIGURH**
I don’t have some way to put it. That’s the way it is.

slowly unkink. The proprietor’s eyes have tracked the packet. Chigurh’s eyes stay on
the proprietor.*

Sir?

**CHIGURH**
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.

**PROPRIETOR**
I don’t know. I couldn’t say.

keeps it covered.*

**CHIGURH**
Call it.

**PROPRIETOR**
Call it?

**CHIGURH**
Yes.

**PROPRIETOR**
For what?

**CHIGURH**
Just call it.

**PROPRIETOR**
Well–we need to know what it is we’re callin for here.

**CHIGURH**
You need to call it. I can’t call it for you. It wouldn’t be
fair. It wouldn’t even be right.

**PROPRIETOR**
I didn’t put nothin up.

**CHIGURH**
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You
just didn’t know it. You know what date is on this coin?

**PROPRIETOR**
No.

**CHIGURH**
Nineteen fifty-eight. It’s been traveling twenty-two years
to get here. And now it’s here. And it’s either heads or
tails, and you have to say. Call it.

*A long beat.*

**CHIGURH**
Everything.

**PROPRIETOR**
How’s that?

**CHIGURH**
You stand to win everything. Call it.

**PROPRIETOR**
All right. Heads then.

*Chigurh takes his hand away from the coin and turns his arm to look at it.*

**CHIGURH**
Well done.

*He hands it across.*

…Don’t put it in your pocket.

**PROPRIETOR**
Sir?

**CHIGURH**
Don’t put it in your pocket. It’s your lucky quarter.

**PROPRIETOR**
…Where you want me to put it?

**CHIGURH**
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it’ll get mixed in with the
others and become just a coin. Which it is.

It looked like a terrible, generic action movie, but I figured, hey, can't be that bad.

Now, I don't care if any of it is bad in terms of: plot, choreography, dialogue, acting, etc. I considered it altogether mediocre across those fronts, but I'm not here to argue for it or otherwise. 

What really frustrated me - and the point of this post - is how it failed to handle its core conceit: an emotionless society.

I was interested in what it would look like to see people with their emotions removed. How can you act, and react, to any given situation when emotions are totally removed from the context? How are human interactions to appear without feeling behind them?

But the whole damn thing is full of feelings! From the very beginning, all the people betray obvious emotional responses. The pathetic Hitleresque rally-speech in the beginning - is that how an emotionless speech would look? There was emotion in the speaker's voice, and emotion in the audience's response. Real-life Hitler rallies were HUGELY emotional affairs (the damn man orgasmed, for god's sake) so I don't understand why they drew inspiration from *that.* Why would an emotionless audience stand up and cheer? What are they cheering for? How are they caught up in nationalism like that?

The characters can be seen hesitating with fear, or doubt, or uncertainty - all of which are feelings! Pensively staring out a window? Maybe that's not necessarily an expression of emotion - but it seems like one to me. 

Most of the elements of fear/doubt/hope/desire/rage/etc are through Bale's character, so I guess there's an argument to be made that that's the point, and that even a Cleric can't contain his emotions. But in the fight scenes, peripheral characters (police captains, etc) respond with obvious fear/surprise/etc. Every human in the movie seems to betray some sort of expression, and expressions are tied to feelings. 

It just seemed lousy. The main conceit is that nobody in this society has feelings - and not just that they suppress feelings, but they they physically *can't* have them, because of the drugs they take. But time and time again people reach to situations not as perfect robots, but guided by typical human reactions, reactions based on emotional responses. It was disappointing!

Edit: There are good points being made suggesting that there was never really any intention for the characters to actually be emotionless, that it was a false conceit from the beginning. That is the sort of discussion I was looking for, and it's definitely helped define the movie better for me.

Yet the impression it made on me seems to be a little bit different than what most people got out of it.  To me it looked glaringly like a morality tale in which Daniel Plainview starts off as the hero and then fails to take up his journey (in [Joseph Campbell's sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth#The_17_Stages_of_the_Monomyth)).

Key points:

 * Plainview is on a hero's journey, alone in unknown and dangerous territory at the start.  He braves the dangers and comes back a rich man.
 * We see warnings of fresh danger on a new journey when the worker is killed in the cellar of the new derrick.
 * The orphaned H.W. has some traits to suggest he's the hero for the next journey, not Daniel: H.W. was born in mysterious circumstances and not raised by his real parents.
 * Not recognizing that he's now no longer the hero of the story but has aged into becoming the mythical father, Daniel leaves H.W. alone in a time of critical pain.  This begins the separation between the paths of H.W. (the hero of the next story, symbolically representing the potential the future holds) and Daniel (a former hero who, because he won't recognize his new responsibility to the future, becomes the tyrannical past).  
 * Daniel meets his shadow brother Henry.  While Daniel used to be a hero and now seems corrupted, Henry used to be a villain but has left it behind.  Daniel can't accept that mirror reflection of himself (""Who *are* you?""), so he kills him and buries him.  Some of the shots of the trees in the background, the fire, and Daniel digging suggested to me that he's inside of a rib cage with a burning heart, digging a hole to bury the pain in.
 * Bandy appears as a threshold gatekeeper willing to send Daniel on a new quest if Daniel will be willing to take it up.  However, while the threshold gatekeeper in most stories appears at least sort of as a good guy, because the audience still relates to Daniel, we see Bandy the way we see dilemmas in our own lives that we don't want to face, as something unpleasant that's only dealt with because it has to be.  Daniel accepts the new hero's journey but only under duress.
 * In Daniel's baptism, he has a real chance to redeem himself.  He's even walked right through saying the words that it would take to set himself back on the path to shepherding the future hero H.W. on his journey, but because Daniel never feels it as he says it, the new journey fails.  Eli in this scene is so odious because he stands in for our conscience in the times when we really don't want to listen to it: he's an overly pious whining teenager standing between us and what we want.

... I could probably write way more but for brevity I'll skip to the final scene ...

 * Eli, still acting as the obnoxious voice of Daniel's conscience, comes to deliver the news that the threshold gatekeeper Bandy has died, symbolically closing the window of opportunity for Daniel to redeem himself.  There's a new window opening for Daniel to support the church's new ventures, but this time the opportunity for Daniel to redeem himself comes off as even more hypocritical and self-righteously pious.  Rather than Eli finally winning over Daniel when Daniel most needs it, Daniel is so far gone that he tries to corrupt his Eli, eventually succeeding and then killing him, dooming Daniel to madness.

Seems to me to have a lot of structural elements and symbols in common with tragic myths like Oedipus.

In this interview, he offers a rare glimpse of life on the set with Kubrick-- not as a legend but a working director.",110,16,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dpqq3/james_b_harris_produced_three_films_with_his/,"You'll never know complete satisfaction until you’ve tried your hand at directing,” Stanley Kubrick told his close friend and producer James B. Harris one day, late in 1962. The pair had been creative partners for nearly a decade--working together on a string of critically successful pictures: The Killing (1956), Paths of Glory (1957) and Lolita (1962).

After Lolita gave them both a welcome financial independence, they collaborated on a nuclear war-themed thriller called Edge of Doom, only to find they were at an amiable deadlock over the tone of the picture. Harris was committed to straightforward suspense; Kubrick wanted to turn it into an absurdist comedy. (It was later made as Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.) “I’m about to become the worst kind of producer,” Harris warned him, “I’m about to try and tell you how to direct your picture.” Kubrick replied: “You should direct.” On that note they dissolved their partnership but remained friends for life, until Kubrick’s death in 1999. And Harris went on to direct five features including The Bedford Incident (1965) and Some Call It Loving (1973).

In a sense, Harris taught Kubrick how to produce, and Kubrick taught Harris how to direct. Artifacts, letters, scripts, photographs from their partnership, are currently on view as part of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In a conversation with the Quarterly, Harris shares a rare view of Kubrick’s working method.

Q: Kubrick showed you his second film, Killer’s Kiss (1955), early on in your friendship. What appealed to you as a prospective producer?

A: What impressed me was that he’d completed it. In those days, you’d hear somebody was making a film, and making a film, but never see the film. What happened? They got halfway through and ran out of money, or it didn’t work. Stanley completed his film. He shot the picture with a wild track; he had to lip-sync everything in postproduction. That was intensive, precision work back then. I was very impressed. I had access to funding, and so proposed a partnership.

I came across Clean Break, by Lionel White; a fast-paced novel about a racetrack robbery shown from many points of view. It was a terrific story. Stanley read it the day after I did and agreed that it was great for us. Stanley wrote the screenplay and Jim Thompson contributed some dialogue; we called it The Killing. We were determined to keep the offbeat time-structure from White’s book.

Q: How did that play for a 1950s audience?

A: There were walkouts at the preview. People didn’t know what they were going to see, and were confused. Sterling Hayden’s agent told us we’d wrecked the picture. Even friends advised us to make it more conventional. Stanley and I asked ourselves, ‘Have we blown it?’ We rented an editing room and built a linear cut of the picture. Halfway through screening it for ourselves, we looked at each other and said, ‘This stinks. Let’s put it back the way we had it.’
You’ve got to believe in your own instincts. If you listen to hostile voices, even those of friends, you shouldn’t make movies. If you’re going to fail, fail with your own contributions, not somebody else’s. Lesson learned!

Q: Can you describe a typical day--if there was such a thing as a typical day--shooting Paths of Glory?

A: The battlefield scenes were the last things on the schedule. That farmland we hired had to be dressed and built into a battlefield, with the trenches and barbwires and all of the shell holes. Stanley loved moving shots.

The main thing was taking Kirk [Douglas] through this obstacle course, this barrage. The idea was that Kirk was going to be followed, in a moving shot, through as much action as we could muster before a cut had to be made, after which we would set up to continue. It was cold; it was uncomfortable; it was wet. Everything was tough on Kirk. After he did it the first time, he told Stanley, ‘I’ll give you one more, maybe two, but that’s it. I’m not going to do this forever.’ I remember Stanley asked me to go up on one of the big parallels, to check out an angle.

Q: A parallel meaning a crane?

A: No. A parallel being a platform we built. Stanley didn’t like heights. I climbed up to look through the camera, and saw the image we were going to get. We had multiple cameras, even a handheld in the middle of the field, to cover the explosions, while Stanley covered Kirk with the moving shots.

I don’t remember Stanley ever coming in with homework, saying, ‘This is the first shot we’re going to do.’ He pretty much knew in his guts, and then did it. Then again, there’s no room in a scene like that for added ideas. It’s a done deal: show Kirk going through the battle. Make it look as uncomfortable and dangerous as it can possibly look, with explosions all around him. Kirk had to crawl through the cold water and muddy shell holes.

Q: You worked side by side every day with Kubrick for close to ten years. What was that like day-to-day?

A: I was required by Stanley to be there, not just as a producer, but because he liked input. There was no insecurity about him. Some people who are insecure don’t want other people hanging around, because they don’t want them to see, or witness any indecision on their part, or anything that could indicate they’re not sure of what they’re doing. Openness to suggestion was one of Stanley’s great attributes. He genuinely thought any idea that was better than his was going to make the picture better.

Q: How did Kubrick deal with conflicts on the set? Did he raise his voice?

A: No. Stanley would never--not ever in the three pictures we did together--lose his temper. I don’t know if that changed after we went our separate ways. When we were together he was always able to outlast the other side of the argument, whether with actors, or in the case of Lucien Ballard on The Killing, the DP. On the first day of principal photography, Ballard, by then very established and sought after, decided to lay a set of tracks and choose a lens contrary to what had been asked for. When Stanley discovered this, he repeated his first order. Ballard objected, ‘It’ll be fine like this. Nobody will notice.’ Stanley looked him in the eye and said quietly, ‘You will either do as I direct or you can leave right now.’ Ballard nodded, rebuilt the tracks and they never had another bad moment.

Stanley would say to me, ‘You need to write things down.’ He always had a notebook with him. He’d talk to somebody on the crew, ask them about the progress of this or that, and then jot a note. Later we’d be walking down the hall, and if this person were coming at us the other way, Stanley would already be patting his pocket, ready to follow-up. That was a moment of panic for a few people. You could see it in their eyes when they had no answer.

We shot The Killing in 24 days; Paths of Glory in 66 days. We were getting up there, but disciplined. If I had to say to him, ‘We’re two days behind schedule,’ he’d smile and say: ‘Oh yeah? Watch this,’ and wham! We’d be back on.

Q: How would he do that?

A: He was fast on his feet, and would think through a way to cover whatever was next--either simply, or in a single complex master.


Q: What was the hardest part about directing for Kubrick?

A: Stanley would always say it was ‘the moment you arrive on the set each morning.’ It’s that way for every director. It was no different for Kubrick. You’ve got a city block filled with equipment, trucks, extras in costume, honeywagons. There you are pulling up, and dozens if not hundreds of people are looking straight at you. They’ve all got questions, and they need them answered right away. Everybody likes the idea of being a director--of being that guy that everybody looks to--but the reality is a whole other ballgame. You’ve got to be ready to answer, but you’ve got to keep your nerve and not answer too fast.

They talk now about how Kubrick disciplined himself with chess. It’s true. You’re staring at the board and you think, ‘I can grab that guy’s queen,’ but if you don’t catch your breath and rethink, you could be building a trap for yourself. The same with filmmaking: You don’t want to be too attracted to an easy answer. An idea might look great on the surface, but create a world of problems up the line. And that applies if you’re in a bad spot. If some disaster happens, and everything’s capsized--keep your nerve. Don’t jump at the first easy answer. Look at your options. They’re there.

Q: Kubrick clearly knew what he wanted to do. Would he listen to other opinions?

A: Stanley had a very open mind. He encouraged contributions by other people. A number of suggestions I made, he accepted, but if he didn’t like them, you weren’t criticized. He admired you; he admired anybody who thought enough about something to have an idea, with the intention of making it better. He’d say, ‘Look. The director’s going to get credit for everything in the picture, no matter where the idea comes from. If a lighting guy on the catwalk yells down, ‘Why don’t you try it from this angle,’ and that suggestion is better than the idea you had, you’re going to get the credit for it anyway. Why not accept it?’ [laughs]

If an idea makes a picture better, pride of authorship is a waste of time and effort. Kubrick invited enormous input from me on Lolita. My brother, Bob, composed the ‘Love Theme,’ which Stanley loved. I picked Nelson Riddle to do the score. The first day we came to record the theme, we discovered that Nelson had written it in a minor key. As soon as he started to play it, I jumped out of my seat. ‘We can’t do this in a minor key. A minor key works if you’re doing horror, or suspense, but we don’t want that. The main love theme should be beautiful.’ Stanley welcomed that adjustment. He appreciated that I could discern a difference, and let me run with what I could contribute to the film. So, overnight it was transposed into a major key, and became something else entirely.

Q: After you parted ways and began directing for yourself, did he give you advice?

A: He not only gave me advice, he wrote down things for me like I was a kid he was sending to school. ‘Don’t get bullied into making a shot-list’ was key advice. He said, ‘A lot of magic happens on the set; it’s no disgrace to not know what you want to do.” It’s no disgrace. If you’re not careful, people will bully you into thinking there’s something wrong with you if you don’t have a clear image of where every shot is, and where you’re going to put the camera. Stanley said, ‘It’s much better to discover your strategy with dialogue scenes. You want the actors to make a contribution. Don’t put them in a position where they’re told what to do--that you’ve already set up the first shot in your mind. They may feel more comfortable walking around, doing this or that.’ He often said: ‘Let the camera accommodate the actors. Don’t have the actors accommodate the camera.

Q: What did you learn about casting from Kubrick?

A: He always drilled into my head that you live or die by your choice of actors. They can be brilliant and bring to your film a dimension beyond your highest expectations. But they can also be incompetent, irresponsible, subject to moods, insecure, and the bearer of unlimited personal problems, which can easily affect the rest of the cast and turn the best-intended film into a shamble. He would say, ‘Unless you’re fortunate enough to have the financial wherewithal to replace a bad actor, you’re stuck with them for the rest of the schedule.'

Q: If you’re working with a well-chosen actor but something is wrong anyway, what did he advise?

A: He told me there are three things you should carefully analyze, if your instincts tell you a scene doesn’t play. The first is: Do the actors know their lines? It could be that simple. If they don’t and have to be constantly prompted by the script supervisor, then there’s no rhythm to what you’re shooting. The mess is right there on the surface. On the other hand, if they do know their lines, ask yourself: Do they know what the scene is about? If they do and it still won’t play, then the scene itself isn’t written properly. The essential talent of a director is that ability to know when a scene is off, for whatever reason.

Q: You and Kubrick shared a passion for music, particularly jazz. Is that what a director’s ear for the ‘false note’ boils down to?

A: As a director, you’re always dealing with a melodic line. Jazz deals with variations of a theme. All the films that Stanley directed, all the ones I directed, have been based on previously published material. That novel or story is the melody. In movies, as in jazz, the melody is stated. The harmonics that go with it remain the same--but the soloist, or the instrumentalist, or even the full orchestra will do variations on these harmonics, making up their own melody, so to speak.
If an actor doesn’t know their lines, it’s as if they haven’t run their scales. They can’t play the tune, so they can’t improvise. They can’t go find the spontaneous thing inside the harmonics; it’s not going to swing. You can’t make anything new out of it.

Q: Jazz also relies on improvisation. How did he feel about that?

A: The movies Stanley and I made relied on improvisations--but we didn’t want them to sound improvised. This is why rehearsal is so important. We’d have the actors try wild, extemporaneous stuff before shooting, but we’d record them. The discoveries would be woven into the script. You have all the spontaneity of improv, but it’s clean. You don’t have a million ‘y’knows,’ and ‘likes’ all over the place. When the actors were handed those pages and came in knowing their lines, the result was magic.

Q: So ultimately, what did you take away from your time with Kubrick?

A: I did not have dreams of directing when I first met Stanley. My directing was totally impressed and influenced by his directing. When you see terrific athletes perform, when you see a Joe DiMaggio--he makes an impossible thing look easy. You don’t realize the degree of difficulty that exists when a master performs. [When I became a director] I was rudely awakened. You’re working with human beings. You have to be a combination of psychiatrist, Dutch uncle, genius, and leader. You can’t show weakness. You’ve got to supervise everybody, and answer all the questions from every department. It seemed so easy for Stanley.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1dpqq3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dpqq3/james_b_harris_produced_three_films_with_his/,

Okay, first of all. I thought Django Unchained was the best film of 2012. I was wrong. This is easily. I loved everything about this film. It is so amazingly beautiful that it captivated me from frame one and held my attention all the way until ""The End"" I honestly could not believe it. The story in this film is one of a paradox. Because nothing really happens over the course of the film, but at the same time everything happens. I thought Freddie was less of a despicable character than Daniel Plainview was. And the score was amazingly done by Jonny Greenwood. Not to mention powerhouse performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams they all did a wonderful job. This also has one of the weirdest endings to a film that I have ever seen, anyone want to tell me what it means?

Now for the artistic side of it. I really really loved the whole ""laughter"" motif that comes up. I'm not yet sure as to what it means as this is my first viewing but if you want to give me your two cents go ahead. I also really like in the jail scene the juxtaposition of Freddie's anger and Lancaster's calmness, which then turns to anger. Which, I believe, is their two character arcs meeting. I also really enjoy the whole idea of the ""potion"" being made of secrets. That really wowed me. Also, and again I don't know what it means yet and if you want to go ahead and explain, I liked the part were Peggy Dodd and Freddie are doing exercises for Freddie's concentration and she says ""turn my eyes black. What color are they?"" and then he says ""black"" and then they turn black. I know that is symbolic of something I'm just not sure yet. Also juxtaposing Lancaster being excited about riding the bike fast with Freddie's running away was amazing. There is some other stuff that caught my eye that I can't think of right now because I am tired.

Anyways, discuss what you think it means and what you thought of The Master I am really interested to hear what you guys have to say. Don't disappoint me.

Oh also, I feel like Paul Thomas Anderson has a thing for mustaches. Samuel Jackson in Hard Eight. Burt Reynolds in Boogie Nights. John C. Reilly in Magnolia. Luis Guzman in Punch-Drunk Love. Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. And obviously, Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master.

I watched this movie for the first time over the weekend and LOVED it. It's been on my must watch list for a while but I finally got around to it after spotting a cheap DVD of it.


First of all, Deakins is a genius. The train robbery scene near the beginning is one of the most visually striking images in cinema I've ever seen and I'll probably have the image of the gang wearing white clothes with eye holes poked out burned into my unconscious for the rest of my life.

Secondly, the acting was phenomenal, especially Casey Affleck who I thought overshadowed Pitt surprisingly. I'd only ever seen him in the Ocean's movies before hand and I'm going to have to check out his work now.

Thirdly, the dialogue/characters were done perfectly. The relationship between Ford and James was unique to any film (that I've seen anyway) and kind of reminded me of the superfan who shot John Lennon in a way.

The way James MAKES Ford into a coward wasn't something that hit me until a few hours after viewing.

I did have a few **TINY** problems with it though, and they're really nitpickers. One is the blood spatter that lands on the lens when Wood gets killed. I thought it was unneccesary since it was added in post (I think), and it took me out of the movie for a few minutes. The second small thing is the freeze frames at the end. Same thing. I just felt it wasn't needed.

Even though the movie was LONG AS FUCK (as long as the title even), I didn't feel it, and when it was over I had to do a double take at my clock.

It put me in a weird mood after watching for a couple hours too, which is the mark of something great to me. 

I wish I could talk more eloquently about the characters and messages but whenever I write that stuff I end up ruining it so hopefully someone can do that better than I can.

1376166653.0,93,self.TrueFilm,1k3una,"Man of Steel: The Modern Superhero film, and the death of wonder.",148,55,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1k3una/man_of_steel_the_modern_superhero_film_and_the/,"I should start by stating that Superman, for me at least is Christopher Reeve, and it's in this context it saddens me if indeed Man of Steel really is the standard for superhero films in the future; I never had an emotionally nurturing childhood, nor one where my father taught me the kind of things we're told a father should teach a son; many of the beliefs I hold today have been developed from reading, and adhering to a code that I believe follows as closely as possible to what I learned from the Donner movie and the comics. I try to do right by people; I'm always mindful of charity, I help where I can, and I try to do good in the world. Despite having no reason to believe so, I believe that people have the potential and capacity to be fundamentally good - Superman and Christopher Reeve inspired that in me, and my point is this...Superman is about hope. He's about optimism for the future, and the willingness to stand up for people weaker than yourself, put yourself in harms way and tell them that they won't be hurt. Superman is a message of loving one another unconditionally, and doing what you can to make life easier on each other by just being decent, compassionate and caring. The reason why superheroes such as the flash, wonder woman, green lantern and even Batman rally behind him, is because he's the moral compass; he's the true north - the brightest star in the sky. When other superheroes doubt what they're doing in the world, they look at superman, and they're reminded when they need it most that their job is to do good, bear the weight for the weak, and carry the ones who need it through the roughest of times. To protect the innocent, and to say no to tyranny, whatever the cost.

Superman was taught all of this, not by Jor-El, but as Clark Kent. He was taught the values of being a good, compassionate man, without powers and without ego; to be humble, and to never forget all of the values I cite above. He was taught all of these things by Jonathan and Martha Kent, and in those lonely moments of my life where I dreamed of having parents that would care for me and nurture me, as a boy I would think of the Kents and pray that my parents would change their mind, just for a day and treat me with the love and adoration that Clark was gifted with by the Kents. The House of El gave him life and a part of his identity, but the Kents gave him character to believe that all life is sacred, that all people deserved to be treated with compassion and trust, and overall the unwavering belief that anyone has the capacity to change.

That was why it was so hard for me to swallow. Without getting caught up in the whys and wherefores of whether it was justified that Superman kills, after the initial anger I felt at seeing that, it's not even the biggest problem I have with the film. The problem I have with the film is that Jonathan teaches Clark that he should have let a bus full of kids die before revealing his abilities to the world, for fear that the government would come and dissect him. Jonathan Kent in the film taught superman Paranoia and mistrust, to believe that he was truly alone, and that he should just take a beating over, and over again. Even in the face of his death, Jonathan forbade Clark from rescuing for the sake of a dog (I'll get back to this), to once again justify and reinforce his belief that humans are destructive, and murderous. With those lessons being taught to him, why in the name of hades would Clark even bother with accounting for the risk to human life? He certainly didn't when it came to levelling smallville, or completely wiping metropolis off of the map in a way that can only be described as the most tasteful of disaster porn. I get that it might be cool to see the pathos behind the mythos that superman does not kill. What I don't get is why a farmer from Kansas, who's used to death on a massive scale thanks to cattle rearing, would even worry about a dog with the threat of an oncoming tornado. Tell me honestly; do you know any farmer at all, who wouldn't say ""screw the damned dog, get to safety"" with a twister that close?

Man of Steel for me is an elseworlds. It's a world where Superman is dark, and brooding and gritty; almost egotistical, and constantly having it reiterated to him by family and the damned government that he's alone. It's a world where superman has a disregard for public property, causing damage on a massive scale and only having the thought to show regret after causing the damage he'd wrought. This is an esleworld where superman is nothing more than a menace that honestly, I don't blame lex and the U.S. government for wanting to put down, and that, as a Superman fan truly, honestly breaks my heart.

If you look at the prime nemesis of the DC live action universe - Marvel, look at the contrast; I adore Both Captain America and Thor, because they teach a good, positive message. Both stories, despite the damage are bright and optimistic in a way that man of steel should have been, and in both movies, as well as the Avengers, I feel it only pertinent to point out that before the brown stuff hits the fans, these two superheroes care about the people around them so much, that their first priority is to cordon off the error and make sure it's evacuated before the battle commences. Hell. Thor sacrifices himself in exchange for the lives of everyone around him, and learns the value of his moral fibre in the process. Where was that in Man of Steel?

Honestly, when it comes to the DC universe, I shoulder the blame almost entirely on people like Frank Miller and Alan Moore, who introduced the concept of dark, gritty adult comics - and because they sold so well, DC introduced more violence, more angst and more Drama into the comics, and thereby the films because as far as people are concerned, that's what people want. What's so wrong, so absurd with having a Superhero movie that is about hope and optimism, and is completely unapologetic for its history. I feel that considering the fact that Kal El is 75 years old this year, there was more than enough room for a middle ground, but as it is, I will never change my view that it was anything less than a mistake to hand the reigns over to Snyder and Goyer. Goyer hasn't made a film that involved positivity in his life, and the one time Snyder tried, it bombed well and truly at the box office, because neither of them understand writing from the perspective of being hopeful and trusting.

Ironically, I had the same problems with the Nolan interpretation of Batman - I feel the commonality between the two films, is that there's no suspension of belief; everything is tied to a ""what if this were the real world?"" ethos, and personally, I believe that we have too much of that in the film industry as a whole and that the one place in contrast that a film such as *Batman &amp; Robin* redeemed itself, was that it made room for characters such as Mr. Freeze and Clayface; it played entirely on the premise that there were supervillians in the world, and it *embraced* how utterly corny it was; When I watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, I don't see Gotham or Metropolis - I see Chicago and Illinois; Say what you will about *Superman Returns*, but one thing you *can* give Bryan Singer credit for is the fact that he painstakingly redressed part of a city in Australia to make it believably look like Metropolis - only a local would recognise some of the landmarks in the film, and it allowed, for me, that all important suspension of reality.

I feel, especially in this 75th year of Superman being in the world, that it's important to embrace everything about his past, and that means embracing and finding joy in the fantastical adversaries that we find  within the DC universe; people want and deserve escapism. They want and deserve the opportunity to close the doors of a cinema for two hours, dig into their popcorn and be taken away to a universe that is all but impossible, incompatible with the physics of our world, and my fear is that children today will have no memories of two hours like that in the way that I did; there is no *Flight of the Navigator* for this generation, or *Explorers*, or *The Goonies* (well. Ok. Pirates of The Caribbean to a certain degree) - There is no science fiction such as *The Last Starfighter*, no memories of being taken away, and landing back in their seat being encouraged to simply *imagine the impossible*. We live in an era where Hollywood seems to be intent on largely re-making films instead of taking risks and investing in imagination, or presenting a future that is a dystopia in feel.

This was a wonderful film, one that kept me riveted for its entire runtime. Even if you don't fully understand what's going on, the filmmaking is of high quality and the way the narrative flows made the movie feel like one long scene, in a good way. Its hard to spoil this film, and its hard to tell people to go see it since you can't really even summarize it more than Carruth already has, with the idea of characters getting caught in the life cycle of an organism.

The cinematography resembles films made by Terrence Malick, handheld camerawork, emphasis on the image and moving the narrative without relying on dialogue, which tends to be played over different shots and scenes, creating a Malick-like voiceover effect. This isn't to say that Carruth is aping Malick, but the similarities are there, even beyond cinematography, with the story focusing on the relationship between the two main characters and how their love develops. 

The editing, which is one of the highlights of the experience, reminded me of the films of Alan Resnais, Jean Luc Godard, Nicolas Roeg (in particular) and the John Boorman's Point Blank. When I asked Carruth about his influences, he had a hard time choosing a few out of many, but stated the French New Wave, Steven Soderbergh's The Limey and Jean Luc Godard's Vivre Sa Vie, all films that show an obvious link to Upstream Color's editing. 

Sound design was outstanding. The performances, including Carruth's, were great, but with this type of film performances tend to be overlooked among other elements. 

As for Carruth himself, he seemed like a really nice guy and grateful for the way things turned out. The first question asked was for a hug and he gave it to the guy, though after some bewilderment.  He didn't really go into detail on the narrative but he gave off the impression that the important things are the characters, their relationship and their journey, set in a challenging situation. Science fiction is the backdrop.

It is a film that has haunted me since I saw it a decade ago as a teenager and since the Blu-ray release, its hold on me has only increased. Ever since Vertigo was announced #1 on the Sight &amp; Sound poll (which was the first time I'd heard of the BFI list) however, I've begun looking at other people's thoughts on Vertigo, and it's been mostly frustrating. The range of reviews runs the gamut from psychoanalysts pushing their own elaborate interpretations (such as the theory that everything after the opening scene is merely a projection of Scottie's subconscious) to the more common but no less disheartening ""It's overrated and sucks"" comments. I suppose the reaction was understandable given that 50 years of film students have had Citizen Kane hammered into them, but this general unwillingness to consider the film itself, rather than theories or its critical ranking, has left me feeling rather uneasy about how people appreciate films.

To that end, I shall try to explain the story and structure of Vertigo, and why I believe the plot is more defensible than most give it credit for. Those seeking a psychoanalytical thesis should look elsewhere, I will try my best to remain grounded to the film itself, and where I do deviate from the celluloid, I shall reference the film for my reasoning. And as a disclaimer: This is not meant to be definitive, I'm fully aware there are other possible answers that work, as long I've succeeded in making you consider the story rather than dismiss it, that is enough.
___
**Plot**
___

* **Why is Scottie, a detective, chasing criminals on rooftops?**

I'll admit I don't know why some people have a problem with this. I think it's fairly easy to rationalize: He's been looking for the guy, finds him, the arrest fails, a pursuit begins and he follows the policeman as backup. This willingness to help and pursue will of course define the film.
___
* **How does Scottie get down?**

Another one I don't know why people get hung up on. The cut from the roof to Midge's room has lead to some of the wilder theories about the film. In all seriousness, he probably yelled for help, the people below called the Fire Department, and he was rescued. Does any of this really need to be shown? No one asks how Lawrence ends up in the desert after blowing out the match.
___
* **How could Scottie and Midge be college classmates with their age difference?**

While filming, Stewart was 49 and Barbera Bel Geddes was 35. Midge's age is 37 in the script; for the sake of argument let's say Scottie is in his mid-40s. That still leaves an age gap, but one that can be explained with their difference in majors: Scottie attended law school, Midge was presumably in art classes.
___
* **What's with the murder plot?**

This is probably the biggest obstacle some people have with the film. After all, who'd hire a lookalike to play their fake wife and mislead detectives about his real wife's murder?

Well, Lars Thorwald for one. In Rear Window, Thorwald dresses a woman up as his wife, leaves his room to make sure she's seen, puts her on a train and has her mail a postcard and pick up a trunk under Anna Thorwald's name. The deception works until Lars kills the neighborhood dog. Thus, a variant of the Vertigo plot was already a plot device in an earlier film; to paraphrase North by Northwest, ""It's an old Hitchcock trick, he's just freshened it up with ghost stories.""

Whether the murder scheme is acceptable or preposterous is a choice the viewer must make personally. However, it is misguided to see the murder plot as the central concern of Vertigo; Vertigo is as much about the murder plot as Citizen Kane and 2001 are about sleds and the Monolith. These all merely set the stage for the grander ambitions of the narrative.
___
* **What's the point of Carlotta Valdes?**

Carlotta Valdes seems like a misdirection tactic, a cinematic sleight of hand to distract from the real story. Some viewers may feel cheated after the reveal, but there are actually very practical reasons why Carlotta Valdes' ""presence"" is important to the story.

We must remember that Gavin Elster's endgame is not to kill his wife, the real Madeleine, that is merely an unavoidable step to his real goal, the '*power*' of her money and the '*freedom*' from his responsibilities. He may have married into his position, but he is not the dominant partner in the marriage; a wealthy powerful man would not be stuck against his will in a dull position tending to his wife's business.

At their first meeting, Elster plainly states that he has already consulted with doctors with the intention of committing her to an institution, this will be repeated at the Coroner's Inquest as proof of his ""innocence"". Therefore, proving Madeleine's insanity was Elster's intention even *before* Scottie became involved. As for his reasons, we can only speculate, but it stands to reason that proving the last surviving member of a family was insane would remove a lot of legal impediments governing their estate. Pesky things such as wills and trusts become much easier to deal with. In the end, it's still all about the money.
___
* **Why does Scottie start following Madeleine?**

Scottie's reluctance and excuses disappear after seeing Madeleine at Ernie's. There is the obvious effect of Madeleine's ethereal beauty, but I've always suspected another impetus: Scottie and Elster are the same age, yet Elster is rich and has a stunning wife while Scottie is middle class and has...Midge? There is an element of envy here, a desire to covet which will eventually grow to overwhelm Scottie.
___
* **How does Madeleine disappear at the McKittrick Hotel?**

This is the granddaddy of Vertigo's supposed ""plot holes"", and has seemingly defied explanation by everyone since 1958. Hitchcock himself never explained the mystery, leaving it as an 'icebox' scene.

But I think I can lick it, I have a theory. There are a number of clues that are dropped during this scene.

1. The room is rented by a ""Carlotta Valdes""
2. She's had the room for 2 weeks, comes 2-3 times a week, and doesn't stay overnight.
3. The clerk hasn't seen ""Carlotta Valdes"" come in.
4. ""Carlotta Valdes"" room key is on the rack.

These clues are given by the clerk, so let's assume she's an innocent bystander. 

We see Madeleine in the room, so she must have access; this implies that a copy of the room key exists. The clerk hasn't seen ""Carlotta Valdes"", this means that Judy has never before donned the Madeleine disguise when visiting. Judy only visits during daytime, and never stays long. The disappearance of Madeleine and her Jaguar suggests that there must be another entrance/exit in the hotel. What does it all mean?

I believe that the McKittrick Hotel is the meeting place for Gavin Elster and Judy's secret daytime affairs. Seen in this light, the clues seem to fall into place. Elster knows about the hotel, and needs an inconspicuous entry and a copy of the room key to avoid the clerk's suspicion. Judy registers under a false name, given to her by Elster, and only visits when their schedules allow. She probably has a job of her own and this is why she can never stay overnight. She brings Scottie to the McKittrick Hotel, after taking him to Carlotta's grave and portrait, because she knows, or has been advised, that it is the one place where she can shake off Scottie's tail.

Can I prove it? No, I can't, but like a Sudoku puzzle it all seems to fit. This echos the opening of Psycho, but more importantly it changes the nature of the entire scene, from an oddity in the narrative, to poetic: Judy, while off the job, meets a man who persuades her to quit her job, accompany him and eventually take on a new identity. Also, several lines take on new meaning in this context: Elster's story about seeing his wife during the day and having to return to the office, and Madeleine's reminisces about the room where she sits ""alone, always alone"", a sign perhaps that while she is assisting Elster, she has doubts about her feelings toward him, which leads to the kiss with Scottie at the seaside.

It is also worth noting that there is no particular reason to mention any of these clues if Hitchcock merely wanted to create a mysterious scene. Vertigo went through 4 writers and a year's delay, it is rather unlikely that a nonsensical scene could have survived through the entire developmental process.

&gt;Truffaut: *By the way, I meant to ask you whether you ever introduce useless dialogue in 
a scene, knowing in advance that people won't pay any attention to it?* 

&gt;Hitchcock: *Why should we do that, for heaven's sake?*

___
* **Why does Madeleine jump into San Francisco Bay?**

From Elster's viewpoint, this action accomplishes several simultaneous objectives.

1. It is a relatively safe way for Madeleine to appear suicidal. The Coroner's Inquest will refer to this as a ""previous aberration"".
2. It allows Scottie and Madeleine to meet, while she is supposed to be unaware of him.
3. Their subsequent conversation will establish her mental state, the fact that she seems unaware of her wanderings.
4. Now that Scottie and Madeleine know each other, she can begin to feed him the information that Elster can't, which will eventually lead them to San Juan Batista.

What Elster doesn't count on is Madeleine's growing sympathy for Scottie. Eventually, Judy will reveal that problems with her stepfather lead her to leave Kansas and that she has been sexually active since 17. There is a hint that she's become used to men using, and perhaps abusing her body, which is certainly what Elster does by having her jump into the Bay. Scottie's treatment of her in his apartment is delicate, perhaps even reverential, a refreshing change from the manipulative Elster.
___
* **How could Elster be sure Scottie wouldn't make it through the trapdoor at the top of the tower?**

This is the hole Hitchcock refers to in Hitchcock/Truffaut, and as such is also one that critics have latched onto. However, it is a hole that Hitchcock purposely created, one that does not exist in the script:

&gt;MADELEINE IS RUNNING UP THE STAIRS OF THE TOWER: SCOTTIE STRUGGLING DESPERATELY AFTER HER. SHE REACHES THE TOP, OPENS THE DOOR, DARTS INTO THE BELL TOWER, SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND **LOCKS IT**. SHE TURNS. GAVIN ELSTER STANDS NEAR THE OPEN ARCH, HOLDING HIS WIFE FAST...

[The lock does exist in the film.](http://i.imgur.com/TTeQD7L.png) Therefore, it's implied that as long as Judy gets a good headstart, it won't matter how much Scottie's vertigo affects him, he still won't prevent the body from falling. The question then becomes: Why would Hitchcock sabotage his own story?

For Judy. This is not the first time Hitchcock deviates from the script to make Judy a more sympathetic character; When Madeleine first meets Scottie at Ernie's, she's supposed to turn her head, look at Scottie and smile, this is how it is in the script and how it was originally filmed (this can be seen in the trailer). After filming completed, Hitchcock had second thoughts and ordered producer Herbert Coleman to reshoot Kim Novak's glance without the smile. His reason was that he didn't want the audience to sense something wrong so early in the film, but his revision also changes the character: a smile at an intended victim is a sinister action.

So, in leaving the door unlocked, we are forced to accept Scottie's failure to climb the tower. However, this simple inaction on Judy's part also has broader implications: Elster is shown that Judy can't be totally relied upon, and this gives him a reason, if he needed it, for ditching her. Judy's terrified glances at the trapdoor after the body is thrown also take on new meaning: she knows the door is unlocked and there's a possibility Scottie could come up. The argument could be made that she is trying to warn Elster while he covers her mouth and backs them into hiding. This also provides a rebuttal to those who believe the flashback is unnecessary: We are shown the mistake Judy makes that nearly undoes Elster's careful planning.

Seen in this context, the scene is not really a hole but a coincidental circumstance. And really, isn't that at the heart of every great murder?
___
* **If Scottie sees Madeleine's body, the whole plot is foiled.**

Yes, it's probably true. But why would Scottie view the body? He is not acting in any official capacity, has no relation to Madeleine and, most importantly, he is the only suspicious character at the crime scene. Under these circumstances, the only one who could ID the body is Elster himself, and for all the criticisms of the murder plot, one can't help but admire Elster's calculated daring. In one fell stroke, he has killed his wife, set himself up as the tragic caring husband, and landed Scottie in the hot seat. It's an inspired move.
___
* **What happens to Midge?**

Midge's exit from Vertigo rubs some people the wrong way. From the narrative perspective, it makes sense; from here on, we're to focus on Scottie and Judy without interruption. From a character viewpoint, it also makes sense. Midge's line, ""I don't think Mozart is going to help at all"", is a confession of her own inability to reach Scottie emotionally. She's seen to what depths Scottie can fall for someone, and knows that she'll never be able to engender the same reaction.

[Her exit shot also echos Madeleine's ""Walking down a corridor into darkness and death"" line](http://i.imgur.com/H3I4tIy.png). In Midge's case, she is walking towards the light; she has rejected Scottie's pursuit of the dead in favor of her own life.
___
* **It's a huge coincidence that Scottie bumps into Judy again.**

Not really for Hitchcock, he pulls this trick again twice in North by Northwest, having Eve bump into Thornhill on the train, and then extremely conveniently having her walk into the Chicago hotel when Thornhill tries to find Kaplan.

Furthermore, I'm not convinced the meeting is totally coincidental, for reasons I'll explain below.
___
* **Why doesn't Judy recognize Scottie at her door?**

This scene is often used to attack Kim Novak's acting, after all, how could the sudden appearance of her beloved on her doorstep after 1 year not create a reaction? However, this assumes that Judy doesn't know Scottie has followed her; I shall try to show that she does.

We must back up slightly to the first time Scottie sees Judy. Judy is walking up the sidewalk with her friends, and [has the most subtle reaction in all of Vertigo](http://i.minus.com/iPLjrjFqH1uyg.gif). Her reaction is cut short, probably purposefully, by Hitchcock. In the ensuing shot she scratches her arm, which can be taken as a nervous reaction. While Scottie follows her, Judy appears to be smoking from a distance. This is the only time Madeleine/Judy exhibits this behavior, and Kim Novak didn't smoke in real life. As she lowers her hand, a white sedan drives up the road and starts blocking our view of Judy. Hitchcock waits until the sedan is in the middle of the frame before cutting to Scottie. When Judy goes into the Empire Hotel and opens her window, we think she's just glancing at the view, but it's actually a repeat of Madeleine opening the curtain at the McKittrick Hotel: She's checking if Scottie is still there.

If we accept this sequence of events, then [this entire scene mirrors the McKittrick Hotel episode](http://i.imgur.com/2W3g5d6.jpg). Furthermore, Judy's demeanor in the hotel before Scottie's arrival changes from complete unawareness to anxious waiting and preparation. While Scottie is talking at the door, Judy slowly backs away and places her hands on the telephone behind her back. She has weighed her options and decided seeing Scottie is worth the risk; as she will later tell him, ""I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove!""
___
* **Is the flashback necessary?**

One of the things I find annoying is people's willingness to toy with key elements of Vertigo, playing around with its structure and imagining different cast members to a degree I don't see other great films subjected to. Personally, I think it shows a lack of appreciation and understanding of the film itself. 

To be sure, Hitchcock himself is probably the source of all this speculation, but I feel some of his words have to be taken with a very large grain of salt. His continual mention of Vera Miles, for instance, is completely nonsensical (newsflash to Mr. Hitchcock: critical flops do not create stars) especially given his later treatment of Miles. His statement that ""Everyone around [him] was against [the flashback]"" is a bald-faced lie, almost the complete opposite of reality. It's now known to a fair degree of certainty that writer Sam Taylor came up with the flashback and Vertigo as we know it was given a limited preview in San Francisco for, among others, Paramount Head Barney Balaban. Balaban himself loved Vertigo and immediately returned to New York to begin promotion. Meanwhile someone, likely Joan Harrison (Hitchcock's TV producer), began arguing against the flashback, and Hitchcock arranged a viewing without it. Hitchcock then ordered the film released without the flashback, against the wishes of Jimmy Stewart, Bernard Herrmann, and producer Herbert Coleman, the latter infuriated to the point of nearly resigning. This decision may even have contributed to Vertigo's critical failure: Unbeknownst to Balaban, the private showing he arranged for East coast critics did not have the flashback, and the feedback was disastrous. It is thanks to Balaban's fury, and perhaps Alma Reville, that the flashback was reinstated. If there's one thing to takeaway from Hitchcock's lie, it's that he also came to realize his rash mistake.

Narratively, the flashback accomplishes several important things: We are shown Judy's behavior in the tower, her mistake in not locking the trapdoor, her genuine horror at the sight of the real Madeleine's body, and the way Elster manipulates her rather than having her assist him. None of this would have been possible to convey without the flashback, short of a clunky expository scene at the end *à la* Psycho. Indeed, that was how Alex Coppel, the 2nd writer on Vertigo dealt with the problem; in a document titled ""Confessions on Tower"", he listed 25 details the dialog had to explain at the end. One wonders how much taller the tower would have had to be to fit in that conversation. 

In terms of character, the flashback is even more important: This is the only time we'll have any insight on Judy's true personalty and motivations. This is essential to sympathize with her, to see the 2nd half of Vertigo through her perspective. Without the flashback, we are completely left in the dark as to why Judy allows Scottie to transform her, and later on, whether her feelings for Scottie were ever genuine or simply manipulative. Judy's character is the heart of Vertigo, it is what provides meaning during subsequent viewings and what ultimately elevates Vertigo from a strange murder mystery to a haunting emotional allegory.
___
* **Why does Gavin Elster leave Judy in San Francisco, why doesn't he kill her?**

In the same way the flashback serves as an insight for Judy, the murder plot is the only true insight we have on Elster. What it tells us is that Elster is a man willing to take extraordinary risks, but in a way where he has meticulously calculated the outcomes beforehand. While the murder plot can certainly be called far-fetched, I don't think the word convoluted necessarily applies. The twists and turns of the murder plot are to me analogous to the feints a chess master uses to disguise their endgame. Like a chess master though, he is not without his weaknesses.

While he is extremely exact about the mechanics of the plot, manipulating Scottie and Judy like pieces on a chessboard, he shows a woeful disregard for the emotional toll this exacts on them. After Madeleine's death, it is unknown whether he is, or ever was serious about taking Judy away with him. However, killing her is out of the question, it is a rash decision with minimal benefit, unforeseen risks, and no clear alibi, the exact opposite of how he functions. From a logical standpoint, he is very safe in leaving Judy: He knows Scottie believes Madeleine is dead, and Judy has nothing to gain and everything to lose by not keeping silent. What he doesn't calculate are the illogical factors: Scottie knows Madeleine is dead but will keep looking for her, and Judy is willing to risk everything for a chance at love.
___
* **Why does Judy wear Carlotta's necklace?**

It seems like an awful choice, and in truth it is very convenient for Hitchcock; Scottie and Judy's romance may be built on the Mother of all Shams, but for the brief scene Hitchcock allows us before the reveal, it seems like it has a good chance of working. Judy genuinely cares for Scottie, and while Scottie may be fixated on the facade rather than the personality within, there is also no hint of friction between them; he appears fond of her and totally at ease, giving every indication that their relationship is meant to last, which of course makes the end all the more tragic.

But Hitchcock doesn't have the time, patience, or funding to follow them through the years, the movie has to end somewhere. And in choosing Carlotta's necklace as Judy's ""slip"", it creates a lot of interesting insights into both Judy and Scottie's characters.

In Judy's case, the contrast with Madeleine is strong: she is not nearly in the same socioeconomic class. Her clothes and makeup are very shabby in comparison (though I must confess, I find Kim Novak so attractive that even under the unflattering costume, she looks kinda cute to me) and her hotel room is very plain. Thus, there is one detail that has always stood out to me: her jewelry.

[When Madeleine dons the infamous grey suit, she is wearing a bird brooch](http://i.imgur.com/6fZg1sG.png). 'Elster' is actually the German word for Mockingbird and/or Magpie. There are many obvious associations one can immediately infer from this.

[When Judy first meets Scottie, and until she agrees to be made over, she is wearing a rabbit brooch](http://i.imgur.com/lTIaQi2.png). I've been unable to find any association between 'Barton' and 'rabbit' or 'bunny'. It's obvious that it has some meaning. This being Hitchcock, it could be an awful jumping joke. However, given his careful nuanced approach to Vertigo, I prefer a subtler interpretation: Whereas Madeleine could fly away (and Gavin does just that) from Scottie, Judy is grounded and can never escape his reach.

I also think a backstory could be inferred from the 2 brooches. I've always considered the brooches as vestiges of Elster's courtship of Judy. It isn't hard to imagine Elster visiting a store (Magnin's?), noticing Judy, buying her the rabbit brooch to start their affair, and later buying her the bird brooch to signify his intention of ultimately marrying her. I link the brooches to Elster because Judy doesn't seem to place a lot of care in her own appearance and decor. There is also the intriguing story of Elster watching Madeleine wear Carlotta Valdes jewelry and looking at herself in the mirror, ""going into that other world and becoming someone else"".

In Scottie's case, it is very interesting that Carlotta's necklace is what alerts him. I think a very strong case can be made that Scottie's subconscious is already bugging him regarding Judy; the background dissolve during the Scene d'Amour kiss is the most blatant proof. However, Judy never wore the necklace as Madeleine, he never saw it in real life. His only memory of it is from Carlotta's portrait, and this to me is an astonishing insight into his frame of mind.

He may have fallen in love with Madeleine, he may be obsessed with Madeleine, but he is *haunted* by Carlotta Valdes. Think back to the dream sequence: Madeleine doesn't appear at all, but Carlotta does prominently. Recall Scottie's line at the beginning, *""I wake up at night seeing that man fall from the roof and I try to reach out to him...""* Scottie is terrified of the notion that Carlotta Valdes can reach out from beyond the grave, it violates every principle of his factual detective persona. The idea that the dead can cross over onto the living plane is what seizes and propels him for the 2nd half of Vertigo. It is what causes him to lose sight of reality and the loving Judy in front of him. After all, if the dead can manipulate the living, if the dead can change reality to suit their whims, why can't he?

When he brings Judy to San Juan Batista, he exclaims, *""One doesn't often get a second chance, I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chance Judy, you're my second chance!""* This, like so many other lines in Vertigo, has a double meaning. On one hand, he's referring to his failure to ascend the tower the first time. On the other, this is his second chance to find the key and explain Madeleine's *""beautiful phony trances""*. He *craves* a rational explanation, which is why, in a poetic nod to the flashback scene's placement in the movie, he also reveals his secret before reaching the top.

To get back to the question: Why does Judy wear Carlotta's necklace? She owns very little jewelry and most of it is probably from Elster. She thinks, in finally becoming Madeleine, she ""has Scottie now"", that she has become the object of his haunting. She believes she is the sole woman in his mind, the only one he can't forget and the only one whose appearance is indelible. 

It is a terrible miscalculation of the damage she has wrought on his psyche, and seals both their fates, propelling them inexorably to their doom.
___
**Vertigo - A turning point**
___

Vertigo's critical and commercial fizzle in 1958 is infamous. It was undoubtedly a harsh blow, and it is interesting to see how it affected the lives of those involved. 

Bernard Herrmann was probably the least affected, but his future was inextricably tied to Hitchcock's. For $17,500, he completed the Vertigo score in 1 month, 13 days; He would echo his themes from Vertigo in each Hitchcock collaboration afterwards and later on in his 1965 String Quartet, 1967 Clarinet Quintet and second to last film score, Obsession (1976). Not being able to conduct the Vertigo score would always be a regret of his; due to an AFM strike in 1958, Muir Mathieson had to conduct, first in London and later in Vienna using Mono recording which, along with later degradation, is partly responsible for the lower fidelity of Vertigo's soundtrack compared to North by Northwest. In 1969, [Herrmann recorded the Vertigo Suite \(Prelude/The Nightmare/Scene D'Amour\) with the London Philharmonic Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_6euCUJ0Tg), the only part of his interpretation that exists.

James Stewart had already been feeling the years creep up on him, knowing that it was becoming difficult to be taken seriously as a romantic lead. As he was a partner in shaping Vertigo, he must be given a lot of credit for allowing Vertigo to navigate such dark depths. His enthusiasm to work with and comfort Kim Novak on the set undoubtedly helped both their performances. The failure of Vertigo must have been a personal blow to him, a sign that even with Hitchcock, his name could no longer be counted on to draw audiences. Indeed, he lost the lead in North by Northwest to Cary Grant, and while the immensity of his persona and talent meant he could bounce back in films like Anatomy of a Murder, his later films are mostly ensemble pieces. His last romantic lead role was right after Vertigo in Bell, Book, and Candle with Kim Novak, a fulfillment of the obligation he made to procure Novak from Columbia for Vertigo. Stewart and Hitchcock would never work again, and all of his Hitchcock films would be 'lost' until their reissue in 1984.

Alfred Hitchcock remains somewhat of an enigma. There is a sense that with Vertigo he was trying to break out of his populist suspense entertainer persona, to vie with the more respected directors of his day, Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan for example. Vertigo was also the closest he ever came to adapting Mary Rose, a play that had captivated him since 1920 and which he constantly referred to while making Vertigo. It is perhaps a recognition of his failure that, when discussing Mary Rose in the '60s, he told Truffaut: ""You should make the picture. You would do it better. It's not really Hitchcock material."" While there are many merits to some of his later films, it's undeniable that Hitchcock never again attempted a film with the emotional subtlety and depth of Vertigo. Beginning with Psycho, he would aim for shock value, and starting with North by Northwest, he would insert himself into the promotional campaigns of many of his films. It is tempting to wonder how a successful Vertigo would've changed his path. North by Northwest would still have been made, but perhaps with traveling salesman Jimmy Stewart instead of Mad Man Cary Grant. Psycho is less assured, but its expository ending has always seemed to me a reaction to Vertigo's failure (Herbert Coleman *did* resign during production, and Joan Harrison took over). Beyond that, nothing is certain; in any case, Truffaut was ""convinced that Hitchcock was
not satisfied with any of the films he made after Psycho.""

Kim Novak was famously not the first choice for her roles in Vertigo, a fact Hitchcock frequently advertised. However, she was also not a last-minute decision; Hitchcock had considered her for The Trouble with Harry, and Paramount, agent Lew Wasserman, and Jimmy Stewart were interested in her for Vertigo from the start. Her loan-out from Columbia would end up costing $250,000 and Stewart's participation in a Columbia production. She was never a self-confidant actress; pressed into the business without any acting experience in 1954 and under the control of tyrannical and crass Columbia Head Harry Cohn, Novak was never really allowed any of the comforts stars typically receive. Her salary was so terrible she had to raid Rita Hayworth's old wardrobe for public appearances; She received a meager $750/week for Vertigo, while Cohn pocketed the difference from the $2,500 checks meant for her. Unwilling to become another Monroe-copy, she tended toward dramatic roles to expand her talent. She approached Vertigo from the beginning as a psychologically complex role, press clippings note her pouring over books on dual personalities. After Vertigo's failure, she would lament it had all been for nothing. Of the 4, it's fair to say that Vertigo's flop probably affected her the most. The critical dismissal, combined with Hitchcock's public statements against her, can't have helped an already delicate personality. With Cohn's death in 1958, the guiding hand of her career was gone and after a series of bad roles, she would famously leave Hollywood in the '60s, unwilling to maintain her actress persona. It is unknown how a successful Vertigo might have changed her career, a critically acclaimed performance might have given her more legitimacy and staying power, or at least silenced Hitchcock. In an ironic twist though, she has been the only survivor to bask in Vertigo's resurgence. As I type this, she has just been announced as the 2013 Cannes Festival's Guest of Honor.
___
**The Greatest Film of All Time**
___
Unfortunately, any mention of Vertigo nowadays has to deal with the Sight &amp; Sound poll. In 2002 it was only 5 votes behind Citizen Kane, and the only film that realistically had a chance to dethrone it in 2012. I'll be frank, saying the Sight &amp; Sound poll is the most legitimate is the same to me as calling someone the most honest lawyer, they may be true statements, but they still ring rather hollow. For my part, Vertigo is my personal #1, but I'd never call it ""the greatest of all time"", because such a film cannot by definition ever exist. In fact I'll go even further and say that every single film on the Sight &amp; Sound poll is overrated by default, and those that would base their movie tastes on a poll should sorely reconsider.

I'm often asked why I love Vertigo so much, and the answer quite frankly is illusive to me. If I fully understood what makes Vertigo so emotionally resonant, I'd be making films, not watching them. Perhaps this is the only way I can explain: I have a very bad habit of overwatching the films I like to death. Sometimes this results in me being unable to watch them again, other films I have to ration to preserve their impact. They've simply become clichés in my brain, so that I'm unconsciously anticipating lines and scenes and generally ruining the whole experience.

In the case of Vertigo however, it's resisted such abuse. In fact, as I grow older, and hopefully more mature, its power seems as undeniable as ever. This is despite being by far my most rewatched film (the first time I borrowed the DVD, I saw Vertigo twice everyday for 2 weeks; I was 13, 10 years ago). Every time I view Vertigo, I ask myself, ""Am I really going to fall for this crazy murder scheme, am I finally going to see that Jimmy Stewart is too old, Kim Novak can't act, and the whole thing is really just a Bernard Herrmann music video?"" And the answer is an emphatic no, every time. I'll never claim it's the perfect movie (that also doesn't exist), but to me its imperfections can be ironically compared to another tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Any architect could state that the whole thing is an engineering fiasco, but if any architect were to try and correct it, they'd be run out of town. Its very imperfections have made it an indelible work of art. It gives me shivers every time I watch it.

The film represents itself as a true battle for Middle-Earth, a battle where good faces off against evil to determine the fate of the entire world. The scope in which Gandalf, Galadriel, Aragorn, and Frodo discuss the War of The Ring and its consequences are huge. Even Merry touches on how the events taking place should rightly touch all of Middle-Earth's inhabitants when he tries to persuade treebeard to fight against Isengard by saying ""But you're a part of this world!""

This broad scope is contrasted with the narrowness at which the world is portrayed to us on the screen. When we first see Edoras, the seat from which King Theodrin rules Rohan, it looks like nothing more than a dozen or so houses on a hill surrounded by nothing but grasslands. It's supposed to be a city, a capital of one of the two nations of men that are left in this world, but based on how many people show up to Helms Deep from there at the end of the film, there cannot be more than a few hundred inhabitants. The same is true of Isengard; a massive tower housing one of the most powerful wizards of the age. Yet, before we see Saruman turn it into an orc plan, it stood alone. Where are those who sought out his advice? Hell where are the rest of the people who live in the tower? Are we to assume that a powerful Maiar sweeps all the floors of his giant several hundred foot high castle? The same is true later in RotK. Minas Tirith just looks too...small to be the capital of the largest nation of men in Middle Earth.

But more problematic, is the sense that the people in these places do not have lives of their own outside of the story of the films. We do not see people selling goods, making things, or tending fields. In fact the only place in the film that actually has a sense of being a real place, is the Shire. Its the only place in the entire film series that we see such mundane things as a field of crops or a man doing something completely independent of the main characters, such as sweeping his yard.

Perhaps this is intentional? Perhaps it is an oversight. But I cannot help but think that whenever I'm watching these films that everywhere in the film world outside of the Shire just doesn't seem real.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_154m7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/154m7p/the_scope_of_the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy/,

First off, let me say that I'm by no means well educated in the ways of film and the well written commentary that is normally on this subreddit. But, since this is the internet, and I'd like to have a good discussion about it, I posted anyway.


Here's my underlying question: Am I missing something about David Lynch and his films (that he directed)? In my opinion, of the films I've seen of his (*Mullholland Drive, Dune, Blue Velvet, Eraserhead*), his films are erratic, confusing, poorly edited and difficult to emerse yourself into. It seems to me that the way he develops characters is very shallow. Take Blue Velvet for example - While I did enjoy Rosselini's character, the rest were so flat and bland - the girlfriend was predictable, Frank was one-dimensional and crazy without some back story, his 'gang' were traditional flunkies... Even the main character felt like he was simply floating through the events without an actually emotional experience.

Then we get to Dune. I loved the book. And while Frank Herbert's writing style is a little different, and I can see that Lynch tried to capture some of the stark and swift manner that Herbert uses, the movie again is poorly cast and badly written. The characters feel like they are cardboard cutouts with soundboxes. The special effects were laughable, even for 1984 when the film came out. Compare it to *A New Hope*, or *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

*Eraserhead*, I'll admit, I enjoyed, but mostly for the austerity of the concept, and the animatronics and puppetry, which I almost alway enjoy. However, the characters and dialogue again are stiff. Granted in this film it works well, and I feel like the success of this film was probably the reason why he got funding for the following ones, because, well, the rest sucked IMO.


So am I missing something? I don't mean to be too critical of the guy, because hey, I don't think that I could make a good movie, but I feel like he's super trumped up and over-rated. Am I alone in this? Is there some kind of perspective that I'm missing?

There are a lot of fanboys out there, and just as many who consider him a professional art thief (although Thomas Crown did that, and we loved him for it). Obviously, Tarantino's films have all been played in the key of his genre du jour.

The problem I have with critics' discussion of *Jackie Brown* is that it's described, and subsequently dismissed, as his ""blaxploitation effort,"" and it never seems to evolve past that in conversation. In fact, when it comes to talking about Tarantino as a writer/director, *Jackie Brown* rarely comes up. Why is that? Is it just because it's probably his least watched film? Probably. But given the source material (I have yet to see a bad Elmore Leonard adaptation), is this film more than that?

It basically says that unlike previous generations, millenials refuse to watch anything older than fifteen years. Even film students. This is because they view films as conversational fashion-pieces instead of works of art.

I was surprised at the overwhelming positive response on Joblo. I sympathize with the author's concerns--I love classic films and am sad that so many ignore them--but I find myself wondering when this magical time was that the mass public watched and revered 40+ year old films. Were all the young kids in the seventies adoring films from the 30s? Wouldn't it have been much more difficult to even access a wide variety of classics before home video and eventually Netflix? I'm only 23, so I'm genuinely ignorant about how consumption may have been different before my generation and thus when this golden period of widespread good taste could have existed.

That being said, the examples provided in the article certainly disturb me. Film students unable to sit through the Godfather? Seriously?

As it happens, I do believe there has been a general dumbing down of mainstream cinema, but I don't blame technology or the damned short-attention-spanned youth.

I love Pan's Labyrinth, and so do a lot of people. It's generally seen as a good film. But aside from that, I think del Toro's work is average at best and isn't equal to the praise he receives. I enjoyed both Hellboy films but, a few memorable scenes aside, they were pretty underwhelming. I've pretty much forgotten Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, which says it all; I like The Orphanage, but he neither directed, produced or wrote that; he co-wrote the screenplay for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (the less said about that, the better.)

But he did direct, produce and write Pan's Labyrinth. But has he created anything else of note? He wrote and directed Mimic - a good film, but nothing else. I like his design aesthetic and share his love of monsters, both of which are found throughout his filmography. But that's it. I'm a little concerned about Justice League Dark/Heaven Sent/Dark Universe now. Design can only take a film so far.

It seems as if the more creativity he's allowed, the better his output. So maybe rather than being overrated, he's stifled, which isn't much better.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1it7n2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1it7n2/pans_labyrinth_a_fluke/,

I'd seen it on lots of ""top ___ lists"" and seen everyone on reddit, and the internet at large adore it. 

But to be honest, I really didn't like it. Now don't come after me with pitchforks and torches, but I completely failed to see what *Pulp Fiction* had to offer that many other films, both before and after didn't. 

First, as a matter of complete personal opinion, I think John Travolta is a pretty bad actor. Quentin Tarantino, Tim Roth, and Harvey Keitel were all far better. Secondly, there was a lot of seemingly unrelated dialogue - I tried to analyze some of this for possible themes, but really I can't find any. Why does the foot massage conversation matter? Who cares about a burger? I've read that this is one of the things people like about this film, but, perhaps by my own ignorance, I don't understand why. And were there even themes in this movie, aside from ""people are all shit and only look out for themselves?"" And while the narrative structure was certainly interesting, it seemed overly long and even so some potentially ripe plot points, like when [Uma Thurman ODs] (/spoiler), seem brushed over. These are just a few of my initial reactions.

I'm not trying to say this is a bad movie or it's undeserving of it's accolades - I'm just trying to hear from all of you why it is so beloved. I'm very willing to admit that it's my own ignorance that clouds my opinion of this film, but I'd like to hear from all of you about why it's so great!

EDIT: Not sure why people are down voting this... As the sidebar says, don't ""Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them."" I'm just trying to understand points of view different than my own.

It's not the *greatest* film, but the distinction between the two concepts has been made clear in repeated discussions in this subreddit.

When I started becoming a very serious fan of film, I found myself noticing things about certain shots that I didn't notice before. I noticed interesting angles, good composition, strange ways in which a camera panned through a scene. I noticed when directors used boring static shots, and I realized why movies I had found dull before failed.

I'm no film student, so sorry if I just butchered something trying to say that.

When I watched The Truman Show, again, with a more serious love of film, I found that shots... were boring! For those of you who do not know, The Truman Show is a movie about a man whose entire life has been secretly broadcast as a television program. He lives on a island-sized ""studio"", and his life was recorded with hidden cameras.

Anyway... shots. Boring. Why did I still love this film?

Specific instances include this one car scene, which is supposed to very thrilling (the music, composed by Philip Glass, pounds adventurous, tense music). Yet it is mostly conveyed through shots such as [this](http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/XsFilms/SnelPlaatjes/Truman18EscapeCar.jpg). A little hidden camera, possibly on his rear-view mirror.

Arguably one of the most emotional scenes in the movie, Truman's reunion with his long-lost father, is shot like [this](http://s.mcstatic.com/thumb/6277456/17922729/4/flash_player/0/1/the_truman_show_father_son_reunion.jpg?v=2)

It sure aint as great a shot as [this](http://www.amovieaweek.com/images/clip_image003_0000.jpg). It's ridiculously far from it.

Why does The Truman Show work so well though (barring the great performances and epic [kinda cheesy, but still epic] tale)?

The answer obvious. The shots are like that in an ironic way. And not the hipster kind of ironic either, the ironic that *means* something to the story. Taking the scene with the father into consideration, the grainy footage ([Here's another image](http://cdn5.movieclips.com/paramount/t/the-truman-show-1998/0535258_20091_MC_Tx360.jpg)) makes us feel... as though the person presenting us to this is being perverse. They are being nosy and intrusive... the shot *itself* is nosy and intrusive! Look how grainy and uncinematic that looks. *We shouldn't be seeing this*.

Now when I said ""ironic"" I meant it. This scene has different forms of irony in it. It has dramatic irony, because the father is telling things to Truman that Truman believes, but we the audience know that the lines are being fed to him. It has a meta sort of situational irony, because you wouldn't expect the most emotional scene in the movie to be shot in such a... well, shitty and anticlimactic way. This, and the feeling of perversion described above ties in to the point of the movie. The director, played by [Ed Harris](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsH/7499-24033.gif) is doing something that he feels is art, that he feels is necessary and beautiful, is actually extermely perverse. Knowing what Truman doesn't know, that his [wife](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U1QnACtNZMM/UDTgQHFslkI/AAAAAAAAAA8/vYNN3Ro9_dY/s320/TrumanWife.jpg), his [best friend](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsE/20238-24033.gif)... even his [MOTHER](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsT/16924-24033.gif) are all being fed lines for the sake of ratings... we are meant to be *disgusted*. 

This goes back to the shot. That shot with the father? ""We shouldn't be seeing this""? 

It's strange how purposefully making your shots look crappy was the best decision for this movie. It fits the narrative, it gives the movie a unique style, and the emotions that you feel because of it resonate with the main themes (which are a bit heavy handed, I admit. If the movie weren't so brilliant in every other regard, it would definitely be one of those movies where you just go ""Christ,  I get it, exploiting and deceiving people is bad; television and entertainment media are headed in a dangerous direction"").

I just thought of another reason! When Truman finally escapes the studio, the shots become very beautiful. When compared to how lifeless and ""TV"" the rest of the movie's shots were, they feel *incredible*. You really feel the escape. This leads to what is, to me, some of the most [evocative imagery](http://www.urantiansojourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the-truman-show.jpg) I have ever seen in a movie.

So, that's it. I guess the point of this post was to talk about the way a movie is shot should always be in service to the story. A lot of times, I feel that directors actually do the opposite... bend the story to get the awesome shots *cough* Roland Emmerich *cough*.

The story is what gives us the emotional connection! Bending it weakens that experience. 

I suppose that you could apply this thinking to found-footage films. A lot of people rag on the style. I feel like early attempts such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield didn't work for *practical* reasons... it was hard for audiences to understand what was going on and it actually made us nauseous. Recent attempts, such as Chronicle, have proven that the style *can* be successful.

How do you feel /r/Truefilm? Is it always necessary to strive for well-composed shots, even if it doesn't enrich the story? Do you still hate found footage? Do you love The Truman Show as much as I do?

1368745021.0,89,self.TrueFilm,1ehcwk,So what did you take from Mulholland Dr.?,103,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ehcwk/so_what_did_you_take_from_mulholland_dr/,"So, first off Definitely wouldn't have gone with Mulholland Dr. as a first Lynch movie (after his more accessible movies, namely Wild at Heart) if I knew better, but GOD did that blow my mind. Jumping back and forth through several intertwining stories, each with their own distinguishable similarities, no matter how subtle, surrealist qualities which don't make any sense whatsoever at first glance. I had to pause about 3 times throughout the movie just to sit and gather what I had actually just witnessed and think about for a moment.


What I conclude from it is that I find it a narrative of the burdens of the cliche ""Hollywood lifestyle"" and the viewpoint of a delusional failed actress, who while came to Los Angeles with high hopes, ultimately failed and whose aspirations turned into nothing but that. 


The amnesiac, who is named ""Rita"" throughout the first 3/4 of the film (which she got through looking at a poster of Rita Hayworth) is nothing but a caricature of someone Betty despises. The gleaming wife of the director (whose name I can't remember for the life of me, but is played by Justin Theroux) and the actor who ultimately got the main role in the film that Betty was attempting to land. She formed this fictional character in a delusion, fueled by envy. She formed her as a down on her luck person who had no idea where she was, and needed guidance (because of her amnesia).


While the movie progresses, you will see how this conclusion makes more and more sense, especially since it's somewhat implied in act III, where out of NOWHERE, the film completely changes direction. When I say out of nowhere, I mean it. Seriously spontaneous. Plus, in the last 10 minutes, a scene is shown where a scene from the very beginning (two men, completely unrelated are sitting and eating in a diner), and a waitress accidentally drops several dishes, she bends down to clean and her nametag shows ""Betty"". Coincidence? I think not. This is the real Betty. Nothing more than a waitress which no one will remember, and matters not to anybody in the diner, for more than a mere 10 minutes. 


The omniscient blue box though, I have absolutely no idea what that signifies. Maybe the key represents how to ""unlock"" this stardom, and the box represents the actual stardom. And the ""monster"" in the beginning which attacked the man in the beginning represents the overpowering dread of realization that you will not attain the fame and fortune, since it was Rita, who had placed the box in the belongings of the creature. Or perhaps the box is the ultimate home of our aspiring actress. The key is the fame that would have saved her from being locked in that box, and the monster is the failed homeless person she will end up, and the man who gets killed by it in the beginning signifies her dreams. Dead.


All in all, it was an incredible, harrowing, brilliant, polarizing, terrifying, surreal masterpiece. I truly wish more would take as many chances, and try to be as original and creative as Lynch is. He is really one of a kind, and this is why he remains my biggest inspirations. Film-wise, and philosophically.

Oh, and sorry if it's a bit rambling, I kind of took one shot on it.

Next on my list is Inland Empire, and after that I will have completed Lynch's filmography, including his shorts and dumbland.

1342002501.0,87,self.TrueFilm,wdnle,Thoughts on Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love ,95,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/wdnle/thoughts_on_paul_thomas_andersons_punchdrunk_love/,"With the lead up to PTA's new film, I felt it necessary to go over his past works and influences as I wait. Landing in between Magnolia and There Will Be Blood, Punch-Drunk Love seems to live in the shadows of two larger and more epic pieces. However upon re-watching it I found a great deal of subtly and thematic development that arguably rivals PTA's other works in merit. What sets PDL aside from PTA's surrounding films (Magnolia and There Will Be Blood) is it's smaller scope; it's a simple love story. However what this simple story and setting allows for is a great deal of thematic development. PTA let a few very simple symbols: colors, music, communication, and travel, to speak very profoundly for the film. So I figured I'd share some of my thoughts on this underrated picture. 

The very first shot in the film is of Barry Egan in his workspace. The first thing to take note of here is the color blue; Barry is dressed in an unusual but defining blue suit that seemingly matches and fades into the surrounding walls. Here we are introduced to the character and 'his color'. Why this is important is that it already tells somewhat about Barry before he's done or said anything. He hides away in his work and tries to blend in to a strange and poor fashion.  

The blue is soon accompanied by a new color; red, representative of Lena. Lena is seen through out the entire film wearing red, with exception to two scenes. This use of red goes beyond just her wearing it and becomes part of key objects hiding in certain shots. When Barry is scouring the grocery store looking for the best deal on Frequent Flyer he mutters ""What am I looking for?"", while an inconspicuous red figure is floating at the other end of the aisle. This very subtle, almost subliminal, placement of red alludes to love coming to Barry (despite his obliviousness to it, spending the rest of the night on a sex-line [possibly implying that people overlook love and go for sex]). Although Lena is represented by red, her next appearance she is seen wearing purple. In this scene, she begins the courting process and seemingly reaches over towards the blue, thus the reasoning in wearing a color that's a mix of blue and red. She wants to meet and get involved Barry, a closer color to him may make him more comfortable about it. While driving home from their date, the entire shot has an overtone of blue on it. It represents Barry beginning to open up a bit and starting to find love and happiness.  

From here Barry must go after Lena to find his happiness, so he's constantly chasing red. When he's running out of his work to go to Hawaii, a red moving truck (travel becomes another important signal too) is taking off just behind him. When he's on his way to his flight he eagerly walks up to two flight attendants dressed in red. Even while running away from the Utah brothers, he runs in the direction that a [red arrow](http://cineprism.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/jumping_red-arrow.jpeg) points him in. When he arrives in Hawaii he and Lena connect and with flashes of blue lens flare, they make their way back to her hotel room. In the next scene we see both of them wearing different clothing than usual. Lena is in a white shirt and pink pajamas, a lighter more happy and uplifted version than her usual red. She's in a better place now that Barry is with her, something important in showing this isn't just a one sided relationship. Barry, for the first and only time isn't wearing his suit, he's wearing a clean white bathrobe. He finally feels clean an no need to hide himself to Lena, he lets her know that he came to Hawaii just for her.  

The lens flares found in the scene just prior to the aforementioned scene, almost acts as Barry's emanating moods. At some points they are mere flashes, and better times they're very rich in a blue color. The one scene in which Barry tells off D&amp;D Mattress Man, shows his blue light emanating through to the end of the phone call. It all comes to a head when Mattress Man looses it and tells him he's dead, when the light is shifted from blue to purple. This shift to purple acts as the power of Lena but more likely love coming into Barry's newfound confidence (as he says ""the love of the woman makes more powerful than anything""), along with showing Mattress Man's breaking of confidence by Barry's love. The blue flares come in again with the face-to-face confrontation with Mattress Man when Barry finally stands up for himself, then again with Lena right afterwards when he brings the Harmonium to her place and to explain everything. The use of color becomes a very strong technique that conveys emotions and feelings that can't really be done with dialogue or acting. 

Another hidden meaning within the film is the aspect of 'Travel'. Barry's journey begins with him picking up a harmonium from the side of the street. In the the jump cut to him running back to his office with the piano, it's done with a moving truck blaring past the shot. This marks the beginning of love arriving in Barry's world. The next time we see this moving truck, it's on Barry and Lena's first date. Only this time, driving at a very relaxed pace, reflecting a more calmed state of mind as from before. What travel comes to represent in the film is dating and relationships. Barry, like many people just simply don't travel. They find no reason to or nowhere to go, such as with relationships. However Barry, through his pudding frequent flyer miles, comes up with a way to travel. Unfortunately he has nowhere or reason to go; even when Lena asks him why he's saving it he says he doesn't know. With Lena it's the opposite, she ""....travels a lot..."" Not really a way to say she's loose, but she's done the dating thing and has even been married once, in a way she's well traveled. What's interesting is thought she's traveled a lot, she tells Barry she wants to go home with him when they get back. In a sense, she wants to settle down and this relationship to go the distance.  

For Barry at the time he's already comfortable, but before on the way to Hawaii he's nervous and excited about his first ever time on an airplane. He asks multiple questions about every single sound happening has the plane is about to take off. His first time really traveling gives him something he wants and knows he needs. This is shown at the end when he rushes to Lena's to profess his love. However everything he talks about with her is related to travel and how he want's to travel with her where ever she has to go, and furthermore he has tons of Frequent Flyer miles saved up that he can redeem. In a simpler sense, he wants to be with her and he's got a lot of love to give. 

The strongest of all symbolism that I find in Punch-Drunk Love is the use of music. In the opening of the film, a harmonium is dropped on the road outside Barry's work. At first Barry shakes his in reluctance and tries to ignore it, but after Lena arrives moments later she pushes the issue by speculating about it. Here there's a parallel happening with the Harmonium and Lena, each of them show up in Barry's life with Lena pretending to need car repairs just to see Barry (strangely enough she somewhat gets him to take in the Harmonium too). Several things happen when Barry first plays the Harmonium, a light slowly reveals his face, and the main theme of the score begin playing. With Luis Guzman's character's arrival, he asks Barry what is it and where did it come from; to which Barry simple replies ""I don't know"". The same with falling in love.  

The score in Punch-Drunk Love almost more than background music, it almost acts as Barry's emotion and mind. An awkward rhythmic assembly of pings and pangs of cymbals and strange sounds that connect with Barry's strange demeanor. What's even better is how every so often when Barry plays the harmonium he plays out the first few notes of the main them with the score. Actually, whenever it seems Barry is uncomfortable or upset, he goes to the Harmonium for comfort. When his sister arrives at the shop with Lena, after the sex line call he fixes the harmonium before canceling his credit card, after punching the wall he plays a few notes. The harmonium is something he doesn't know how to play yet but he knows it brings him joy and comfort, a reflection of his love life.  

While on their date, Lena asks Barry if he stole the Harmonium from street. Barry seems unsure but Lena reassures him that it's his now, and asks him if he's going to ""play it"". This is a very important question for Barry at this moment; he has Lena and the Harmonium, but what is going to come of it. The question is reflects the ideal of simply acquiring the necessary pieces isn't enough; both music and a relationship require constant care, or 'practice'. Barry doesn't seem to know very much about piano or music, and it comes across when he's playing out little note groupings of the main theme. However as the film comes to a close and Lena comes to meet him at his work, we find Barry beginning to sit down at the Harmonium and playing with two hands and in sync with the score of the film; a reflection of where he's come to in his love life. Music is an expressive language, it conveys emotions on very base and raw level; as such it can convey things words can't. Barry's character has trouble controlling some of his base emotions (anger, sadness, love) but with music and Lena he slowly comes to control those emotions. 

What I love about this film is not there's a ton of thematic symbolism, but is how PTA developed all of it over a relatively simple story. His original intentions were to do a traditional Romantic Comedy (in a nice change of pace from Magnolia and a reaction to [cookie cutter rom-coms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL840D1296F145C005&amp;v=1BM_wyZ-u_Q&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=307s)), but in doing so he brought it up to another level. Not just with the film genre, but I feel PTA's filmmaking hit a huge improvement upon an already amazing ability. With Boogie Nights, he gave a tone to story telling and narrative unseen in mainstream film. Magnolia did the same but stayed serious the whole time, however it is arguably verbose in terms of it's massive story. Punch-Drunk Love stopped and sized everything down and started off small and simple, then seemingly let itself grow in themes and meaning. As There Will Be Blood is tale of the lonely journey to Godhood, it's only because Punch-Drunk Love turned a love story into an exploration of colors, journeying, and music. Richness and depth, from simplicity. 

This came out a lot longer than I had planned, but I'd love to hear what you guys think about the film and some of the points here or ones what you've observed from it.

I don't necessarily agree with the notion of a film having one singular meaning, but it was a nice way for me to bring up *The Social Network*, and how it plays with the Unreliable Narrator device seen in films like *Rashomon*. I'll repost that comment here:

____________________________________

Throughout the film we are presented with several unreliable narrators presenting their testimony during the depositions. This is especially brought to light by Rashida Jones exchange with Mark at the end:

&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: I'm not a bad guy. 

&gt;Marylin Delpy: I know that. When there's emotional testimony, I assume that 85% of it is exaggeration. 

&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: And the other fifteen? 

&gt;Marylin Delpy: Perjury. Creation myths need a Devil. 

Before I go any further, for those who don't know: An unreliable narrator is a device for a narrative in which a character describes events on screen that may or may not be happening, and might be obscuring the truth of the situation. This is a popular device in films like *Rashomon*, where we're not meant to get the whole truth.

Essentially the film is framed by these depositions. We see events happening as characters describe them. Basically, unless it happens in the deposition room, or we get documentation supporting the scenes, we can't assume they really happened like people said they did.

If you can notice them, a lot of the information we get doesn't match. We don't know fully if the Winklevoss twins truly hired Zuckerberg to create an exact replica of what Facebook became, and if it was, is Zuckerberg even responsible?

And what about Eduardo? Why was he ejected from the company? Was it because of Sean? Was it because he made a financial threat to the company because he felt he was being left out? Was it because of Mark's jealousy that Eduardo got into the club, and would also be a part of a huge growing company, thus still being more successful than him? **Why?**

It is because this entire film is the trial Mark Zuckerberg never got. And we are the jury. The film ends with him at his computer trying to get a friend request approved from Erica, the girl from the beginning of the movie. But in this case she's not anyone specifically, she's everyone. Everyone Zuckerberg ever wronged. Including you and me. And he's sitting there at the computer, waiting for the friend request.

And he'll sit there and wait. An approval would mean forgiveness, and decline would mean that he doesn't deserve forgiveness. It's up to you though: Do you **approve** of Zuckerberg based on the information given to you (that may or may not be false) or do you think he can go shove it?
___________________________________


With that out of the way, I'd like to hear some references to other films that feature this device as important to its overall story, and how it serves it. I'd also like to hear what you think about the device itself, and whether you think it is a cheap ploy by filmmakers, or if there are some merits to it.

Personally, I love the way it plays on the obscurity of truth, and how what we see on camera, while seemingly real, isn't always true. I feel it also brings to light how characters see the world and tells us so much about them by what we're shown, rather than merely told.

That being said, I also feel there are films that play with this as some kind of cheap trick, thus saturating the effect. How do you feel?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_186xax,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/186xax/the_unreliable_narrator_films_that_feature_them/,

Their complaints mainly centered around other people's responses to the film, that it was overrated and not as intelligent or ""trippy"" as people acted like it was.  Of course, you're entitled to your own opinion, and there's no accounting for personal taste.  I'm even inclined to agree with the naysayers to a certain extent.  But I also feel they are missing the point.

I like Christopher Nolan a lot as a director.  He can tell a good story and shoot a gripping action scene.  I admire that he tries to use as little CGI as possible.  But I feel his real talent lies in accessibility.  Just as Rush blend the musical complexity of progressive rock with loud, fun hard rock, Nolan has been able to make interesting cinematic concepts into blockbusters.  

True, *Inception* is no *Naked Lunch,* but would you rather have people go out and see Michael Bay's latest shit-tastic CGI disaster (a false dichotomy, I know, but you get my point)?  Nolan was able to get a sizable portion of the mainstream American moviegoing public to see something they hadn't seen a million times before.  He got people to try to interpret and discuss the film, and made them excited to do so.  Shouldn't it be commendable that a film that raked in almost $300 million in the US alone inspired people to think about what they were watching for 5 fucking minutes?

What do you think [/r/TrueFilm](/r/TrueFilm)?  Am I a snobby, condescending, elitist, prick who doesn't give the average filmgoer enough credit, or is there value in trying to package new and interesting ideas in a way that appeals to a mainstream audience, even if the end result isn't quite as intelligent as it could have been?

*This is an examination of a film I have not previously watched. Weeks prior to viewing the Coen Brothers’ Barton Fink, I indulged in Miguel De Cervantes’ Don Quixote. The book depicts an aged man wishing to live the very fiction he adores—that of a renowned knight. This struck me, as Barton Fink depicts a writer wishing to escape extravagant fiction. However, his reality still manifests as fiction, distorted by horrific delusions and violent attitudes. In an effort to be as real as possible, the writer stumbles into the surreal.*

The opening shot ushers in descent, theatre rope pulleys maneuvering our view onto a stage—here, Mr. Fink’s production is in motion before an enraptured audience. His face contorts with feelings we must dissect—is this adoration for his characters? Perhaps, dissatisfaction or fear.

Three key questions are presented, unbeknownst to first-time viewers:

**Where is the Common Man found?**

**What are the untold stories?**

**Will a writer write an escape from reality or instead the Common Reality?**

In the eyes, brow, and mouth, we see Mr. Fink’s entanglement with these questions. A dinner party follows the play’s ending (note: how the film begins with the fictional end.) Friends-of-friends compliment the “greatness” of the production, even the playwright’s genius. But Mr. Fink expresses his own inner-critique—the play is simply not good enough.

A crash of ocean waves begins the next scene. In contrast to the dinner party’s elegance, this is a startling transition. Nature crashes louder than all of humankind’s efforts. Mr. Fink strives to match that sound, such immensity. He yearns to change the very foundation of theatre, seeking what he terms “real success,” not simply financial betterment.

Urged by a fellow colleague, a deal has been offered for Mr. Fink to work in Hollywood. The hotel he arrives at is grand but vacant. The key-hooks behind the front desk rise high, beyond the film’s frame. The hotel leger is a massive tome. Corridors stretch far off-screen. This is a large-scale environment, rather hollow and empty for Mr. Fink. We sense the Disconnect, his dissociation from these unfamiliar surroundings. The writer wonders, where and how will inspiration occur?

Despite a steep weekly rent, his allocated space is modest. The windows stick. The bed creaks. He sets his briefcase upon the bed (note: how deep the briefcase sinks into the mattress—a weak bed or a weighty item? It carries his typewriter, a heavy device through which he transmits pain.)

He sits before his Underwood. By the look on his face and our knowledge of its potential “for success,” this is an old friend. He has returned. Beside it, a notepad courteously provided by the hotel reads, “A DAY OR A LIFETIME.” Above it, a painting hangs of a woman staring at the sea, relaxed on a shorefront. The ocean crashes, frozen.

Mr. Fink lies in bed that night, staring upward. He goes to the trouble of putting on his glasses to examine the peeled, scarred ceiling. These are writer-quirks, studying insignificant details so as to understand their significance.

The following day, a man of Hollywood named Mr. Lipnick calls for Mr. Fink. They wish for Mr. Fink to produce a script for a wrestling picture, a standard B-flick. The office of Mr. Lipnick is as you would imagine. And the statues blurred behind, just over Mr. Fink’s shoulder, are of two Greek-looking men bearing the globe upon their shoulders separately. Is this the pressure he feels? Is the pressure self-imposed or expected of him?

    “We don’t need to tackle the world this time around.”

    “We need it to have that Barton Fink Feeling.”

    “We’re all expecting great things.”

    —Mr. Lipnick

Mr. Fink is now in his room, typing:

    “FADE IN

    A tenement building on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is audible.”

He seems displeased, editing the period into a comma, continuing the sentence. This pleases him. But we do not see the modified sentence at this moment, as the scene is interrupted with a man crying through the wall next door.

Through a short sequence of events, the crying man is now sitting in Mr. Fink’s room, apologizing for interrupting his work. This is Charlie, a burly man, a “common man.”

Where is the Common Man found? Here, next door. This is the man Mr. Fink wishes to write about. Mr. Fink detests the plays of kings and fantastical myths. He wants theatre to embrace the pain of reality. He wants fiction to mirror what he sees and feels as truth. Charlie likes this.

Mr. Fink is contradictory in his behavior, hesitant to have a conversation. He does not want Charlie in his room. He would rather write. While Mr. Fink could learn from his neighbor, he is instead preoccupied with how to escape this encounter. Ironically, Charlie apologizes to him for the commotion. But Mr. Fink owes an apology for assuming his work is more important than those suffering around him. How can he properly write of pain when he assumes he is above it? This is the common dilemma of the writer and the introvert. He wishes to write for the people with whom he wants nothing to do with.

    Charlie says, “And I could tell you some stories.”

    Barton exclaims, “Sure you could!”

What are the untold stories? The writer writes of the common man, but who is telling the story—the writer or the people he observes? While it was Charlie who came over to converse with Mr. Fink, it is actually Mr. Fink who does all the talking. He spouts off about theatre and how it wrongly glorifies the high-and-mighty men, not the Common Man. And for a third time, before leaving, Charlie says, “I could tell you some stories.”

The typewriter is waiting for more. We now see the amended sentence:

    “Early morning traffic is audible, as is the cry of the fishmongers.”

Will a writer write an escape from reality or instead the Common Reality? This is reliant on the observation of a few key details, the first being how the film is shot. Many shots are close-ups of Mr. Fink, the other characters slightly blurred, the background our focus. It is filmed as if we are meant to subtly realize how self-absorbed he is, how a great deal of the film’s perception is stuck within the writer’s head.

    “You’re just a tourist with a typewriter. I live here, Bart.”

    —Charlie

Other key details are color and alcohol. The color white represents a blank palette, an absence of color—in this film it is an absence of reality. Characters who are not concerned with pain will often wear white, whereas, Mr. Fink dresses in more earthen shades of browns, greens, and yellows. This color scheme is also true for their environments. Mr. Lipnick’s office is white, and Mr. Fink’s hotel room is dark, more associated with the Common Man. The handling of alcohol in this film is used primarily for diluting pain. Anyone who drinks is suffering. It is only after the film’s momentous and violent turn-around that Mr. Fink swallows a whole glass.

We read and entertain ourselves to escape the dullness of living. These people are upset, tortured. Even a famous writer whom Mr. Fink encounters, Mr. Mayhew, suffers as an alcoholic (note: how Mr. Mayhew believes writing comes from inner and outer peace, whereas, Mr. Fink believes writing comes from inner or outer pain.)

    Charlie says, “Can’t trade my head in for a new one.”

    Barton says, “Guess you’re stuck with the one you got.”

We are halfway through the film and Mr. Fink has only written those first few sentences. He is set to meet with Mr. Lipnick in less than twenty-four hours. He needs the whole three acts to his wrestling picture, unable to see the beginning, the middle, or the end (note: how we are in the film’s middle, just as unaware as he.) “You don’t have to write scenes,” a female friend of his says. But that is the easy part for Mr. Fink, and that is why he cannot understand the Common Man he wishes to write for. Everyday people find it difficult to get through their daily routine. For Fink, the day is easy. It is not the scenes that matter. What he is most concerned with is the overall structure, the acts, the meaning. But until Mr. Fink can appreciate the difficulty of each day for the Common Man, he will feel out-of-touch. He may dress and live like one but he does not yet feel like one.

    Barton says, “Where there is life, there is hope.”

    Charlie says, “See? You are a writer.”

The wallpaper of his hotel room peels, glue dripping, as the film’s denouement is realized. The plot is unraveling. The final act of the show occurs here in one violent sweep (I will not reveal how.) This act introduces the kind of pain that Mr. Fink needed. As a result, he finishes the script. He titles it. He turns it into Mr. Lipnick. But Hollywood has no use for this work, despite Mr. Fink believing it is the best work he has ever written. “I wanted to show you something beautiful,” he tells Mr. Lipnick. But any writer can offer that “Barton Fink” feeling. Whatever resides in his head is not special among the rest. Mr. Lipnick wanted what was good for Hollywood.

The ending is satisfactory because we are given the comfort that Mr. Fink learned from his pain. He apologized to the Common Man for his arrogance. He never sought to appease the color-absent executives. The film’s closing is left for pondering—Mr. Fink must better understand the struggle of the scene in order to tackle the overall meaning of his own living film.

    “I’ll show you the life of the mind! I’ll show you the life of the mind!
    I will show you the life of the mind!”

**Notes: I wrote this awhile ago, revised it. Wanted to hear what the people of TrueFilm thought.**

*[originally posted on my website, http://jjsmithcritic.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/barton-fink-1991/]*

**EDIT:** Thank you, everyone for your input so far. Also, for the general enjoyment of this examination.

**EDIT, 2:** In response to AFUTD (who commented, *""Questions: Any speculation on the murder, or on the contents of the package Charlie hands Barton before he leaves for New York will be greatly appreciated."")...

...I figured the contents of the package were much like the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. The package may have had some significance to the character giving it, or to the character receiving it, *or to the audience, or even to the film's writer(s).* The girl's severed head, perhaps? However, while that may fit, given all the details, it does not seem very satisfying. I assumed the content's ambiguity was more important than the contents themselves, *simply because Barton is left at the film's closing with a very ambiguous air about him.* He seems unsure, as the audience generally seems unsure, as we can see from the comments in this thread that many interpretations are perfectly feasible.

Ambiguity begets discovery. Barton is on the horizon of discovery, having achieved an honest work of art that satisfied himself, despite how Hollywood felt toward it.

...As for ""any speculation on the murder,"" my initial assumption was that, when the moment Barton awoke post-coitus, he entered a sort of vision, not necessarily a dream but a fantastical re-imagining of reality. (Note: as Barton and his lady friend are engaged in intercourse, the camera travels to the bathroom and runs down the drain, into the pipeline where moans are echoed. It's sort of like descending into another tale of fantasy, just as the film began with a descent into reality.) This interpretation holds up as the ending of the film centers with him sitting on a beach, the female stranger lying before him in the sand, mirroring the photo that hung above his typewriter (note: the photo hangs above the typewriter; why? For inspiration?) The film closes with him still sitting in his imagination, trying to think of what to write.

Once the murder occurs, many things go awry: Mayhew vanishes, Lipnick kisses Barton's feet; Charlie sets the building on fire and returns to his room after killing the government agents; and Barton walks into the very painting he admired. This is all rather fantastical and surreal.

However, I am not one for ""dream endings,"" unless we are talking of films like Brazil (Gilliam somehow manages to get away with elements that a typical Hollywood flick would be lambasted for.)

So my next assumption was that Barton had killed her and conveniently forgot, perhaps, in an effort to feel pain (remember: Barton believes writing comes from a place of inner pain. He needed to feel more in order to write more.)

However, this also did not sit well with me. Barton does not strike us as the killer-type. But Charlie does. And we're not even certain he is real (but if that is the case, then are the government workers real?)

Charlie does say to Barton later on, ""Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out."" This seems like an awfully strong indication that he murdered the girl.

The murder confounds me. The descent-into-the-pipeline transition strikes me as being vital to understanding the murder. I avoided from writing of this Act in the film, primarily because my initial intent was to highlight basic elements, themes, and details; secondly, I am not sure if there is a firm answer to any speculation on the murder. Its happening forces us into ambiguity, much like Barton being handed a mysterious package he has no intent of opening, just carrying around.

Perhaps, we are supposed to carry this film in our own heads, not to better understand it but to simply reflect on its themes and ponder over the most important perspective(s): rich man or common man? reality or fantasy? peace or pain?

*“I’ll show you the life of the mind! I’ll show you the life of the mind! I will show you the life of the mind!”*

**EDIT, 3:** CoopDaddy made an intriguing point:

    Also the action of the film is set during the onset of America's involvement in WWII.
    Pearl Harbor actually happens and Fink seems to make no mention of it,
    demonstrating how self involved and introverted he has actually become.

Reality goes on without Barton Fink.

**EDIT, 4:** Thanks to everyone who commented, as well as piperson, I found fitting closure (personally, at least.) There is no ""straight fiction"" or ""straight reality."" Barton's vision of ""real theatre"" is as much fantastical as any other. And Barton's striving for absolute reality forced him into absolute fantasy.

1365642245.0,82,self.TrueFilm,1c3re4,Network (1976) Let's Discuss...,97,15,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1c3re4/network_1976_lets_discuss/,"The story of a mad prophet in the modern world and everyone around him trying to 
make a quick buck. 

Firstly I'd like to say Sydney Lumet does a fantastic job with directing, all of the actor are excellent, the cinematography is great, and he harnesses, what I'm sure would been a long and rambling script, and uses it to it's maximum potential.


IMO what makes this movie fantastic is the string of monologues throughout the movie that make the movie come to life. You can feel the movie screaming at you. This type of movie comes along every once in a while awhile and seems obligatory. Modern day equivalents would be God Bless America, and the HBO show Newsroom, which is basically a remake of this movie. However there's something about Network that just sets it apart. Where Newsroom come across preachy Network comes across earnest and relate able. To me the difference lies in the characters, this is something a lot of indie films, or any film for the matter, get wrong. All of the characters in Network are very well developed, they all have personalities and you are able to understand and connect with them before the movie goes into high gear. Every character has a unique voice nothing is dishonest which helps your suspension of disbelief and prevents you from feeling the movie is trying to teach you something. This is where the success of the movie lies, it so easily could have turned into a rambling, preachy, train wreck of a movie in the wrong hands. 


As far as getting a message across goes I've always preferred this method. With the exception of the abstract, I feel that a movie's characters should operate the theme/message rather than the the characters only existing to serve the theme. It means the film can be enjoyed from a story/character point of view as well as a thematic point of view; only a thematic line will impede enjoyment unless you invest time into the movie which you might not want to if it's a chore to watch. Directors like the Coen brothers and Billy Wilder do this well while later Kubrick films tread the line if not cross it (especially Eyes Wide Shut, even though a have a weird fondness for that movie). 


**So what did you guys think of Network?** 

Personally I thought the last shot, where there are four screens, was just perfect. The way there was always and ad playing at the same time as the resolution is explained through a news broadcast put a fantastic foot note on the end of the film, a subtle comment on how impersonal everything is and how business and products saturate everything. I also loved the monologue near the end delivered by the business executive 
to Beale, it reaffirms the ideology of the movie only in a fresh way, from the perspective of someone who accepts it. If I have one major gripe with the movie it's that The decision to kill Howard Beale goes by too fast and is anti-climactic, no one is even slightly fazed. 
But hey, maybe that's the point.

Vincent is born as a certain class with certain expectations, and is thus seen as having potential limited use within society from birth. He has to fight to prove himself to be seen as relevant by the ruling elite, to have access to the tools of success. He has to pretend to be something else to be accepted in to the society of 'genetic superiors'. I see this film as a film about class struggle with the idea of genetic manipulation as a metaphor for the above statement.

1363642834.0,80,self.TrueFilm,1ajth3,"Never posted to /r/truefilm before. Was looking for some discussion on a difficult-to-watch film today. Posted this in r/movies and got downvoted with a single comment reading, ""tl/dr"" so I thought I'd give truefilm a try. The movie? Compliance (2012)",117,37,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ajth3/never_posted_to_rtruefilm_before_was_looking_for/,"I watched Compliance last night.

For those of you who don't know, Compliance is a film that came out last year based on true events. It revolves around a fast food manager who is tricked by a prank caller claiming to be a police officer into detaining a young female employee because she is told she is accessory to a theft and major drug crime. Under the false knowledge the manager ends up strip searching the employee and that's only the beginning of the horror.

I watched this movie after seeing it in a few of those ""Cringeworthy movies"" threads or the ""Good movies you will never watch again"" I was ready for it to get really messed up, and it was, but I thought it was nice that this movie focused on telling the story and not shocking the audience. I mean, yes, it was a very shocking movie. But they showed a lot less than some filmmakers might have and it gave a respectful tone to the film rather than seemingly being made to shock it seemed like it was more made to raise awareness of the weakness of people, the seemingly unprovoked evil of some, and the dynamics of authority.
What hit me hard about this movie was simply the fact that it's a true story. This was happening in the 90's and early 2000's and this movie is not only based off of those events, but it is a dramatic retelling of the particular case that got on to national news. It was also the furthest the prank ever went, with the caller eventually [Spoiler](/s ""ordering the manager's fiance to spank her while she is naked as punishment for disobeying as well as giving him a blowjob as a reward for dealing with her."") It's a movie that would hold absolutely no water if it weren't true, it would be considered too ridiculous. The events are bizarre and falls under the so weird it has to be true genre.

The characters were really well set up in this movie. While the prank call starts only about 10-15 minutes into the movie and lasts well over an hour, the first 10-15 minutes are not wasted. We see a 19-year-old girl talking about boys, obviously carefree and very impressionable and while I don't think anyone would disagree that she was the victim in this case, I found the manager to be a very compelling character. In the beginning we see so much about her in so little time. You can see that she doesn't hate Becky (the victim/employee) but she is very jealous of her ability to be wanted by young attractive men, and the juxtaposition of Sandra (the manager) being excited about being engaged to a middle aged redneck while Becky flippantly scrolls through pics young men send her really established their dynamic. I was only able to imagine how much it must suck being a middle aged manager of a fast food restaurant getting no respect from employees half your age and knowing they are going to leave that place to find their life while your life is that restaurant. Sandra's jealousy of Becky doesn't really come into play later, but it is a fascinating dynamic that I think added to the tension once Sandra was given true power over Becky by the caller. The scene where Becky pleaded for help, naked, to Sandra and Sandra yelled, ""Why are you talking to me!? Don't talk to me!"" was much more powerful with this relationship dynamic pretense.
Another thing I liked about this movie was the writing. It was very reminiscent of Hard Candy (another great movie you will surely enjoy if you liked Compliance, or are just really weird). It was very few characters in a single location dealing with a fucked up situation. The prank caller's dialogue was written so well it did a lot to keep this movie from ever getting boring. The whole time I was on the edge of my seat just wondering what this guy was going to make them do next. The dynamics between the pranker and the manager were incredible. He always kept control of the conversation, and even though you could hear him getting frustrated when people didn't do what he said he was very quick and always able to convince people what they were doing was for the best. It was interesting how all he had to do was gain the manager's trust and after that everyone took her word that he was a cop, even though it is established early on that the manager is easily the weakest person working there. (Established by her employees laughing while she was talking to them about leaving the freezer open, and also her super awkward and probably false confession that her fiance sexts her, it was obvious to me she only wanted to be liked and respected by Becky which is why she said that.)

Another interesting moment was at the very end when [Spoiler](/s ""the manager was being interviewed on 60 Minutes and her lawyer warned her not to answer a question. The interviewer was obviously annoyed with the restrictions and also obviously thought very lowly of the manager. She recognized this and all of a sudden changes the subject to where he is from and makes a joke about it. She used the same tactics as the prank caller to get the interviewer back on her side."") I thought this was really interesting, like she was using lessons she had learned from the despicable prank caller to have the same kind of control over conversational flow as he did. The caller used simple polite conversation, some urgency, some simple information gathering (""Ah yes, Becky, we have Rebecca on the sheet.""/ ""I have your regional manager on the other line"") and some authority tactics that instantly make people more likely to do what you say (such as forcing everyone to call him ""sir"" and giving Becky ultimatums whenever he had to convince her to let someone do something to her.) It seemed that the manager was able to recognize all this only after she realized it was all a farce and she learned from it. Which was an interesting way to end the movie, showing that she had learned from her experience.
After watching the movie I looked into the actual events of this particular case and I was floored to see that it's pretty much all true and even was totally caught on tape. I think the detective towards the end summed it up pretty well, ""Wait, you're telling me this has happened more than once!?"" This was already shocking enough to know he succeeded this far this time, but to know it was only the last in a long string of successful pranks of the same nature was just frightening. Frightening to think how weak and unquestioning people in authority are, frightening to think how few people question their commands, and frightening to think that people are still so unaware how dangerous anonymity can be.

I also read some reviews of the film and it seems after its premiere at Sundance last year it caused a shouting match during the Q&amp;A because many people found the film exploitative with simple shocks. To me, this couldn't be farther from the truth. I thought the movie was pretty respectful. None of it was taken lightly at all. It was horrifying to watch and while the movie pulled no punches with what happened it did pull punches with what it showed. Some filmmakers may have been a lot more flippant about what to show. This movie, however, did not seem to exploit the sexual nature of the film in order to get some sort of weird sex appeal. It wasn't sexy when Becky got naked, it was an act of desperation and truly difficult to watch. The horrifying acts are framed just as that, horrifying. I don't think simply making a movie about this subject makes it shocking. Shocking, to me, is when a film uses shock material gratuitously. Like Pink Flamingos. That's a shocking movie, not only because we see a manwoman eat real dog shit and give her son a BJ, but because it has little place in the plot other than to shock us. Yes, the plot was a competition to see who was the most disgusting, but really that plot is just a way to show us the most disgusting shit we've ever seen. Not that I have anything against Pink Flamingos (actually a very important movie) but it always seems odd to me when people call movies like Compliance a shock film. Compliance was not made to shock you, it was made to shed light on real events and how people bend to authority or how they react to being given ultimate authority.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1ajth3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ajth3/never_posted_to_rtruefilm_before_was_looking_for/,

1356564499.0,79,self.TrueFilm,15hni3,"The Story of Film: An Odyssey -- A 15 hour documentary now on Netflix instant, in 15 episodes. I'd like to discuss it a little.",97,18,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15hni3/the_story_of_film_an_odyssey_a_15_hour/,"My knowledge of film has basically come from enjoying movies and watching a lot (especially recently). I have never taken a film history class, and only found this sub this summer.

Basically, direct experience has shaped my appreciation for film, not talking about it. That being said, I love learning about it when I come across information about it. I saw this documentary on the netflix instant streaming queue and thought I would give it a shot.

Coming from a point of being ignorant on the history and birth of film, I have learned an incredible amount from it so far, and I'm only on the 4th episode. I learned what a Big Black Mariah was, as well as how early projectors used technology borrowed from a sewing machine mechanism to advance a film real one roll at a time. I learned how different movements in film were influenced by notable directors, and writers, who shaped film into the idea most average movie goers would expect to have in their minds when they go to the movie theater. I learned a lot about how early film makers learned about what shots were going to work in film and what would make for a continuous experience for the viewer. All of this has been fantastic for me, and I'm eating it right up. I loved hearing the reasons for some of the movie maker's decisions when it came to shots, and how some accidents led to innovations in style, and insights. One such insight was Alfred Hitchcock's realization that the protestant church taught him how to prove the unprovable, in a sense, and by careful omission, would allow his characters to further their story by means that were unknowable to us, but went along with because of our imagination filling in the rest.

Some things that bugged me were his insistence on making some pretty outlandish and sometimes unnecessary claims. The one that comes to mind was claiming that Hitchcock left a greater legacy for visual arts than Picasso, then went on to prove his point with ""7 reasons"". The reasons were just kind of things he admired about Hitchcock, not the actual ""reasons"" I thought he would go into when he said it. It's a stylistic choice that throws me off, when I'm expecting to hear history, when instead get tossed an opinion. Its not usually something I enjoy hearing in a documentary, but I can look past it because even though they are his opinions, I enjoy hearing them. I don't often get a chance to hear educated opinions on film, so I listen and consider what he says, then move on.

The other thing is... his voice. I am totally an ignorant american, who has lived all of his life across the north and southwestern states, and I don't get to hear what I am hopefully guessing to be a ""Bellfast accent"" (I'm so ignorant to the point of being terrible for this) and his inflections are very different than what I am used to. That's not a criticism of the content as much as an expression of my level of concentration I have to keep while listening to his very soft and somewhat repetitive cadence, that makes it sound like everything he says is a question.

I would also like to add that sometimes he uses a few too many filler still shots of different things and to my uneducated eye sometimes looks like he is deliberately trying to show you, with his own collected footage, how to make some of the awkward framing decisions that he describes. Some of the editing decisions seem questionable, but it only happens every once in a while, and I can understand with 900 minutes of film that there will be rough points.

So aside from those things that don't overshadow the real heart of the content (in my opinion), the documentary has been able to teach me a great deal about the history of film, with lots of cross referencing, showing contemporary directors harking back to references to old films, and clips from hundreds of different films. I could go into more detail about what it entails, but that's what the documentary is for.

So what do you guys think is the value of this documentary, if you have seen it? Would you recommend it to someone else? 

What other documentaries would you recommend for learning about film and the people who make it? I am very interested in the artistic direction and development side of things, a little more so than the technical aspect of film innovation, but I am very interested in that as well.

Frankly, I'm amazed any executive thought it was a good idea to adapt a Victor Hugo novel and make it a movie for kids. I'm only vaguely familiar with the novel, and I haven't seen the silent film adaptation starring Lon Chaney (though it is on Netflix Watch Instant and I plan to watch it eventually), but it's very clear that Disney's HoND takes extreme liberties with the story. Characters live in the movie that die in the book, Quasimoto is deaf in the book but sings several musical numbers in the movie, and as far as I know there are no signing gargoyles voiced by Jason Alexander in other adaptations.

It's a tough movie to examine, because as a kids movie I'd say it's an outright failure (apart from an overall positive moral), but as a movie for serious adults it's very compelling, but then that compelling drama is undercut with attempts to please the target audience. Frollo is a wonderfully tragic and complex villain, arugably the best villian in a Disney film, but I can't imagine an 8 year old comprehending or even finding much to enjoy in a scene like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGL9B_TPTI) where Frollo wrestles with his lust for a Gypsie woman and his conflicting racism and zealotry. ""She will be mine or she will burn,"" Frollo sings. We're a long way from Hakuna Matata, kids. It's also worth examining how Disney does a much better job with this number than in a similar ballad ""Stars"" in Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"", which was also based on a Victor Hugo novel. The animators and performers take full advantage of the medium to convey the character's internal struggle, while Hooper merely sticks the camera in front of Crowe hoping we'll be amazed.

Disney tries their hardest to ""kiddie"" up what is an inherently dark and depressing story, and while they're occasionally successful (Kevin Kline and his animated horse are quite charming), often they end up just further highlighting the tragedy of the story. This is exemplified in a scene where, after being charmed by the heroine Esmarelda, Quasimodo's gargoyle friends sing a poppy number posing the idea that maybe he's got a shot with the girl, and that maybe she's sick of good looking guys and wants a guy like him. It's a fun song until you remember that these gargoyles are figures of his imagination and it's painfully clear that Quasimodo has ZERO chance with this girl.

Nevertheless, for all its tonal inconsistencies, it's still a very compelling film and one of the most engaging of the Disney Renaissance. It's hard to deny the talented songwriting and animation that went into a sequence [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEOFQAJAcss).   Other films of the age are more crowd pleasing like Hercules(1997) and Mulan(1998), and I'll always consider The Lion King to be Disney's masterpiece, but there's a beautiful ambition to The Hunchback of Notre Dame that makes it worth discussing and is also why it's often overlooked or forgotten.

---

Watching the movie I first thought it's going to be about the technological adcancement over time starting with primitive apes. These first few scenes made it clear, that this movie was about aesthetics and additionally they gave me the feeling I already had when watching ""A Clockwork Orange"": Sitting in a theater, not really watching a movie.

Going on when the *real plot* started I thought, that the movie will *just* be Kubrick envisioning what the future will be like in 2001(phoning with video, tablets, space flight), it changed completely when they started talking about faking an epidemic on on Calini and about something to be kept secret. In that scene I said to my father - because the suspense really killed me - ""I really want to know what's going on there!"", I think this feeling is not established that often.

Since I'm really tired and I still have questions to be written down I will try to skip a few things.

---

The music used in the movie was so well timed and always undermined the pictures, aswell as giving a bit of foresight to what might happen next.

* The Waltz was spot on for this feeling of weightlessnes in space, I imagine it to be.
* The chorus(Monolith scene) is one of the scariest things I have heard in my entire life and made me feel extremely uncomfortable, which is most probably why Kubrick picked it.
* What I really love was, that  the ""space shots"" were pure silence, no sound, just silence, I could hear the disc spinning in it's drive.

---

The shots catched the scenes in a way I have seen rarely: For example when David and Frank are trying to find a hiding spot from HAL you can see HAL in the background of the cockpit window and I already knew that he was most probably trying to read their lips, but I would not have guessed, that Kubrick would catch it with such shots: Just the lips in a face to face conversation.

---

What I really came here for is the ending: I was flabergasted by the precision of the effects and by the effort they must've put in to create these filters. But that's not my point...  
What is happening in the end? Is David really detached from time and space, but not in control of it, thus randomly popping in and out of it in different states of age. Why is that so, what did he discover? What waves did the monolith emit in the first place? Was it even mentioned?

And one thing I just want to add: Every scene in the movie seems to be just 30-50% too slow/long, everything is just a bit longer and slower than it should, and I love it. In the begining it felt a bit comical - watching apes discover tools-, but over time it gives the viewer a sort of power to observe more than just what is in the focus of the camera.

Parts I have will- and shamefully skipped: Lighting, Colours, Plot, acting, philosophical analysis.

It's one of the best things I've seen this year.,91,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1f9roe/i_havent_seen_anything_about_jeff_nichols_mud/,"A coming-of-age story, set on the banks of the Mississippi River, that manages to be both thrilling and spiritually profound. Two adventurous Arkansas boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), discover a dilapidated boat wedged high up in a tree on a small island. Setting their sights on making it their own, their plans are scuppered when they meet the mysterious Mud (Matthew McConaughey), a heavily superstitious fugitive with crosses nailed in his boots and a winding snake inked on his arm, who is living in the boat. He is back in town to reconnect with his true love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis feels an immediate kinship with him and his quest, and the boys set about helping fix up the boat. As his parents’ relationship suffers at home, and Mud’s dark past resurfaces, Ellis’s life begins to change irreversibly as he takes his first tentative steps away from childhood.

Mud may be the titular character but this is very much his and Ellis’s story – two naive romantics who believe in love in the purest, traditional way and as a result suffer in its volatile hands. McConaughey is remarkable, emanating an eerie tranquillity that masks a burning anger – every second he’s on screen, time seems to slow to the speed of his protracted metrical speech. Despite his enormous presence, it’s the performance of young Tye Sheridan that really stands out for its naturalism and impressive range. Every emotion that courses through him has an intense authenticity, making every experience we share thoroughly moving.

This is a sentimental film that touches on melodrama, and isn’t as nuanced as it may initially appear – but is no less worthy or absorbing because of it. The quiet contemplation of the first half is transformed into something of a more traditional thriller which ultimately delivers a degree of accessibility and satisfaction that a more subtle denouement wouldn’t offer. Visually ‘Mud’ is flawless, capturing the natural scenery and earthy characters with incredibly beautiful shots – pulsating with a feeling of time and place, part 21st century, but all organic and untamed, with men and boys who don’t just live on the river, they’re part of it. ‘Mud’ is a deeply affecting look at the confusion and heartbreak of young love told as a timeless piece of rural Americana, drawing on the classic traditions of Mark Twain. A lyrical odyssey as enduring as the river that forms its setting.

He began by developing his dialogue and ability to conduct a character study with *Bottle Rocket*. Next, with *Rushmore* we saw the first signs of his definitive style, with title cards, the montages, slow motion tracking shots, soundtrack choices, and continued development of his idiosyncratic writing style.


Then came *The Royal Tenenbaums*, the film I've always felt closest to, and the film that, after seeing everything he's done since, and after rewatching it twice in the last 24 hours, I can say is absolutely his magnum opus.


It's like his great American novel, with everything before and after being incredibly strong but ultimately lesser work, some of which I could comparatively call ""novellas"" in their scope.


His style continued to grow, developing sometimes-cynical sometimes-uplifting comedy/love lines with *Life Aquatic*, also advancing many themes from *TRT* such as the ""failed"" patriarch. In *Life Aquatic* he takes a different approach to the ensemble, one that centered on a father/son relationship, with the other characters (all of whom are important) orbiting around. This is in contrast to *TRT* in that that film allowed all characters to interact equally, holding equal importance to eachother's development and the overall continuation of plot.


*The Darjeeling*, *Fantastic Mr. Fox* and *Moonrise Kingdom* all continued this path of branching and developing ideas first seen in their fullest scope in *The Royal Tenenbaums*. A few more examples of these seeds are below.


*TRT* creates a fictionalized, almost fantasy-like version of New York, one where the time period is never evidenced by the actions. One can smoke inside anywhere, where gypsy cabs are the only cars seen that are not driven by characters (Eli Cash) or by friends of the characters (revolving around the weding). The script is extremely self-referential, letting every noticeable ""noun"" or  concrete ideas reoccur. The headstone inscription, the javelina, Richie's bloody marys and the S&amp;P shaker he keeps in his pocket etc. The script is ""complete"" in that everything get's tied up, everything that occurs has a notable set up much earlier, nothing stands alone, there is no deus ex machina. The world he builds is expansive and finished, allowing rewatches to show smaller and smaller details. Everytime I watch it I find something new, something even subtler than my last discover.

This wasn't supposed to be an essay, just a conversation starter, so I'll stop for now.

**TL;DR** I think that in context of his entire filmography up to this point, *The Royal Tenenbaums* remains Wes Anderson's magnum opus, the piece where he first truly executed the ideas that he's built upon since, and the piece in which he most fully created his vision in the grandest sense.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_19z6p4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/19z6p4/thoughts_on_the_royal_tenenbaums_in_retrospect/,

Despite the ever-changing social conventions and cultural progress, it appears that heterosexual, romantic 'love' is continuously desired amongst male and female protagonists alike – with literature, cinema and television reinforcing idealistic portrayals romantic stereotypes upon audiences, over decades, even centuries, it is not surprising that many films are still subject to these codes. 

Claire Johnston discusses the use of predetermined stereotypes that have been present in a large number of Hollywood films, taking Erwin Panofksy's criticism as starting point:

&gt;Panofsky locates the origins of iconography and stereotype in cinema in terms of practical necessity; he suggests that in the early cinema the audience had much difficulty deciphering what appeared on the screen. Fixed iconography, then, was introduced to aid understanding and provide the audience with basic facts with which to comprehend the narrative.


The effect of this insistence of using generic character types can still be witnessed in a large number of contemporary films – particularly when it comes to underdeveloped female roles. Perhaps the most notable issue, when looking at a number of female characters within romantic comedies (past and present), is that of the 'male gaze' - a term popularised by film theorist, Laura Mulvey:

&gt;The determining male gaze projects its phantasy on to the female form which is styled accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact [...] 

There are several reasons - besides Johnston 'iconography' argument - why the male gaze so prevalent throughout the history of the romantic-comedy sub-genre, among others; **a male-dominated film industry, product of a patriarchal society, has allowed for very few alternative representations of gender, romance and family in the past** – consequently, such films are generally from a male point-of-view. Pre-existing notions of romance, identity, and the idealising of female characters, have influenced the filmmaking process ever since its inception; their solidity in media and culture is largely unaffected by unconventional viewpoints (even female-written, pro-feminist protagonists may frequently be subject to male gaze). 


In a pre-feminist America, women were largely represented as **passive, virginal homemakers and (potential) wives**, just as susceptible to the myths of 'love' as their male counterparts. Male protagonists, often idealize their female love-interests, viewing them as innocent, helpless and needing to be 'saved' (Vladimir Propp's “damsel in distress” role) from a life of potential misery; female protagonists, arguably, are still subject to a certain degree of **passiveness, sexual immaturity and general reliance on their male counterparts**. 

Johnston notes the 'unchanging' view of females since early cinema:
&gt;As the cinema developed, the stereotyping of man was increasingly interpreted as contravening the realisation of the notion of 'character'; in the case of women [...] the dominant ideology presented her as eternal and unchanging, except for modifications in terms of fashion, etc.


In more recent years, many films of the 'rom-com' sub-genre have come to explore less-conventional, more-cynical ideals of the contemporary culture from which they have spawned; **with social movements, such as first-wave feminism in the 1960s, and a subsequently-increasing Western divorce rate**, cinema reflected these changes by showing subverted values and exploring issues which had not been largely dealt with before, such as **professional independence, sexual maturity and rejection of patriarchal ideals of marriage**. The notion of 'true love' is no longer as clear-cut. 

Suddenly, protagonists could be damaged, unconventional leading figures, who do not succeed in 'getting the girl' in the end; male protagonists could be less conventionally-attractive (Woody Allen being a seminal example), whilst it appears female characters had the freedom to choose career over family life. When feminist movements meant that females no longer had to be tied down by patriarchal ideals, their newfound freedom of sexuality and career was reflected in films of the era (notably *The Graduate*, 1968), challenging the longstanding male perspective. 

Yet, in spite of these changing conventions, two things remain apparent: male and female protagonists still endlessly pursue this ideal of 'romance' and 'true love', of which they are (variably) certain they will obtain; and **hints at true female independence and sexuality is met with (subconscious) emphasis on this character's villainous side, downplay of this femininity, or ironic, post-feminist leanings which romanticise an earlier, more oppressed era**. The ethos of post-feminism appears quite significant to the understanding of certain contemporary cinematic figures; Angela McRobbie defines the movement in relation to first-wave feminism:

&gt;[Through] an array of machinations, elements of contemporary popular culture are perniciously effective in regard to this undoing of feminism, while simultaneously appearing to be engaging in a well-informed and even well-intended response to feminism.


A certain type of character, typical of the latter, post-feminist trope, seems to have arisen, particularly within the first decade of the twenty-first century: a rare, significant beacon of hope in these broken, cynical (almost-always white) protagonists' lives. This type of female representation seems inherent of a contemporary Western society, where attempts at defining either gender can no longer be applied by simple classic stereotypes; **defining the twenty-first century male is ambiguous – therefore hypothetically, a similarly-postmodern representation of the female is also needed**. 

The character in question is the **'Manic Pixie Dream Girl'** - a type of female love-interest who's main reason for existing, according to critics, is to improve the lives of their “broodingly soulful” male counterpart, through 'quirky' behaviour and a child-like perspective on an otherwise disillusioned society; meanwhile, having little or no life ambitions of her own. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is lighthearted, eccentric, and non-threatening; her (often, unintentional) behaviour inspires creativity, organisation, and 'true love' among the male's life that is nothing short of the literary muse. 

Numerous films, notably in the last decade, have used some variant of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope – that being, a female character who, rather than being a fleshed-out and fully-realised character, they appear to be ultimately defined by their relationship to the male lead. This essay will attempt to explore the origins, characteristics, political and social reasons why the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is so prevalent among the present-day romantic comedy genre (and whether this trend will persist in the future), with specific emphasis on one film in particular: *(500) Days of Summer* (2009), directed by Marc Webb. Is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (in this case, the eponymous Summer) a post-feminist figure, inherent of a skeptical postmodern society; or is it simply a contemporary tangent of a traditional literary trope that has been around for years?

*(500) Days of Summer* is not a 'love story', but rather, 'a story about love'; as the film's tagline and opening narration suggests. From the beginning, the film deliberately attempts to set itself apart from common 'rom-com' conventions, whilst remaining in familiar enough territory from which to draw contextual conclusions. 

From the offset, the conventions of the sub-genre are simultaneously reinforced, examined and subverted. The film is essentially a study of the ideals relating to 'love' held by two protagonists – one romantic, one cynical – through their (lack of) exposure to these very conventions. 

A brief sequence at the beginning of the film explores the psychology behind the two leads – Tom, subject to years of exposure to “sad British pop music and a total misreading of the film, *The Graduate*”, is convinced he will never be truly happy until he finds 'the one'; Summer, presumably affected by her parents' divorce at a young age, **rejects the typical ideals of marriage and openly voices her discomfort with being someone's girlfriend - a post-feminist mentality which is never fully explored**. Nevertheless, Tom and Summer begin to bond, and, after several weeks, enter a physical “relationship” (although, even this is entirely debatable, depending on point of view) and inevitably break up, leading Tom, as protagonist, to look back in an attempt at finding “those first signs of trouble”. 

Through these conflicting points of view, Webb attempts to come to a traditionally-escapist, but 'honest', conclusion, as opposed to simply projecting unrealistic expectations, like those which have been strongly embedded in Tom's character. 

In an interview with the Examiner, Webb notes his dissatisfaction with typical modern romantic-comedies (in this case, *Hitch*, 2005) and their portrayal of unrealistic scenarios:

&gt;[This] fat guy waxes his back and then dances and suddenly he’s dating a model. I just thought, “You’re lying. You are outright lying, that does not happen.” If it does it’s usually pathological it doesn’t end well.


In a self-aware manner, Webb's reliance on Tom's partial perspective inherently alters how the audience experiences the story – particularly how the character of Summer, as a whole, is viewed. The director plays on this idea of **shy young males, projecting idealistic characteristics onto girls like Summer**: the term, the 'Summer Effect', is introduced to describe a certain phenomenon in which young males become fixated with idealised female characters, for seemingly incomprehensible reasons. 

The film's narrator explains:
&gt;For all intents and purposes, Summer Finn: just another girl. Except she wasn’t. [...] Summer’s employment at the daily freeze during the summer of her sophomore year coincided with an inexplicable 212% increase in revenue [...] It was a rare quality, this “Summer effect.” […] For Tom Hanson to find it now in a city of 400,00 offices, 91,000 commercial buildings, and 3.8 million people, well that could only be explained by one thing: fate.

The 'Summer effect' is rather implicitly at play within numerous romantic-comedies, particularly, but not exclusively, where there is a male lead; films which appear to evoke strong feelings of 'love', or idealisation of a female character (especially where 'love at first sight', muses, and Manic Pixie Dream Girls are concerned) from which the male finds difficult to escape, are likely consequences of the 'Summer effect'. **However, this high degree of positive emphasis on one character's attributes brings with it a level of bias, miscommunication and lack of general character development**. Rather than presenting a balanced, realistic image of the lead characters' relationship, it is warped - in this case, in favour of Tom, subsequently leading to a general misreading of Summer, which puts unfair pressure on a character who does not actually appear to deserve it.

The character of Summer is exemplary of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope – she is considered attractive yet approachable, 'quirky' yet down to earth, and confident in being in charge of her own destiny. Summer's taste in music and pop-culture is also an important factor for Tom– he defends himself when his teenage sister (and romantic confidant), Rachel (Chloe Mortez), disputes “just because she likes all the same bizarro crap you do, it doesn't make her your soul mate”. **Defined by her eccentricities rather than emotional development; there is very little revealed about the potential complexity of Summer's personality, that doesn't relate directly to Tom's own experiences**. 

Sarah Seltzer elaborates on this issue, noting how the typical Manic Pixie Dream Girl may hold undertones of sexism.
&gt;[Her] function isn't to blossom and grow as a unique individual over the course of the film. Instead, she awakens creativity, hope, romance, or whatever else was sleeping within the male protagonist. She is the catalyst for his change or his feelings, but she inevitably doesn't have much a personality of her own underneath the endearing eccentricities.

Webb acknowledges potential feminist criticism of Summer as nothing more than a muse - who's sole intent, as a fictional character, is to inspire creativity and “embrace life” - claiming how his use of classic literary figure helps explore the entire concept of 'love' throughout history:

&gt;[It's] part of literature that has always existed. What was Beatrice to Dante? […] Eve was that to Adam. It’s just part of what [Summer] represents and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We are often beguiled by creatures that we endow with powers that aren’t real. You expect this girl to be the answer to everything and it's not really the case.

Tom's subjectivity to the notion of Summer as a muse is all too apparent in his rejuvenated career ambitions. Through a series of triumphs and struggles, the reason for this change lies almost-entirely with Summer, for better or worse; in several scenes in particular - as early as day **(8)** - Summer questions Tom about his passion for architecture, asking him to point out his favourite buildings and wondering whether he would want to make a difference to the city's skyline. All the while, Summer's ambitions are relatively unknown, with very little character development in comparison to Tom - much of her behaviour appears merely to benefit his, rather than her own, needs. **She displays strong opinions on the concept of love and marriage, desiring only a casual relationship whilst rejecting old-fashioned ideals, favouring a life of pseudo-independence; she even openly proclaims how she enjoys being alone, which is a rarely-explored alternative to romance within the sub-genre**. 

Webb, however, defends the character of Summer as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, stating that, although she displays many of the typical attributes of the trope, these are deliberate misreadings put in place in order to explore the psychology behind the protagonists' 'love' (or lack thereof) for each other:

&gt;**That is one of the codes of the movie. He falls in love not with her but the idea of her […] You don’t really get to know her if it was a mature relationship, which it’s not.** 

Tom's self-indulgent perspective and misunderstanding of the complexity of Summer's character, now, at least, have a contextual position within world of the film – rather than male gaze for the mere sake of it, Webb's conscious decision to emphasise the eccentric and 'attractive' components of the love-interest is, arguably, part of his effort to scrutinise the modern 'love story' and to typify the tired, unrealistic representations within the romance genre as a whole.

Over the course of five hundred days, Tom goes from meeting Summer, falling in love and eventually learning to move on, after having his heart 'broken' – with Summer, however, there is no suggestion of 'love'; despite Tom's questioning, she avoids labels and blatantly changes the subject when the 'boyfriend/girlfriend' issue is brought up. While the classic romantic-comedy (taking Chaplin's *The Circus*, for example) employs this conflict of interest in order to generate empathy and catharsis for audiences, this would typically be resolved (the hero wins over his girl, sealing their fate with a kiss), perpetuating the myth of an eternal romance (that lasts long after the conclusion of the film). In contrast, (500) Days of Summer hints at this type of ending (through Tom's own projected desires) but plays with these conventions - subtly promising (a subversion of) this type of 'happy ending', if only in an attempt to explore both the honest and unrealistic implications behind such a cinematic motif.



&gt;**(86)**
&gt;I think it's official. I'm in love with Summer. 
&gt;I love her smile. I love her hair. I love her knees. I love how she licks her lips before she talks. I love her heart-shaped birthmark on her neck. I love it when she sleeps.


After spending several weeks physically involved with Summer, Tom confirms that he is “in love” with her. Elaborating on this claim, he lists numerous appealing physical features, whilst a visual montage of appropriate close-up shots accompanies him – an indisputable instance where the male gaze theory can be seen at work. In the short sequences of clips featuring Summer, the character is presented through Tom's own observations of her, as mirrored in the use of point-of-view camera work. He lists her physical attributes as reasons for 'love', rather than intellectual or professional, for instance. 

In contrast to the elevator scene on day **(4)**, in which the two first bond over a mutual fondness for *The Smiths*, Tom considers the very first moment he sees Summer as the moment he falls in love – placing a significant reliance on his superficial, visual pleasure, if only subconsciously. Does Summer hold this first, brief moment of eye-contact in similar regard? Not likely. **Mulvey argues that characters, like Tom, not only hold a position of ideologic male spectator, but represents a predominant heterosexual ego with which audiences can relate**:

&gt;According to the principles of the ruling ideology and the psychical structures that back it up, the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification […] The man controls the film phantasy and also emerges as the representative of power in a further sense: as the bearer of the look of the spectator, transferring it behind the screen to neutralise the extra-diegetic tendencies represented by woman as spectacle.

Consequently, the character of Summer *alters*, depending on Tom's mood the point in time (with particular emphasis on her physical appearance), thus adding this degree of unreliability and immaturity to his character as protagonist. In a later scene, the influence of the male ego upon the audience can be witnessed, when an identical montage of Summer's physical features appears – however, this time, a post-breakup Tom lists off things he hates about her: 

&gt;**(388)**
&gt;I hate Summer. 
&gt;I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. I hate the way she sounds when she laughs.


**The audience is subject only to his thoughts and feelings, rather than having a balanced, realistic scenario from which to draw their own opinions, emotions and conclusions**. It also is significant to note that Tom's main source of relationship advice comes from his younger sister; though she appears wise beyond her years in terms of understanding romance, this simply reinforces Webb's notion of the immature attitude that young males, such as Tom, have towards relationships when subject to the 'Summer effect'. **The projection of this self-idealised male ego from viewer upon Tom helps reinforce the ideology of the male as the dominant, narrative force behind the film, allowing the filmmakers to manipulate their audience in order to strengthen this cinematic ego, whilst attempting to cover up Tom's vulnerability and fear**. Tom specifies a number of Summer's faults, rarely taking the time to analyse his own characteristics – he lacks the mature self-awareness needed in order (for his character) to be considered a responsible adult, which a strong self-indulgent narrative perspective makes up for.


Tom's occupation as a greeting card writer is perhaps the most notable scenario where Webb's attempt at deconstructing these myths and assumptions of 'love' is at its clearest. When the 'Summer effect' is in full-swing, it provides an abundance of inspiration for Tom; not only does his fulfil his proposal targets in a single afternoon, but he gladly lends a hand to McKenzie and other greeting card departments **(167)**. After spending several weeks post-breakup, preoccupied with depression and self-pity, Tom's return to work, distraught by the concept of 'love' that he comes to a realisation about the 'lies' that have been the basis of much popular culture throughout the decades.

&gt;**(442)**
&gt;It's these cards, and the movies and the pop songs, they're to blame for all the lies and the heartache; everything. We're responsible. I'm responsible. I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel [...] not some words that some stranger put in their mouth. Words like “love”, that don't mean anything.

In this particular scene, Tom voices the true intentions of the film's exploration of 'love', displaying emotions that are the very antithesis of the hopeless-romantic convention that Tom represents at the beginning of the film. Webb attempts to dismantle the myths of 'true love', the 'Summer effect' and the conventional happy ending – such filmmaking methods are no longer as relevant in a contemporary Western society. In effect, *(500) Days of Summer* provides a postmodern middle ground for the romantic-comedy, where both sides of this argument are explored in equal regard. 

However, the film still falls victim to a certain number of these 'lies', be it unwittingly or self-aware; ultimately, Webb's film hints at a progressive standpoint on the view of 'love' within the sub-genre, but this is slightly undermined by his use of traditional methods such as the male gaze and general misinterpretation of Summer's character. **Conventional gender roles are still reinforced, to a degree, despite Webb's best intentions to subvert them. Much of this stems from the political, industrial and psychological factors which govern, not only Webb's filmmaking, but virtually the entire Hollywood system throughout the decades. ** 

---

Ever since its inception, film directors, writers and producers have been, for the most part, male. It is no coincidence, therefore, to see such a saturated market when it comes to the male gaze – it is simply the product of generations of male-filmmakers enforcing codes and conventions throughout repetition (thus creating easily-readable stereotypes for a broader number of audiences), with little alternative representations of gender available. With less than one-fifth of Western filmmakers being female (though increasingly *very* gradually), it may be correct to assume gender representations and filmmaking styles, such as the male gaze, are likely to persist in the foreseeable future (continually reinforcing Johnston's theory of the “eternal and unchanging” female).


What Johnston's criticism does not take into account is the amount of awareness that has come into play regarding sexism and stereotyping in cinema; in order to contextualize representations such as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl within cinematic history, it is necessary to compare and contrast the trend with earlier, more traditional codes and conventions – particularly prior to equality movements, such as first-wave feminism. **The Manic Pixie Dream Girl's superficial characteristics reflect a synchronous culture, but, with closer inspection, one can draw many similarities (psychological, physical and political) between this figure and previous incarnations of the literary muse over multiple generations.**  


Though Summer displays post-feminist attitudes of modern Western society, her physical appearance, child-like eccentricities and preference for quasi-retro culture are reminiscent of a 1960s America, just prior to first-wave feminism. **The character resembles a number of sixties female icons, particularly Marlo Thomas in *“That Girl”* (1966-1971) and Audrey Hepburn in *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961), who, also defined by their quirky behaviour and unconventional attitudes towards relationships, closely mirror the contemporary Manic Pixie Dream Girl** – minus the postmodern setting and retrospective irony with which Deschanel, among others, carries her part. Tom even reinforces his romanticism for this particular era, proclaiming, “London, 1964 - those girls knew how to dress...” **(259)**; **his subjectivity to the same type of retro-sexual infantilization that attracts him to Summer subconsciously diminishes the inherent masculine fear of castration**, as Gry Rustad notes:

&gt;Mulvey contends that the male spectator either controls the female object through fetishism, or by demystification and possession, so as to avoid castration anxiety. Infantilization (paternal control) and asexuality (renouncement of sexuality and demystification) takes away the threat of castration and as such both are ways in which men can control, posses and suppress the female characters.

In a more traditional gender role, Summer's sexuality is deliberately downplayed to the point of non-threatening and virginal – perhaps innocent or naïve, with an underlying hint of deviance; Holly Golightly (Hepburn) in *Breakfast at Tiffany's* embodies a similar type charismatic female, with a power over men that is not unlike the 'Summer effect'. Holly uses this aspect of her personality in her employment (cheering up “lonely old men” for money), without explicit reference to her sexuality; essentially a precursor to first-wave feminism, Holly (at first) appears in charge of her own independence, and rejects her neighbour, and the male protagonist, Paul's insistence that he loves her.

&gt;Paul: Holly, I'm in love with you […] You belong to me.
&gt;Holly: No, people don't belong to people […] I'm like cat here, a couple of no-name slobs. We belong to nobody and nobody belongs to us. We don't even belong to each other.

However, these pre-feminist leanings, it is later revealed, are simply consequential of Holly's desire to raise money for her brother, Fred – her greatest ambition being to marry a wealthy man, regardless of attractiveness, age or cultural background. Likewise, she proclaims that nothing makes her as truly happy as the feeling shopping at Tiffany's jewellery store evokes – placing particular emphasis upon capitalism in defining her happiness - arguably as superficial as Tom's reliance on 'love at first sight'. **Although it is interesting to note the largely-positive representation of a (downplayed) sexual independence, this is undermined by traditional ideologies of the female reliance on capitalism and matrimony, rather than a career, as key factors in defining happiness**.


Though a post-feminist ethos allows Summer to look, work, live in any way she sees fit, she winds up in a similar position to Holly, finding 'true love'. There is a very brief timespan during which Summer leaves her job, finds 'the one' and marries him. In this scenario, conventional gender representations arise: Summer goes from rejecting matrimony to finding herself in a 'loving' marriage. **There seems to be no middle ground in which for her to mature; she cannot have both**.

This issue relates specifically to the intriguing female roles from *The Graduate* (1967), directed by Mike Nichols. Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a recent university graduate with little motivation, falls into a secretive affair with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a housewife and long-time friend of his parents; and later, her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), a student with an ambiguous future. 

A sign of the times, *The Graduate* reflects the social issues raised by the first wave of feminism, among other movements, in the late 1960s; Benjamin's household encapsulate the nuclear family (virtually the only tolerable media representation of the family unit at the time), whilst Mrs. Robinson displays newly-emerging attitudes of female sexual independence and power, but simultaneously supports a husband and daughter (both oblivious to her goings on, for the most part). Her character bears certain relevance to Janet Fink's writings on the changing values of marriage and motherhood:

&gt;[Many] significant changes to the lived experiences of women…and to the ways in which these experiences were reflected by the film industry. Undoubtedly, marriage and motherhood remained central to the conceptualization of womanhood but there were important shifts in attitudes toward the woman her rights to personal fulfilment.

That being said, as much as a feminist paradox Mrs. Robinson appears to be, she is still subject to the male gaze – when she first attempts to seduce Benjamin, for instance, the framing of her figure has lenience towards the male perspective, her physical attributes suggestively filling the frame in front of an onlooking Benjamin, “stylised and fragmented by close-ups” – essentially a more explicit version of the voyeuristic montages in which Tom describes his love-interest's physical highlights. The early sequence of events between the kitchen and bedroom place specific emphasis on Mrs. Robinson's physical attributes - a highly sexualized image that portrays the independent woman as simultaneously intimidating and for the male's viewing pleasure. **Benjamin is framed suggestively through the housewife's legs, for instance, highlighting both his entrapment and his dominant gaze**; subsequently refusing to let him exit Elaine's room, shots of Benjamin's startled reaction is punctuated by brief, “fragmented close-ups” of her unclothed breasts and thighs. 

Despite Benjamin's uneasiness in the scenario, the incorporation of these examples of the male gaze still reinforces his dominant ideological position as the spectator. In comparison, Summer's physical appearance (similarly, Holly's), while an important factor of Tom's male gaze, is not referred to in such an overtly graphic manner. It appears that a majority of filmmakers (i.e. male) essentially have two options when it comes to representing female love-interests with strong feminist beliefs: **either play-down her sexuality to the point of old-fashioned innocence, or even asexuality (Summer), or have her portrayed as a sexual, formidable character (Mrs. Robinson). Neither are particularly beneficial for the portrayal of women in Hollywood cinema.**


However, there are some slight exceptions to this rule; Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, who later becomes a more age-appropriate love-interest for Benjamin, embodies many struggles of the young, first-wave feminist. Elaine is, arguably, a subtle early depiction of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl; whilst she lacks notably extroverted behaviour or eccentricities, she represents similar themes of inspiration and motivation that are typical of the 'Summer effect'.

Benjamin knows her for only a brief period of time, but is immediately convinced that he loves her. There is little revealed about her character at first – **she is essentially a blank slate onto which Benjamin can project his expectations, hopes and fears. Elaine, too, feels something of a blank slate, in terms of uncertainty of her future, both romantic and professional (the ambiguous complexity of her character lost among Benjamin's subjectivity)**. Both Benjamin and Elaine represent a generation of young adults who are no longer tied down by ideological ideals such as matrimony and family, bonding through their mutual desire to do something “different” with their lives, as Benjamin proclaims in the opening scene. 

Despite this, Benjamin resorts to marriage as the only solution to find true happiness, persistent that he is in 'love'; Elaine, however, displays a varied degree of opinions on the matter of marriage – she answers Benjamin's pleas with “I might”, “I'll think about it” and “I don't know” responses, as an attempt to keep her options open; she even holds another young man, Carl Smith, in a similar position. **Elaine's complex attitudes towards traditional marriage are noteworthy in relation to early feminist representations – despite her fears and precariousness, the female appears to be in a position of power, if only for a short time**. 

Nicole Smith explains:
&gt;Elaine [both] seeks to appease the status quo as set forth by her parents and suburban society while at the same time to break free and form her own understanding of herself as a woman [… Elaine], unlike her mother, does not clearly embody the values of the 1950s nor those of the 1960s. Instead, she blends these two and is the perfect immersion of the new and the traditional.

Elaine represents an ambiguous future for American females, in which discrimination and inequality would gradually cease to be a problem; first-wave feminism, workplace legislation and more accessible divorce laws gave rise to the number of single, professional young women who did not necessarily desire the traditional, patriarchal family unit as portrayed in 1950s television sitcoms. Her placement at Berkley University is also significant, due to the number of gender, and race, related movements that took place around the time around which the film is set, making her a contemporary representation of young females at the time of the film's release.

In the evolving social climate within* The Graduate*, finding a husband and settling down, after graduating college, is no longer the only acceptable option for which women to spend their lives – yet, whatever strong independent beliefs the character may hold, Elaine, Holly and Summer, manage to fulfil this old-fashioned gender role, whether through freedom of choice or not. Elaine eventually drops out of university, at the insistence of her parents, in order to marry Carl Smith. At the end of *The Graduate*, Benjamin makes a dash to Elaine's wedding in order to 'save' her from a 'loveless' marriage – they flee from the wedding ceremony together, but, as the final scene of the film suggests, their spontaneous decision brings immediate regret. **Elaine may have been saved from the patriarchal, traditional marriage, but the fact remains that her relationships with men are crucial to the significant recent events in her life; until she is able to break free from this pattern, she may never be truly independent.**


This residing message is helpful in understanding the differentiation of opinion between the two leads in* (500) Days of Summer*. Tom's misreading of the film at a young age is partly responsible for his certainty in the belief of 'the one' – through this misinterpretation it is likely that he views Summer as character worth pursuing, or even, 'saving', all the while in denial of the disparity of their romantic beliefs. 

On day **(290)**, their last day together, he and Summer watch* The Graduate* together; Summer's tearful reaction to the film's final scene is indicative of the relative position in which she sees herself: **the despairing pursuit of Benjamin mirrors Tom's adamance in believing they are truly happy and 'in love', whereas it appears Elaine cannot forge her own career trajectory or personal life without having persistent male figures attempting to shape it for her – to 'save' her**. The doubts and fears suggested in Elaine's character are similarly present within Summer after all, but Tom fails to understand, yet again – this level of miscommunication between Tom and Summer evidently carries the same undertones of immaturity and irresponsibility that is inherent in Benjamin and Elaine's 'romantic' entanglement.


Summer, too, rushes quickly into a marriage, after a chance meeting at a coffee shop convinces her in the very things for which she criticises Tom – 'true love', 'the one' and 'destiny'. Summer is now susceptible to the very same 'myths' and assumptions that “sad British pop songs” had once sold to Tom; conversely, the male protagonist loses faith in the one thing that he was certain would, one day, make him 'truly happy'. No longer believing this is the case, Tom is able to carve a more independent, professional lifestyle for himself, without the worries of 'true love' residing in his mind – a position in which Summer, to a certain degree, is no longer in. 


In the final scene of the film **(500)**, Tom runs into a female architect, Autumn, with whom he is competing for an illustrious job. They talk briefly prior to their job interview and make plans for coffee, bonding over their shared passion for their potential careers in the same way Summer and he once did with *The Smiths*. When Tom discovers the girl's name, a tongue-in-cheek nod at the camera implies that Autumn may restore his belief in 'true love' after all, with the days counter returning to **(1)**. The name 'Autumn' implies an emotional progression from his relationship with Summer - Tom has finally developed into a professional, mature human being; in relation to numerous films, Howard Suber defines this balance of love and work as the sign of true maturity:

&gt;**Sigmund Freud wrote that the most important requirements for maturity were the ability to love and the ability to work. In an astonishing number of the most popular films, the protagonist can do one, but not the other, and the lesson that he or she frequently learns […] is how to do both.**

It is fairly common that characters, particularly females, end up in this scenario; they develop the ability to love and find marriage, but neglect work (e.g. Summer, Elaine, Benjamin), or vice versa (McKenzie) – those who represent this sense of maturity (Mrs. Robinson and, to an extent, Holly) are often met with intimidated or innocent representations.

However, Tom's developing maturity is just one notable aspect of the scene: for the first time in the film, and even among the other films mentioned, both male and female characters are, simultaneously, applying for the same position – evincing a contemporary scenario in which **both genders have equal skills and opportunities – and are able to occupy themselves with pursuing a love-interest, in spite of said career prospects**. This is not to say Autumn herself wouldn't fall under a post-Manic Pixie Dream Girl banner, but it is, presumably, a step in the right direction in regards to feminist representations.

However ambiguous these films may seem in regards to feminism – several instances, such as *The Graduate*, portraying varied, progressive representations of females in contrast to the traditional values of the nuclear family – the fact remains that, a certain degree of male bias (and in some cases, misogyny) is going to arise so long as the filmmakers are, for the most part, male. Of the films mentioned previously, all of which were written and directed by men; issues of miscommunication, male gaze and dominant ideological stereotypes are all inherent of this fact. **In order to present a 'true' feminist film, several theorists argue that, a female counter-cinema must arise**.

**TL;DR** Manic Pixie Dream Girls are the subject of a male-dominated cinematic perspective, which is the result of generations of the male-dominated industries of film and literature. Summer in *(500) Days of Summer* is inherent of earlier characters and tropes such as the ""muse"" and pre-feminist-era female protagonists. Pro-feminist and post-feminist filmmaking is growing, if only gradually.

1374938674.0,77,self.TrueFilm,1j5vsy,Cube (1997),94,17,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j5vsy/cube_1997/,"I’ll preface this by saying I don’t claim to know a lot about movies or even to have seen a great deal of them. I just thought it would be fun to talk about this movie. Feel free to criticize my analysis and I will try to improve my writing in the future. I would also like to add that I haven’t seen the sequel or prequel to this movie yet so if you all wouldn’t mind keeping the discussion free of spoilers for “Cube 2” and “Cube: Zero,” or using spoiler tags if necessary, I would appreciate that.


I came across this movie in a “best science fiction movies” list. Before watching the movie I did not think that it sounded like a science fiction movie at all. Afterwards I would maintain that it does not qualify as “sci-fi” even though “horror” and “sci-fi” are not mutually exclusive. I wouldn’t say that this is a science fiction movie unless you would also qualify a movie like “The Human Centipede” as science fiction as well, since it has scientific elements. I’m sure there are reasons for “Cube” being referred to as science fiction when it is, like “The Human Centipede,” about torture committed by humans against other humans, but I don’t see the cube device itself or the fact that math is used as sufficient reasons to call it a science fiction movie. At any rate, whether “Cube” is a science fiction movie or not is one topic we could discuss here.


Returning to the subject of torture, one thing that I liked about this movie was that there was not an overabundance of “trap” deaths in the movie, since that’s something audiences have had plenty of from movies like “Saw.” Only two people are killed by traps in the entire movie and their deaths take place mostly to serve the purpose of establishing the premise, rather than to scare or disgust the audience. Considering that the theme of the movie is that humans are capable of an infinite amount of stupidity, it is fitting that the victims’ real enemy is one of their own. One thing I do have to say about Quentin is that the character and actor who played him could have been more subtle. It broke my suspension of disbelief a bit to see him acting so insane when other characters seemed to be unaffected by the effects of stir craziness or even acting more rationally than at the beginning of the movie. It’s a bit hard to swallow that a cop, or one who claims to be a cop, would act in such a way simply because he is being criticized by others.


Though the central theme of human stupidity is one I don’t disagree with, the delivery of it is a bit ham fisted. The best evidence I can give of this is the ending, when Worth literally sees a way out and, instead of doing the completely logical and natural thing and hightailing it out of there, he decides to hit us over the head with the message of “endless human stupidity” once again. The fact that his moralizing inadvertently causes his death and the death of Leaven could be potentially infuriating for an audience member. However, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal since the writers probably would have found a way to end the movie the way they did in one way or the other. Kazan, a recycled version of “The Rain Man,” is the only one who escapes. He is the only innocent among the group since “contributing” members of society merely contribute to making the world a terrible place.


One question I have is, does the fact that Leaven uses mathematics to ""solve"" the cube contradict the theme of human stupidity? If so, was this purposefully done?


After writing all this, it seems that I’m mostly pointing out flaws, but the truth is I really enjoyed this movie. It’s competently made, especially considering its budget, and does a great job of leading the audience by their nose and creating suspense. It’s also nice to have a movie based on more concrete principles like mathematics, even if the only parts of it I can understand are “square root” and “prime numbers.” Too many horror movies rely too heavily on supernatural elements that aren’t fully explained, if explained at all. This movie seems to follow a certain amount of logic consistently. It can be nitpicked to death and I can definitely understand someone not liking it.

Honestly, I can only recall 2 that actually scare me: one is REC, which is a case of handheld done right, something very hard to find and overused. But, despite making me mute my headphones the first time I saw it, it is not much more than a well made horror flick. What I mean is that there's not much else going on, as opposed to my favorite horror movie ever, which is A Tale of Two Sisters. I was as nervous as I've ever been watching a film, the music, the tone, the suspense, made me scared and uncomfortable without the need of many scare jumps. On top of that, the movie has interesting characters, relationships, twists, symbolism (something that I find goes extremely well with horror for some reason), life lessons and emotion.

Since then, I've not been able to find a horror story in film form that has had that much effect in me. I liked Martyrs, but it was more shocking and interesting than it was scary. Same with Antichrist.

I tried watching Paranormal Activity and it was one of the few times in my life where I just had to skip to the end, it was extremely dull and boring, I'd prefer to watch The Blair Witch Project again. Same thing almost happened with The Strangers.

Other movies, like The Shining or The Exorcist, I consider good films, but, probably because of their age, don't really scare me.

Summing up, I think REC is an example of good horror without much else, The Shining a good movie without much horror, and A Tale of Two Sisters the perfect mix of both elements.

Anyway, I feel very on edge and uncomfortable even thinking about these people hitting rock bottom and not even knowing why. The loss of self, not necessarily the control but the awareness of you yourself as who you are to you.

 Another example for me is the bathroom scene in The Shining because, again, we're losing what we knew about ourselves as Jack and then being assigned a new identity we are unable to accept leaving us to fully assume the roles of Danny and Wendy who are the external victims of Jacks newly forced disassociation.

In Shining it's less severe because we're steadily decending and acclimating to who jack's becoming.
 in Upstream Color, the only thing we have to hold onto these characters is sanity- however weak- which is viciously ripped from us.

(Spoilers for This is 40),108,33,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17yx6b/do_you_think_katherine_heigl_was_right_about_judd/,"In regards to working on 'Knocked Up' Katherine Heigl controversially and admittedly unprofessionally called the film sexist claiming it  ""paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys"". After watching 'This is 40' I honestly can't disagree, I think the intention was to balance out the negative attributes between the couple that form the basis of the film's conflict but we are shown Leslie Mann's character smoking when pregnant and the ""equivalent"" is Paul Rudd's character being addicted to desserts. Whilst Mann goes out partying with a younger female colleague and an entire hockey team Rudd is berated for playing games on his ipad. Rudd tries to explain that it is not the same thing but he is drowned out by Mann.

Its not even limited to just the primary couple, yes there are negative male characters such as Mann's father and arguably Rudd's, but the behaviour of Rudd's father is apparently motivated by a controlling spouse, which leads to financial difficulties for Rudd. Whilst you might not agree with Rudd supporting his father it seems to be coming from a good place and how you respond to Mann's reaction might depend somewhat on what you would do if placed in a similar situation. Even a minor character like Lena Dunham's, who delivers only a couple of lines manages to squeeze in a snide remark at Chris O'Dowd's sexual inadequacies. Then theres Melissa Mcarthy's shrieking overly-protective mother, but even her behaviour is motivated by Mann verbally assaulting her child, although that whole sequence certainly makes us root for Mann to a point.

Megan Fox's character and Jody, the other employee at Mann's shop are also both revealed to pretty disreputable people, Fox, though initially suspected of being a thief is actually a prostitute and Jody, a strange but apparently hardworking employee is actually a drug addict. Fox is also easily captivated and seduced by the loveable Apatow-regular Jason Segal. Judd Apatow said that if you cast Paul Rudd in your movie, you can get away with anything, which leads me to believe that whether or not Apatow genuinely means to be sexist,his casting choices perhaps inadvertently present women unflatteringly in contrast. As an audience we're more likely to side with actors who have earned a reputation for playing goofy, everyman types, like Rudd, Segal, Rogen and Brooks. When they're stood next to actresses like Fox and Heigl, actresses who have a reputation for steeliness and unapproachability the character who we support is far more likely to be the ordinary goofball who just can't quite catch a break, a problem that isn't helped by burdening the female characters with negative plot-related attributes.

The effects of television herein are deleterious and hysterical. In Videodrome, television creates opportunities for physical change, a New Flesh arises, evincing a kind of paranoid futurism.

Under-appreciated actor (Seriously),140,65,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1f80zg/zach_galifinakis_underappreciated_actor_seriously/,"I think there is an over abundance of hate for Zach because of his over the top characters in Hangover and Due Date, but I am of the opinion that he is an impressive actor. He hasn't had many dramatic roles as of yet, but the ones he's had are very promising. 

I really loved his character in Its Kind of a Funny Story. I thought he blended the comedic and dramatic aspects of that character very effectively. Honestly it was a bold choice of film for him considering he had just hit the mainstream with Hangover. 

He was also in a film called Visioneers. That movie was incredibly unique with its darkly comedic sensibilities packed into a very bleak and depressing vision of nearly-Orwellian plot lines. I think Zach really proved his range of character acting considering his character, George, could not possibly be further away (conceptually) from his character in Hangover. If Hangover were compared to a waterfall, I'd say Visioneers was like a dam slowly cracking and then bursting open. 

I honestly think if Zach gets the right part and avoids being pigeon-holed into the ""wacky insane supporting character"" parts for his entire career, he could pull off an Oscar-worthy performance. If Confederacy of Dunces is made into a film and casts him in the lead (as has been rumored), I think people might start to change their mind about this guy.

1366823539.0,74,self.TrueFilm,1d0r3x,Discussion: The Place Beyond the Pines,87,13,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1d0r3x/discussion_the_place_beyond_the_pines/,"Transporting Greek fatalism and Shakespearean tragedy into the disarray and malaise of modern life, The Place Beyond the Pines - thanks in no small part to a haunting, baroque soundtrack by Mike Patton - creates a world that borders on the horrific. This is an immense credit to Cianfrance - because what we see unfold is, in a lot of ways, a very realistic plot about fathers and sons, and decisions involving money, careers, and families. But meanwhile, unsettling, even terrifying impressions land and spread through the story like a terminal disease.

What immediately sets the film apart is its straight linear narrative and triptych structure, or three ""acts."" This might be overwhelming for some people - the sprawling, multi-generational plot spanning two and a half hours can feel more novelistic than cinematic - but Cianfrance makes it work. The Place Beyond the Pines is not three films slapped into one, but a unified trinity.

Through these three acts, Cianfrance's great task is building up a sense of tragic necessity - and he succeeds. Dostoevsky once, in a bleaker mood, described the possibility of seeing nature as ""some enormous, implacable, and dumb beast...some huge engine of the latest design...a dark, insolent, and senselessly eternal power, to which everything is subordinated."" This perfectly captures the world of The Place Beyond the Pines; the characters ultimately appear helpless, thrown onto a dark, implacable, mechanized course that's chosen for them.

But there's more to it. Cianfrance also captures what he calls the ""eternity of every moment."" With long, lingering shots and documentary-style editing, he plunges us into the profundity of a given scene: of people situated in certain places, with certain dispositions, free to choose one way or another. So we're caught between two impressions of this place beyond the pines: either the fate of the characters is fixed - actions linked to other actions, people to other people, in a rigid, machine-like way - or it's the result of the chaotic skubala of human desires, of human freedom. Or, maybe somehow, it's both.

But all of this doesn't have to be as disturbing as The Place Beyond the Pines is, however unsettling the question of determinism can be. Cianfrance says in interviews that he was inspired by his own children, and he could have easily written a story about virtue, honor, dignity, strength, courage, conviction, tradition, faith - in short, purpose - passed from fathers to sons, and the same questions about fate vs. freedom in the grand scheme of things would be in play. (Think Forrest Gump: ""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time."")

Instead, the fatalism of Cianfrance's story haunted by a specter of despair, self-absorption, and moral obscurity and deterioration. Kevin Jagernauth, writing for Indiewire, rightly says that the film ""could be regarded as an allegory for the moral turpitude that has shaken the American dream.""

1359706431.0,75,self.TrueFilm,17oojj,Director trademarks. What are they? Why are they used? Are they important to a film? And do you know of any lesser known or obscure trademarks?,94,19,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17oojj/director_trademarks_what_are_they_why_are_they/,"I guess we should start this by defining a director trademark. I would say a director trademark is something (a name, a genre, a location, a shooting style, a specific shot, a sound, a song, a technique, a common cast, etc) that reoccurs throughout a filmmaker's films regardless of what the film is about. It's something that manages to work its way into a movie, or is simply something that is associated with the director. Some would say that crime / mob movies are a trademark of Scorsese. Kubrick used one point perspective a lot. Burton tends to have ""daddy issues"" for his characters. You get the idea.

But sometimes a director's trademark can be something much more subtle and difficult to spot. While it is very popular (and I'm sure most of you are already familiar with it), Tarantino is known for his trunk shot as well as shooting (with a camera) feet. It's known that Tarantino has a foot fetish, which explains why he shoots women's feet all the time, but what about the trunk shot? Even when there is no car available he manages to use to (the end of Inglourious Basterds for example). But why does he use this shot over and over again? Well, perhaps he simply thinks it's cool. Perhaps he once saw it in a movie and wanted to use it. Maybe he's not sure of another coherent way to show what's going on in those situations.

So, is any of this even important to the film? Does Tarantino adding his trunk shot add *anything* to the film other than a new IMDB trivia entry? I say they do. I think it's interesting because it can show us a piece of the director's personality. We may not fully understand it, but the information is there for us to read, and I like that. Michael Haneke uses the names Geroge / Anne is, I think, every single movie he's done. Normally the main characters, but when there are lots of characters he simply makes sure one of them is named George and one is named Anne. This goes far beyond simply sticking to a similar style and having the inevitability that something will come up frequently. It's a deliberate choice he makes. And that idea that some directors make a very deliberate choice to include something that doesn't really add anything to their films, is exactly what I want to focus on. I want to know if anybody here has picked up on anything that isn't on IMDB, that isn't already discussed on Reddit, and that maybe you're not even sure you're right about. The hunches and the coincidences that you can't look beyond once you notice them. Because I've had one for two of my favorite filmmakers for a long time now, and hopefully you'll find it at least entertaining.

Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the greatest filmmakers out there. I could go on and on about them, their movies as a whole, and their movies individually, for a *long* time. There is simply a ton of content in their films. When it comes to trademarks they are no different. They typically have plots consisting of misunderstandings, they use money as a plot device, they film things spinning (they film round things a lot too), they *love* to film people screaming, they use the same actors, they use the same DOP (which leads to similar photography), and they tend to make their characters very relatable by making them ""every day people"". They're also, to some extent, normally dumb. But there is something else that I've never seen mentioned anywhere. Sometimes, when I mention it to a friend and try to point it out, I'm told I'm over thinking it. I've been told that what I'm seeing is inevitable given the nature of the shot *around* the trademark...so I decided to go through all my DVDs / Blurays for their films and screen cap most of the moments I could find this afternoon to show that there is no way it's simply a coincidence or inevitable due to the nature of the scene or whatever else. It's a deliberate decision they're making and I really don't know why. So, what is it exactly that I've noticed?

The Coen brothers fucking love shoes. At first, I thought they loved low angles, which was explaining why I kept seeing shoes. A lot of their character introductions are through low angles, you see. But I started noticing that it's more than just a low angle. It's a constant effort to *include* people's feet and shoes in a shot that is often achieved in a different way by most other film makers. Sometimes it's not even shoes being worn, it's simply shoes. Other times, it's something involving shoes or feet. It's strange.

You may be saying to yourself that it's just one of those things, and that it means nothing...but I challenge you to find me another director that has used anywhere near this many shots of shoes and feet. It's crazy. I know I missed some, and I purposely excluded some moments in some films because it was too quick and didn't look good in a screenshot. I've also excluded The Man Who Wasn't There (because that one actually didn't have any shots I could use), Intolerably Cruelty (because I don't own that movie), and The Ladykillers (because I don't own that one either, but I remember thinking about my shoe theory the last time I saw it so I know it applies, I just don't have any screen shots to show you).

So check it out. And be warned that some of these images may spoil parts of the movie for you. So I advise you to simply not look through the film's album if you haven't seen it just to be on the safe side.

I watched it for the first time last night can't stop thinking about it. Such an odd little film.

I saw it mainly as a cautionary tale about letting the established order around you remain unchallenged, whether that be a government, religion, whatever society or way of life to which one might become indoctrinated, and a demonstration of the complete and utter absurdity (and ultimate futility) of trying to control the kind of information one receives by shutting out exterior influences. 

I thought of the Carl Jung quote: ""The achievements which society rewards are won at the cost of diminution of personality"". The father in the film has created a small ""utopia"" for his children to protect them from the harmful outside world. His is a meritocratic society that rewards achievement, seen in the little stickers and awards he gives to those who win his little games, while completely deforming the way these poor children see and experience the world, down to their fundamental understanding of linguistics and denotation. I could almost imagine the father justifying all of this to himself when they were first born, when he was still psychotic but maybe more idealistic, and over the years it just devolved into farcical insanity. Then again how you would justify something like this in the first place is beyond me.

Even if it's a film that's more concerned with its concept and themes than it is about character or narrative, I still really felt for the children, particularly the eldest sister. The way things ended for her, that was tragic, and the notion that because her fundamental understanding of the world has been so totally molded and mutilated by the father, when her anarchic instincts (or her innate drive for self-actualization) kick in and she finally makes to escape, she can only do so on his terms and her attempt is futile (assuming she died in the trunk).

I also really admired the way the film was constructed, gradually revealing information about the whole situation until we get a fuller picture. It's also shot very nicely, the framing is disarmingly ordinary and everything so deadpan that I was just more disturbed the more blandly everything was presented. It was also disturbingly funny. When the eldest started quoting Jaws in the pool and snapping her arms at the brother, hilarious and really unsettling.

I'm still a little baffled by certain things though. Like the significance of the father's factory, or the dog training. What was the significance of that? Was it just another potential scare tactic? Was it just to show how the father is applying similar principles on his children? I thought it was interesting how meek the dog seemed to be compared to the others in the facility. 

Lots more I have to mull over, it definitely left an impression on me but my thoughts are a little scattered at the moment.

My thoughts.,102,29,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1bj3d3/first_watch_of_requiem_for_a_dream_2000_my/,"Bleak portrait of drug abuse and addiction from Darren Aronofsky, telling two interlocking stories of a mother and her son – both afflicted by drugs, but under vastly different circumstances. Harry (Jared Leto) is a young addict living a spaced out life with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Tired of struggling from fix to fix the boys take it upon themselves to improve their prospects by making the switch from users to small-time dealers – but refusing their own product becomes their biggest challenge. Meanwhile Harry's mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) has a lonely existence in her dark high-rise flat. Widowed and with only sporadic visits from her junkie son for company, she finds solace in grotesque TV infomercials hosted by repugnant Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald) in the manner of an evangelical preacher. Her aimless life is rejuvenated upon receiving a call that she’s been selected to appear on television, and becomes fixated on losing enough weight to wear a glamorous red dress from her youth so as to look her best. Several failed diets later, she turns to diet pills that draw her into spiralling addiction.

The film unflinchingly depicts helplessness and dependency, never beginning to hint at any kind of redemption or salvation and relentlessly pulling the characters deeper into their addictions. Not primarily driven by narrative, these stricken characters are simply presented to us – so we can share in their declines and aspirations. But unlike the characters we’re able to see how, while they remain fixated on their hopes and goals, drugs are tearing them apart. Although drug abuse is shown in the most negative of lights, it isn’t moralised about – there is no good and evil, just unfortunate souls consumed by their own sickness. It’s this ambiguity that makes ‘Requiem’ so effective. The crippling effect of addiction is apparent but it raises countless questions that it invites the viewer to analyse. The theme of dependency on a substance, but also friends and family is raised throughout – so even if the concept of drug abuse is far removed from our own lives the reliance on others will resonate with everyone. Indeed Sara’s core struggle is no longer feeling needed – “Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got, Harry?”

This is a spellbinding piece of filmmaking with exceptional performances from all the cast – Ellen Burstyn in particular is remarkable as the vulnerable Sara - as well as frequently inventive cinematography and camera techniques that were groundbreaking on its release in 2000. Unfortunately the quick close up cuts of drug preparation and dilating pupils, and disjointed split-screen shots of conversations, have been mimicked and rehashed in everything from music videos to commercials. Still a great technical achievement, but as the film’s language has now passed into pop culture, its visual impact has been severely blunted. The same can be said for the music, a wonderful dark minimal score by Clint Mansell that sweeps over the jarring tactile images beautifully – but has since been repurposed as the theme for Sky Sports News (amongst others), creating an irritating distraction for any UK sports fans, especially as the main theme ‘Lux Antenna’ is such a prominent part of the film itself.

As with all Aronofsky’s work it engages physically as well as emotionally. He’s created a terrifying, grim world that feels entirely tangible, with close ups of bodies and skin that have the ability to make the viewer squirm in their seat. A thoroughly harrowing watch and an unparalleled study of helplessness in modern society, this is an exceptional piece of cinema.

&gt;[2011] [[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675192/?ref_=sr_3)] 

&gt;A Southern Gothic tale tackles eschatological themes, centering the coming apocalypse in rural America. Curtis (Michael Shannon) sees visions and dreams of a great, brooding storm that is sure to destroy life as we know it. Interpreting these recurring dreams and visions as premonitions, Curtis builds a storm shelter in his backyard. However, by doing so he puts great financial stress on his family, as well as emotional stress on the community, as they believe that he has gone insane. Nichols has crafted one of the most haunting visions put to cinema in all of cinema's history.

For any illiterate plebeians like me, *eschatology* is apparently 'a branch of theology concerned with the final events in the history of the world or of humankind'. What a great word. This film slipped under my radar completely so I'm looking forward to watching it. Jeff Nichols also directed *Mud* with Matthew McConaughey, a Palm d'Or nominee which was recently released in the United States (if that piques your interest).

Also for maximum transparency: this film and Kurosawa's *Dreams* were tied for upvotes, but *Take Shelter* had significantly less downvotes.

&gt;A great opportunity to discover classic films and debate how each culture/country perceived war and its consequences.

I feel the motivation behind this theme is to let us expand our understanding of global conflict via alternate perspectives of events. For this reason, I'm going to suggest that we exclude films that depict a non-*western* version of events, such as a British or Australian war film. These probably wouldn't expand our monkeyspheres in the same way that a Russian or German perspective would. I also think that Holocaust films should be discouraged, unless they approach the issue in a way that is sufficiently alternative to the narrative we are all undoubtedly familiar with (so perhaps *The Counterfeiters*, but probably not *Schindler's List*).

Tarantino's new editor isn't quite as good as Sally Menke was but the writing and the performances were excellent throughout. I actually think Christopher Waltz may have outdone himself. Refreshing to see a German characterized as a hero for once, to say the least.

The direction, cinematography, set design, and overall feel of the film paid great homage to the western without actually tripping over itself while attempting to do so. It had a touch of the old black-sploitation films to it but seemed to come off with verve. I explained it to my black roommate as a film done by a master (or near master at least) filmmaker with a keen eye for black culture. We see a lot of well crafted films meant for a global audience that borrow from British, French, and of course mainstream American cultural nuance. We rarely see a well crafted film directed from (not towards) African-American culture though. While I doubt this is the start of a trend it was interesting to see it done right for once.

It is a film that demands attention the first time around because of the rules of dreams. After seeing the film once, with an understanding of the formal rules, you can see that the film only has a handful of ideas.

A film like *Mulholland Dr.* is both a complex and intricate film. David Lynch's clues to unlocking the film reveal that the intricacies are merely a way of keeping the audience engaged, but there is much more going on beneath the surface in terms of themes.

Shane Carruth's second film *Upstream Color* is complex. There are no formal rules as to why things happen. They just do and the audience understands more as the film progresses and has to keep up on their own.

Can the disparity merely be the difference of being independent films or studio made? Or does it come down to the directors being at fault for deciding what level to engage and challenge the audience? For the record, I believe all three of these films are fine pieces of filmmaking. Just different.

And I really love seeing Soderbergh and Damon working together again; I was a big fan of The Informant! Not to mention some great performances by Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd.

What stood out to me the most was the control that Soderbergh held over the tone of the film. It's relatively light hearted and fun for the first half, despite us seeing Scott Thorson throwing his identity away for a lavish lifestyle provided by Liberace. There's a lot of humor infused into otherwise serious situations. Not to say Liberace is depicted as some monster. He's not. You see a very real, poignant, albeit completely fucked up, relationship between the two. The film doesn't try to cast judgement on its characters.

It takes these characters and takes them to a new level, building on the other two movies, and shows in a very real sense what love means, and the cost of ""true"" love, if it even exists. 

The style is the same as the others, both visually and narratively, so it comes as no surprise, but it's a style that still works and makes for a beautifully crafted piece of filmmaking. Richard Linklater is a unique artist. The only other filmmakers I can compare him to are perhaps Eric Rohmer or Abbas Kiarostami. When his career is all said and done, he will be, along with those two, among a revered pantheon of filmmakers, ones who challenge cinematic conventions and create something that reminds us of why we watch movies.

The dialogue, crafted by Linklater, Hawke and Delpy, is at its strongest out of the three movies, and takes the characters through all parts of their intellect and emotions, and always keeps you rights with the characters. It's realistic, hilarious, heartbreaking, and most importantly, honest.

 I find this series to be a great cinematic portrait of humanity, of people interacting with each other in a raw way that is almost more real that reality. I don't have conversations with people the way Jesse and Celine do, but I wish I did. I'm only 22, so I haven't aged with these characters or shared their experiences, but I ask myself the same questions they ask each other, and I wonder how the trajectory of my own life will compare to theirs. Uncertainty has plagued me, and many others, of course, with anxiety about the future. These movies and these characters, along with other Linklater films, have given me at least some hope that im not alone, and that finding your way is a part of life that might not be resolved for years.

Of course, many of these films were influenced by *On the Waterfront*, but what exactly separates them in quality from Kazan's original work? Does seniority play a factor in a film's esteem? In other words, because it was first, does that automatically mean it's better?

I have a couple of other examples of things like this, but I was just wondering why older is always seen as better, and why contemporary films are often scoffed at when considering the ""best"" or ""greatest"" of anything involving cinema. It's one of the most recently invented art forms and, because of that, I think that we are only now truly tapping into the medium's full potential.

While I enjoy this film like nothing else, it's odd to say that there is a character in this film that I have yet to fully understand or grasp... Dr. Strangelove himself.

It's been mentioned on this subreddit before that this film explores the conflict between the rational and the irrational, to which I would agree. I would say nearly everyone in this film is irrational. The only character I can fully embrace as rational is Mandrake. Though quite silly at times, he seems to be the only true voice of reason; which for me makes him the protagonist. My true confusion lies in the character of Dr. Strangelove. Why is the film named after him? Why is he so vital? Don't get me wrong, I love the character, but I'm still conflicted about his true intentions and purpose.

At first, Strangelove appears somewhat rational. He doesn't understand the logic of the Doomsday Machine. He goes on to suggest a means of survival in the event of disaster. Soon after, he begins to deteriorate, eventually fighting some kind of demonic inner compulsion. Stranglove's final declaration after standing; while memorable, left me puzzled as well. For me, Strangelove ended up being a goofball quack of some kind. Though I could once again have the wrong impression.

One other item that bothers me is one of my favorite shots in the film: After the wing is recalled and the war room begins to celebrate, we cut to a shot of Strangelove sitting alone within the darkness (http://i.imgur.com/NkU277b.png). He stares forward ominously, as if he knows it's not going to be okay. While a beautiful shot, that scene scares the shit out of me. In any case, I'm confused by this shot. This shot (for me) indicates that Strangelove knows a lot more than anyone else in the room. He's as rational as can be. He knows much better than to celebrate. It's such a powerful shot. But then... soon after... we watch Strangelove disintegrate completely. I'm left believing he's just another nutty character in the bunch.

I apologize for rambling and I hope that I'm not missing the point. I've just always been confused by the character of Strangelove and was hoping TrueFilm could shed some light on his true being and intentions.

Thanks in advance for any replies!

Since the first time I've seen this movie, I always felt that the movie is about redemption, and how these character get redeemed or saved. The one that stands out is Tom Cruise's character, Frank TJ Mackey, the reason he stands out is because his character goes through a total 360 through the course of the film. When we first meet him, he is in his prime and has got things working for him, and he moves towards something dark and depressing, and suddenly comes back to a happier place and changed, after his redeeming moment with his father.

I kinda wanted to have a discussion on ""Nostalgia Goggles"". I recently made a thread where I linked an article defending the Super Mario Bros movie as not being nearly as bad as people make it out to be (though still not great), and listing off various video game movies she considered worse than Super Mario Bros. You can find the thread [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f67ai/20_videogame_movie_adaptations_that_are_worse/)

I will say now, no, I'm not here to throw a shitfit because ""omg its a gud article gimme karma"", I just wanna have a discussion regarding people who wear these hypothetical nostalgia goggles, and in general what people think of using nostalgia as a defense for ""classic"" movies, and if it's fair to hold a movie in high regard, not because of it's quality, but because of the fond memories people share of the movie (whether that movie be good or bad).

I had linked the article in hopes that it would spur some interesting conversation, people looking back at some movies they may have really enjoyed and saying ""Man, this isn't as good as I thought"", or in the case of the Super Mario Bros movie ""Man, this isn't as terrible as I thought"". Instead I was simultaneously disgusted and surprised at the kind of comments I got, I was surprised because I've seen some truly great discussions come out of /r/movie, but with this thread I instead got some very *insightful* comments about how the Pokemon movies are really good and how dare anybody say otherwise, with such *amazing* points to back it up, stuff along the lines of ""It's a kids movie, you can't expect them to have really good writers like some movies"", ""It's a kids movie, it's meant for kids and kids enjoy them, of course an adult won't like them"", and many other comments about how it being a kids movie makes it exempt from any sort of criticism. 

What I imagine is that most of these upset commenters probably had some fond memories of the movie when they were younger (I know I did), but this somehow means people aren't allowed to criticize it, which I just don't understand. I enjoyed the movie as a kid like many others, but that doesn't make it a good movie, and that certainly doesn't excuse it from some criticism. I saw ""Escape From Planet Earth"" recently, and while the kids probably liked it, that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie (and it really wasn't).

On the other side, it is apparently a **fact** that Super Mario Bros is the worst video game movie ever made, and anybody saying otherwise is wrong. I think this train of thought is the opposite of the Pokemon one. Myself and others likely remember seeing the movie as kids and saying ""But this isn't anything like Mario"", with Mario being one of the most popular things going at the time, and now people collectively agree that it's the worst thing ever. But looking at it now I gotta agree the writing is fairly competent, it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as people made it out to be.

I know he's influenced some of my favorite directors (Woody Allen especially) but I've never gotten to see any of his work yet. I have to check out The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries very soon because this film was brilliant. Did anyone see how David Lynch could have been very highly inspired on Mulholland Dr for this film? The similarities were strong, but I've never read about Lynch being influenced by Bergman or this film at all. Nonetheless very surreal, artistic and some parts are pure mind-fuck, like the beginning 15 mins or so.

This isn't quite a movie people can explain with great detail or articulation unless they are perhaps film scholars, or they've seen it more than a few times and have dissected it.

This was an absolute masterpiece and it was a film that hit very close to home for me. I found this film fascinating for a number of reasons:

-The most obvious is Jack Lemmon's and Shirley McClane's performances. Both were incredible and captivating. Wonderfully engaging actors whose screen presence is overwhelming

-I found it incredible that Billy Wilder was able to so blatantly and clearly deal with the subject of infidelity during the Hollywood Production code. Not to mention suicide and depression. Billy Wilder is dealing with some very heavy themes here.

-I think Billy Wilder's take on the ""Beta man loves girl out of his league"" was probably one of the best ones I've ever seen.


I thought what was really great about the film was that the character Baxter was a very imperfect character other than being someone who comes off too strong and awkward. His desire to be seen as a ladies man destroys his reputation with his neighbors who he allows to see him as a reckless and constant partier. Furthermore, while taking care of Kubelik he encourages her to get back together with Sheldrake, a man who is obviously bad for her. He doesn't have the courage to tell her that she should stay away from Sheldrake and he also becomes very nervous when forced to confront her emotional problems. Instead of actually discussing them and trying to help her confront the problems in her life, he tries to distract her with a game of gin/rummy. Some may see this as him trying to keep her mind of her troubles but at the same time what Kubelik really needs is for someone to tell her to get out of the relationship.

The end of the film was rather bitter/sweet. C.C. confesses his love for Fran but she says the famous line ""Shut up and deal"". This clues into a Catch-22. Fran likes C.C. because he doesn't think of her in purely sexual way and is attracted to her as a person, unlike everyone at the office, yet if Fran were to date C.C. that would destroy everything that is so endearing about him.

C.C. is a good guy, but he isn't an ideal partner due to his inability to tell Fran what she really needs. Although the ending illustrates that C.C. is learning how to be honest and forthright with people.

I have so many thoughts, blar, it makes me want to vomit my ideas all over some ~~doctor~~ nurse’s face.



Ok, it was an amazing thrill ride from start to finish, with seemingly no filler, and so many nods to the original, with so many homages to the traditional themes within horror movies that I am gushing. **Firstly**, the gore. Goddamn was it brutal, raw, and unyeilding. No holding back on this mothafucka, that's for sure. It didn’t flinch from making you watch the most unsettling scenes, never letting you off the rollercoaster you get onto at the beginning.


The **editing** deserves a mention here, as it focused on the slow cringes, and cut through the creepy action quick-cuts like butter, mixing it up with abundant style. Specific nods go the knife on the knee, Eric's many new orifices, tongue+box-cutter, the limbs, the crowbar and his longtime girlfriend, and seeing the flesh crisp away from hick girl's skin. Probably one of the most disturbingly brutal gore-flicks I’ve seen, mixing Haute Tension with Dead Alive, if I had to choose two. 

---

The **acting** was exactly where it needed to be. Conveying fear and emotion through faces and whimpering was on display by everyone who had to do it well; specifically Mia outshining everyone. I assume it was also her (Jane Levy) in the demonic scenes, which showcased such a wonderful  character/motivational arc from devious, manipulating, demonic, terrorizing, malicious, redemptive, and then finally to surviving. Truly a great horror genre actor, Ms. Levy. 



Everyone else fulfilled their actions well, with good comedy thrown in to lighten the mood occasionally. Sometimes, in a movie like this, laughter is the only defense against the discomfort one feels when one sees a victim pull a hypodermic syringe from his eye. Pretty interesting situations, all horrific throughout, all capitalizing on the “demonic”, “evil” thematics. 

It followed the pentagon of Slut (in this case the girlfriend, and not very slutty), Hero (jock, athlete, etc), Intellectual (nurse/rationalizer), Moron (come on dude, put that book down), and Virgin or Final Girl. The things this movie does with the final girl are pretty spectacular, in my opinion. 

---

And while I don’t necessarily want to label the **ending** as a “twist”, I did not know what to predict. It certainly had my anxiety up even when all was quiet, and I really enjoyed the way things upfolded in the end. That literal bloodbath was beautifully excessive, feeling like a huge reward for enduring the horrors of the film. I struggle to call any horror movie “excessive”, but that was like a 10 seconds of showcasing the *moment*; it was a straight up statement, and I loved it. 

The **plot setup** of the drug detox was seamless, and the family dynamic really allowed lots of relatability within the characters. I’d assume lots of people have a friend or know someone that wasn’t a great sibling, leading to heart-wrenching familial troubles. Shit’s life, man. Such empathizing for the characters made my mood bipolar, waxing and waning whenever that fucking demon saw fit to try and test a character’s willpower and resolve. The lines of dialogue “why does my face hurt” and “I just wanna go home” combined with the minimizing of classic horror movie “fuck-ups” made the whole situation really hit home. Empathy overload, almost.

That’s another huge bonus. The movie **minimizes stupidity** by plot conventions and characters that aren’t clumsy as hell just for shits and giggles. My suspension of disbelief rested easy with Evil Dead because everything made logical sense, and I only had a couple minor grievances (see below). The characters were even portrayed as being skilled during combat, which is a departure from the genre’s status quo. Massive props to that shotgun kick and gas-can snag. As a result, it made for a truly enjoyable experience, if you know exactly what kind of movie this is – one that doesn't ever let up. 

---

I think one truly horrifying thing about the Evil Dead having demonic roots is that as an audience, it’s asking us to **question our superstitions**. Obviously the notion of an actual demon possessing people is irrational and any sane person would also (barring any meta-realization about horror concepts) laugh at a book that tells it to leave it alone. Fuck, most of us would just read the book aloud *to spite it*. I know most of my friends would, after posting a pic to Facebook trying to lick the nipple part of the skin on the book. 

But because there is that possibility that our superstitions or our rituals have some basis in reality, like the movie showcases, the horrors from the screen might invade our everyday life. I find this horror movie to be truly terrifying on that level. If a movie can make us question, for just a second, our own belief system and make us act upon it, it’s a success in more ways than one. The fact that this movie celebrates malice and what could only really be described as EVIL is an individuals’ choice to value or not. I leave to you. 

---

**Grievances: (spoilers, obviously)**

From one viewing, I was caught up by a few things: 

The Moron, Eric’s death seemed final, yet he came back. It made me wonder about what constituted a final ending to a corporeal form, if not suffocation by drowning? Should that not work similarly to being buried alive? This wasn’t clear but I don’t think it matters too much, as Eric came back to spook the shit out of us. 


The Slut, Natalie’s death was inconclusive and made me slightly confused. I believe it wasn’t important because I only thought of it afterwards, but her face was all nailed up, so I didn’t think it was a stretch to say she died, limbless and like lumber. However, it would have been nice to see David put her out of her misery (it may have been uncharacteristic though). Perhaps she simply burned in the fire, which made sense too. 


The one who arises, the female, at the end. Was that the female from the intro (which by the way, was presented amazingly)? If so, we are to assume that that one who rises is the last to be exorcised? Or was it another female? I didn’t care in the moment, because there was too much awesome happening before my eyes, but I am curious about explanations. I almost kinda wish it was Campbell coming back, but that would have been too cool for even me to handle, and I would have sliced my face off in the theater right then and there. 

As far as traditions within horror films go, it both had the pentagon of classic characters and skewed or tilted them, spicing them up. Each character speaks to parts of our psyche, and is symbolized as one of our primal instincts/needs, almost in a Freudian way. Many horror films expresses these ideas, and sex is often a huge one. There were no bosoms, boobs, or bodacious breasts in this film. Totally forgivable, but lets face it, everyone likes a nice pair every now and then, especially within a horror flick. There's also much consideration for their absence, so it's more of a discussion topic, not a gripe.

**TL;DR**
*The movie was unflinching raw, as it paid respects to both the Evil Dead name and classic horror tropes while maintaining the exact tension, gore, and escalation fans of the genre came to see.

1348378824.0,67,self.TrueFilm,10bylm,The ending of The Grey contained more character growth than the entire movie.  I recut it as a short film and would love your thoughts on how it changes the movie.  (spoilers ahoy),86,19,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10bylm/the_ending_of_the_grey_contained_more_character/,"I thought The Grey was going to be a thriller, an action film - something other than what it really was.  Every character was one dimensional and really not a single bit of growth happened throughout the entire movie.  The only saving grace of the film was the ending scene, but even that had some issues.  Ottway (Liam Neeson) had two big struggles throughout the film - struggles with fear and the will to live.  He resolves these in about 5 minutes when it's a bit too late.  

In editing down the end scene, I noticed a few interesting things.  One was there were two performances in that ending.  One, Ottway is angry at the wolves, wants a fight, has the will to live.  He wants revenge.  The other Ottway is scared, full of regrets, tired, ready to die.  Everything about these two performances was different in the movie - different lighting, different body language, dialog vs non.  When I cut the very end, he has two expressions - one is scared and the light is very blue/cold.  Immediately after the last flashback, his face is lit in yellow light and he's angry.  

I cut out angry Ottway.  I pulled out only the fear and survival aspect of the character.  I thought that viewing the movie only in this light created a different story.  He's lost, he's scared, there are a bunch of people that he either killed or was trying to remember.  If you watch the entire film, you see these people and remember how unlikable they were.  The scene of him sorting through the wallets has no impact.  Not knowing anything about them in the short version, you assume that they were good, kind people that he cared about. 

On a technical note, I ripped out all the sound except for two sound effects I liked plus the end line.  The rest is rebuilt using other SFX.  The music is different - all from the Ink soundtrack this time.  I also changed a lot about the wolves using real sound from wolves, not the weird otherworldly sound that the movie used.  Really bad design in the original, IMO :)

So here are a few questions:  was it too vague in this form, or did you build a story in your mind that gave you a satisfying backstory?  I think the beauty of short films is that every viewer has a different experience because of how they build the backstory in their mind.  Did the edits change how you viewed the character of Ottway?  Did the changes in music alter the mood any?

I'm talking about the predisposition to shoot with a shallow depth of field with mostly close ups of actors faces and a few perfunctory establishing shots all edited at a blistering pace of (on average) a cut every 3 seconds. 

Personally, I find this method of filmmaking inappropriate for 3D. (I'm going to disregard the question of 3D being a fad because I'm not in the business of telling the future) 3D, as far as I understand it, exists under the pretense that it is ""more immersive"". I find that a shallow depth of field within the context of a two dimensional projection assists the illusion of depth or three dimensionality but within the context of a ""3D"" projection limits the viewers' eyes' ability to roam about the frame. If I decide to look anywhere other than the subject my brain begins to hurt because everything else is out of focus. The same is true of a fast cut. I feel I would like to experience each shot for longer in order to ""live in"" it and since I have a desire to let my eye wander about the frame I'm less likely to be looking where the editor wants me to at the moment of a cut causing me a lot disorientation. 

I think that a return to a more Bazinian style of filmmaking would greatly improve 3D films. With a larger depth of field and longer takes the viewer would be able to look around the frame at will and really immerse themselves in the world that the filmmaker is trying to create.

Everyone has their own plotline, but there are also some more subtle ways that PTA characterizes their sense of self and what they do. My favorite instance of this is Dirk Diggler and the Brock Landers films. I always love a play-within-a-play or in this instance, a film-within-a-film, because it gives us some way to see into how a character feels, whether it's Hamlet or in this case, Dirk. Dirk is established as a very polite young man with a somewhat boyish and immature but well-meaning personality. Brock Landers is his invention, a rich, suave, and sophisticated James Bond type who does karate and seduces women. Or at least, Brock is Dirk's *idea* of how such a person would be. Brock's first appearance is in a laughably choreographed scene where Jessie enters a crappy looking restaurant set and walks up to the bar, where Brock is inexplicably sitting sideways on a bar stool sucking on a leftover olive from his martini while wearing a ridiculous and flamboyant three piece suit and sunglasses. He scoffs that they are in ""the best restaurant in Los Angeles,"" a line that Dirk delivers with such imagined flair that it comes off as campy. We later cut to Jack, who's decided this is the best film he's ever made. After the time skip, we rejoin Dirk in the 80s, who through the evolution of his ego and cocaine addiction begins to act more like Brock in his real life. What's so great about PTA's characterization is that we have a collection of characters who are either dumb or misguided and who in their own way truly *believe* that they are either refined or sophisticated while having no clue what that means. Even Jack, as charismatic as he is in his own circle, has no comprehension of how bad his best work is. It's truly a marvel the difference in perception PTA is able to create between the characters living in the porn world and outside, and he drops such incredible hints in the first half of the movie that as seemingly glamorous an existence as these characters have, they would likely not make it outside of porn.

It's made a billion dollars worldwide, is the highest grossing Bond to date, and it seems to be enjoying quite a bit of reddit enthusiasm.  

Does it go without saying that there will be spoilers?

I saw Skyfall on opening weekend, and while I wasn't disappointed in it...I certainly wasn't blown away.  In fact, I walked out of the theater rather underwhelmed by the movie.  The things that drove me the most bananas about the movie was the lack of bondgirl.  Or rather, the fact that a ""bondgirl"" was shoehorned in for all of 15 minutes before she took a bullet to the head, yet somehow she's still supposed to be significant enough to make it onto the damn DVD cover?? *sigh*....the other thing that made me audibly scoff in the theater is the fact that Q, the super-awesome-fantastic-masterful-computer genius who **states explicitly** that they're dealing with a madman who's *also* a super-awesome-fantastic-masterful-computer genius, and yet he STILL decides to plug this villains computer into the MI6 mainframe?  Really?  I admit that I'm NOT a computer genius (unless taking a semester of C+ in undergrad counts), but even I knew that plugging an alien computer into the entire basis of your operation is a bad idea.  Lastly, the whole M dying at the end with Ralph Feinnes taking her place just seemed a bit contrived, in my opinion.  I saw it coming from a mile away, and I really didn't feel a whole lot at the moments when the film was trying it's hardest to make me feel bad.

I know there are quite a few people who like this movie (you don't break a billion dollar box office income easily), so I'm just curious to know what it is I'm missing about this movie that makes people like it so much?  Yes, there were cool action scenes.  Yes, The intro song and opening was pretty cool.  Yes, there was a pretty strong set of actors.  At this point, however, I have no desire to see the movie ever again, not because it was reprehensible, but because I was bored watching it.

Spoilers.",90,27,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18hlww/film_discussion_spike_lees_do_the_right_thing_am/,"[Plot, for those who haven't seen it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_the_Right_Thing#Plot)

Just a bit of a preface, my mother worked at a video store so I've seen a wide variety of movies. When I was young, my dad told me about Spike Lee and his movie ""Do the Right thing"" where ""A lazy guy works at a pizza place owned by a white guy in a bad neighborhood. He steals, he's lazy, he's rude but he is never fired. Then when someone dies, He burns down his restaurant!"" That's it.

Fast forward ten years a coworker yells at me ""YO SAL(my name)! WHY AIN'T THERE NO BROTHERS ON THE WALL?!"" I am confused at this point but he tells me about the movie, so I go home and watch it. I take into consideration that that my dad is uhh old fashion.. Anyway I watch the film but I don't disagree at all.

I see the movie as this: 

* Buggin' Out is just trouble. He goes to someones restaurant and says the foods too overpriced and needs more cheese but he's wearing $100 pair of shoes. When Sal says ""Go somewhere else"" he says forget it and then complains that in an Italian American restaurant, why there are only Italian Americans on the wall. That the colored neighborhood is the one paying the bills and want a ""Brother on the wall!"". When he gets kicked out, he tries to start a ""boycott"" but only Radio Raheem would stick by him. So they confront the store owner.

* Sal bought the restaurant when it was mostly white but didn't move when it turned black. It didn't matter to him, He just liked making pizza and feeding people. He opens the store after they close just to give three people pizza. THREE PEOPLE. that's all. His older son is a racist. no doubt about it. His younger son gets along with everyone. When Buggin' Out tells him to make it the way Buggin' Out wanted, he just kicked him out. That's not wrong of him. When the shop is about to close, he said it was the best sales ever and that He is changing the name from ""Sal's Famous Pizzeria"" to Sal and Son's Famous"". He also included that despite how shitty Mookie works, he is **family** . 

* Mookie has a child and is working, but is lazy. He says he needs more time to make deliveries but he stops to talk, stops home, takes a shower and changes, visits his child's mother. He yells at his boss. Sal has a crush on his sister, a very beautiful Young black woman, who he makes special food for (which further proves that Sal is not a Racist) and Mookie tells her to stay away. Just to stay away.

*  Radio Raheem is a trouble maker who just walks around causing confrontation with everyone. His radio he doesn't turn off is playing ""Fight The Power"" by Public Enemy. When he goes to the store for batteries for his boombox, he swears constantly instead of asking. When He goes into Sal's playing loud music, Sal told him to turn it down but he got all pissy. Later, When Sal gets mad and calls it Nigger music he flips shit and the police get called. In an act of Police Brutality, He is choked and killed after resisting arrest. Nothing not wrong about that. 

This cause a riot in the neighborhood. They corner the father and sons and yell say that it is not his fault. Some member of the community try to settle it down, but everyone continues until Mookie throws a trashcan through the storefront window where the neighborhood destroys the restaurant. WTF is he doing? Sal just said he was his son! in the fire, someone then puts up a picture of Malcolm X and MLK  smiling. Doesn't matter, it still burns. The next day Sal is sitting infront of his burned shoppe and Mookie gets up and asks him for his weekly check. Understandable? the man just had his entire life burned down and the guy who started it is asking him for $200? Sal gives him $250 but mookie says he doesnt want his money and throws it back. After a minute of looking at it on the ground where he threw it, he picks it up and walks away. Thats it. Thats the End. 

Does that sounds like a Black oppression Movie? Anyone that have seen it that can tell me what I missed? I feel like it was Spike Lee telling me that Black people will always hate white people no matter how human they are and don't care if your White Black Asian or Spanish, just because you are white.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_18hlww,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18hlww/film_discussion_spike_lees_do_the_right_thing_am/,

Cinema is filled with huge reappraisals, films not received well or widely seen become hugely popular with critics decades after their release, sometimes scaling the likes of the Sight and Sound list.

I'm thinking of films like Vertigo, which was received with ambivalent reviews upon its release, or Tokyo Story, which was not popular in America until 20 years after its initial release and 9 years after the death of its director.  And now they're regarded as some of the best films ever made.  If I recall correctly, Keaton's The General was received poorly both by audiences and critics, yet it is also regarded as one of the best films ever made.

But I feel like I haven't really experienced that in my lifetime.  Maybe it's just my perspective being warped by only reading about these occurrences and not experiencing them, but it seemed like the 70's, for example, were a happening time for old classics getting dug up and becoming beloved.  I read about how Hitchcock and Ozu got national releases, and feel like I just don't see that anymore.

Still, it seems like there are a few films digging their way up, like A.I. Artificial Intelligence for example, that are becoming more regarded as classics, if slowly.

I have to wonder with the way the internet works, films must be much more widely seen by an international audience than ever before.  You couldn't have an Ozu anymore who just wasn't able to escape his country because, somewhere, somebody would see these films and talk about them.

So my questions are these:  Do these reappraisals still happen?  Is it just that they take more time than I realize to occur?  What films nowadays are being reappraised(like A.I.)?  What are some films that you expect could be reappraised(I know this is like listing, but, with the other aspects of my post, I still feel it will generate discussion)?

edit: Another question might be are there instances when films are instantly regarded as classics but later reappraised to be not as good?

And how does this affect the overall cinema landscape?",81,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hqfyx/with_advances_in_cgi_what_types_of_films_are_now/,"The inspiration for this topic goes to /u/prim3y for [this comment](http://redd.it/1hheyz), who pointed out the number of superhero films that are now being made simply because, for the first time outside of pure animation, CGI finally can accurately express a director's vision without breaking the fourth wall.  

Back when I was a kid, movies like *Star Wars* (1977) and *Superman* (1978) set a new standard for what was visually possible in movies, but neither created a perfect illusion of reality in every scene.   I remember when watching *The Wrath of Khan* (1982) that it would be really cool to see Star Trek ships battling as they were supposed to, with full shields and fancy maneuvers -- which at the time was technically possible, but not financially prudent.  Of course, that came along soon after in the TV series, and since has shown up many times -- but never without some visual artifact that made it clear I was still watching a movie.

With *Superman II* (1980) we finally got somewhat dramatic battles between super-powered characters -- but again, visual artifacts from the blue screen and other cinematic tricks were there to ruin the illusion, if I let them distract me.  Even much later movies, such as Sam Raimi's *Spiderman* (2002) or better Catwoman (2004) had laughably awful motion capture CGI that did little to sell the film visually.

But then you have films like *The Avengers* which was pretty well visually perfect.  I don't think it would have been possible without some of the advances that came from James Cameron's *Avatar* (2009) -- which undoubtedly had its flaws, but CGI was not one of them.  The real advance was the advent of natural, realistic motion capture sophisticated enough to have no human actors on-screen at all for much of the film, again without ruining the illusion.

That being said, the animation of Gollum in *The Two Towers* (2002) was brilliant, so I shouldn't say to say it was *impossible* before *Avatar*, but perhaps not as easy.  I'm also probably not giving LucasFilm enough credit, certainly with the ability to create visually dense yet totally computer-generated scenes.

Still, the *Star Wars* prequels and *Avatar* were groundbreaking movies that were expensive because they had to invent these new techniques.  Once invented, any director can now take advantage, and so the cost has and will continue to come down, at least without any more innovations. 

But to get to the point: with the advent of truly realistic CGI, there are really **no more limits** to the visuals that can be produced in film, and no movies that absolutely *cannot* be made simply because it would be impossible to recreate the correct look.  

So, how has this, and how will this, affect the cinematic landscape in terms of what movies producers will now attempt?  Will this create additional emphasis on spectacle for its own sake (e.g. the *Transformers* movies, or possibly the upcoming *Pacific Rim*) or will this give directors freedom to push the visual envelope?  

And how will this change the film narrative overall, and (given that life imitates art) how will these movies affect the society that views them?

The one thing I won't forget was that final sequence of the film. It captured me with its cold and somber quality. I guess what this post is is to see what the rest of you think of the film. I understand it that A.I. is a rather divisive film, with some strong detractors and some ardent defenders. At least from what I've read.

So, how do you feel? Is the mythic-like collaboration between Spielberg and the late Kubrick a successful blend of styles and sensibilities or was it a failure that didn't reach any of its destinations? Is it middle of the road? Is the craftsmanship poor or sublime? What did you love, like and hated. What did you take from it or what did you think was poorly communicated?

- &gt; 8 : really good films
	
- 7 – 8 : good films that for some reason are not wildly appreciated (maybe they have a bad execution, maybe they’re boring or controversial, …)

- 5 – 7 : average films

- &lt; 5 : there’s something really wrong with these ones.

And then there are some things to take in consideration, like

- “Fanboys” films will have a higher rating.

- Genres considered “less noble” will have a lower rating (for example, a romantic comedy above 7 is probably a really good one).

- The ratings are higher when the film is brand new.

Obviously these ratings can’t be regarded as the absolute truth, and just because a film has a higher rating than other it doesn’t mean it is necessarily *better*, but I find them quite useful. And even when I don’t really agree with the rating, in most cases I can understand why  is it so high (or so low).

So, why is there such a hate for IMDb ratings?  And for the Top 250?

[Here is the discussion in /r/dataisbeautiful]( http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1hn1l3/ten_graphics_on_the_bechdel_test_oc/)

I wrote in /r/dataisbeautiful about the test and my motivation to do the charts:

&gt; Bechdel test was enunciated by Alison Bechdel on the comic Dykes to Watch Out For in 1985. A movie to pass the test must meet the following prerequisites:

&gt; 1. It has to have at least two women in it,

&gt; 2. who talk to each other,

&gt; 3. about something besides a man.

&gt; The most widely form of the test used today added the necessity of the two female characters have names. The test has the characteristic of being simple, so easy to apply, and does not require much of a movie for succeed. However, a limitation of it is that the application to a single movie is debatable, since there can be many artistic choices that end up making the movie not pass the test (for example, Run Lola Run don't have two female characters who talk to each other). Thus its application is more interesting when applied to a set of films, since it may reveal patterns of how women are represented consistently in this group. The graphs present here subdivide the films into groups according to variables available on sites to try to find how each category affects the way females characters are represented.

I would like to hear a discussion about it here, in /r/TrueFilm about these charts that , I think, have some information that can lead to good discussion about the test itself and, depending how you see it, about how the movies industry represent women. These are some questions that I have (fell free to propose and discuss other aspects, I'm just trying to give something to start the conversation):

1. It's ok to evaluate a director, a writer, a genre or a country by this standard?

2. We had a recent period (60's to the 80's) that had greater tendency to increase women role in movies than now. Why this stop? 

3. The gender of the directors, writers and executive producer have a influence if the movie pass or not in the test. It's that something to notice? Or is normal that male professional will tend to tell stories with focus on male characters, with they have more familiarity to do so. 



As I said in my post I have little academic knowledge in movies. I'm a biologist who deals with data and when I heard about the test I decided to make these charts.

I would like to highlight  one thing about the charts:

It seems that Bechdel Test [measures very well if female characters talk quite as much as male character]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7XSm1mkVyMw/UdV6lJPlZfI/AAAAAAAAG50/CTMjWU0-d-Y/s1600/SP_BECH_EACH.png), but it don't measures efficiently if women have their roles around men. That's because is normal that any characters (independent of the gender) talks about men, probably because males have the primary role in movies. [Women characters don't seems to talk more about then than others and when female characters talk more about men than others men in a movie the Bechdel Test not capture this phenomenon]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuVdXpYymLA/UdV8xAq2tqI/AAAAAAAAG6Y/StKZdHhbzVg/s1600/T_SP_BEC_MEN.png).

By this I mean stuff like World on a Wire, The Matrix, Dark City, Total Recall, Inception, The Adjustment Bureau, etc wherein essential conflict involves the characters' movement between different modes of consciousness or identity (technological, psychedelic, spiritual, dream etc), often attempting to liberate themselves or others from an 'imposed' existence into a realm of alleged 'true' reality. 

The root of this trope in western narratives might well be Plato's Allegory of the Cave, tho it broadly overlaps with tenets of many religious and (counter)cultural ideologies. And I'd wager that its ubiquity as plot and thematic device in contemporary popular sci-fi cinema is due in no small part to Philip Dick's various explorations of meta-reality via technology, spirituality and drugs. 

As sci-fi, Upstream Color is unusually organic/mundane in its form of the parable but the same basic premise can be extracted. And so I'm wondering: I can't be the only one feeling really uninspired by this damn thing. Its certainly a very rich, malleable and poignant narrative tool (and way more thought provoking than Zombies, for example) but its getting old. I want some exciting and challenging new interpretive paradigms in sci-fi... where do we go from here? Am I missing something? How are some other, more novel tropes being explored on screen or in books?   

Finally, I'm most intrigued by Carruth's omnipresence in the creation of his low budget movies and I was really impressed that he clung to that DIY approach in his distribution of Upstream. I mention this because it leads to reason that today's availability of creative resources are such that there needn't be a significant gap of time between *The Thinkers* and their ideas being explored in *The Movies* (ie. PK Dick's 1966 short story wasn't adapted to screen as Total Recall until 1990, etc), especially for more concept-oriented low budget stuff.

Additionally please keep in mind that I haven’t read the book and books and movies are different just because a book wanted to portray something doesn’t mean the film’s director followed or even wanted to follow a purists vision that comes from the author.

I personally think this movie should have won Best Picture. For several reasons really to me the only true competition was Lincoln and after the Academy Awards I made an opposition thread talking about the politics of the awards this year. [That thread is here if you are interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/197c8o/2013_oscars_opposition_mostly_to_best_picture/)


This really isn’t going to be an analysis as much as it is my viewpoint on questions about the movie. Questions that I had people ask me and common questions about objects and meaning throughout the film that I don’t think most people would understand or noticed.

Again if you haven’t seen this movie spoilers are below so go see this beautiful movie then come back.

**Common questions**

What does the island represent?

The island Pi finds in the ocean. The first thing to notice about this island is that when viewed from afar the island is the shape of a man lying down. So what does this mean, what we find out is that the island is essentially everything a man would need to physically stay alive, for both him and the tiger. An endless supply of meerkats (or w/e the animal was I can’t remember) and food for both of them, but at night the island is carnivorous and Pi realizes that while this island gives me everything I need eventually it will devour me. This is because the island only has what is physically sustaining for men. 

Now there are two things to point out that happen at night. 

1.	He finds a Lotus Flow at night time in the tree branches
2.	He finds a tooth hidden within the lotus flower

**What do these two things mean,**

**The Lotus Flower** – “What did you mean? The God of Love is hiding in the forest?” remember that line in the film? Pi approaches the girl of his dreams and asks her about the interpretation of her dancing and why she made a certain hand symbol about love. He asks her was she trying to say “that the god of love is hiding in the forest” she offers no response but says the hand symbol can also mean “lotus flower”. Now later when Pi finds the island he sees a Lotus Flower in a place where it shouldn’t be. Up in the trees of the forest and when he grabs it and opens it he finds a human tooth inside and realizes the island is “carnivorous”. The lotus flower represents love, good health and purity. Purity because it is so untouched by impurity, a lotus flowers place in nature is in river beds or ponds. The flower rises from muddy waters to bloom beautifully and at night it sinks back underneath the water.

So my interpretation is that the Lotus Flower is showing him the lies of the island. First of all he finds the flower in an unnatural place to find the lotus flower they are located at the bottom of rivers not up in trees, so that is the first lie. The second lie is that the flower is holding a tooth inside. The flower is supposed to represent love, beauty, good health and purity. But he realizes that the island devoured a man before him and that this place was a lie and would devour him too. 

So what does this mean I took it like this, in the daytime human beings are social and come out like a flower and the island would give him his sustenance for the work day. 

But at night time in isolation, loneliness creeps in he would be alone without the sustenance for his soul, which is love and living life, staying on the island is the act of a person who would be apathetic toward living. Which is not how Pi believes he should live his life so he leaves, the unnatural lotus flower represent the lies of love that the island wants him to believe so that he will stay and be devoured. The tooth represents two things the island devouring the man on the island, but as we later find out it also represents that Pi may be a cannibal and his story may be false.

Side note: Although isolation isn’t necessarily a bad thing in life, that would be like saying very introverted people are always evil, it’s just not true. But in the case of art and literature, it’s often used as a tool to explain the human psyche, it has more to do with a disassociation with other human emotions than actually being isolated. See for instance characters such as: Daniel Plainview, Roger Chillingsworth, Gollum, in fact even Ahab mirrors this flaw which leads to his downfall.

Therefore the island acts as a sort of test in life to moving forward, it causes him to teach himself a lesson much like his Father and Richard Parker were teachers to him. Here he is applying their old lessons. He has to keep moving forward like his father asked his family to do when he moved them out of India.

**Were the events true or not?**

At the end of the movie Pi has to tell his story as a survivor of the shipwreck to the company that owned the ship, and they don’t believe his first story, the story he has been telling all along so he gives them another story…A story that interprets the original one as a story among people who murder and cannibalize the boat members. 

This is wholly up to the audience to decide. There are facts and interpretations to support both. However I have a problem with his realistic factual story, in the story he says this line: 

*“No one has ever seen that floating island since; you won’t read about those trees in any nature book. And yet if I hadn’t found those shores, I would have died. And if I hadn’t discovered that tooth, I would have been lost, alone forever”*, 

This is very true, how would he survive without food and water? Those are physiological facts, people say it’s because of his cannibalism but that’s impossible. Without being able to freeze meat it will quickly spoil and in a day under the hot sun the body would begin to rot and be inedible very quickly. You can ignore this and say ok well he survived some other way. I choose to believe that the island is real and so is his story. That’s just my opinion.

**But,** others don’t see it this way and the director (as well as the author) made some clear points to hint at cannibalism saving him as much as God. I already spoke about the tooth that’s one point, the other is the story he tells at the end, he tells it with a lot of passion and tears so you could take that as being the emotional trauma of having to tell the true story, (but you could also take that point for the other side as well). The next clue is the tigers name. Way back in the day Edgar Allen Poe wrote a story about a cabin boy named Richard Parker. What happens in the story is that a few men and the cabin boy get stranded on the open ocean after a ship wreck and the men eat the cabin boy to stay alive. The eerie part about this is that some years later a ship actually did shipwreck on the open ocean and several men were stranded, these men killed and ate one of the other men to stay alive, the man who was killed, his name was Richard Parker. Therefore we can say the tiger’s name is a clue to the truth of the story as well.


Now for what I believe is the most difficult question for people,

**What does the tiger represent?**

**The reflection in the eyes** –  Pi’s Father reprimands him for getting too close to the Tiger, the Dad states the when Pi is looking into the tiger’s eyes he is only seeing his own emotions reflected back at him. Richard Parker is an animal and will kill him. However later on Pi says that he knows that when he looked into the tiger’s eye he saw more than his own reflection even though he can’t prove it. 

These statements are largely my belief for what the tiger represents. He represents the whole mysteriousness of god and life vs. nature. Similar to Melville’s Moby Dick, who is a representation of mysterious God, both benevolent and malevolent. 

The tiger is a representation of nature, it can be trained to benefit you and respecting it can teach you about life, but to Pi he believes that when he looks at nature and at the world, he doesn’t see a cold lifeless world he sees God starring back at him. Pi sees the beauty of life, and even though God makes no call to him and says nothing to him he still believes in him, and that it was God who saved his life. 


*Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, he was watching. Even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering, he was watching. And when I was beyond all hope of saving, he gave me rest, then gave me a sign to continue my journey.*

Pi continues on nothing but the faith to be rescued or find land.

Similarly if Pi is the Tiger like he says at the end the themes simply go without God and like he said the tiger represents both his will to survive and the way that cruel circumstances will bring out the evil nature of men, Pi says about the French cook “He was such an evil man. But worse still, he brought the evil out in me. I have to live with that.” 

**So, if that’s what the Tiger represents what does Pi’s speech mean?**

*At the edge of the jungle, he stopped. I was certain he was going to look back at me, flatten his ears to his head, growl – that he’d bring our relationship to an end in some way. But he just stared ahead into the jungle.*

*And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life. After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.*

*I wept like a child, not because I was overwhelmed at having survived, although I was. I was weeping because Richard Parker left me so unceremoniously. It broke my heart... After all we had been through he didn't even look back. But I have to believe in his eyes there was more than my own reflection staring back at me. I know it, I felt it. Even if I can't prove it...*

*You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we’d been through, he didn’t even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it – even if I can’t prove it. I just wish… Sighs…*

*You know, I’ve left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India – I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived… And I know he’s a tiger, but I wish I’d said: It’s over. We’ve survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.*

**I’ll explain this by paragraph:**

1.	The young Pi at this moment in his life wants a cathartic experience with his friend Richard Parker the tiger. The tiger as a representation of nature and god he wants to know it has a soul a physical determining fact that it will turn around and say yes your right, but that doesn’t happen.

2.	He refers to Parker as the terrible one that kept him alive even though he says it with compassion, meaning, that nature is something to be respected and feared but that doesn’t mean you can’t love it even though it can be so cruel. Also some exposition there.


3.	He explains that the letting go of his companion was heart breaking. He metaphorically says that he still believes in God despite the lack of acknowledgement from God.

4.	He acknowledges his father’s hard lessons of using reason but that he still felt the touch of God in the animal.


5.	The culmination of the lessons his teachers had on his spirituality and thoughts on life. Between his Father, himself, the tiger and God.  He realizes that he truly believes he loves all of his teachers, but he wishes he could have said it to them, and that even though they are gone they are still with him in his heart and mind because he has accepted those lessons as a part of himself. Then he just says I love you and blesses them.


**SIDE ANALYSIS**

**Pi’s Father** - Pi’s father is an intellectual man he represents progression in India thus his desire to be a successful business man who has the only Zoo. He clearly loves his family deeply, he is pragmatic and doesn’t believe in God, this is implied when he teases him at the dinner table and promotes him to believe in science and reason. But this doesn’t mean that he is a bad person, he is a very good person who tried to teach Pi about nature, Pi thinks him a sort of mean person because Pi has the naivety of a young person to not realize that harshness can be seen as love too. That is why he is so tough on the young Pi and makes him watch the tiger kill an animal and tell him that the tiger has nothing in his eyes. Not because he wants to deprive his son of a friend but because he wants his son to live and realize that nature is harsh whether you believe in God or not and that if he wants to survive he needs to understand this.

**The bioluminescent whale**– This scene is a homage to **Moby Dick – Spoilers Ahead** In fact when Ahab dies in the book he is on a small boat just like Pi that gets crushed by the whale and he is dragged into the sea after harpooning the white whale, in fact there is a famous depiction of Moby Dick and Ahab that’s regularly seen on the front of the book. It’s when the camera is panned out and the whale is in the air, and we can see all the boat and the whale, it’s almost the exact same picture.

For reference:

[Moby Dick there are tons of these and this isn’t the exact picture I was referring to, but close enough]( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P5LlPD11kCg/UQGLBptYweI/AAAAAAAAFxo/dF6BfQ8J96I/s1600/RTMobyDick.jpg)

[Life of Pi]( http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Whale_final.jpg)


**TL:DR** – Pi is either a cannibal or you believe in miracles and God. I believe in the God part. Either way if your Dad, Mom or anyone that was important to you and taught you lessons in life that you ended up using and appreciating go home and tell them you love them and thank you for their help even though you didn’t acknowledge it, or else not doing so will be the hardest thing about moving forward in life.

For me one of the greatest achievements in cinema history and one of my favorites is The Decalogue directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski and Krzysztof Kieślowski. Originally aired for Polish television in the late 80s this ten part series of one hour films are some of the most original and thoughtful films ever made. Loosely based on the 10 commandments each film represents one of them well at best ambiguously. The stories are dramatic events surrounding the characters lives and the impacts by their choices and actions in regard to each commandment. The characters live in the same Warsaw apartment rise and interact with each other whether its just walking by or waiting in the elevator with each other. There is a on looker, a homeless man, who appears in some of the films who could have a higher symbolism or be just a onlooker of these peoples lives.

**Purpose:**

I want to spend 10 weeks with each week starting in order of the series dedicated to a thoughtful discussion of this series. If things go well then we can have a special recap of the 10 weeks into trying to put it all together and debate any connections, at all, between various films of the series. I believe that these films need greater exposure in the film community and are not just a made for tv mini series but 10 separate films linked by a common bond.

**OP's Remarks On Decalogue: One**

This is my favorite out of all 10 films and ironically its the first one. The story is about a man of science who questions the validity of science when it fails him. I won't give out details to avoid spoilers but for me it shows how there are higher powers playing in the world and that there is a God versus an atheist universe where science and reason are above anything. What I find interesting is the presence of values of human nature such as love, worry, and compassion existing in a world they believe is ruled by reason. Where did it come from if it cannot be explained? Is there a greater force at work and is the actions at the films conclusion a validation to not forget the higher being?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1ddovk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ddovk/ten_weeks_of_the_decalogue_decalogue_one_part_1/,

The first thing that I found striking about the film is it's marvellous camera-work, which I found to have an omniscient quality to it (which is effective considering the film's subject matter) – the towering shots of the city's buildings; the seemingly-effortless takes observing people in their homes; the camera gliding through the library all provided a god-like presence, resulting in an extremely potent viewing experience. This, along with the very rich soundtrack made the film's other features (such as the peoples' thoughts and the lack of narrative) work, where in any other film those same features may not slide.

The second thing I found impressive was it's use of colour, and how effective it was. When we saw the world through a human's point of view – in colour – it successfully displayed their ignorance to the universe or possibilities of life; this is how good it gets for them, in their eyes. Of course, colour could represent the way the angels *think* humans see the world – when in reality, they too could only see the world in monochrome - this would show the angels' sense of superiority/power (although this theory probably holds no weight considering one of the angels humanises himself, and proceeds to see in colour)

While I personally enjoyed the film I could see why one would not, considering it is very rich in style and in it's existential nature, which could make the film seem a little heavy. It's definitely a film I intend to watch again, as I feel there is so much more to it than one could possibly grasp on a first-viewing. This was my second Wim Wenders film (my first being “Paris, Texas” which I also thoroughly enjoyed), and I look forward to further exploring his filmography.

The themes in the film are so well explored, even when they are slightly brushed over, not to mention the stellar cinematography, script, acting, setting, and everything. Every time I watch the movie there is always something that I find different in it.

The movie was a box office flop, but apparently went on to become one of the most acclaimed Sci-Fi films ever, and probably the most influential movie to the Sci-Fi genre (in very close contention with 2001).

I've heard the fact that blade runner is very influential to the sci-fi genre post 1982, but I don't really see what movies it makes it mark in, or how exactly. I understand that before 1982 most sci fi movies featured pristine white space ships and a clear cut hero and villain, but even then A New Hope and Empire had their grimy and dark moments, and most sci-fi movies afterwards, in my opinion, still had a clear protagonist and antagonist.

Just as ""Cabin in the Woods""  satirically follows every convention of the horror/thriller genre, Haneke broke our every expectation through the antagonist Paul who breaks in and out of the forth wall and aims to frustrate and mock the audience. One scene on top of my mind that I think was interesting:
 
- When Paul forces Anna to remove her clothes, the camera lingers up and down between her face and neck, but we are never actually shown anything. Also Paul covers their son with the pillow case to ""preserve moral decency"" regarding the mom's nakedness, but he has no problem humiliating and torturing his parents right in front of him.

I tried posting a while back on r/movies about Malick but didn't receive much of a response, so I figured I'd post here and see what sort of discussion this inspires.

*The Tree of Life* captivated me. Perhaps more than any other film it has sparked and kindled my new-found love of cinema (immediately after seeing this I went out and watched all of Malick's films, and I love them immensely). Visually it's stunning, and emotionally it's managed to move me to tears. I think it's a profound and novel exploration of childhood and life at large, all played out on a gorgeous canvas of cosmology, existentialism, family, and Biblical allegory.

What exactly was moving -- or, for dissenters, pretentious -- about *The Tree of Life*? What worked or didn't work?

I've heard people mention Kubrick, especially in regard to *2001*, but I'm open to suggestions.

I think he's one of the more interesting big-time commercial film directors, but his stuff just isn't up to the same artistic quality as some other directors out there right now.

Another one of my friends said Lars von Trier. He's a more viable candidate I think, but I don't think films like Dogville or Dancer in the Dark, amazing as they may be, will live on in our cultural unconscious the way the films of other directors will, namely...

Paul Thomas Anderson (my choice). I think he's the perfect choice. Every one of his films is mesmerizing, a few of them I'm convinced will become iconic. People will be watching the opening of *There Will Be Blood* in acting classes in 100 years.

1369686763.0,61,self.TrueFilm,1f5ncl,"Blood Simple and the ""Idiot Plot""",70,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1f5ncl/blood_simple_and_the_idiot_plot/,"I've often been frustrated by movies which use the ""idiot plot"" as a central driving mechanism for the characters. As coined by Roger Ebert, a film which relies on the ""idiot plot"" is one whose central conflict would immediately be resolved if characters would reveal crucial information to each other, removing misunderstandings and diffusing conflicts. It's an often frustrating device used particularly in comedies, and one generally employed by lazy screenwriters who are more interested in keeping up the momentum of a film than earning their movie's big payoffs.

However, having watched the Coen Brothers' first film ""Blood Simple"" for the first time last week, I think that I've finally seen my first film which uses the ""idiot plot"" in a way that I can completely get behind, and which seems both intelligent and honest to the characters in the story. It's the whole point of the movie, in fact, and it's even reflected in the title - ""blood simple,"" or a state of mind defined by reduced judgment as a result of exposure to sudden violence. I'll be spoiling key elements of the film, obviously, but this won't really make much sense if you haven't seen the movie, either.

The basic synopsis is that a man (Marty) has hired a private investigator (Visser) to kill his wife (Abby) and her lover, also one of Marty's employees (Ray). Visser sneaks into Ray's home, takes Abby's gun, doctors photos of the two of them dead, then kills Marty, the only witness, after collecting his payment. Ray later stumbles onto the crime scene and, shellshocked, buries Marty in a farmer's field, in an attempt to save Abby from the consequences of her ""actions"" (he thinks she's killed her husband for obvious reasons).

From this point on, all of the characters dig themselves into deeper trouble as a result of not knowing one crucial piece of information; Visser begins to pursue Abby and Ray, convinced that they're onto him because he left his cigarette lighter at the crime scene. Ray suspects that Abby is denying the crime - probably to implicate him - due to seeds of doubt in her loyalty planted by Marty. Ray's coworker Meurice receives Marty's phone message accusing him of stealing money from the safe and confronts Ray, unaware that the (now-dead) Marty was merely trying to pin the loss of the $10,000 paid to the private investigator on him. Abby legitimately has no idea what's going on, as neither her nor Ray even know that Visser exists.

Through some combination of being absolutely shellshocked and rightly accepting the most logical explanation for what they're seeing and hearing, each of the characters winds up digging themselves deeper into the mess. It isn't until Ray notices somebody watching Abby's apartment that any of the characters really see anything that might have allowed them to piece together what's going on. Visser is given the true ""punchline"" of the film; after having shot Ray from outside the house and having been finally shot by Abby through a door, she tells him ""I'm not afraid of you, Marty!"" Finally piecing things together, and struck by the sheer irony of the situation, Visser bursts into uncontrollable laughter, responding: ""Well, ma'am, if I see him, I'll be sure to give him the message!"" Abby's dumbfounded. Roll credits.

What I really like about this film is its subversion of a worn-out trope in a legitimate way; while each character's behavior might seem unbearably foolish while it's happening, their perfectly legitimate reasoning falls into place as you consider things from their perspective. The lack of communication between the characters (communication which might have allowed them to work things out at least partially) makes absolute sense, through some combination of the nasty, confusing things they're going through, their legitimate application of Occam's Razor in coming to the most logical explanation, and the magnitude of the information that is missing to the characters (if either Ray or Abby knew about Visser and hadn't told the other, the lack of communication would have felt contrived rather than understandable due to fear and suspicion). All in all I'm a little humbled, as I'd already written off films which use the idiot plot and now have to consider that in certain limited cases it may serve a legitimate purpose. I'd like to use this thread both as a discussion of the film and as a springboard for conversation about other worn-out tropes that have been used in fresh and worthwhile ways in individual films.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1369712411.0,,,True,t3_1f5ncl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1f5ncl/blood_simple_and_the_idiot_plot/,

This is my favorite crime/gangster film of all time.  It features great performances from the entire cast -- Sean Penn is perhaps more physically transformed than ever, and delivers as a cowardly, shifty lawyer. John Leguizamo plays a kind of younger version of the film's starring character, and perhaps it's just his physical features, but he brings some Lucifer-like qualities to the role.  Luis Guzmán as a fickle henchman.  Pachino's great, Penelope Ann Miller's great.... even the bit parts, like Viggo Mortensen in a wheelchair: ""I shit my pants everyday. I can't walk! I can't hump!""  Even the Spanish guy who plays Saso, and doesn't speak a word of English... they all turn in stellar performances!
 
The suspense generated is on par with that of a Tarrantino or Hitchcock flick, such as in the pool table scene, or the final scene of the film in the train station.  I listened to the DVD commentary, and Brian De Palma said that the producers told him the pool scene was too long, and to cut it down.  He took it as meaning ""it's not long enough.""  He intended it to be a very taught scene, and perhaps they had only really seen it for the action at the end.  So he made it longer.  The producers accepted the new version, and it's the one we see in the final film.  Much like the train station scene, it goes on very long and keeps the audience at the edge of their seats.

There's so much more I could say about this film.  I just thought I'd bring it up since it gets mentioned so infrequently.

Brad Pitt and Scoot McNairy are the in charge Egos, James Gandolfini and Ben Mendehlson the pleasure seeking Ids, and Richard Jenkins and Vincent Curatola are the authority figure Superegos. In the film, Pitts' Jackie locks his Id away in jail and doesn't allow his superego any authority, thus staying in charge and ultimatly getting what he wants, while Mcnairy's Frankie tries to get his Id and Superego to come together and ends up dead.  

I noticed this another time this technique was used this year was in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's  Master being the dominate Ego, Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie the Id, and Amy Adam's Peggy the Superego. 

I found this interpretation to very interesting and offers a lot of insight into the characters and the story's. So my questions are, of course what are your thoughts on these interpretations and what are some other examples of this character structure used in film?

____________________

Film viewers are often bothered when they see a movie which gets details wrong about a subject they are particularly knowledgeable about compared to the public (either because they study this subject, or have had unique first had experiences with it).  These issues arise due to lack of research on the part of the filmmakers, the filmmakers not caring (because it won't matter for the majority of viewers), or the filmmakers spending less time on establishing these details correctly, since it might otherwise take away time from the film or obstruct important plot details.

I am *not* talking about implausible or unrealistic science in speculative fiction (particularly science fiction) films, which also annoy some viewers.  I also don't want to discuss accuracy of adaptions.  Historically accuracy in period films should be discussed here, especially if they take place in a period you've lived through, and better yet if we've pretty much all lived through it (like *The Social Network*, which is set in 2003 and beyond, but still tries to be accurate in period details).

Although I'm not exactly a mathematician, I regularly work with mathematics, so fictional or incorrect Mathematics can be off-putting and may decrease my appreciation for a film, such as *Good Will Hunting* or *A Beautiful Mind* (the math is right in this one, but the game theory is explained incorrectly).  But recently, I've been wondering if virtually any film that deals with specialized topics gets things wrong, and I just never notice because I don't have experience with these topics.  

So I'm wondering if you've seen some films that really represent your chosen topic well, but are also great films in their own right.  I'm talking about period-accurate details, correct terminology or jargon used as they naturally would, realistic portrayals of individuals and experiences, accurate ""props,"" etc.

A diverse lists of examples of ""topics"" to illustrate what I mean:

* Academia
* Law school life
* The restaurant industry
* Finance
* C-suite executive level jobs
* Chemistry
* Theoretical Computer Science
* Software engineering
* Law enforcement
* Priesthood
* Skater culture
* First generation Chinese immigrant culture in America
* Islam in America
* The 1970s punk music scene in the UK
* The Vietnam War
* Borderline personality disorder
* Drug addiction and/or recovery
* Gambling addiction
* Stand-up comedy
* Tabletop roleplaying
* Collectible card games
* Video gaming
* Fishing
* Horseback riding
* Roller derby
* Lacrosse
* Music composition
* Filmmaking
* Spending time in prison
* Hacker culture
* Stamp collecting
* Comic book collecting
* Psychology
* Polyamory
* Transgender people
* Religious conversion
* Loss of faith

Some of these things relate more to personal experiences and are therefore more subjective.  Chemistry is always chemistry, but different individuals will have different experiences in working in Law enforcement.

However after much thought, I can't really place it's importance in the context of the film, and I wanted to see if anybody else in /r/truefilm had any thoughts on it.

I'm thinking of specifically 3 instances in the film in which race is briefly touched on, but never fully explored.

1. When Martin Scorsese plays the man in the back of Travis' cab who is spying on his cheating wife, he makes it a point of specifically mentioning that his wife is cheating on him with a ""nigger."" He says the word with such venom and with a certain connotation that it's hard for me to believe Martin included it just to add flavor to the character, especially since HE was playing that character.

2. Early in the film when Travis is walking the streets, he walks past some black guys dressed to the nine in 70's fashion. The shot is slowed down and there is a definite tension as Travis walks past these men, between both parties. Is this just another example of Travis' alienation, or are these the specific people he means when he talks about ""the scum, the filth.""

3. For all the lip service that Travis gives to cleaning up the streets, the only real act we see him commit (besides the end bloodbath) is to shoot a black guy as he robs a liquor store. He shows no remorse at this and never mentions it again for the rest of the film.

I'm really not sure if I'm reading too much into this, and all these events are just parts of the greater meta narrative, or if Scorsese intentionally places these things throughout the movie to give it a racial charge.

I have heard one or two of the songs previously, but never watched the musical on stage or watched any previous adaptations. This puts my in a position where I had no preconceptions or prior knowledge of the story before watching the film. My views on the film seem to be slightly different from those I've read and those of my friends, this may be part of the reason.

I'd like to start off by saying that I didn't hate the film. I can't say I thought it was excellent either. I enjoyed it in parts but thought it was nothing special. There are some excellent points in the film, which have been covered many times so aren't worth discussing (Jackman and Hathaway were excellent, there were a few songs (I dreamed a dream) which were staged brilliantly). I also enjoyed some (but not all, we'll come to this later) of the camera work. In particular, there were a few 'fluid' shots which I thought were use particularly well. I enjoyed the sword fight between Jackman and Crowe a lot.

There were a number of things, however, which I disliked about the film. As mentioned countless times before, the incessant close ups of the actors grew tiring and exhausting. So much of the film was close ups of people in despair and sadness. There's nothing wrong with these kinds of shots, and if used more sparingly may have had a much greater affect. However, it almost felt as if Hooper was showing us all these crying faces and screaming 'THEY'RE SAD, BE SAD TOO. CRY! CRY!' Now, a number of people I went with seemed to lap this up and found it all very emotional, but I just felt it was far too unsubtle and unrelenting I grew tired after not very long. 

There are two other problems I have with the film, and they concern the storyline. Perhaps the storyline presented in this film may be slightly different to the original book or the musical, and if I had seen these before, I may have felt differently, but there were two plot points in particular which grated with me. They both focus on the representation of the revolution in the film. The first was Marius's progression. Throughout the film, he was seen as a young man from wealth who had seen injustice in this world and chosen to live with the poor and fight for revolution and equality. This seemed like a noble cause and a cause that we as the audience were meant to side with. The revolution was good, and the government was bad. After the initial revolution was crushed by the government and Marius was together with Cosette, he seemed to abandon these ideas of revolution and go back to living a wealthy and prosperous life and apparently giving no help to the poor. (Of course, he could've been helping the poor, but this was not shown, and at the very least he had returned to his life of riches, at least somewhat abandoning the poor) 

The second plot point I had problems with was the ending scene. The revolution had failed, the bad guys had won. The only shred of salvation in the film was that Marius and Corsette had found happiness. (But this was somewhat soured for me as stated above) This seemed like an appropriate ending to the film. However, then there was the final scene where all the deceased joined together on the barricade as if by dying they had somehow won. I argue that the revolution had failed, and the only surviving member (that we as an audience knew about) had abandoned the cause. It seemed strange tome, therefore, to see everyone celebrating. I may be missing something here, and please tell me if I am, but this seemed like such a strange ending to a tale of despair and defeat.

I've always enjoyed this film. While not without its flaws, many characters are well-defined and easily relatable. The film succeeds in being quite humorous as well. Though it deviates a bit from its source material (Daniel Clowes's graphic novel of the same name), it does well in conveying similar themes.

The character of Enid fascinates me. I suppose it's because I've been in her situation. She makes a lot of mistakes throughout the film and a lot of what she does is motivated by selfishness. While this makes her character a bit unlikable, I'd be lying if I said I was never motivated by my own interests. It's this mixture of irrational self-motivation and the incompatibility of everyone around her that results in her ""departure."" It's a situation where someone is angry with everyone and everything, including themselves. 

Aside from the conflict above, I felt the film did a fine job touching on a number of subjects: small city living, social outcasts, uncertainty of the future, societal pressure, conflict within friendships, and many more. I specifically enjoyed the humorous presentation of characters such as the convenience store's nunchuck wielding redneck, the out-of-touch art teacher, and the entire Blues Hammer ensemble.

All-in-all, I found it to be a very entertaining and insightful film. It ends on a bit of a sour note, but the presentation of the characters and the conflict really holds my attention through each viewing.

There are many stories about the excesses that occurred during the filming, here is an excellent documentary about the film and its problems:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcRiPLp4oU&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLCD053EC71B857D1D  if its too long to watch ( oh the irony) I will sum it up: The shoot went way over schedule. Sets were built then torn down and built again.

The out of control budget was in the press long before the film was finally premiered and instantly the critics were trying to outdo one another with their catty evisceration of the too long film. Cimino's first cut of the film was over five hours long! The studio chopped it down to three hours thirtynine minutes for the premier and then withdrew it after a week and postponing a worldwide release for a YEAR when an even shorter version was in theaters for two weeks and took in only 1.3 million. United Artists was sold to MGM and Michael Cimino's promising career was over. A few versions of the film were spliced together over the years but it was a very difficult film to see, despite its name recognition as a famous flop. A Criterion Collection version is now out (a ""directors cut"" apparently Cimino is happy with and which runs 3 hours 36 minutes) and I saw it last night and I have to say I did not like the ending and the female lead was miscast but everything else was great.

Some or a lot of critics (can't decide on one) and people on this and other movie related subreddits have said this film goes nowhere or has no set goal. i believe this view can be tempered if not changed to some extent. i don't know if i will be able to be the catalyst for that but if anything maybe motivate further viewing of what I'm finding to be my favorite PTA film.

The ending informs my take on this film. Where Dodd states as paraphrased by me that ""if Freddy has no Master then he has some unique insight into the world or is the first in the history of the world to be so"". The Master is a film about individuals seeking to control the ""base"" instincts emotions and emotional reactions to become something new that is not what they were before. Dodd in the first part of the film speaks continually about the animal or animal reactions and what humans are compared to what they should be. Processesing is there to take them back so that they can go forward as something pure, the ""spirit"". Freddy's character has from his posture and mannerisms to his manner of speaking the quality of an animal.

This film therefore goes somewhere for me. it goes from the beginning right back to the beginning. however the beginning is now different because of the journey. As i think about what i have watched more and more i am drawn to the research and experiments on teaching primates sign language. these experiments did not translate into primates who could express their feelings or complex emotions, instead you had primates who could name objects(I'm oversimplifying and do not mean to say Dodd is higher than Freddy).

Freddy is what we all are but to an exaggerated degree. He is a passionate man consumed by his emotions and his memories. He is broken in a number of ways. He is taken in by Dodd who sees an experiment and protege. Dodd uses his techniques and in the midst of that we see Freddy sort of moving beyond who he is and then reverting. We also see Dodd, the man who has taken on the mantle of being a revolutionary theoretical philosopher, not changed by his own discoveries he is still bound to the ""base"" animal instinct in a sense (the pig fuck outburst).

Freddy returns to the beginning at the end of the film still who he is but with the language of the Cause using that as a means to get off. He is a primate that can sign but still a primate. I have read that initially this film was to be the story of Dodd. It was changed to focus on Freddy however i feel Dodds story is just as important. He was made out to be the Master of many but he was not the Master of himself (if thats even possible). So in that, maybe, there is another movement in the film. Freddy lives knowing he is not the master. having been on that path he returns to who he was a twig in a fast moving river knowing a little more about the river but unable to do anything about it. Dodd however is a twig trying to move against the current or extricate himself from the river but moving in the same direction and at the same speed as Freedy. and maybe Dodds mistake is thinking that Freddy will not see him as The Master instead of realizing that There is no Master over all just master over self, which in itself is easier said than done if that is even an enviable position to be in.

More than A story about PTSD or a cult this is a story about who each person considers themselves to be and how much they think they can change that and how far they think they can remove themselves from the human condition. In that reading i consider this to be a brilliant film that follows the themes of many other PTA films i have seen.

watched the movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it.

&gt;If you were looking for a whimsical way to kick off the weekend, Michel Gondry is here for you with the first trailer for his upcoming film, Mood Indigo. Based on the 1947 novel L'Ecume des Jours by Boris Vian, the film tells the story of a wealthy young inventor of an olfactory-musical instrument (the pianocktail) whose wife develops an illness that can only be treated by surrounding her with flowers. Yep, it doesn't get much more Gondry than that. The film stars Romain Duris (The Beat That My Heart Skipped) and Audrey Tautou (Amelie) as the predictably adorable leads. The film opens on April 24 in France with a Stateside release to follow after. The trailer is stunning; however, just a heads-up, the whole thing is in French, save the Lumineers' ""Hey Ho"" playing in the background — because even in France, ""Hey Ho"" must be used in all trailers and advertisements.

A few days ago, having finally reached the end of my Netflix queue, I re-watched it. I noticed something I never noticed before. I'm sure many of us are aware of the mirror motif - if you're not it's simply that everytime Jack talks to a ghost he's talking into a mirror or a reflective surface - Kubrick's subtle hint that this is possibly all in Jack's head. There are other hints to everyone else's unreliability throughout (I've been told that windows and doors change places, but I've never spotted this).

With this in mind, I'd always been of the opinion that the true evil was inside Jack, and possibly the rest of the family. I found it plausible that nothing supernatural occurred and Kubrick was presenting us with a surrealist and off center portrayal of madness.

However, watching the scene in which Wendy locks Jack in the food storage and Jack begins conversing with Grady through the door, and Grady unlocks it. The only way this works is if something supernatural is going on. I never noticed this, at all. It's such a minor thing that Kubrick completely slipped it past me.

It is only after the world of ""second belief"" is violated within the work that the audience has to suspend their disbelief in order not to notice the lack of consistency in the inner reality of the world created. 

As a writer and director, I agree with Tolkien's definitions and incorporate the idea into my viewpoint and technique. Primarily,

""The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside."" 

I also therefore reject excuses made for many shoddily-crafted tentpole films in regard to having to ""suspend disbelief"" in order to enjoy them. While dismissed as ""mindless faire"" they actually cause me to work harder as a viewer.

###**THEME MONTHS** 
*^^^^dah ^^^^de ^^^^dah ^^^^dah!*

Yes, in an effort to promote discussion, openness, and film appreciation to the entire hippie commune of r/TrueFilm, we are going to try dedicating each month to a specific theme of related films. These may focus on, but are not limited to, the films of individual directors, ""Wave"" movements, genres, stylistic conventions, etc. The number of selected films will vary.
___
The theme for August is: **Westerns**.
___
Frequently overlooked among cinephiles, yet at the same time hugely important in the history of cinema, the Western was one of the earliest and most popular film genres to develop. From 1903's *The Great Train Robbery* to *The Searchers* (1956) to *No Country for Old Men* (2007), the Western has gone through countless re-imaginings, while at the same time influencing films as diverse as *Citizen Kane*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Star Wars*.

The films selected for review are as follows:

| Film   | Director    | Date of Discussion     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| [*Stagecoach* \(1939\)](http://redd.it/1jvxe2)        |          John Ford|     August 7     
| [*The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* \(1948\)](http://redd.it/1k3e2q) |    John Huston|  August 10   
| [*Winchester '73* \(1950\)](http://redd.it/1kcxjo)      |        Anthony Mann|   August 14
| *The Tall T* (1957)      |        Budd Boetticher|   August 17
| *For A Few Dollars More* (1965)      |        Sergio Leone|   August 21
| *The Wild Bunch* (1969)       |        Sam Peckinpah|   August 24
| *Unforgiven* (1992)       |        Clint Eastwood|   August 28
| *Dead Man* (1995)       |        Jim Jarmusch|  August 31

Now I know what you're thinking: 'Hey, where's \*insert acclaimed film here* ! Well the point of Theme Months is not merely to rehash the most well-known masterpieces, otherwise I'd have you all watch *Vertigo* for the rest of your waking days. This list serves merely as a general introduction to the genre, and hopefully you will gain a broader perspective and search out the masterpieces and hidden gems for yourself. In the interest of maintaining interest, we have tried to keep the actors and directors of each film as varied as possible. We will use the feedback from this trial run to determine the future course of this program.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you participate and enjoy the show!

I think *Prometheus* is a good example of a movie that came out recently that had some good individual scenes but frustrated so many people because it falls apart when you dissect its logic. This is a more extreme example, it's a case that plagues just about every big budget movie released and for the most part audiences are willing to accept these flaws. 

An example of logical flaws working into a movies favor in my opinion, the Batman franchise does it well for the most part. The practicality of how the villains in that franchise are able to accomplish their plans completely falls apart with basic analyzing. However, that same problem is why the villains feel so sinister in the movie. They have the city under their control. Not something I think you would be able to accomplish as effectively if you were writing with the worry that everything make sense. 

Is a scripts logic important to you in mainstream movies? Do you think it should be more commonplace having people that are good at pointing out these flaws co-writing scripts, perhaps just adding some notes for a possible revision? Do you see any downsides in having storytellers being held to higher levels of scrutiny for the practicality of their story?

The first time I watched the film I could not help but think how long it felt and how bored I was. This was much the same way I felt upon the first viewing of 2001 A Space Odyssey, but much like 2001 I found the second viewing much more enjoyable.

I thought most of the shots in this film were beautifully composed. Every shot looked almost as if it could be a panting or a work of art on its own. I felt Daniel Day Lewis did an astounding job at making his character a maniacal bastard. 

The last scene is what made the film for me, the whole film was a lead up for us to find the true nature of the characters of Daniel and Eli both in the end in the wrong in some way. 

I thought the score worked very well for the film. It was often subtle but helped build the tension of the film.

This is, regretfully, the only Paul Thomas Anderson film I have seen but if his other work stands up to this level there is no doubt he is probably one of the best working directors out there right now. This film had a very Kubrick feel to it without necessarily stealing from Kubrick.

I feel that the point of *Antoinette* is entirely missed by many expecting an historical drama and are unfamiliar with Coppola's style and use of themes to drive her films rather than an overarching story. 

Antoinette enters Versaille without any friends or possessions, latching on to the court and its frivolities in order to extinguish her sense of loneliness  (it took 7 years before Louis XVI consummated their marriage). She indulges in parties and spends frivolously because upon entering Versailles that is her impression of the court - she does this both because her own personality is oppressed by protocol and she sees it as the only way of advancing in a place so emphasising those qualities. After wrapping herself in the culture of Versailles and finding a place within the court she then discovers towards the climax of the film that the Palace of Versailles itself is isolated from the plight of France and the deteriorating political situation; she embraces frivolity and a lavish lifestyle in order to end her loneliness only to discover that she has simply confounded it even further - in her attempt to end her anguish she has invited even greater pain. 

Many have focused on the lack of historicity in the film but I feel that misses the entire point. The film uses Marie Antoinette as a vessel to her themes rather than a point unto itself - Coppola uses Antoinette as a backdrop to advance the narrative. The lack of investigation into the politics of the time, the causes of the French Revolution, and even the ending of the film (cutting with the March on Versailles rather than her at the guillotine) but again, the film is about Antoinette's experiences as a stranger in a stranger's land - the film is from her perspective and including these aspects would not contribute to Coppola's theme. If you go into the film expecting a biopic you will be disappointed. The use of modern music in this apparent period piece further reinforces that foreignness of an Austrian princess in the court of Versailles and emphasises the similarity of Antoinette's position with those that may be experienced in the present day - essentially Coppola is illustrating the timelessness of her theme.

1362588504.0,53,self.TrueFilm,19s73i,A look back at Silver Linings Playbook,94,41,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/19s73i/a_look_back_at_silver_linings_playbook/,"I've been thinking about this film a lot since Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for her role. The film was not a bad film, I believe David O. Russell was sincere with his direction but in the end the film came off staler than it should have. Particularly what annoyed me about the film was how it fell into rom-com clichés and the ending. But before I talk about the negatives I'll point out the positives. 

The wedding tape scene where Pat has an episode was acutely accurate and genuinely gave some insight into the character more than any other scenes. David O. Russell's direction wasn't mocking of depression or bipolar disorder and I think he made this film to raise awareness (to an extent) about mental illness. However, due to factors that I'll talk about, overall the film did come across at yet another Oscar ploy in the vein of films such as I Am Sam and Rain Man (and obviously Simple Jack.) 

My main dispute with the film was the last half hour or so. Up until the football game it was moving at a nice pace (although I would have liked a bit more focus on Tiffany) and there was plenty of room to look more into both their mental illnesses but instead what we're given is Pat gleefully hanging out with his therapist who is then racially abused and attacked. That whole scenario was completely ludicrous. Firstly, I'm fairly certain if you see your therapist you don't join them in a round of frivolity and camaraderie. A therapist is supposed to be emotionally distant from their patients as not to build a bond that will eventually be broken (see A Dangerous Method for the outcome of what really happens when a therapist/patient get too close.) Then after the round of cheers we're given a Crash-esque 'racism is bad' scene which ends with a plot device (Pat could go back to the psychiatry ward for breaking conditions) that is completely thrown out of the window the minute Tiffany turns up and says ""Hey, don't forget we've got to dance."" Which then turns into a parlay and thus turns the film from being a genuine sincere look at bipolar disorder into a 'will they, won't they' scenario. It was just too much for me to overlook and it became painfully obvious to me that they were going to win and everything was going to be fine. 

Which gets me to the ending where everything is fine. That was a real insult to my intelligence and to anyone out there who actually suffers from both depression and bipolar disorder. I know you could dispute that the ending was ambiguous as to whether Pat would get better but you're really clutching at a thin argument there. I would have happily accepted such an outcome if this film wasn't constantly being shown as 'the rom-com about bipolar disorder.' If the first half wasn't focused on his disorder then again maybe I would have let it slide but it was and I couldn't accept such an ending. Having one good thing happen to you isn't going to end your turmoil and to suggest such a thing turned the film from being a sensitive look at a mental illness to yet just another platform for some actors and a director to get some nominations. 

I was going to write a bit about why I didn't particularly find Jennifer Lawrence's character engaging and how she was more of a plot device than a character but I've wrote quite a lot. Anyway, what did you lot think of the film? Does anyone agree or disagree with my points? All opinions are welcome. 

**TL;DR**: Silver Linings Playbook started out as a sincere portrayal of mental illness and ended being another stereotypical rom-com that served as a platform for Academy nominations via the age-old method of playing someone with a disability.

There were very long queues. People wanted to see this slow, dark, brooding Swedish film on a big screen and were wiling to travel far and wide, and risk the entire journey being pointless (tickets couldn't be booked). 

At the time, working for a magazine, I asked them why they felt the need to travel this far. The standard answer was that something in this film spoke to them. On some level, they clicked with this film. I began researching cult movies for an article. I discovered that little liked films I liked - *Drop Dead Fred,* *Freddie Got Fingered* - had cult followings, particularly amongst child abuse survivors (which I am). I found that people I knew who worked in TV adored the film *Network*. I discovered that Robin Williams was utterly beloved by people who suffer from mental health problems (which again, I suffer from). Before I got anywhere near finishing my research, the magazine I worked for was swallowed whole by the depths of the credit crunch and I forgot about it.

Earlier today, I came across some of my notes, and it got me thinking again about this subject. What makes a cult film? Is there rhyme nor reason?

As they haven't seen most of them, I end up watching fairly mainstream films I've owned and not watched since my teens. It was because of this that I re-watched Being John Malkovich.

Despite the fact that I've often reccomended it to people, this time something happened - **I didn't like it.** Or, more specifically, I didn't like Lotte and Maxine. I dislike both characters and found myself sympathising with John Cusask's Craig more than anyone. 

On top of this, I found that the film seemed.. cluttered and messy. The tone seemed uneven to me this time around, as if Kaufman had so many ideas he was unsure which to use and just threw them all in. 

This leads to a different point I've been considering - when presented with these pop-surrealist films, do we forget about film ""grammar"" or general cohesion and just accept it as part of the films? Do these so called mindfuck movies get away with being looser and less tight than conventional films because of how they're done? Are we right to cut them the benefit of the doubt?

The Director's poll will probably be available soon, though the top ten has been leaked [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948):

1. Tokyo Story
2. 2001: A Space Odyssey (tied for 2)
3. Citizen Kane (tied for 2)
4. 8½
5. Taxi Driver [*I strongly suspect it's actually be Raging Bull*]
6. Apocalypse Now
7. The Godfather (tied for 7)
8. Vertigo (tied for 7)
9. The Mirror
10. Bicycle Thieves

The year given for *Taxi Driver* is 1980, so I think they may have meant *Raging Bull*, especially when considering *Raging Bull* is quite the favorite among directors, although it's curiously absent on the critics' top 50 list.  **EDIT: they changed the year on *Taxi Driver* to 1976, so it's probably correct. END OF EDIT**

Much is being made about *Citizen Kane* being dethroned on both lists.  I'm somewhat saddened by the poor showing by Kurosawa, totally falling out of both top 10, with *Seven Samurai* only showing up at position 17 in the critics' list.  Also noteworthy are *In The Mood For Love* and *Mulholland Dr.* appearing in the 20s on the critics' list.

I'm pretty happy for Tokyo story placing so high on both lists (no. 3 and no. 1), but it also really surprised me.  It's possible that people try to submit ""balanced"" lists in terms of directors, themes, purpose, style, genre, etc.  So perhaps *Tokyo* story is so singularly the best film of it's kind that it places so high.

Directors with more than two films on the list:

* Godard (4)
* Coppola (3)
* Dreyer (3)
* Tarkovsky (3)

I would have expected those sorts of numbers more from Kubrick (1), Fellini (2), Hitchock (2), Kurosawa (2), or Bergman (1), although maybe they need a top 100 to pack that much punch.  That said, Coppola isn't that much of a surprise, since it's always those three films.

So TrueFilm, what do you think of the lists?  What do you think are the place of such lists in popular culture, or serious film criticism?  Do they really play a part in defining the film canon?

While I love the original dearly, the brutal and visceral approach of the remake put it a step above its predecessor for me.  As an avid movie lover, and huge fan of Westerns in general, I have no hesitation in saying this could very well be the best modern western out there.  Although there have been some pretty great westerns in recent years, (I would put *The Proposition* and *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford* up among these) I have yet to find one as perfectly paced and properly tense as this one is.  While the cinematography isn't flashy, the film is gorgeous to look at.  One thing that particularly struck me with this viewing was the lighting and editing in the film, both masterfully done and contributes to the serious tone of the film. It takes itself very seriously when it could have gone a more playful and campy route, but it works incredibly well.  Each scene bleeds into each other effortlessly, and there is little to no filler.  Also, the performances by Crowe and Bale are some of the best of their careers. 

**TL/DR:** 3:10 to Yuma is up there as one of, if not the best modern Westerns out there.

What do you guys think of this film?

Firstly, Brandon Shaw is a delicious psychopath, perhaps an even better psycho than the infamous Norman Bates. 

Was wondering what people thought of Brandon and Phillip's relationship? Their co-dependency issues really provoked the sinisterness of the film. I also believe that the tension between them was much more than sexual tension or brotherly bond, it was very dark.

What did people think of the unusual style of movement? To me, the story felt rather like a theatre play, unfolding with the continuous takes. I rarely see this technique used so well; most notably the long scene where Brandon retreats to the kitchen to put away the rope, with the door swinging at that perfect moment to see his large smile.

I've watched Bond since I was a little boy, and boy was I excited for this one. QoS (Quantum of Solace) was not that good, which we know, but with Mendes behind the camera this couldn't be bad.

I've always liked Craig as Bond beacuse he seems like the kind of guy with a hard outer shell whilst being a bit gooey inside.

CR (Casino Royale) was, which we know as well, a reboot of the series, which started with Bond getting his 00-status, and QoS was a confusing direct sequel. But this one... This one I thought was amazing. Amazing according to Bond rules. 

We get to know Bond on a more personal level, whilst understanding why he's been so distant in the precious 21 movies: Every woman he's loved has been killed, and the person(s) he love the most (MI6) doesn't care if he lives or dies, as long as the mission gets accomplished.

When they got to the garage where the old Aston was stored, I got goosebumps. With the old Bond theme playing, it couldn't get more ""Bondesque"". Loved it!

I believe that one of the reason some people doesn't like this movie is because of the recurring Bond references. If you haven't watched the old Bond movies, you won't appreciate this one as much.

Maybe I've just been picking the proverbial ""low-hanging fruit"" of Korean films that are easily accessible in the US and I haven't been finding the truly great works, or maybe the films simply are not for me. I'm hoping you all can help me out.

First of all, [**Peppermint Candy**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247613/) (1999), directed by Chang-dong Lee (who has also done the very well received **Poetry** from 2010, which I have not yet seen), is the most interesting movie I've seen so far. It has a narrative structure that goes in reverse, first showing a suicidal man completely self-destructing, and then going back in time, scene by scene, to show you how he got to that point. It has a great lead performance and gives very illuminating insight into late 20th century South Korean history. Unfortunately, it's difficult/expensive to find (~$45 on Amazon), although I found a copy at a Japanese video store.

I don't want to get too long winded here, but I also saw [**The Host**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468492/) (2006), directed by Jong-ho Bong (who also directed **Mother**, which I also have not seen). I had heard a lot of good things about it being a great monster movie, but I didn't connect with it on any level. [**Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386064/) (2004), directed by Je-Kyu Kang, became the highest grossing film in Korean film history when it was released, but I found it melodramatic and cloying. [**Oldboy**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/) seems to be one of the most well-known Korean films, and while it was fine, it didn't inspire me to watch the rest of Chan-wook Park's ""Vengeance"" trilogy. And then [**My Sassy Girl**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293715/) (2001) is a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy that is very popular, but I didn't see anything special in it.

I realize that most of these movies are in the last 10-15 years, but I had heard that this is a ""Golden Age"" of Korean film making. I saw several older films at a Korean film festival I attended, but nothing that left an impression on me. So have I just not delved deeply enough to find the true gems (my guess), or is it just a case of me not connecting to what is out there? What are your thoughts on the state of Korean film in general?

Now I've heard this a hundred times or more, and while it seems pretty open and shut, I don't think it all fits. Maybe that's in there, but I think there's more to Eraserhead (or perhaps less). The Lady in The Radiator or The Man in The Earth don't fit in with this theory (nor does Henry's dream of his brain becoming pencil rubbers). 

So, r/truefilm, I turn to you as a bastion of excellence when it comes to film analysis and criticism, and ask you, what are you theories and thoughts on David Lynch's Eraserhead? Does it even have to have a meaning? (I lean towards no). 

My personal feeling is that the film is so unsettling, on a level that few films manage, that any meaning is beside the point. I'm affected and disturbed by what Lynch has shown to me, which I believe was his intention. If I have felt the effects of his intention, what should his meaning matter?

WWII saw the participation of many Hollywood figures: John Ford, John Huston, and Sam Peckinpah were all involved with the U.S. Armed Forces, creating war films, witnessing the carnage, and in some cases even participating in the battles. While it's impossible to determine the effect of the War on any individual's psyche, it's clear that the country, and the World, suffered a loss of innocence during the War years. Although the fighting ended in 1945, the paranoia if anything only increased. This was the era of the escaped War Criminal, the Communist Sympathizer, and the Red Scare.

In 1947, the House Un-American Activities Commission instigated the Blacklist; From now on, Hollywood would be divided, filtered, and persecuted by political affiliation. In response, a number of industry professionals, including John Huston and William Wyler, founded the [Committee for the First Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_First_Amendment), a political action group protesting HUAC's activities. Their influence was negligible and subject to open and hostile criticism. Many of the participants would fall under suspicion themselves and some, including Paul Henreid, John Garfield, and Edward G. Robinson, would be blacklisted. Humphrey Bogart, one of its most prominent members, would be forced to explain his actions in a March, 1948 article bluntly titled, [""I'm No Communist""](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khEGRvkO_nTSne4jDqCdtJ9aCXcPjhQaxVMExAVE_pk/preview).

Against this backdrop, films also started to reflect the complex psyches of the time. The wholesome do-gooder Western hero gradually gave way to murkier protagonists. An apt comparison is John Wayne's roles in *Stagecoach* (1939) and Howard Hawk's *Red River* (1948); the big-hearted fella has given way to a man deranged enough to hunt his son across state lines. The Western became less of a display of righteous values and instead began to toy with the psychological strain of frontier life, exploring how much a man would sacrifice of his integrity in the pursuit of self-interests. The enemies would no longer simply be natives, but also other gunmen pursuing their own ends. Thus, the Western, much like the Hollywood of the day, became a dangerous place filled with competing alliances and traitorous backstabbers, real and imagined.

#Legacy

Ironically, our 2^nd oldest Western also happens to have the most modern setting, taking place in 1925. This date, along with the atypical subject material, has led to some debate over whether *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* should be classified as a Western. The Writer's Guild of America seemed satisfied with the label, giving Huston the Best Written American Western award in 1949.

This is one of the first Hollywood films shot on location outside the United States. 

*Blazing Saddles* (1974) would pay homage to *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* with the misquoted line, ""We don't need no stinkin' badges.""

This is one of the favorite films of Stanley Kubrick, Sam Raimi, and Paul Thomas Anderson, who frequently referred to it while writing *There Will Be Blood* (2007).

Gorgeous film by Spike Jonze, with sublime cinematography and a heartbreaking soundtrack. Here's my interpretation of it, I want to see whether or not yours is similar:

Personally I think the whole thing is pretty Freudian and allegorical. It's meant to symbolise Max trying to come to terms with things about his personality that he isn't comfortable with. Things that as a younger kid he may not have noticed, but now he's growing up starts to identify his 'wild side' as something with the potential to hurt others- in other words, the beginning of a development of stronger sense of morality. All the Wild Things represent these negative aspects of his personality - fear, lack of confidence, etc, but Carol (the main one) represents the key specific problem to Max (the one that drove him to that allegorical island) - his 'wild' nature. 

Basically his retreat into fantasy is very much about psychologically reconciling the guilt he feels about attacking his mum. His time on the island mirrors his life before the island - the snowball fight/the mud fight to use one particular example, and then eventually Carol falls victim to his 'wild side' much as Max did when he bit his mother. When Max realises he forgives Carol for losing control, he manages to forgive *himself*, and after finally finding inner peace can return back to reality. 

I think it's a beautiful expression of what it's like to grow up. It's not necessarily about losing these negative emotions- the Wild Things are still there, they are not vanquished or anything - and it's not necessarily about how to control them either. It's about how to live with them.

1359190304.0,55,self.TrueFilm,17b4co,Looper: The rebirth of classic sci-fi,115,60,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/17b4co/looper_the_rebirth_of_classic_scifi/,"**I couldn't sleep tonight, so I wrote my view on why Looper is going to be a classic sci-fi film:**

It was last summer when I watched the trailer to Looper. It was a promising time for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as he seemed to be picking up gigs left and right. At the time it looked like another cash-in on this new A-list figure before Daniel Radcliffe is old enough to not be associated with wand jokes. I wondered whether JGL was taking it all in to quickly without learning to say no. Premium Rush had just come out and JGL was the lead actor as a NYC bike messenger being chased around by cars due to a package he was in charge of delivering (?). At least that was what the TV spots led me to believe. Let’s not forget his role in The Dark Knight Rises, his second work with Christopher Nolan (and hopefully many more to come between the two). Not surprising, I was waiting for JGL’s first bad casting decision because it seemed all too inevitable.

My initial reaction to Looper was the complication with time travel plots. Ever since Terminator 2, there hasn’t been a film that involved time travel and pulled it off (12 Monkeys probably comes the closest). The setback with time travel on film is you need to base the plot on it while fully aware of the complicated paradoxes that emerge. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban struggled with this and to this day it’s a well known joke around the fan base. Terminator 2 succeeded by never quite focusing the story on time travel but rather the consequences of time travel events. Looper seemed to take the second and dirty road. The trailer allowed just enough to know that the film will be completely engulfed with paradoxes. Why do they send these guys back in time to die? We get it, you need someone else to do your dirty work, but surely the writer could’ve used better story devices. Is time travel worth the risk? Why would you risk your audience over thinking while watching the film?

How wrong I was. Looper knew its audience. And it did answer my first question rather early. When 30-year senior Joseph Simmons (Bruce Willis) from the future and the present Joseph (JGL) sit in a diner, they tackle this issue head on. Let me allow the dialogue to explain my case:


&gt;Old Joe (Bruce Willis): It’s hard staring into your eyes. It’s too strange.

&gt;Joe (JGL): You’re face looks backwards.

&gt;Old Joe: Yeah.

&gt;Joe: So, do you know what’s gonna happen? You done all this already, as me?

&gt;Old Joe: I don’t wanna talk about time travel shit. Cause if we start talking about it, then we’re gonna be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws. It doesn’t matter.

&gt;Joe: If I hurt myself it changes your body. This is what I do now, change your memory.

&gt;[suddenly old Joe snaps in anger]

&gt;Old Joe: It doesn’t matter!

Looper screamed at us to shut up. It knew that we are looking for answers that don’t matter and wouldn’t solve the current problem. Just like the young arrogant Joe, we wanted to find a fault with the logic used just so he could dismiss the entire plot. It’s a form of composition/division fallacy that is quite common with audiences. I have been guilty of using that quite a fair number of times.

On the subject of self awareness, let’s not forget Jeff Daniels’ character that mocks JGL. He smirks, “The movies that you dress like, are just copying other movies. Goddamn 20th century affectations. Do something new!” Could the film be any clearer? And he, too, clears up on the confusion of time travel paradoxes, “On top of which, a man from the future runs free long enough — [in a disgruntled and frustrated voice] — this time travel shit fries your brain like an egg.” It is quite clear that the film knows that it stands on pillars that might or might not exist (Schrödinger’s pillars?). But the fact that it’s not falling, makes it pointless to worry about the pillars.

One of the classic rules of cinema is simply “Show, Don’t Tell”. Sci-fi as a genre benefits a lot from this. Blade Runner is a renowned Sci-fi film and I can vouch that its accolades stem from respecting this rule. Looper took lessons from this. The Mise-en-scene is full of interesting bits that we never quite fully explore. Here is where Sci-fi gains an advantage over other genres. Directors and writers get to take us on a tour in their worlds and allow us for the 2 hours to explore as much as we can. Minority Report allowed us to wonder whether targeted advertising was appealing or creepy. Blade Runner was filled with police paranoia and their omnipresence. These anecdotal memories are what stick longer than the actual plot. Looper introduced telekinetic characters who constantly played with lighters. It introduced eye-drops as recreational drugs. To some extent, it felt like the film didn’t even need a plot. The mere fact I get to live in the world for 2 hours suffices. A plot, however interesting, seems to act like a gateway into this magical world. The plot shouldn’t be there to hold together the fictional world. Quite contrary, the world should be large enough to hold up the plot and several others too. This applies to any fictional world whether in film, book or any other work of art. I caught myself imagining the despondent revelation of the telekinetic characters on their seemingly promising powers yielding disappointing results. The eye-drops drugs seemed to have an interesting story as Joe was quite addicted to them. These were heavy elements with equally interesting stories when compared to our main plot. Looper exposed these elements but never said a word about it. Leave it for the imagination.

In a time when the genre seems to be replaced by “comic-book sci-fi” Looper loudly reminded Sci-fi, “Do something new!” Ironically, ‘new’ involves going back 20 years and learning the core elements of classic Sci-fi. I would go as far as claiming that Looper would fit in any of the past 4 or 5 decades. It has easily established itself as timeless.

1352305540.0,52,self.TrueFilm,12swxf,"Couldn't find a single thing about one of my favorites ""No Country For Old Men"". I want to explain a few thoughts and take some of yours. (Spoilers)",68,16,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12swxf/couldnt_find_a_single_thing_about_one_of_my/,"Hey guys, No Country For Old Men is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's villain, Anton Chigurh, is one of the greatest singular villains of our generation; there is a lot of speculation about the meaning of the film. However, that is a very lengthy topic so I thought I'd focus on explaining some of the more controversial aspects.

**First let me explain the role of the villain Anton.** What Anton is **not** is a supernatural personification of death like in Ingmar Bergman’s the seventh seal. I think this is a common misconception; he is however an incredibly arrogant and incredibly talented killer. He has a god-complex, you can see this in scenes such as when he kills Wells and then speaks to Moss over the phone, he says to Wells regarding the money “it will be brought to me and placed at my feet” this is something only kings would say and regarding murdering Moss’ wife he says with frustration, as to Moss not understanding how Chigurh knows this will all play out, “it doesn’t matter where she is”. 

Anton believes he is an entity of fate. He believes he knows how things will go and only he moves through and directs fate. The best scene to understand this is in the Coin Toss scene, with the gas station attendant. He explains that he travelled from 1958 just like the coin did, it’s through the coin toss that we understand part of his twisted moral obligation, his only form of mercy is a coin toss, like a coin toss no one but god, fate or someone who could see the future can predict the coins outcome, it’s his only fair method of releasing someone, by allowing fate to decide. Fate brought you to him; Anton judges you and only fate can release you.

Anyone who “sees” Anton, by this he means comes into his path of destiny, is liable, and only by his determination, are they allowed to live or die.  Anyone who contests him has to die and anyone that denies liability must be tried by fate through a coin toss. 

The ending is a very important part of the movie because there we see that he is not supernatural (for ambiguity purposes: I’m not referring to the fact that he can be injured). When Carla Jean Moss refuses to call the coin she contests him by claiming no liability and refuses to select, normally he still makes the person call the coin however she does not. Anton kills her; however this causes disruptive feelings evidence by him looking back in the rear view mirror. I think he is questioning his “rule of life” and he falls out of his path of destiny into another one that he couldn’t predict or understand. 

Anton is then forced to get help from two young boys who he pays $100 for one of their shirts which he uses to wrap his arm. This action shows Anton passing into the age of an old man by requiring the help of the young and likewise corrupting the young boys with money and asking them to lie about the crime scene and say they never saw him. As the boys break out into an argument Anton walks off.

This is one of the most brilliant scenes of the movie because in just a ten minute period the Coen Brothers concisely defined and completed the nature of their villain. 

Anton’s injury and implied fall denies the theory of a supernatural existence. The theme of the movie is reinforced by showing the corruption of the young kids, but Anton escapes and his archetype of unstoppable evil remains. 

This is a representation of an outlook on how evil exists. As simple of an act as supporting evil by giving your shirt, for money and silence, allows evil to continue only by complete denial of engaging in it’s world, like Carla Jean, can stop it from existing, and ignorance does not absolve you from actions and consequences that could return.

**The Dreams**

The next scene shows Ed Tom Bell, after recently retiring from sheriff’s duty he’s not sure what he wants to do today, he then tells the woman he is with about his dreams he had last night.

""Alright then. Two of 'em. Both had my father in 'em . It's peculiar. I'm older now then he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember too well but it was about meeting him in town somewhere, he's gonna give me some money. I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up...""

**The first dream:**

This dream has some ambiguity, it’s really not clear when he says “I think I lost it” if he is referring to the money or to not remembering the rest of the dream. I assumed it’s the money.

My first thoughts on this dream were that the money represents the riches of the old generation being lost on the new generation. 

However, recently I’ve started thinking that the money represents the corruption and wrong doings of the old generation being transferred into the new generation. I’ve decided on the later because of the proximity to the previous scene where Anton gives the kids money corrupting them. This type of action, having two characters talking/doing similar things, was used throughout the film to create parallels between the characters. 

Example of the parallel:
Such as in one of the first scenes with Anton he kills the man with the bolt-action air pistol, he says to the man “hold still” and looking as though he is about to bless the man he takes his life. This scene is in parallel to when Moss is hunting the deer in his first scene and while having the deer in his scope he says “hold still”.

The second dream seems to be the more important dream.

His father is carrying the fire ahead through the night and cold. Fire representing hope, and going on ahead meaning the future; the night and the cold representing the darkness of the world.

He says the fire had the light of the moon in it, the only natural source of light at night-time. The fact that the moon is natural light may mean that the fire or hope is something natural, and since his father is carrying it for him this may suggest human nature being passed down from person to person. Hope is something that must be passed down for our future generations to survive. Take for instance the adage “a society grows great when old men plant seeds whose shade they know they shall never sit in”.

 This fire can only continue if someone rides ahead in the night to build a fire for when you get deep into the cold and night. 

Bell faces the cold and night in his interior struggle to be a part of the world when he re-enters the old crime scene, Anton isn’t there, but it’s the interior evil of Anton that Bell is imagining, before entering he pulls his gun, something he hadn’t done before, this suggests as an old man he is re-entering the young mans world, saying like he mentioned earlier in the film “Ok, I’ll be a part of this world”. However he doesn’t see Anton, but the fear of the situation and the events of chasing this criminal have enough affect to make him retire.

**A common question of the film.**

Why don’t the Coen Brothers show the death of Moss?

Most of my friends were really annoyed by this and at this point, it’s important to understand that Tommy Lee is actually the main character of the book and I don’t believe it’s ever known how Moss dies. But you might be saying people add and change things all the time isn’t it more exciting to see the fight play out? Yeah it might be more exciting, but this is actually brilliant editing, it supports the archetype of the villain. By not showing his death and forcing you to assume Moss is the dead man in the pool the scene greatly reinforces the arrogance and supernatural appearance of Anton. Additionally I don’t believe this movie was a huge budget so they may have done it because of budget constraints.

**The lighter tone took some getting used to**, especially after I saw the Extended Editions marathon in the theater last Saturday.  But it fit.  *Fellowship of the Ring* had its share of light moments, and it's fitting for the first part of the trilogy.

**There were too many action sequences and setpieces and they were far too unrealistic.**  Now there's something to be said about 'realism' in fantasy films, but *LOTR* was much more realistic.  In the first film, the most high-octane and astounding feat is when the stairs collapse in the Mines of Moria.  In the other two, amazing acrobats were typically reserved for Legolas, one who we know is capable of such feats.  But in this, particularly in the Goblin caves, the action was ludicrously unrealistic, ignoring the laws of gravity and probability.

Now these were obviously in place because of the 3D aspect -- the camera flies around, passing through the scenery, and is no doubt excellent in 3D.  But in 2D, it becomes transparent and you start to notice the length of the sequence.

**The lack of realism in the action sequences leads me to the overall lack of realism.**  In *LOTR,* every creature aside from the cave troll was done with makeup.  In this, it seems like a lot were done with CGI, even the leading orc, Azog, seems 'fake' to me.  All of the goblins seem digital, as well, particularly the Goblin King.  It's fantastic CGI, make no mistake, but it just lacks the texture of the creatures in *LOTR.*  

All in all, enjoyable.  Doubt it will garner any Oscar nominations beyond technical ones, however.  ",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_14u5ib,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/14u5ib/the_hobbit_discussion_thread/,
1355168760.0,52,self.TrueFilm,14mbsk,The art and use of over-acting.,66,14,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/14mbsk/the_art_and_use_of_overacting/,"tl;dr: Overacting is a real style used by directors and actors but is often dismissed for bad acting because of the culture of american film goers, when in reality it is typically used for humorous effect or to create a surreal atmosphere.

Hey guys I'd like to take a minute to talk about over acting and how it is used. Basically since American Cinema has no name for it I’ll just refer to it as over acting. However Japanese cinema does have a name for it, I believe it is part of Kabuki acting, which is the traditional style of theatre acting (I can’t think of the actual name for it please inform me if you know it). You can see examples of this in their cinema in movies like Ran, such as when the exiled emperor is going crazy.

American Cinema also uses overacting but because it is less understood as being a part of the style of the film and has no traditional stance it is often miss interpreted as bad acting and then people cast off a movie for the wrong reasons.

**What is overacting:** Overacting is basically when an actor uses more emphasis or animation than what a typical person would use or how an audience would expect a person to react, especially when the unimaginable is occurring.

**Why it is used:** Overacting is used for a variety of reasons and often depends on the genre of the film. In Horror and comedy it is most often used for humorous or satirical reasons. For instance the Scream movies, the killer ghost face is always over animated and uses cheesy lines to poke at traditional horror films where the Killer always seems to be able to easily kill the side characters but screw up when trying to kill the main character. It is regularly used in slapstick style comedy obviously for humorous purposes, the three stooges is probably the best known example of this. The collision of these two genres are great examples as well for instance Evil Dead or Cabin in the Woods, both have a tongue in cheek humor that effectively uses overacting.

Overacting in dramas is used to create a surreal feeling and that what your experiencing is more akin to something of a dream rather than something that is realistic or could actually occur. Perhaps the best director to use overacting effectively is James Cameron; other notable directors would be David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick, who have used over acting but not nearly as much in their films. James Cameron uses it to create a fairy tale effect. Kubrick and Lynch used it as a way to dull the violence and drama of their films and make them more realistic by creating a dream like effect.

Overacting is essential to Cameron’s style; it allows him to turn scenarios of a heartbroken drama into a fairy tale love story.  People often have said that a Cameron film is more of an experience than a movie, I would agree. While overacting is essential to his films they would break down if they didn’t have all the other elements to hypnotize them; elements such as fantastic actors, epic plots, stunning visuals and well developed score. But without overacting his movies would have more of a serious feeling to them than the fairy tale feeling. To better understand this I would recommend reading the scripts to Aliens and Titanic (in Aliens really concentrate on Bill Paxton’s character), just notice how ridiculously cheesy all the lines look on paper, but how when your watching the movie you seem to let that part slide by you. Cameron is basically using overacting as an element to his style which I would describe as semi-surrealist.

Cameron’s use of overacting does however differ from other directors such as David Lynch and Kubrick who use overacting simply for it’s surrealist effects to make things seem more dream like. The tones of their films are much more serious, violent and dramatic. For instance the staircase scene in The Shining Jack Nicholson is overacting as is Shelly Duvall as he explains to her how he is going to kill her and she poorly swings a bat at him. Lynch used it in Blue Velvet to take his incredibly strange film about evil believable by using extremely good actors to engage in these very weird scenes.

Overacting can be used in other ways as well. Another very well known and notable example would be Kevin Spacey in the Usual Suspect 

**(Spoiler alert do not read further if you plan on seeing the usual suspect)**

If you watch when he is explaining his story within the movie during the present time he can’t seem to deliver a line worth a damn, but during his flashbacks and explanations he is suddenly a normal actor again. That’s because as you find out at the end the whole story is a lie that he is fabricating as he is going, suddenly upon watching the movie again you realize he’s lying the whole time he even sounds like he’s lying.

I encourage you guys to go out and watch some of these films for yourself and make up your own opinion these are simply my thoughts about how overacting is used in American Cinema. Just because an actor seems to be delivering something poorly stop for a second to look at the film as a whole and see if it fits the style, you may find yourself having realizations about films and valuing them a lot more than you once did, and if you learned

I must warn you right up front though, if you think I'm going to make a case to prove Caden is dead, a homosexual or a woman you're going to be disappointed. In any case, I'm going to make an argument for him not being any of those and all of those at the same time.

The first thing you have to learn is something that in my case took a fairly long time to understand fully: sometimes, a piece of art doesn't have to have a definitive meaning. Please let that sink a little. I know some people like to think of art, specifically movies, as a puzzle to be solved to reveal the ultimate meaning. Truth is, some puzzles cannot be completely assembled. Any Beach House fans in here? Could you explain why a song such as Lazuli is so emotional even though it seems to be talking about nothing? It's because the selection and placing of words along with the execution of the voice and the music makes it emotional, and yet you couldn't explain what the song is about in the same way you could explain Adele's Someone Like You for example (not giving her shit though, I love her). Charlie Kaufman is someone who's very notably against movie clichés, in fact the whole ""Adaptation"" script revolves around making a non-traditional film and failing. He has repeatedly said he hates movies with an ending such as ""and it tuns out he was dead all along"" because it's a big cop out. So the first thing to understand is this, the movie doesn't have an ""aha!"" moment at the end to make everything fall into place, in the same way ""Eternal Sunshine"", for example, did. If you're not understanding the movie as it plays, you're not going to understand it when it ends. That's because you don't have to understand this movie, you have to feel it. More of that later.

I've been a Kaufman fan for a while now so I actually read the script for Synecdoche before they started shooting it, because it had leaked back then. The original script was even longer and had sequences that didn't made it into the film, and it didn't have some of the monologues that are present on it. But while I was reading it for a moment I thought I was reading a very free adaptation of 100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez. If you haven't read it and you dug this movie then please, by all means get a copy right this instant. Not only it's one of the most epic books you'll likely to read, it also shares many points with this movie. Synecdoche has a lot of magic realism, which was popularized by Márquez. What it means is that you'll have a dream logic running through out the story, and you'll come across impossible things that happen without anyone question it. In the novel for example (minor spoiler), there's a female character that is so graceful it's constantly referred as an angel. There comes a point that she is hanging laundry and all of the sudden she develops wings and fly to heaven, never to be seen again. This is similar to many of the things that happen on Synecdoche, so the first time you see it it's likely you will wait for a big resolve at the end that will explain all those things. ""Ah, I see, the character was dead all along, that's why Hazel bought a house on fire"". No, Caden was not dead.

So what's the house about? The brilliant thing about this movie is that it presents visual allegories all the time. By this you may think you have to be very intelligent to ""get"" the movie but it's not the case. Those scenes act both as allegories but also as jokes. On a personal note, I usually think the house represents Hazel falling in love with Caden: she developes affection to a guy that most likely will not love her back because of all the shit he's going through. In the same way she boughts a house that's constantly on fire and she knows it's very likely the house will kill her eventually, but she choses to do it regardless. That's why is so perfect that she finally dies the day they get to be together, it was her choice all along. I can relate to that because I also have made decisions knowing full well the outcome would be catastrophic, but you just can't help it. Now, what's brilliant about this is that you may see that scene and you can have your own personal interpretation, and if you don't make an interpretation then you can laugh your ass off because of how funny it actually is.

As someone who's seen the movie more times that I care to admit and seeing it on different moments of my life, I can assure you there are scenes that will make you cry the first time around and laugh out loud the second time. Take the scene in which Caden gets a call informing him of his father's passing. He's having sex while Sam's shadow lurk behind, the phone rings and a voice similar to the grown ups on Charlie Brown say something very quick to him, which it later turns out it was actually a really long, long message (""My father died... He had cancer, they said..."" etc). Cuts to a very tiny coffin being buried and Caden's mom saying they had to fill it with cotton to keep the body from rattling around. It's funny, it's very funny, and it's also heartbreaking and horrifying. Both reactions are great. The thing is, you have to watch the movie without trying to interpret it, just let it wash over you. I promise once you do that it will speak to you on a very personal level and will make you react in ways not many movies can. You can watch it 100 times and always get a different reaction from it because the story is so open.

So, what is Synecdoche about then? No one can say for sure except for Charlie Kaufman, but there are a couple of things that I think are pretty clear. Is not that Caden was Ellen all along, is just that Caden is everyone because we all share the same feelings of loss, grief and disappointment. We all think we are the protagonists. And yet as you get older you start to lose those things you thought made you special, and the line between you and the rest gets more blurry by the minute. That's why I don't think the ending is depressing. He finds someone that works both as a deus-ex machina and a maternal figure. He is able to connect with her for a moment, a true connection that makes him feel understood and cared for. It's not much, but it's really the only thing we can all hope to get. But again, this is only a personal interpretation. Keep in mind the movie's called ""Synecdoche"", so even when it starts it's acknowledging it will fail in the portrayal of what life is. Having said that, I personally don't think it fails by a huge mark.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1352010361.0,,,True,t3_12lhm5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12lhm5/about_synecdoche_new_york_xpost_from_rmovies/,
1351408852.0,56,self.TrueFilm,127m9t,David Lynch's Lost Highway,62,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/127m9t/david_lynchs_lost_highway/,"Searched and didn't find a thread. This is by far my favorite David Lynch film (I'm a solid fan for certain). I would love to see some discussion on it, especially interpretations as to what the overall film is about. To me it is a wonderful examination of guilt, memory, unfulfilled longing, paranoia, and the sense of futility in trying to escape yourself, both through your mind and others.

I see it as Fred murdering his wife after she cheats on him, which is one of the easier to understand aspects of the film. This is followed with him being imprisoned, where he then mentally attempts to escape his circumstances. Now whether or not this really happens supernaturally in the film's universe or if it is simply a mental/imaginary dream world, that's up for debate; if it's physical then it could be seen as his ""punishment"" and if it's mental then it definitely feeds into the idea of never escaping yourself, because then the film is quite the opposite entirely. Personally, in context with Lynch's other kinds of films, I'd assume it's a dreamworld.

To me I see him becoming Pete as Fred wanting to run away from himself and his life, hoping to overcome his sense of frustration and guilt while also wishing he could be free from prison. So he becomes a young man who unlike Fred has no solid worries or much of a past to tie him down. 

Of course it doesn't stay this way and it's out of his desire for a woman, Alice, that it all comes unraveled. To me Alice represents a lot of Fred's wife. She's a woman who Pete is in love with, yet he also is obviously struggling at points with the knowledge that she's slept with other men, especially in pornography. But, in this, it wasn't much of her decision, which allows him to cope. In reality Fred has no such way of accepting his wife's infidelity as she is willingly choosing to be with someone besides him. 

When they are later having sex in front of the car and Pete turns back into Fred I see it as him finally fully becoming himself again, and her saying ""You'll never have me"" as his own way of mocking himself with the fact that he murdered her, knowing he can never have her again. It's his subconscious speaking directly to him at that point.

He's reminded of his guilt and of reality but is still trying to escape it and by the ending of the film he is being chased down by the police; reality and his sense of guilt is overcoming him but he still is uselessly fighting it, attempting to escape as he drives down the seemingly endless stretch of road, lost in darkness. The ending of the film is to me him becoming completely aware of himself again and still wanting to break free of his reality so badly that he is willing to fight without any genuine chances of succeeding. He's lost in his own head and left with nothing and no one besides himself, encapsulated in his guilt and pain.

As far as the Mystery Man is concerned, I view him as a manifestation of Fred's guilt and paranoia. The sense of fear and dread, the threatening moments of his character, the phone call, etc. all to me indicate this and also the way in which while he's with his wife, the Mystery Man appears and reminds Fred of his home while he's at a party. Being reminded of his house and a man answering is to me the idea of him dealing with the suspicion of another man being with his wife, in a sense replacing him at home.

I see the idea of Pete and most of the film being Fred's desperate attempt at escape through a dreamworld/delusion backed up by my other favorite Lynch film, Mulholland Drive, which has a similar theme in which Diane is dreaming a world to escape from her empty reality until finally reality clashes and she can't escape it; in this case reality for Fred is himself and he can't escape himself, even after becoming someone else completely. It seems to be a semi-recurring motif in Lynch's films and I think it makes the film make the most sense.

Now I'm certain there are some flaws in my interpretation, and I know I left some things from the film out. It's just my take on it and I am very open to what anyone else thinks. Also how do you all feel this film ranks amongst Lynch's other films and how do you think it works with them? To me it's the perfect display of his dream-like film-making and his constant feverish sense of a distorted reality and really has everything I think of when I think of David Lynch.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_127m9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/127m9t/david_lynchs_lost_highway/,

I thought it was an absolutely horrifying picture of the intricacies of cults and how enigmatic leaders target and lure in their victims (there is an emphasis on young women in the film, but that is not necessarily limited to that). 

I was very moved by Durkin's cinematography, the extensive use of narrow focus and fine details he continued to place on the fringes of the frame as well as the presence of and manipulation of shadows in the settings established some of the tensest images I have seen from a new film a very long time. 

With such intense focus on Olsen that Durkin placed, I could not believe that this could be Olsen's first movie (although I was moved by her performance in the 1994's [How the West Was Fun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_West_Was_Fun)). There was seldom any time where she was not the subject of a frame, the entire brunt of the film's themes laid on her shoulders, [from the disciple of the esoteric, savage tribe she had sought refuge in, to also framing the the portrait for the victim of their predatory ways](/spoiler). She filled both roles perfectly and showed great versatility in properly capturing such polarizing positions. 

Ultimately, I felt the film became very existential and thematically involved in one's role in society. Considering the evolution of Olsen's character [from the birth of Martha, who died with her mother, leading to the birth of Marcy May with her ""new family"", and finally once becoming the harbinger of death in Marlene, she escaped and reverted back to Martha. Durkin crafted an entire lifetime in a snapshot of two years of a woman's life. As Patrick says ""death is the most beautiful part of life...it brings you to now and makes you truly present"", the tribe's insistence on existing is truly revealed through their own, as Martha faces the cult's murderous wrath, it is then that she fights for her life, the only times we see her long to be alive, the only time that she, as she claims to want, exists.](/spoiler)

The ending of course has been very polarizing, but only furthered Durkin's message on death [as the audience anticipates the murder of Martha, Lucy and Ted's murder, it is then that we are most interested, it is then that we fully understand Patrick's preachings on death for it is then that we truly exist in Durkin's cruel world as we sit in the car with the three of them awaiting their cruel fate with them](/spoiler).",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_x2s3l,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/x2s3l/martha_marcy_may_marlene_2011/,

(HEAVY SPOILERS)",66,14,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1gacqp/i_know_its_probably_a_little_early_but_i_saw_this/,"So, I saw ""This is the End"" last night, a film written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was really excited for it. I laughed harder at the trailer than I did in any of the Hangover movies, and it just seemed like a lot of fun and I liked all the actors and I thought the premise was pretty unique and the humor appealed to my sense of humor a lot so I was in. I saw it last night, and I thought that it definitely delivered. It was one of the most absurd, over-the-top, ridiculous comedies that I've ever seen, but it still had intelligence behind it, unlike stuff like the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. All the actors do fantastic jobs of convincingly playing just an exaggerated version of who they are. Danny McBride makes a joke early on in the film about Seth Rogen (which can be seen in the trailer) whenever he thinks the devastation that the group is telling him about is all just a prank, and he says ""That was a better performance than your last 6 movies, where the Hell was that in Green Hornet?"" and it's a funny joke, but it's also kind of true. Seth Rogen does best when he's playing a lovable stoner underdog because he seems like he would be that guy in real life, and he plays that guy in this movie to a tee. The performances in this movie are probably some of the best, most convincing performances a lot of these guys have given, such as Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, because you could see all of them really being these characters, and not just because they're playing themselves. They have small personality traits that give off these vibes of being lovable or being awkward or being a party-guy, and they recognize that, and so they really play off of those character traits and vibes with one another to create some really genuine moments and convincing chemistry. But, despite how over-the-top and raunchy and absurd this movie was, it also had deeper themes behind it that in some cases are pretty obvious, but can also be very subtle at times. The themes of this movie are sacrifice and selfishness. First, selfishness. Selfishness is most obvious in [Danny McBride's entire character] (/spoiler), but the theme of selfishness can be seen all throughout the movie until these examples. None of these characters are good, selfless people. Seth Rogen drags Jay to a party he doesn't want to go to, Craig Robinson [leaves Aziz Ansari to die and is more worried about a papercut than Aziz's fate just moments later] (/spoiler), Jonah Hill is nice and lovable throughout the entire first half but later he [prays for God to murder Jay Baruchel after the two of them get into a confrontation] (/spoiler), James Franco [hides food from his starving friends] (/spoiler), even Jay Baruchel, who is seemingly the most real and genuine guy there, is revealed to have [lied to Seth Rogen about staying with him every time he was in LA out of jealousy of Seth's success halfway through the movie] (/spoiler). These characters, who are supposed to be good friends and are all self-proclaimed ""good people"", lie to one another constantly, they backstab each other, they gang up on one another, and they fuck themselves over just to try and get ahead and survive longer. There are various reasons for this selfishness, such as arrogance, jealousy, bitter resentment, lack of sympathy, and fear of ones own death. The way the characters fight over simple things like rationing supplies is another key example of how selfish they're acting, or how some of them cop out of doing things they're supposed to do for the good of the group, like when [Seth refuses to go to an abandoned house and gather up supplies even though he lost the wager] (/spoiler). All of these characters are extremely selfish, and some remain that way until the very end (which I will get to later). Now, onto sacrifice. Sacrifice is an obvious theme as soon as the [religious/redemption plot line comes in near the very end of the film after Craig Robinson sacrifices himself to save his friends from the flying demon] (/spoiler). The movie is about these characters overcoming their extremely selfish attitudes and behaviors and instead learning that sacrifice in order to help save and protect their fellow man is a much more honorable, noble way to live and is the only way to redeem their selfish actions. But the thing is, not all of these characters learn that. [Franco is arrogant until the bitter end and his sacrifice in the name of Jay and Seth is just a ploy for him to get into heaven] (/spoiler), [Jonah Hill is so consumed by his envy towards Seth and Jay's friendship he prays for God to murder Jay and thus ends up literally getting possessed by a demon] (/spoiler), and [Danny McBride starts a fucking cannibalistic cult] (/spoiler). These guys are consumed are all consumed with envy, arrogance, anger, bitterness, and greed. The only people who make it are [Craig Robinson because he sacrifices himself to let his friends escape] (/spoiler), [Jay Baruchel because he is fully honest with Seth] (/spoiler), and [Seth Rogen because he accepts his fate and allows Jay to move on to Heaven, despite whatever consequences he may face] (/spoiler). These guys all mature out of their selfish, negative actions into honest, content, good people. This film just uses the apocalypse in order to allow these characters who are all so consumed by greed, lust, gluttony, and the rest of those sins to grow and mature and redeem themselves through sacrifice, honesty, and selfless deeds. I found it to be surprisingly deep once I took a closer look at it, and I also thought it was very funny, so if you haven't seen it, and this type of film appeals to you, I would recommend it.

You won't like it at first, you will think it looks like a video game or a kids show. But the added information, coupled with the new possible areas of creativity it brings us will usher in a whole new era of film making. Mark my words.

Live action looks more like really good CG and subsequently good CG looks more like live action. Once we adjust to the new format we will no longer be able to tell generated artifacts from the real thing which will add greatly to immersion. 

Action scenes are crisp and lively. Color saturation is fantastically present (improving 3D a great deal I might add).

It's a bit off putting at first and in particular scenes involving actors seem almost ugly at times. However, landscapes right from the get go look amazing. The setting of the film comes alive in a way that almost makes it the central character in the film. Again, I think this is a good thing.

I can say a lot and I'm sure others will disagree with me but I believe we are part of a great change in cinema and I for one intend to explore it to it's fullest extent.

EDIT: I suppose I should add that The Hobbit has it's flaws, no doubt. Watching Jackson wield HFR is a bit like watching a kid with a new toy. However, my assertion is that 48fps changes things so much that it will take us time to figure out just what it is capable of.

In this article I propose that if we look at Malick's films as examples of hermeneutic circles from Heideggarian philosophy then the apparent ambiguity in his films is no longer problematic. Please bear with the length of this post, its necessary to really cover the issue. 

Article Text: Interpreting Malick

Its been almost a year since Terrence Malick released the enigmatic “Tree of Life”, and it seems that critics have arrived at a consensus. While it was received with high praise, in almost every review there is a caveat--either the film didn't have a clear meaning, it wasn't cohesive enough or it needed another round of editing. Although Terrence Malick's films are not above reproach it is surprising that critics tend to focus on the elements of Malick's directing that set him apart from other filmmakers. If Malick were to take the advice of his detractors he would probably become a more focused storyteller, but he would also no longer be Malick. It is the meandering narrative and initially obscure meanings that have earned Malick so much respect. So how is it that Mallick earns praise and criticism for the same aspects of his work? 
Malick is making films from a different perspective than any other contemporary filmmaker, and so our tools for analyzing movies don’t fit his unique style. However, if we could understand the perspective from which Malick is working then maybe can begin to analyze the esoteric aspects of his films.

Although little is known about the reclusive Malick, we do know that before his career as a filmmaker he spent a large amount of time studying the work of one philosopher: Martin Heidegger. It is possible that Malick’s influence from Heidegger could provide path to interpreting his work.
	
Malick and Heidegger

Before becoming a filmmaker Malick had a promising start as a philosopher. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from Harvard and did graduate work as a Rhodes scholar in german philosophy. After teaching at MIT and still in his twenties he traveled to Germany and met with Martin Heidegger before publishing a translation of Heidegger's “The Essence of Reasons”.

It is tempting to over-emphasize Malick's background in philosophy when analyzing his films. Malick’s background would suggest that Heideggerian thought was a strong influence on his own personal philosophy. However any attempts to connect the philosophy embodied in Malick's work and Heideggerian themes has been fruitless. In fact many themes in Malick's films hint at metaphysical concepts that heidegger would have rejected outright.

If we can trace any influence of Heidegger on Malick's work it is in his methodology, particularly in the way the Heidegger answered questions. In his early work, Heidegger developed a method for avoiding the circular logic that was the downfall of many philosophers before him. Heidegger’s “hermeneutic circle” is a technique for discovering knowledge without relying on assumptions. Thinkers before heidegger would assume a proposition, use that proposition to draw conclusions about reality and then mistakenly use those conclusions to support their original proposition. This seems like an obvious mistake to make but the difficulty of philosophical writing tends to hide circular fallacies from even the most brilliant minds.
Heidegger realized that since all ideas are related to each other it is impossible to avoid circular thinking entirely. The questions was how to use the circular nature of ideas without falling prey to logical fallacies. To do that Heidegger would jump into the circle with a rough outline of a particular idea and then instead of immediately drawing conclusions, he would explore the relationships between his ideas to discover their finer details. Once he was able to get a better picture of how his ideas fit together Heidegger would begin again at his original starting point with a better outline. By repeating this cycle, Heidegger believed he could discover an accurate foundation for knowledge, like uncovering the foundations of a building—with each shovel full of dirt you take away you get a better idea of what lies beneath the surface and where next to dig.

Mallick’s Hermeneutics

Terrence Mallick seems to employ a variation of the hermeneutic circle in his films, and it may be for this reason that some people view his work as ambiguous or unsatisfying. Most films follow a very familiar formula: we have conflict, rising action, climax and resolution. While Malick clearly violates this traditional structure by interrupting it with poetic montages of images of nature, music and voiced questions, his most drastic break from tradition is in the way he develops themes.

In this sense he bears influence from Heidegger's hermeneutic circle. Movies that try to convey an idea have a formula, they propose evidence—often in character's experiences—and arrive at a conclusion. Malick takes this formula and blends it together so that its almost unrecognizable. But even after he puts it all together again, it ends up looking a lot like a hermeneutic circle. Malick begins his circle with narrative.

Narrative is key to Malick’s process. It creates opportunities to ask questions. These questions can be phrased in voice-overs, through mis-en-scen, or even in conflict between characters, but each of these questions serves the same purpose: they throw the viewer into the hermeneutic circle by  asking a question. Once a question has been expressed Malick directs his narrative to explore these questions, giving us situations to see our answers affirmed or challenged so that we can better understand the question. 

True to the hermeneutic circle Malick continually returns to the same themes throughout his films.  But each time a question is asked the images we have seen inform us so that we can ask the question with greater insight. Instead of building up, Malick digs down. He doesn't want to give answers, he wants us to understand why the questions are important and then he impels us to answer the questions for ourselves.

Circles in “The Thin Red Line”

There is evidence of a hermeneutic circle in each of Malick’s films but it is particularly apparent in “The Thin Red Line”. The first lines we hear are the voice of Private Witt, played by Jim Caviezel:

What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself?

This question is our starting point in the circle, and Malick uses image to explore it. The images we are presented with are stunning contrasts, paradisiacal jungle scenes are replaced by images of the destruction of war, shots of vibrantly colored birds give way to burnt fields and craters. At one point a beautiful low-shot of light seeping through the jungle canopy transitions seamlessly into an image of a dying bird, obviously wounded and covered in mud slowly flapping its wings and struggling to move. This montage of images forces us to consider the first question spoken in the film: why does nature vie with itself? 

The war narrative ramps up and we are caught up in the efforts of the U.S. army soldiers to take a hill fortified by the japanese. For some time we are bombarded with the circumstances of war--an almost indistinguishable blend of malice, heroism, ambition and brotherhood all occur over the backdrop of vivid pain, until unexpectedly in voice-over narration Private Witt reiterates the original theme of the film and connects the disparate images we have witnessed:

One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.                   
But death's got the final word.
lt's laughing at him.
Another man sees that same bird,
feels the glory.
Feels something smiling through him.

It becomes apparent that the original questions about conflict in nature, the image of the dying bird and the violent images of war are not just haphazard collections of shots, they are different perspectives on the same theme. Now we see that in nature’s conflict we can choose to perceive glory instead of destruction. Though we thought we were being shown contrasts when edenic nature shots replaced apocalyptic violence but Malick is suggesting that the glory can be seen in both. 
This isn’t an answer to the original questions: “What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself?” But now we are better equipped to ask these questions, and like a descending spiral, though we have gone deeper into the question we have also returned to the same place.

Malick’s films don’t usually provide us with conclusions that can be expressed in a sentence or written on a plaque. The hermeneutic circle isn’t designed to find answers, it is designed to understand questions. For this Malick should be commended. With the formative control he has over his films he could easily bombard us with trite but satisfactory morals, but he holds back. Don’t think, however, that he falls prey to the old cliche that answers aren’t important, only questions. I think he realizes that we have to provide our own answers, but those answers are impossible to find if we don’t understand what we are asking.

Viewing Malick's work as a hermeneutic circle gives us a lens to examine his films. Rather than giving token criticism of his loose editing or his rambling storylines we can criticize the effect his narrative and style have in developing thematic questions. This type of analysis is limited because there is certainly more to his films than a formulaic technique, but where understanding Malick is always going to be difficult climb, at least it can give us a handhold to begin the ascent.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_t1zlo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/t1zlo/a_new_way_of_interpreting_terrence_malicks_work/,

However, one name I rarely see listed is one of my favorite, if not my favorite director, Sidney Lumet. I have already seen several Lumets films, Network(my favorite), Dog Day Afternoon, 12 Angry Men, The Pawnbroker, The Verdict, Serpico, etc, and they were all fantastic films on top of being some of the most influential films in history. The Pawnbroker is actually used in film studies class as a benchmark for good film making. Yet, Lumet himself is generally seen as a second tier director. The most common criticisms are that he was inconsistent, which is somewhat true because for every Network, there was The Wiz, but every director has made bad movies, and Lumet still has 6-10 great films, which is no small feat. The other criticism is that Lumet lacked any signature style which to me is an advantage of his film making. Films like Network, a dark satire, need a different feel from the Holocaust themed Pawnbroker, which needs a different feel from the theatre-like Equus. Lumet was able to change his style to fit the film, while still keeping his ability to pull out amazing performances from his actors. Even though he was against “overly artistic” camera shots, he could definitely provide good visuals, see The Pawnbroker, or Ned Beatty’s monologue in Network, but in movies like Dog Day Afternoon, having some Kubrickian deep focus shot would be distracting, and I appreciate his restraint. So I guess my questions to Truefilm: (1) What are your thoughts on Sidney Lumet, and do you think he’s an elite director, or simply a good director who made some iconic movies? (2) Is having a signature style, visual or otherwise, important, or can you be a great director being a chameleon like Lumet?

Towards the end of the 19^th Century, vast expanses of the American West remained untamed and unexplored, providing an allure for those seeking new opportunities and a source of inspiration for entertainers and storytellers, bringing the frontier life to the public in the form of Wild West Shows and 10¢ novels. Decades before the concept of a superhero was even created, larger-than-life figures such as Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley dominated the public conscious.

The new medium of film was not long in exploiting this interest. While there were some attempts with the genre several years beforehand, Edwin S. Porter's [*The Great Train Robbery* (1903)](http://youtu.be/Bc7wWOmEGGY) is recognized as the first Western and indeed the first narrative film. A milestone in film, it pioneered multiple techniques required to evolve film from the more effects driven spectacles of Georges Méliès to a storytelling medium. Location shooting, camera panning, parallel editing, double exposures, and even color were all utilized or introduced for the first time. Not much from 1903 still survives, but *The Great Train Robbery*'s famous last shot is paid homage by *Goodfellas* (1990), *American Gangster* (2007), and maybe even the James Bond gunbarrel opening.

In the following decades, more directors would use the Western as a dramatic setting. Thomas Ince, D.W. Griffith, and William S. Hart were a few of the ones who enjoyed success in the genre. In 1917, John Ford debuted on the scene, directing 41 silent Westerns before the arrival of sound in 1928, most of which are lost. 

Gradually however, the public tired of the Western bombardment, and audiences dwindled. Ford took a 13 year break from the genre, and with sound and the Crash of 1929, Westerns were generally relegated to B-status. A number of Westerns tried for critical legitimacy; *The Big Trail* (1930) with John Wayne's first starring role was filmed in pioneering 70mm widescreen. The Great Depression and the costs of installing sound systems caused theaters to balk at retooling for widescreen projection, and so the financial failure of the film caused the format to disappear until the 1950s, and relegated John Wayne to B-movies for nearly a decade. *Cimarron* (1931) won Best Picture, but had negligible impact and today has the dubious distinction of being among the worst winners of the prize.

With war burgeoning in Europe, studios suddenly refocused their attention to the Western. For the first time A-list stars were cast, including the early roles of Marlene Dietrich, James Stewart, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Henry Fonda, James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart. In this context, Ford returned to the Western and, while he had given Wayne minor roles before, felt that the time was finally ripe for bringing him to stardom.

#Legacy

*Stagecoach* is perhaps best known today for being the film Orson Welles studied while making *Citizen Kane* (1941). Its influence however goes a bit beyond that.

This is the first Ford film shot in Monument Valley, Utah. 200 miles from civilization, Ford would use the same 5 square miles for almost every subsequent Western, forever linking the location with the genre. Remember all the wacky scenery Wile E. Coyote chases the Road Runner through in *Looney Tunes*? You can thank Ford for that.

John Wayne's career took off after *Stagecoach*, and he would never again have to suffer being a supporting or bit player, much less an extra (or a corpse, his most degrading role in *The Deceiver* (1931) after running afoul of legendary SOB Harry Cohn). He would go on to play a staggering ~100 leading roles, 12 of those with Ford.

Did the stagecoach chase scene remind you a little of *Ben-Hur* (1959)? Well good, because it was supervised by legendary stuntman [Yakima Canutt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima_Canutt), who would go on to work in *Gone With The Wind* (1939), *Spartacus* (1960), and yes *Ben-Hur*, where he staged the epic chariot race scene while his son Joe Canutt doubled for Charlton Heston. His stunts in *Stagecoach*, jumping between horses and being dragged under the coach, would be homaged by Spielberg in *Raiders of the Lost Ark* (1981) with the German truck chase, and *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* (1989) with Indy's jump from the horse onto the tank. In addition, much of Wayne's on-screen persona - his drawl and walk - were directly inspired by Canutt.

Stagecoach's critical and commercial success revitalized the moribund genre, and paved the way for other directors to lend their touches to the Western.

What social, political, artistic, etc., contexts was the film made in? Are there any other movies I should see before or after to complement my viewing?

EDIT: Also it's cool if you want to just turn this into a thread for the movie.

EDIT 2: Going to bulk up the post and make it more broad for discussion's sake. Can we discuss films that require prerequisite knowledge or experience and possibly other films to fully enjoy and appreciate? Do these films ask too much of the audience and become inherently flawed as a result?

Personally I  think that ultimately the reigning majority of films become highly dependent on the culture and current events they are birthed into, whether they are informed by the culture or end up informing it as a piece of art. I've had many experiences where I saw a movie that had relatively little impact on me, researched it or discovered a certain outside factor about it that changed my view on it, went back and watched it and had a much more powerful experience. One example of this for me is Ben Hur. Knowing that Charlton Heston was purposefully not informed that Stephen Wallace was directed to play the character of Massala as having a homosexual desire for the character of Ben Hur adds a huge amount of depth to an already outstanding set of performances and really cements it as one of the most interesting and best friendship/romance-gone-wrong performances in film.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1373160416.0,,,True,t3_1hrfrl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hrfrl/what_do_i_need_to_know_before_watching_the_holy/,

I enjoyed the novel, but thought King's inserts of faux interviews and news clippings about the ""prom incident"" didn't add much to the story and actually slowed down the pacing, but DePalma strips all that nonsense out and in my opinion it doing that makes the movie much better. Sissy Spacek was nominated for an oscar for her role and holy crap did she deserve it. She's so compelling and sympathetic that there were several times watching the movie where I would forget entirely that she has superpowers. Piper Laurie is also quite good as Carrie's mother, though a bit over the top. That said, I don't know how someone could play that character and not be over the top.

As for DePalma, I've not seen too much of his work outside of The Untouchables, but what stands out the most here is his editing. Every cut seems deliberate and you can really tell how much care was put into that aspect of the film. As it turns out, it was edited by Paul Hirsch who edited Star Wars IV and V, among other things.

What I'd really like to talk about though is how this film compares to what we've seen of Kimberly Pierce's ""Carrie"" starring Chloe Grace Moretz. I like Moretz as a performer but from the trailer it seems obvious that she's horribly miscast. Spacek truly looks the part, she's gangly, her hair is bad, she's got bad skin, and just generally seems awkward and afraid. Moretz on the other hand looks like the popular girl in school with slightly less make up and bad posture. She's far too attractive and confident to play someone who is supposed to be the most beat upon girl in school. This might seem like nitpicking, but if you take away that emotional core of the movie, you take away that tragedy of the saddest girl you've ever met getting to become prom queen only to have it taken away, and all you're left with is a girl who has a crazy mom and can move shit with her mind.

I could speculate more about why the remake will most likely be terrible, but that wouldn't be entirely fair to the film. That said, if you're so inclined: speculate away. If not, thoughts on Brian DePalma's ""Carrie?"" There's plenty to talk about.

1369869061.0,48,self.TrueFilm,1fau0u,What do you think of Ingmar Bergman?,69,21,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fau0u/what_do_you_think_of_ingmar_bergman/," I discovered Bergman through Roger Ebert's reviews (I've been completely lost movie wise since he died...). I really respected Ebert and he loved Bergman movies so I watched Persona. I loved it! I watched about 10 other Bergman movies and I loved most of them, liked all of them, but was frustrated by more than a few!

But then I read a little more about Bergman. No one seems to watch his movies (at least people I know). I've asked a couple of my film major friends about him and they say they don't like him that much. Why? 

I read an article that said Bergman wasn't really taught in film classes because he was kind of irrelevant to the history of cinema. I can't remember what it was called but I think I found it through a roger ebert article he wrote after Bergman's death. Do you agree with this? I can't see it being true *if only* because he influenced Woody Allen so much and I feel like his cultural impact is undeniable. 

If you don't like Bergman movies is it because you find them pretentious? This is a bit of a tangent so skip this paragraph if you want... But I felt like a lot of people had that opinion when The Tree of Life came out and I couldn't help but feel they didn't understand what being earnest is. It can look pretentious, especially with out culture of irony, but if you choose to read it as someone being genuine and honest you'll enjoy it a lot more. Even if they were ultimately being pretentious. I was listening to a podcast by a woman named Julie Klausner and she said something like ""labeling people as pretentious precludes our culture from enjoying some spectacular weirdos."" And I agree! Not just weirdos but honest, beautiful (or ugly even) things.

I think Berman's movies are beautiful, atmospheric, scary, sad, exciting, and generally make my life more interesting! What do you think?

I had seen one or two previews to give me a general sense of what would happen but wasn't completely convinced the movie would be able to define itself outside of its own premise.

It began strong, like any good mind game movie, by slightly disorienting the viewer and inspiring many hushed whispers inside the theater full of speculation as to who was who and why is he still alive. This seemed like a good sign, especially with the somewhat creative ""communicating"" done through cutting into one's own body, but unfortunately these elements were short lived.

After about thee 45 minute mark, the movie seemed to be struggling to really define what it was about, and not in a good way. Do we care about Joe closing his loop? Do we really care about Old Joe and his wife when we only learned about her through a flash forward? Oh, and apparently the Rainmaker, a character alluded to slightly, is now a big deal?

Be wary of the many critics now describing this narrative ambiguity as ""smart"". It is unfocused, dull, and delivered in such a way that I found it hard to truly care about anyone. Along the same line as that, the characters were all very flat and singularly motivated, and poor Emily Blunt, while promising at the start, is reduced to being another weak female character to be controlled by a stronger man.

When you think about it, we all romanticize sitting in a train, in a foreign land, and spotting someone whom we have a transcendent connection with.  I think filming such long takes as he did, was the best way to tell a story like this.  We can see a number of nuances in the character's mannerisms as they walk across the city, which immerses us in a major way.  

I believe it connects us more when there are no abrupt cuts.  For example, there were more cuts in Midnight than the other two and it felt more ""commercial"" so-to-speak.  I've been searching for more love stories like these, where the director focuses on nuance and allowing the actors to take over every scene.  In a time period when film is about loud noises, epic action and scenes last a few seconds each, it's so refreshing to remember how great films are defined by intimate dialogue between characters.  Not to mention, the philosophical questions about love that the movies raise, and how transient and fleeting these connections are, is so poignant and important for a lot of people to see.  

This is one of my favorite stories in film, it's especially nostalgic with it being set in the 90s, when the world felt so free and magical, everything felt dream-like.

Now with that being said, watching it again made me question whether or not the two main characters, Joel and Clementine, were created to pander to the type of audience that would typically be interested in a movie like ESotSM.

Joel is the quiet, nice guy, who's always writing in his journal, he plays to every shy or socially awkward teen or guy in his mid twenties who thinks the world just doesn't understand him.

Clementine is the impulsive, wacky, emotional rollercoaster, who's hair is a different color every week.

These characters seem to be how the audience wants to/probably does see themselves, rather than how they actually are.

I've considered that maybe this is intentional for the purpose portraying a better than reality type of rose tinted glasses that we wear when nostalgically thinking of fond memories, but at the same time I think that might be over analyzing the film, and it might just be pandering to the type of viewer that this film is aimed at.

This movie is flawed, gloriously flawed. I went into the theater very apprehensively, as I have never been a fan of Rob Zombie's ouvre besides ""The Devil's Rejects"" (which still holds up fantastically I might add).  Anyway, Rob Zombie *really* stepped out of his comfort zone with this one.  The film is incredibly atmospheric and gets under your skin right away.  I was constantly reminded aesthetically of Polanski's ""Repulsion"" and Kubrick's work.  ""The Lords of Salem"" is essentially an art-house picture disguised as just another horror film.  The soundtrack is wonderful, and contributes quite a bit to the atmosphere.  As for the flaws, there are many: the acting is stilted in some scenes, it gets a little too weird for its own good, the dialogue isn't too impressive, the list goes on...  For me, these flaws only added to my appreciation of the film.  They are examples of a fearless filmmaker taking a lot of risks: some work and some don't. It's that simple.  With a $2.5 Million budget, you can tell Zombie made the film he WANTED to make.  I can almost assure you there was no studio input with this thing, it's very bizarre and definitely not for everyone. I couldn't take my eyes off of it and I'm still thinking about it a lot today.  Anyway, what are your thoughts if you've seen it?  I never thought I'd see the name Rob Zombie in /r/TrueFilm, but I just had to express my appreciation of this film to you guys and urge you all to support truly original work!

I've only watched one other film by Godard: Breathless, which I enjoyed very much. I feel that Pierrot used many of the techniques that were employed in Breathless, especially how sometimes the camera would be fixated on Belmondo or Karin whenever he or she was involved in a conversation. Yet it seemed so much more. Not only did it have several references to American culture, the Vietnam War, and cinema, the dialogue was also much harder to understand. It seemed frivolous, wild, almost pretentious in the sense that many of the ideas that they espoused were never further explored. To me, Pierrot seemed like a criticism on the Bohemian/wild/destructive lifestyle that Karin and Belmodo have (especially in the way that Belmondo dies).


I just have a few questions about it

* How does Pierrot, a color film, compare to Godard's black and whites and was there a major shift?

* What does the color blue represent (Belmondo covers his face in the color right before he blows himself up)

* Towards the end, as Belmondo is chasing Karin, he meets a man who talks about a ""song"" and describes how everytime he listens to it, he imagines several women who rub his hands. What is this dialogue supposed to represent? Does it reflect a shift, loss of love, of Belmondo?

* I felt that it had strong links to Absurdism, especially Camus' *The Stranger*. The nihilistic disregard of Belmondo and Karin towards authority and life seemed to resonate with his ideas. Is this accurate?

* When Karin and Belmondo are singing about ""Fate Lines"" and ""Thigh Lines,"" are they foreshadowing their tragic deaths at the end of the film? Or is it more that they are giving the viewer information about their characters?

*In what sense can the audience take their dialogue seriously? I think Roger Ebert wrote that the film is more about transmitting a feeling.

Dredd is undoubtably one of my favourite films of 2012. I personally feel like it was excellently crafted.

From one of my comments in that thread (edited):

&gt;I'm going to advocate Dredd as having one of the strongest scripts I've seen in an action movie in a long time. Dredd has a highly minimalistic script which eschews broader narrative in lieu of carefully planned and paced action sequences. Whilst the action and special effects are beautiful, it was the script which made me fall in love with this film.

&gt;There are perhaps four or five real characters in the film, and character development is almost exclusively related to one of the protagonists. The story itself is basic in scope, and lacks scale relegating the film to one locale. I feel this was done to create a focus on the action of the film, stripping away excess unnecessary to the film.

Thematically the film draws attention to the nature of crime as it relates to the human condition, and explores the moral extremities of both crime and response to crime. Though it remains thematically simple, I would argue this is intentional minimalism as opposed to laziness or a 'dumb' script.

What are your thoughts on Dredd? Did you find it to be a 'mindless' action film? Did you feel it deserved more recognition than it received?

My question is, should this kind of priming be necessary, is it a case by case basis?

I ask, because with some films, most notably comedy-horrors I find people tend to have very adverse reactions with no priming. E.g. When I showed my friends Drag Me to Hell, they all hated it, they just thought it was stupid, e.g. the talking goat etc. They weren't aware it was supposed to be a comedy. I feel like maybe if I'd said that, they might have enjoyed it more.

I had the same experience with Cabin in the Woods, I didn't look anything up on it, just heard good things, and heard it was from Joss Whedon. When I first started watching it, I was confused, and wasn't sure whether I was supposed to be laughing or wondering what the hell was going on.

I can't say I've seen another film that equals *In the Mood for Love* in the way that it conveys its sense of pining and forlorn love, and Christopher Doyle's cinematography is awe-inspiring in its own right (and that final scene? Just incredible). As for *Chungking Express*, it seems like the antithesis of *In the Mood for Love* in that the former is very giddy and jubilant whereas the latter is slower and more methodical. That doesn't keep it from being a great film, however, since *Chungking Express* also features some incredible photography from Christopher Doyle, and its portrayal of relationships is so incredibly genuine. It's one of the few romantic comedies I've actually enjoyed -- indeed, that I've loved. It takes the fugacity, the transient nature of many relationships, and manages to portray that in a way that is both endlessly charming and surprisingly positive -- all while avoiding the frivolity that this genre usually encounters.

I plan on watching the rest of his filmography in the near future, but are there any other directors out there that really compare to him in terms of style or content?

First of all, he clearly values Style over Substance.  Every movie he has made is intensely atmospheric, and draws the audience in flawlessly.  He also knows exactly how to film violence.  However, a lot of the time the story of a Refn film is needlessly simplistic and straightforward.  Take Drive, for example.  There's a buildup, the failed, heist, and then a series of killings at the end of which Ryan Gosling has defeated all the villains and saved the innocents.

I perceive something of a lack of self-control in many of his films.  He often builds up a fascinating storyline, but finds himself unsure how to end it so he goes with a bloodbath and disposes of almost all his characters.  Bleeder and Valhalla Rising also suffer from this, while Fear X is similarly straightforward if not excessive in the slaughter of its characters.

On the other hand you have Bronson, which I consider excellent.  However, it doesn't have all that much of a plotline, understandable since it is biographical.  It's mainly a series of set pieces in which we get to observe Tom Hardy's great acting and Refn's great directorial skill.

The Pusher series, it seems, is where Refn has the most restraint.  They each exhibit uniquely offbeat storylines that don't necessarily go where you would expect after watching his other works.  These are the films that launched his career, so I wonder how that differentiates them for Refn.  Are they his most personal, or the other way around?

A pretty vague focus, but hopefully that allows us to go anywhere we want with it. 

For example, it seems like many filmmakers respect Anderson. Altman was something of a mentor in the late stages of his life, and even made Anderson an AD on Prairie; Bergman apparently enjoyed Magnolia; he's friends with Tarantino (no surprise there); and even Spielberg likes him (but when has this guy criticized someone). 

On the same note, I've found that many scholars don't really discuss him. Anecdotally speaking, I've briefly spoken to several who just seem to have a lukewarm reaction to him; more or less, they're unimpressed. 

Is this because much of Anderson's films revolve around a love for previous films? Is he too derivative? What sets him apart from other contemporaries? Behind all the cliquey love for this guy, is he actually quite ordinary? With all of the movies he's admittedly stolen from, does he say anything new?

I don't want to limit this discussion to just how Anderson does or does not ""quote"" movies. Much of what has been said about Tarantino can be shared with Anderson. But I think Anderson is also a very different filmmaker than Tarantino, not necessarily for better or worse. What are these differences - has he taken himself too seriously (consider the vibrance of Boogie Nights to There Will Be Blood's cynicism).

I have a lot of thoughts on this film that I'd like to put out there, and hopefully spark some discussion and elaborate on certain themes.

**Spoilers ahead**

The central theme of Martha Marcy, as i see it, is a sense of depersonalization, and loss of identity.  it's right there in the title.  Martha was inducted into a cult, who focus on the collective more than on the individual (though of course, this collective exists to serve the cult leader Patrick).  it attracts lost young women, many of whom are trying to escape their old identities.  they are slowly conditioned to view themselves as non-entities.  they get new names, they are raped in their sleep by Patrick - a disorienting and traumatic experience that will either drive them away, or, if successful, push them deeper into psychological shells and disconnect them from their lives and identities.  the cult's reasoning for stealing from others is a hyper-socialist mentality that all of humanity is part of this collective, and thus should share their belongings with the cult.  Martha, after escaping, still retains this strange worldview that has no real sense of time, location or self, which clashes with her typical bourgeois sister and brother in law.

as i mentioned earlier with the title, the movie tries to enforce that sense of depersonalization.  one character, Patrick's male right hand in the cult, is played by Brady Corbet.  he menaces Martha/Marcy near the beginning of the film.  at the end, Martha sees a man from a distance, who looks a lot like this character, but is played by a different actor.  meanwhile Martha's sister's husband is framed in several scenes to resemble Patrick, a skinny dark haired looming figure.  adding to the confusion is the frequent repetition of words in dialogue - ""it feels nice to put on something nice and comfortable"" - and the title itself. 

there is also a deep, profound sense of dread and anxiety permeating the film.  i was on weed brownies the first time i watched it, and nearly had a panic attack.  the cult is completely absent from Martha's present day timeline, at least until the end, but they are always there as a threat, a brilliantly rendered psychological monster - in a flashback we see them breaking into a fairly isolated upper-middle class home, quite similar to Martha's sister's.  then in present day, Martha and her sister are arguing and the scene is encompassed mostly in one shot - Martha's POV of her sister, who only occupies the bottom half of the frame, while the top half is a view of the deck outside through their glass doors.  the entire present timeline domestic drama has this shadow hanging over it in nightmarish fashion - could the cultists track them down?  they don't have a lot of resources, but they were able to find Martha earlier.  and they have every reason to kill Martha and her family.  this is what's on Martha's mind for the duration of this timeline, not whether her sister will accept her.  she can never really escape the cult.  the whole thing culminates in the final scene, which cuts to black before we get any real answers.  i think this was the right move.  that cut to black leaves us in fear with Martha.  if the final scene was some cultists driving them off the road and cutting their throats, it would weaken that fear because you know what happens.  the growing realization that this nightmarish situation is real, is the most terrifying moment.  past that point it's just total despair, something that would offset the careful balance the film had built up.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1jztc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jztc7/discussion_of_martha_marcy_may_marlene/,

The films that touch me the most are the ones that portray modest, shy characters whom we don't know much about since they keep their feelings very private. It makes them mysterious and we are able to project a lot and identify with them. When the director is not afraid of these slow, silent scenes focusing on body language it really makes my heart tighten and I find it incredibly emotionally powerful. That's really what I'm longing for in a theatre room: feeling pushed back in my chair, completely relating with the characters and wishing the scene lasts as long as possible, which rarely happens. 

I guess I should give an example for it to be more understandable: Amongst the most popular movies *In the mood for love* illustrates well what I'm trying to explain. The combination of the rhythm, music and sensuality in this simple story respects and highlights the couple's feelings, that they can't express... in words.

So, again, sorry if that does not belong here: I wrote this in order to request other examples of films that fit that description... Which director(s) do you think manage best to film these simple yet powerful scenes? Are there other elements to add to my not so good analysis of what is needed to achieve this? All the films I could think of involved love stories but can you think of characters like these who don't appear in a romance?

(I'm not so much interested in characters who have a real social anxiety/disorder; there are plenty of films like this but I'd prefer to focus on characters who don't (explicitely) have a condition).

I saw that it was playing at the local ""art house"" theater, watched the trailer, and went to see it.  I thought it was absolutely phenomenal.  Michael Shannon's performance alone makes it worthwhile, but the film has so much more to offer.  It examines the concepts of mental illness (and the uncertainty that surrounds it), family, and sacrifice in such a profound way that I don't even know how to describe it.  

So here's my question:  After watching the film, I was positive it would be all the critics were talking about, and a major awards contender.  So why did this brilliant film fly so far under the radar?  I'm used to smaller budget independent films that I love only getting a smattering of critical praise and maybe a nomination or two from the major awards shows if they're lucky, but how did Take Shelter not even register on the critical radar?  The only movie that I saw in 2011 that I would even consider a competitor with this film for best of the year would be Drive.

Maybe there was more of a critical buzz than I realized and somehow I just missed it, but I was mystified by how little I ever heard about this movie after seeing it.

Right in the middle of a sentence, with no signaling music or any sort of transition, it cuts from the mother in the kitchen in the middle of a sentence to both of the parents standing outside their neighbor's house, synchronized with an odd lightning flash.

I sort of like this; it's definitely a ""how the hell did that get through?"" moment, but apparently most people online don't remember noticing it back in the day.

I'm not referring to stuff like things that were clearly intentional or stylistic, but strange, incongruous things that don't have a ready explanation.

Having just watched *Pulp Fiction*, which I hadn't seen in years, a trend became readily apparent that I realize holds true in (I think) all of his work: 

Every scene, in every film of his that I can recall, has virtually the same structure. They seem to always be unabashed, long-fuse, time bombs. 

&gt;1. The fuse in each one being an amusing character set-up that paints the nuances of each party involved. Dialogue-heavy, often static, funny, and grueling in its building tension (sometimes not).

&gt;2. An explosive conclusion often laden with violence and plot-driving mechanics. 

While I wholeheartedly enjoy this structure, and adore his work, I noticed in my *Pulp* watching, that something felt lacking. I know *Pulp* (above all of his other work) is considered a modern classic, but, and I had this same gripe immediately after watching *Inglorious Basterds*, felt that these awesome scene-by-scene pieces never added up to anything. They're tremendously enjoyable in their own right, and are top-notch examples of character building through dialogue, but those bombs that keep going off never seem to collectively ""destroy"" anything or create a bigger explosion in the end. 

All filmmakers have completely different intentions for their work obviously, and while it doesn't seem to be his intent (from my experience) to move mountains with an overall ending statement, I'm left thinking, *""damn! this could've created a friggin atomic blast at the end if these things added up to something more significant!""*

I can't stress enough how much I do enjoy his work. From the seemingly infinite well of his film knowledge that he seamlessly (and shamelessly) appropriates in his films, to his pacing, structure, editing decisions, multi-narrative inter-weaving, etc. I think it's all brilliant stuff, but I'm curious to hear how it moves others and how it's interpreted - whether it be in-depth or even just surface enjoyment.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_14257o,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/14257o/tarantino_a_discussion/,

First off: Hard Candy is one of the most brilliant films that I have seen in a long time, in my opinion. I will probably spoil some parts of the film in this, but I will try to put up spoiler tags when appropriate.

For those who have not seen it, Hard Candy (David Slade, 2005) is a psychological cat-and-mouse thriller about a 14-year-old Hayley (played by Ellen Page) and a 30-some-odd-year-old photographer and suspected pedophile who meet online. After flirting for several weeks, the two decide to meet in person, and then go back to the house that Jeff (played by the immaculate Patrick Wilson) owns. Things then take a drastic turn as Hayley drugs, traps, and mentally tortures him.

This film got a lot of criticism due to the touchy subject matter overall. Sure, a film about a pedophile generally isn't going to be a Hollywood classic, but I think the obscure plot was a good choice. Especially because Slade refused to hold back. There is no easing in to this movie; from the start, you're watching flirty chat-messages, Hayley pulling her clothes off on Jeff's couch, and a truly cringe-worthy castration scene. 

Some people also disliked Hard Candy because it didn't follow the traditional bad-guy-and-victim scenario. Jeff was not portrayed as a monster, although society likes to make pedophiles look like monsters. Instead, Jeff was a clean, charming, likable man. He seemed like the sort of man you would see shopping at the supermarket with his family, or pulling weeds from his front lawn. Jeff, however, was involved in a little girl's murder... And yet we end up desperately hoping for Jeff to escape Hayley's torture games by the halfway mark in the film. Many people disliked that they felt sympathy for Jeff, but I think that's what makes this movie unique. Rather than leaving the theater (or in my case, the laptop) feeling a sense of accomplishment as the villian is captured, we feel uncomfortable that Jeff died. We feel like Hayley was just as much a villian as Jeff was, if not more. The film isn't carefully gift-wrapped with a box - it's edgy and slightly unnerving to watch.

**9/10.**

To those who enjoy thrillers, Hard Candy is a brilliant film, and worth a watch.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_110jz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/110jz5/lets_talk_about_a_film_called_hard_candy/,

I'd like to tell you about him. Put simply, Parajanov mastered a technique of composing his frames with a strikingly painterly quality, directing the viewer's attention completely to the colors, costumes, optics, and geometries of his subjects- not unlike Fellini or Jordorowsky. But I'll let his compositions speak for themselves before going any further- [check em](http://imgur.com/a/1xhJu). Here's also a great exemplary sequence from his most prized film [*Sayat Nova.*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glsytnUdt-E&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=464s)

His films have an intense beauty, and resonate with an inexpressible visual logic. Many critics tell of his inattention to story, plot, and character, but I'd argue these are actually the primary focus of his films, just represented through imagery rather than dialogue. In other words, he is absolutely telling stories, rich stories, just in the same way a painter would tell them on a canvas. But because of the multi-sensory nature of film, Parajanov was able to innovate beautiful score, hypnotic choreography, and powerful performances into these highly baroque 'living pictures.' His films were a hybrid of almost all art-forms, and his execution was flawless. 

Parajanov the man was an Armenian dissident whose film work spanned from the 1950s til his death in 1990. Due to the radical surrealism of *Sayat Nova,* the KGB arrested him on trumped up charges of homosexuality. Yeah, he was actually arrested for 5 whole years, for making too-surreal of a film- can you imagine?? 

I think I've said all that can be said about this enigmatic filmmaker... His films and style need to be experienced, not read about. Please watch his movies and drink in the cinematic pleasure!

An example (not my opinion though) would be that a lot of people see Irreversible as going too far, mainly with the 9 minute rape scene, it doesn't necessarily make it bad but it does make it hard to watch/unwatchable. 

My example would have to be Suckerpunch, too much 'style', CG and barely clothed females for my liking. It was embarrassing to watch and infuriating to listen to people talk about how they enjoyed the blatant and down right pathetic pandering. 

Also I'd have to say that Tarintino's homages in the Kill Bill films go way too far in the amount of ideas/characters/scenes/styles taken from older films.

This seemed reminiscent of the silent film Nosferatu especially. The way Wilder shot Norma's house certainly gave it a gothic castle and haunted feel. The way Max was constantly obscured by shadows and the camera work also seemed like direct homage to the film. Also Norma's mannerisms weren't very humanlike which gave her a monster like appearance. She is constantly ensnaring Joe with her arms, but not so much in loving way. SHe latches onto him like a predator trapping it's pray. There is something twisted (and wonderfully) spider-like about her performance. The way her eyes widen also seems to create this monster like image. She's the monster held away in the castle and Joe gillis in the unsuspecting visitor who falls victim to her trap. I thought injecting this sort of style into the film noir genre while simultaneously dealing with the drama of someone who tries desperately to stop herself from becoming obsolete made for a fantastic and brilliant film.

While I clearly acknowledge the overarching message concerning the readiness of society to not only believe, but promptly blow out of proportion, the story made up by a young child- I think there might be something deeper at play here. 

Throughout the entire film, I kept noticing what I thought were faint bruises and minor cuts on the faces of Theo's children, Klara and Torsten. They are especially noticeable in the scene when Klara comes over to Lucas's house and asks to play with Fannie, the following scene where Torsten and Klara are building a Christmas scene together, and the final scene when the camera pans around, focusing on Torsten's face. I also noticed there were multiple instances in which Theo snapped suddenly, and rather menacingly from a calm and loving demeanor to one much more tense, almost foreboding. First, when Lucas has to take Klara to school because Theo is too busy screaming at his wife, Agnes about an agreement they had made over who should take their daughter to school. Second, when Theo attacks Lucas in his own home, it was quite obvious that both Klara and Agnes knew to steer clear. Third, when Theo is about to leave his Christmas party to bring Lucas some food Agnes pleads with him to stay. At first he tries to explain that he'll be back right away, but when she persists- he stares at her stone cold and says, ""Agnes, move aside"", at which point she sheepishly slinks aside without a word, looking petrified.

The combination of these two observations were verified (in my mind) by the final scene. 

When Marcus was ""becoming a man"" in the ceremony of sorts, the camera first focuses on Lucas, and then begins to pan around the room. It stops specifically on Torsten, who is already looking directly at Lucas (similar to the way Lucas was looking at Theo during the Christmas sermon). Torsten's face is bruised, and he looks as though he's seen a ghost and quickly moves his gaze. Then, when Lucas is shot at in the woods he looks up at his assailant, who clearly has the means to kill him, but chooses to run instead. I saw this, in my mind, as a desperate cry for help from Torsten. 

Hear me out here, but I think that Theo has a short temper and somewhat of a darker personality that occasionally causes him to loses his cool, directing his anger/frustration at Klara, Torsten, and probably Agnes. In the scene where Theo brings Lucas food from their party, Lucas may or may not realize what has been going on, I'm not entirely certain about that... but I think Theo wanting to stay with Lucas instead of return to his family was his guilt about throwing his friend under the bus for something he had done (or had been doing). Torsten's look of utter desperation in the final scene was the nail in the coffin for me. When he and Lucas made eye contact, I saw it as a painful, yet faint mutual understanding of the situation. This would then give Torsten motivation to cry for help by shooting at Lucas, reminding him of whats at stake. It was Torsten's way of saying, ""You know whats going on here, please do something about it"".

I could be totally off here, but I can't seem to stop thinking about it, so I figured it was worth a shot. I'd love to hear all of your opinions!

&gt;[2011] [[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675192/?ref_=sr_3)] 

&gt;A Southern Gothic tale tackles eschatological themes, centering the coming apocalypse in rural America. Curtis (Michael Shannon) sees visions and dreams of a great, brooding storm that is sure to destroy life as we know it. Interpreting these recurring dreams and visions as premonitions, Curtis builds a storm shelter in his backyard. However, by doing so he puts great financial stress on his family, as well as emotional stress on the community, as they believe that he has gone insane. Nichols has crafted one of the most haunting visions put to cinema in all of cinema's history.

Obviously, the writing was shit and the characterization was utterly nonsensical, but that is not my complaint. I simply couldn't help but be distracted by the lack of respect toward science. I know that films are not always supposed to be realistic, but this film seemed to be trying so hard to ask big questions, but relied on a premise that was completely at odds with everything we know about science.

The most frustrating thing to me is that they could have very easily made the movie fit in with everything that we know about science and kept the basic idea of the premise intact. I am talking about the nakedly stupid idea that the ""engineers"" share the same DNA as us. Being that we share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees, this idea does not follow logically at all. If they had simply reworked the plot so that the aliens were unrelated to us, and had a habit of trying to develop intelligent life by genetically engineering pre-existing species, this premise would make sense. For example, the back story could have been that the aliens landed here 1.5 million years ago and saw that our pre-human ancestors had the potential to be evolved into an intelligent, self-aware species. They set up a colony, did selective breeding for quite a while, and then left us to our own devices once civilization started to form, leaving us a beacon to their homeworld so that we could come visit them someday. We go visit to find out that they wiped themselves out with their own genetic experiments.

This took me 5 minutes to come up with after the movie. Why couldn't a team of experts, with hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal do the same? As implausible as this alternative plot is, it is not immediately refutable, and it jives with everything we know about our history (namely, that it is an irrefutable fact that we are apes).

Furthermore, this would have gotten rid of the ridiculous ending wherein the space-man wakes up from hyper-sleep and begins acting like a typical movie monster; as the character was ""human"" as per the movie's absurd premise, this behavior made no sense; but if he were an alien being that looked nothing like us, it would make it far less easy to read its emotional states, making it seem a whole lot less retarded when he begins acting like a monster. This is especially bullshit when you consider that they drew the goddamn thing in CGI anyway; it can't even be argued that they did it to save money.

I was watching Insomnia today and when Pacino's character is asked by Swank's character if he shot his partner on purpose, Pacino (demented with sleep deprivation) says that he doesn't know anymore. It got me thinking about the fact that this seems to be a recurring theme with Nolan. How do we know what is real? 

**Memento** The main character plays out a revenge fantasy over and over and realizes that he doesn't know what is real about the hunt for his wife's killer. He in fact chooses the illusion over the reality. 

Inception deals with a man that doesn't even seem to have the capability of knowing what is real and what is a dream. He also seems to want to choose the illusion over reality.

The Prestige makes an interesting turn from this theme. It deals with illusionists, people that are understood to not be showing you reality. One magician takes that illusion to its limits by living their whole life with a twin that is completely dedicated to their illusion to the point of not even telling their family. Meanwhile, the other magician goes in the other direction, making the illusion not an illusion at all, but reality of sorts.

I haven't seen Following, and I don't know where (or if) the Batman movies fall into this theme, but I just found it interesting that these four films of Nolan's deal with similar themes. I don't really have anything more than that.

I saw it three days ago and it hasn't left my mind ever since. It is possibly the most deeply disturbing and unnerving movie experience I've ever had. It's one of the most bizarre, surreal, disgusting, and ultimately profound films I've ever seen.

The Act of Killing follows several now elderly gangsters who were recruited as death squad leaders by the Indonesian military during the 1965 coup. They ended up on the winning side of the conflict; and as such, they've never been held accountable for the horrible things they've done. On the contrary, they are celebrated as local heroes and have convinced themselves of as much. They openly boast and celebrate their 'accomplishments' as young men. They sit around and drinking and talking about the good old days when they could rape and murder indiscriminately. It's a surreal experience; like stepping into an alternate reality where the Nazis won the war and are celebrated for their atrocities.

This is not a typical doc where the victims families are interviewed and the perpetrators condemned. Instead, the filmmakers challenge these men to recreate the conquests of their youth in their favourite hollywood styles (Gangster films, and musicals most note ably). They dress up in cheesy makeup and drag, reenacting torture methods that they performed on real people. You want to laugh because it's so outrageous but that thought makes you sick when you're reminded that these are real murderers who did these things to real people.

It's a strange but ingenious approach. By not confronting or condemning these men, but instead appealing to their vanity and egos, it allows them to expose the lunacy and horrifying truth of their nature and past actions for themselves. It's a film about the power of the human psyche to fabricate, twist, distort, and deny a reality that is too horrible to come to terms with.

The Act Of Killing paints the portrait of a monster. One that is so terrifying because it is so human.

I won't ruin the ending, but the final scene is the most deeply disturbing and chilling thing I've ever seen captured on film. The dead silence of the audience when the credits rolled was something I've never experienced before in a theatre. Werner Herzog said in an interview that he doesn't think this scene will be topped by any of filmmaker for decades, and I'm inclined to agree. I believe that 20 years from now this film will be looked upon as one of the best documentaries ever made. You should most definitely see this film if you have the opportunity.

Thoughts? I'm curious what others took away from this.

This is the first one I've written shortly after watching Aguirre, The Wrath of God by Werner Herzog. All criticism is welcome, I need it. 


**The Wrath of the Jungle**

In Aguirre, Wrath of God director Werner Herzog constructs an operatic conflict between Spaniards and the jungle, the wrath of god and the power of a looming other. Aguirre leads a breakaway expedition in search of El Dorado to claim the land and riches as their own. They travel down a hellish river into a simmering, silent, and nightmarish exploration of man vs. nature.


Klaus Kinski plays Aguirre and his performance is powerful. Moving with an odd loping and limping gait he moves around the lone raft like a tightly wound protohuman dictator. His piercing blue eyes and long blonde hair stands him out from the rest of the would-be conquistadors like an angel turned demonic, wrapped in armor not fit for this land. He controls the boat with the wrath of god, as death seems to extend from his fingertips and issue from his breath. 

The most powerful aspect of the film is Herzog’s portrayal of the looming forest. In every shot and frame it rests in the background like a green veil. Beyond it is the unknowable. Where the Indians hide, where death seems ever imminent, and where man goes to disappear. It is the ever present other that issues wild animal calls that punctuate moments of the film, and the silent watcher where the absence of noise brings on the presence of an alien gaze. It is an unstoppable  force.

And it is laughable that Aguirre and the men think that they may conquer or control this land. Sitting upon rafts that float midstream past walls of vegetation like the walls of a hedge maze they claim ownership over what they fear above all else. Herzog explores the true power of these men and of Aguirre’s claim that he is the wrath of god. If Aguirre speaks the truth, his power and wrath is empty, fit only for the monkeys. It has no power over the jungle or the Indians.
Herzog fits all of this into a tight and unsettlingly beautiful film that shows the primordial conflict of man vs. nature and its nightmarish human inadequacy with an operatic style and piercing clarity like A Heart of Darkness turned medieval.

(1932)",57,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1b0y25/japanese_late_silent_cinema_and_yasujirô_ozus_i/,"I just saw this film today and it is actually the first Japanese silent film that I've seen as a part of a film studies course I'm taking. Before I work my way into the film itself I kind of wanted to give some context into the studio that made it.

So, Japanese late silent cinema actually took place a bit later than the late silent cinema of most other countries. The transition to sound took longer for Japan, with most theaters being wired for sound around 1932. Talkies were heavily prominent around 1934. The director of this paticular discussion, Yasujirō Ozu, was the most resistant to the talkies, making his last silent film in 1935.

Most, if not all, Japanese films of this era were accompanied by a Benshi. A Benshi was a translator, narrator and commentator when silent films were screened at theaters. Benshis even became celebrities to a certain extent. Audiences would attend certain screenings in accordance to the Benshi who was presenting the picture. Actually, the concept of a Benshi strikes me as an incredibly interesting one. Because Benshies were there to basically explain the action to the audiences, directors felt much more liberated to explore complex narrative structures. However, the Benshi were mostly gone by 1933. Interestingly enough, the Benshi Strike of 1932 was led by Akira Kurosawa's older brother, Heigo Kurosawa.

Shochiku, the film studio in discussion, was a reaction to Japan's oldest studio Nikkatsu which produced action heavy films. Shochiku began producing films in 1920 and it's key genre was known as ""shomingeki"". This genre is recognized as the home drama of everyday folk, which dramatized the lives of the middle class. Note that this is years before Italian Neo-Realism (though these two styles are different). The shomingeki style was infamous for making one laugh and cry within the same breath. Some of the other characteristics of these films consisted of: Hollywood influences, contemporary settings, middle class characters with stories expressing anxieties caused by modernization, extensive and realistic depiction of landscape, and was auteur centered. An interesting fact is that while most people attributed the low-camera style to Ozu, the usage of the low camera was actually heavily used in most Shochiku films seeing as how the director's hired by this studio stole from each other in means of unifying the studio's films as one collective work. As time progressed they eventually went off into their own styles. It is important to note though that no camera went as low as Yasujirō Ozu's whose flat angles would never reveal the floors or the ceilings of interiors.

Now, transitioning to Yasujirō Ozu's 'I Was Born, But...' (1932), I want to discuss how this film perfectly fits into the collective of Shomingeki films. It revolves around 2 sibling brothers' struggle in assimilating with their new school as they face conflicts against a gang of kids, but later familial conflicts as they begin to fear for their own future as their respect for their father rapidly declines as they see the inferiority he displays amongst his boss.

Like most shomingeki films, 'I Was Born' takes place in the time in which it was filmed. Ozu refused to film in the past or the future, never using flashbacks. It shows a small family from the countryside make their way to the suburbs as symbols of modernity prove evident throughout the film. Trains, planes and coffee shops are all common within mostly ever scene. This was an important factor because Ozu wanted to make films where the audiences lived. This went from predominantly countryside landscapes to suburban areas being key to shomingeki cinema. A popular stereotype of Japanese cinema of the time was that the entire plot was comprised merely of meditating characters conversing in Haiku. As ridiculous as that sounds,  there was some truth in that. Ozu would frequently show characters converse spontaneously in a mountain top or a field of grass without obvious relevance to the story. Many Shochiku films were known to do this as well. However, these particular scenes would give information about the characters in terms of how the landscapes they chose to surround themselves in would reveal their social status. 

Social status is an extremely essential element in 'I Was Born' because it highlights the weak male figure of our protagonists' father in how his role in society damages his appearance as a father. The children in this story are yearning for the traditional role of the father to come out. However, the father is trapped within the constraints of capitalism, to the disappointment of his children. Sadly, many of the jokes of this film are lost in translation, but some are obvious when involving body parts. Ozu breaks the characters into pieces. Close-ups and stationary shots of: scratching heads, scratching genitals, spankings, odd facial expressions etc... All of these shots are juxtaposed next to dramatic events. Again, laughing and crying is key when it comes to Shochiku films.

Anyway, this is my first Japanese silent film and I was really curious as to what others have to say about 'I Was Born, But...' (1932) or anything related to the shomingeki, Shochiku Studio or Japanese Late Silent Cinema.

Toxic in as there were and still are quite a lot of directors in Sweden trying to be Bergman who are not up to snuff, resulting in stilted performances that films feels more like theatre than cinema. However not everyone shares the same filmmaking ideals as Bergman and most prominent of those opposing the perceived stuffiness of Bergman was Bo Widerberg.



Bo Widerberg was a man with a vision, a vision where people in flims actually talked like people, a vision where films dared venture outside of the safety of the soundstage, a vision where films felt alive and he articulated this vision in his 1962 book *Visionen i svensk film*|*A Vision of Swedish Cinema*.


Born the 8th of July 1930 in Malmö, son of artist Arvid Widerberg, Bo Widerberg was to Swedish cinema what François Truffaut or Jean-Luc Godard was to French cinema.


Starting his career as a writer he made his debut with *Hösttermin*|*Fall Semster* in 1952, he then went on to write several books and short stories as well as critique and journalism. The same year as he published *Visionen i svensk film* he got the opportunity to put his vision to celluloid with his debutfilm *Barnvagnen*|*The Baby Carriage* (1963). Later the same year he got his major breakthrough and first Oscar nomination with *Kvarteret Korpen*|*Raven's End*.


The international breakthrough came with the 1967 film *Elvira Madigan* gaining several awards and nominations (including BAFTA, Cannes and Golden Globes). Building on the success of Elvira Madigan he went on to make a string of successful films including a biopic focusing on Swedish-American labour activist Joe Hill (*Joe Hill*|1971), *the* Swedish crime thriller (*Mannen på Taket*|*The Man on the Roof*|1976) and a terrific political thriller (*Mannen från Mallorca*|*The Man from Majorca*|1984).


Towards the end of the seventies Widerberg moved from feature filmmaking to TV-production and theatre due to various reasons including his mounting problems with funding despite his acclaim.


Bo Widerberg was a political filmmaker who wanted to tell stories about ordinary people and also show the beauty and wonder that exists in the world often letting his characters experience a piece of music or a painting. Not being afraid to use a lot of film stock Widerberg would do retake after retake just to get that slight, unanticipated movement from an actor.


Likely suffering from bipolar disorder, the environment on set was chaotic and his lack of planning, frequently using various bits of paper for script, caused several issues. The most extreme example of which has to be the 1974 film *Fimpen*|*The Butt*, where he pushed the sound engineers to constantly redo the mix, causing one of them to go to hospital for heart problems. The soundmix took so long to complete that when the curtains were hoisted on the première the mix wasn't finished; the final scenes were still being worked on. The film started as the finalised reels were rushed from the studio escorted by police to the projectionist, however it worked, the reels made it in time and the audience didn't notice a thing.


In 1996 he founded *Lilla filmfestivalen*|*The small filmfestival* a more intimate filmfestival that takes places in one cinema, Bio Scala in Båstad, that focuses on arthouse films, seminars and dialogues with invited guests.


On the 1st of May 1997 Bo Widerberg died of abdominal cancer, leaving behind 14 films, 17 theatre productions, several books and four children.

### **Notable Works**


##


**Kvartert Korpen | Raven's End** (1963|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057237/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_End))


Drawing on his own childhood experiences Widerberg tells the story of an aspiring working-class writer in Malmö, featuring some terrific performances, a moving story and great cinematography, it's easy to see why some regard this as the greatest Swedish film of all time.


**Elvira Madigan** (1967|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061620/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\Elvira_Madigan_(film\)))



Based on the real life of Danish tightrope walker Elvira Madigan and her affair with Swedish cavalry officer Sixten Sparre, the film is pretty oh so very pretty. Grim, but pretty. Terrific performances all round and a great use of Mozart in the soundtrack.



**Ådalen 31**(1969|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065261/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalen_31))


Also based on real events Ådalen 31 takes place in the Swedish district of Ådalen during a major strike in 1931, focusing on a family and their life during a key moment in Swedish history. With the usual excellent cinematography, great acting and directing that Widerberg consistently delivered.



**Mannen på Taket | The Man on the Roof** (1976|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074857/)|[WIKI]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_on_the_Roof))


This is the granddaddy of Swedish crime-thrillers and it has yet to be surpassed, ambitious, beautifully shot, well acted and with an intriguing (if straightforward) plot. However it's the characters who makes this adaption of the novel *The Abominable Man* by Sjöwall and Wahlöö stand out; they truly feel like distinct persons with their own ideas and motivations.



**Availability**: To the best of my knowledge only Elvira Madigan and Mannen på Taket have received English editions (and in the case of Mannen på Taket, it also being in English is not well communicated), however bitching nicely to Svensk Filmindustri [here](http://svenskfilmindustri.com/contact/) or [here](http://www.sfinternational.se/about/contact) about releasing a limited run of an international version of the DVD box set *Bo Widerberg - En filmografi* might work.


### **His legacy**


##


Despite leaving quite the mark on Swedish cinema Widerbergs influence pales to that of Bergman, he has his followers for sure (most notable of which at the moment is [Mikael Marcimain](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0545729/)) and he provided a much needed injection of energy into the industry. His *Elvira Madigan* was quite influential in its day and a lot of its imagery and even more so its use of music is now used to the point of it being clichéd.

And to some degree the tremendous success of *Mannen på Taket* is to blame for the 30+ films based on the same characters (most of which have been utterly awful), and god knows how many other subpar crime-thrillers that this cold nation of ours have produced.


However *Lilla filmfestivalen* instituted the Bo Widerberg Fellowship in 1997 and it has been given to some of the most vibrant and exciting talent that Sweden can muster. So with some luck we may soon have another eccentric giving another injection of the much needed energy that a lot of Swedish films lack.


Also, it doesn't feel right to conclude this post without posting [this wondrous interview from 1963](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkNSPnZJSVY) where he talks about using improvisation whilst his daughter is less than impressed and totally steals the show.

I've been re-watching a few golden-era movies, most recently Vertigo and North by Northwest. It always strikes me that movies today seem to have strayed away from the ""simple story"" typically found in Hitchcock movies, and others from the same era. I'm wondering whether this is due to a lack of good writing, or whether the ""simple mystery-adventure movie"" just doesn't attract a modern audience. 

It seems to me that today's Hollywood movies are too strictly separated into categories. You have the ""action movie"" category, a lot of which simply caters to the lowest common denominator, whilst the rest remains too superficial or conventional. Take the Bourne series; it generally has decently good writing and an interesting premise, but to me the elongated action scenes make the movies boring, and there's never time to explore the interesting bits of the premise.

A lot of the good movies that have come out since the early 90s have had quite different story structures than what was before. I'm thinking of movies by directors like Tim Burton, The Coen brothers, Quentin Tarantino or David Fincher. These seem to have really set a lasting precedent, although they were themselves no doubt influenced by earlier movies. The other good movies of the past 20 years have typically been historical, fantasy / super hero, or heavy dramas like The Shawshank Redemption.

What I'm missing is the simple (yet good) story. I'm thinking of movies like North By Northwest (and various other Hitchcock movies), The Third Man, Casablanca or Chinatown, as well as later movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Did simple storytelling get too boring? Am I just confused by nostalgia and Cary Grant? Is there anything more interesting to say about this topic?

Recent programs such as The Wire, Homeland, The Sopranos, and Band of Brothers have, as far as depth and realism goes, broken a lot of new ground in quite a short time. The traditional ""60-minute-story"" has given way to the ability to create multiple story arcs, while allowing characters and stories a deeper scope and more realistic framework. There are a few programs I would say rival great films such as The Godfather, Blade Runner, Citizen Kane in terms of innovation and depth. Comedies such as Arrested Development, The Larry Sanders Show, and Curb Your Enthusiasm have evolved TV comedy in a completely different direction in quite a short time. Laugh tracks and one-liners are all but gone, and wit, awkward humour, and documentary style cameras are in. Comedy in movies has evolved quite a bit recently as well (and as comedy does, quite parallel to television), but the direction TV comedy has taken seems like it veers more toward film every year.

It's about a kid (Ryan Gosling) that tells his shrink (Ewen McGreggor) he's going to kill himself on his 21st birthday. The plot revolves around the few days until this date and the Ewen's attempts to find and help Ryan. As the day draws closer Ewen starts losing his grip on reality; the same things happen twice, he's supposedly talking to people that are dead, etc. and the end of the film really leaves you sitting there in a stupor until you can formulate your own idea of what it all meant. This ending also leads to great discussions after viewing.

One other reason I love this though is for it's attention to detail. There are many very subliminal changes throughout the film that you really don't notice the first time watching or even at all unless it's pointed out but these slight tweaks do a lot for the mood and consistency of the film. 
The soundtrack is also fantastic and one of my all-time favorites. I watched an interview done by the two artists Asche &amp; Spencer and the depths they went to on the tracks are mind boggling. I really appreciate their work and it really stands out as a beautiful accompaniment to the visuals. 

Well that's about all I need to write, I hope that some of you watch this as there is much room for discussion - from the end of the film and all the rest it entails to the awesome post-work done in the form of very unobtrusive edits ...

I felt the story was original. It had that indie feel to it. The cinematography was wonderful. The acting was good. Overall I felt that it was a great piece of sci-fi. 

A lot of the sci-fi films we see today are fairly terrible. The story gets lost and buried under the millions of dollars of special effects. I don't think Pandorum suffered from that. The movie cost $33mill, but I think most of that went to into the sets.

Can you think of any other great long single shots? Also what do you think the value of such shots are in a film?

 I prefer the way Cuaron shot the action in Children of Men to say the quick cuts in the Bourne films which are rather nausiating.

Currently I'm rethinking the ending and wondering what kind of message that is sending to the audience.

I really like the style of this film, very warm and intimate, and I don't really know anything about the director Mike Mills but I'm guessing this is a very personal film for him since he also wrote it, plus it FEELS very personal; not just a fictional story with interesting characters, but real life types of people with real feelings, real reality and real idiosyncratic types of behavior/personality traits. They feel real because they're very particular anyways. I'm sure some (or maybe most?) things are totally fictitious.

Anyway I really enjoy the style of this film, and the subject matter is really intriguing. I've never had any problems with relationships with my parents really, or had to deal with these type of issues, but I feel like I relate to the main character. I saw this about a year ago and was really surprised how intelligent this was; I guess I was expecting some kind of quirky family comedy/drama type of thing, but if anything, this kind of reminded me of Eternal Sunshine, where memories and thoughts are put to film in a very evocative, beautiful way I hardly see in films nowadays. It gives me that warm feeling, sometimes melancholy but its a comforting form of that.

I know this film has been noticed and praised a few years ago but I don't hear a lot of people talk about it much, or know anyone whos seen it.

I've read that this is a metaphor for Poland after the cold war ended, which makes sense, but I just didn't find it as appealing.  Perhaps my lack of experience with European is the cause for this.

So, I guess here's what's on my mind: What connections may I have missed about the film that might change my mind about it?  What connections are there to the theme of equality that I might have missed?  How does this relate to the brief scene of the old person trying to recycle the bottle?

Ever since I saw it last summer, Bernie has only grown in my esteem; it’s the American film I’ve thought about the most this year and it will be the highest rated American movie on my forthcoming Top Ten Films of 2012 list. It wasn’t until I recently revisited Bernie on DVD, however, that I came to truly appreciate the slyness and subtlety of McConaughey’s crucial supporting turn. When viewers are first introduced to McConaughey’s character, small town District Attorney Danny “Buck” Davidson, it seems as though McConaughey is hamming it up unmercifully with his use of “air quotations” and his whispering of the phrase “closet homosexuals.” As the film progresses though, we start to see that it is Danny Buck (whose modus operandi includes outrageous P.R. stunts in order to capture wanted criminals) who is the ham. Notice the difference between Danny Buck’s demeanor in the faux-documentary scenes where he is directly addressing the camera versus the more objective scenes where he is interacting with the citizens of Carthage, Texas, to see how carefully modulated McConaughey’s performance is. The real highpoint of the performance comes later though; once the film shifts from a black comedy about a small town murder into an electrifying courtroom drama, McConaughey, like Jimmy Stewart in Anatomy of a Murder, suggests that his character’s folksy persona is something of a put-on in order to successfully manipulate the jury. Danny Buck intentionally mispronounces “Les Miserables” and then goads Jack Black’s title murderer into acknowledging that white wine pairs well with fish. Bernie ends up coming off as a pretentious aesthete in front of a jury of hicks and we, the audience, realize that this yokel D.A. is, well, really kind of brilliant, after all. Just like the movie.

A creepy, self-loathing, misfit.  I thought his performance was one of the best I've seen in a long while and the best I've seen from Phoenix. 

This character is set up perfectly to be controlled by, The Master.  The movie is a commentary on how people feel inherently broken.  We feel something is not right inside of us and we need to return to the perfect human state.  Anderson shows us how it's possible for these cults to begin and I personally thought it to be very plausible.

While his character is undoubtedly informed by the actor's background, Murray avoids reproducing his typical dramedic personas, giving us a character who comes across more realistically and whose reactions seem more natural and authentic.

While I don't think that Nicolas Cage has deliberately tried to create a particular persona in his films, the recent viral popularity of his more hammy performances has ascribed to his career a particular persona that's hard to ignore once it's been established. Tbh, I think it has affected my view of many of his better films. For example, I was watching Adaptation the other night, and I couldn't shake the idea that his performance as Charlie/Donald Kaufman was good but also that it was just him doing Nic Cage. I feel the same way about Leaving Las Vegas and Matchstick Men, that the merit of his performance is in the conformity of those characters and their situations to Cage's over-the-top acting. Even though Cage does put a tremendous amount of energy into creating those characters, it feels weird because you could just as easily put moments from those films into the ""Cage loses his shit"" videos. Devoid of context, Cage doing Charlie Kaufman becomes very continuous with performances that are more frequently mined for 'Nic Cage' moments. The only movies that I've seen where he comes across as something entirely different are Raising Arizona and Lord of War. In those movies, he handles the characters in a way that diverges from what he's become known for--he manages not to look like Nic Cage.

These days Cage seems very aware of what people expect from a Nic Cage movie. It seems like his promotion of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance has centered on it being a Nic Cage movie. This is not to say that he can always save a low-budget popcorn script: three of his films in 2011 were flops. Yet, he seems to be becoming a brand in his own right, not unlike Samuel L. Jackson or Tom Cruise.

I put to you: Does the 'Nic Cage' phenomenon take away from some of his more critically acclaimed performances? Also, what movies with Cage see him blending in most effectively? Finally, in your view, is it possible for Cage to deliver the goods (performance wise)*, and what type of movie could he do to make it happen?",,False,,t5_2szp0,1343187644.0,,,True,t3_x42bv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/x42bv/can_nicolas_cage_ever_escape_the_nic_cage_persona/,

In fact, I would argue that cgi animation, with movies like Toy Story, pioneered the modern cgi used in non-animation movies. 

When Walt Disney, first pionered traditional animation as a full movie, a lot of people thought he was nuts. However, over the years animation has been a huge part of both children cinema and adult cinema. 

I will be the first to admit that sometimes the story of animation movies can be contrived. Other times, however, the stories have as much artistic merit as a live action movies. Take for example, Hayao Miyazaki's films (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle). There has been much analysis of these films.

Does anyone here use this site? Since I started using it 4 years ago it has been indispensable to me. It's extremely useful for keeping a record of all the movies you see and when you see them, as long as you're inclined to rating them as well. I'll give a basic rundown of how it works.

First you rate as many movies as your heart desires. Potentially a very long task but very worth it. You can rank from 0-100, but the way the 10-tier system works, you can rank 0-10 and you'll get the same results as 0-100. 

Next, there's the Taste Compatibility Index (TCI). TCI is a rating that you have with every other user, comparing your tastes. The most useful aspect of this is that on individual movie pages, you can sort ratings by your closest TCI.

Perhaps the most useful tool of Criticker though is the Probable Score Indicator (PSI). This generates the likely score you will give to any unseen movie, based on all the ratings of the users with the closest TCI.

The film database features are also very intuitive and useful. There are a bunch of genres to filter by, all based on the IMDb genres of a film. You can filter by any year-to-year range you wish, the films popularity on Criticker, or any individual filmmaker. There is also the ability to sort whatever you filter by # of rankings, year in ascending or descending order and most importantly, PSI.

The community is filled with well-watched cinephiles. I'm posting this here to hopefully bring some more in. Whenever you rate a movie you have the option of writing a 500 character max. mini-review. There is a very estimable set of users that regularly post these.

There are a few other things you can find out for yourself about the site, if you like. I hope this brings in some more users, as I think this is an extremely under-utilized website in general.

&gt; Do not make posts that just ask users to list the names of films

I accept such judgment, although my point is to talk not only about what movies fit this category, but to analyze when and why it works.

Looper has massive 'unique to this specific movie' rules that must be there, lest the plot fall apart. Forcing the Loopers to murder their older selves, 'tagging' making murder in the future problematic, physical afflictions in 2044 affecting 2074 versions of the Loopers with no other ramifications, people with TK and the rules to that, etc. It's a lot to buy into in order to get going with the actual story.

Inception was very similar. What happens when you go into another dream layer, how time slows with each one, how subconsciousness works within the shared dream, when things fall apart, dream security, inception itself, each new element a new side of a house of cards that must stay standing or the plot crashes down.

Now every Sci-Fi, fantasy, supernatural, or otherworldly movie must have its rules, obviously, to create a fleshed out world that's believable. From *Toy Story* to *Lord of the Rings* to *Dune* to *Avatar*. I'm curious, though, as to finding the **most convoluted set of rules** ever conceived for a movie that still remained successful.

I ask this in /r/truefilm because I don't think /r/movies would fully understand the question and would come back with ""Primer- it's so complex!"" when I really am looking for answers like 

""The Matrix- it spent the whole movie explaining its environment, the rules to it, and also creating an allegorical statement of existence and our awareness of our lives. It made it work because it *showed* us how the rules worked through the ""new guy"" who needs everything explained to him. Inception also had the ""new guy"" character, Ellen Page, so Leonardo DiCaprio spends his time showing her how everything works.""

It has a lot of good information on the history of the film and it's many different releases. 

For more to think about, [here](http://www.ebertfest.com/four/metropolis_silent_rev.htm) is a modern review, by Roger Ebert, which praises the film and [here](http://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/H.G.Wells_on_Metropolis%201927.htm) is a contemporary review, by H.G. Wells, which strongly criticizes it. It's worth noting that Ebert seems to be reviewing the 1984 [Moroder version](http://www.morodermetropolisdvd.com/) and Wells almost certainly saw a truncated version that probably ran about 90 minutes.

We're discussing the new [""complete"" version](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Metropolis-Blu-ray-Brigitte-Helm/dp/B0040QYROK) with a running time of 148 minutes.

I'll try to start us off with a few questions to think about. Please don't feel obligated to answer these, and feel free to talk about anything you'd like.

**Some questions:**

* Visually, what did this film do that was new for its time? Was it genuinely groundbreaking?

* What does this movie say politically? Socially? Is it successful in making a statement?

* What does this film say about the act of revolution?

* Fritz Lang later said:

   &gt;The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am at least 50 percent responsible because I did it. I was not so politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale – definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture – thought it was silly and stupid – then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?

   He seems to be very critical, and is all but disowning the film. Why do you think he felt this way?

* How does the story of the tower of Babel relate to this film? What religious meaning does this film have?

* How does this film treat women? Why do you think Rotwang chose to have the robot do an erotic dance to show how lifelike it is? How do you feel about the crowd's reaction? What do you think of the contrast between the robot and the ""saintly"" Maria?

* What do you think about the film's portrayal of technology?

* How does this film relate to previous, and later, films and works of literature?

* How does putting the film into historical perspective change your understanding of it? Are there aspects of the film a modern audience can't ""get"" without understanding the cultural and social issues in the time and place it was made?

* What lesson did you take away from this film? What lesson do you think the film intended?

* How does this film compare with Fritz Lang's other work?

1376576590.0,44,self.TrueFilm,1kf433,The Use of Realism and Violence in The Hunger Games and Battle Royale,63,19,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kf433/the_use_of_realism_and_violence_in_the_hunger/,"There aren't many films in the same genre as wildly different in tone as *The Hunger Games* (2012) directed by Gary Ross and *Battle Royale* (2000) directed by Kinji Fukasuka, but for all their tonal differences they are very similar thematically, in plot, and in that both are ultra violent.  In this essay I intend to argue that the violence of *Battle Royale* is more poignant while being unrealistic and hyberbolic because the characters it portrays are more believable, while the violence of *The Hunger Games* is less poignant while attempting to be realistic because the characters it portrays are not believable.

*Battle Royale's* children all know each other from the beginning, being in the same class for presumably a long time.  When placed on an island and commanded to kill one another we see instantaneous rejection of the idea that they should be violent towards one another, but slowly they realize that they must succumb to violence to succeed in the world in which they are placed.  But even though the violence is gratuitous, its effect is very strong because these characters are believable and the moral consequences of murder are never fully forgotten as the film goes on.

How are the characters in *Battle Royale* believable though?  I particularly like how the characters act as immature as children toward their peers.  A great example of this is a scene a little over a third into the film in which Mitsuko, the class outcast now turned serial killer, is confronted by a classmate for murdering another girl and the suicide of her boyfriend, who was stolen by Mitsuko.  The talk quickly divulges back into class dynamics with Mitsuko, a villain in the film, crying out “I've had it, why does everybody gang up on me.  What did I do?”  Something in my experience with children is especially true.  They talk like this, blame each other quick, and question “Why does everybody ____ to me” instead of facing their own mistakes.

While the violence in this scene and the rest of the film are dramatically and ridiculously over the top, it's emotional effect is amplified by the fact that the characters in the film act like normal children, by quarreling over crushes and other trite things all the time.  Morality is still present though in an early scene in which the main character Shuya and another boy fight.  The other boy dies in a tumble and Shuya quickly asks his female counterpart “You saw it, did I kill him?”  Shuya is very concerned with whether or not he committed murder, as are many characters in film.  This scene is constantly referred back to in the film because Shuya's childlike innocence is at stake and he is worried he is tainted due to possibly having murdered someone by accident.  These idea make the death of characters have more depth due to the consequences seeming more real.  These characters seem more real, fully developed, and mutli-faceted than characters in *The Hunger Games*.

So what makes *The Hunger Games* characters unbelievable?  Now while I understand that the narrative is set in a dystopian society and the plot tries to cover this up by saying that certain children “train” to be in *The Hunger Games*, many of the characters, including the main character, Katniss, appear to be one-sided, boring characters who are almost solely just mindless killing machines.

About half way through the movie “the games” start and we are introduced to violence on a grand scale.  The children are in a circle and at the center of the circle are weapons, the children can choose at the start of the games to either run towards the weapons (higher risk:reward) or run away into the nearby forest.  This scene as a viewer stuck out to me because it is ultra violent.  In particular one boy with a large bloody knife stands over another boy and hacks at him mercilessly.  

While this violence in a vacuum is more effective at invoking emotion that the cartoony violence of *Battle Royale*, it is sorely lacking once put into context with the film and what we know of the characters.  The characters in *The Hunger Games* are one dimensional at best and thus their deaths are inconsequential.  Perhaps the only character who breaks this emotionless existence is Rue, a small girl who dies with Katniss, but the film engages (in my opinion) with emotional manipulation to make her death effective rather than flushing out her character.  Rue is not a complex character like Mitsuko (who may I remind you is a villain) but instead Rue is just some girl who happens to be nice towards the main character.

Rue's death is poignant because she is sung a lullaby as she dies, Katniss cries, gives her a funeral, and a quasi-rebellion happens in her district but if we had all the same information we have about Rue and she just got blown up by a landmine and nothing else happened we as an audience would barely bat an eye.  Inevitably she is just another face in the crowd for Katniss to get through to complete the games.  Mostly all characters act like this in *The Hunger Games* thus while the violence is “realistic” and filled with powerful images, it inevitably falls flat because the characters are forgettable.

Thus, I believe the over the top violence in *Battle Royale* is more poignant than the violence of *The Hunger Games* because the characters in *Battle Royale* are more believable, relatable, and complex than those of *The Hunger Games*.

So yesterday I finished watching Primer for the second time after doing quite a bit of reading into fan theories and explanations of the film and decided to look into how the movie was crafted in a production-sense. 

So the first thing I'd like to discuss is it is known that Carruth used 35mm film to storyboard the shots out but shot the film itself on Super 16 mm film with a shooting ratio of 2:1. 
And my question is this: Why do you think Carruth chose to use such shoddy film for this movie, or even real film at all for this production, as opposed to say digital, like whipping out a fancy DSLR and shooting Primer. Would the movie be as good if it were shot on a DSLR?

How was he so successful with the production of this film? Is Sundance really something that can launch a no body into the ""game""? 

If independent filmmaking is really launching and Shane Carruth is a clear example, then what makes him so? Are we finally at a time where talent and vision alone can catapult a movie into success? Independent filmmakers all over are using DSLRs, why did he go the film route rather than digital do you think?

&gt;A sleazy cable-TV programmer begins to see his life and the future of media spin out of control in a very unusual fashion when he acquires a new kind of programming for his station. Visually audacious, disorienting, and just plain weird, Videodrome's musings on technology, entertainment, and politics still feel fresh today.


As you may be aware, users were invited to submit two complementary films to watch over two rounds (this is part 2). The winning submission was by /u/jcwood, here's his write-up of how the two complement each other and are interrelated:

&gt;**Network** (1976) by Sidney Lumet and **Videodrome** by David Cronenberg (1983)

&gt;Though stylistically, these films differ tremendously, they both deal with the advent of television and this new medium's impact on human society. In Network, the approach is satirical, and indicates an adversarial attitude toward television from a dying movie studio that has refused to adapt to the times (MGM). The effects of television herein are deleterious and hysterical. In Videodrome, television creates opportunities for physical change, a New Flesh arises, evincing a kind of paranoid futurism. In both cases, television ushers in a new stage of humanity, the humanoids of Network and the New Flesh of Videodrome.

I watched it, can find evidence it exists, but still I'm convinced that I'm asleep right now and the movie is a complete fabrication of my sub-conscience.

The movie doesn't look like it was made in 1999. So much so that an opening title has to reassure you it takes place in the 90s. It looks more like Taxi Driver than anything Scorsese made in that time. It's both horribly unpleasant to look at, and remarkably beautiful at the same time. I can't recall a film with blacker shadows than this, or brighter highlights. It's an dreary nightmare land of florescent lighting, whip pans, and receding hairlines, and I loved it.

Where the film doesn't quite work for me is on a narrative level. And while it might be tempting to throw the blame on screenwriter Paul Schraeder, I think the real reason why the film isn't as emotionally satisfying as it should be lies entirely on Patricia Arquette. She's such a black-hole of boring that the whole film suffers as a result. I can't decide who was a bigger mar on films in the 90s, her or Juliette Lewis. Either way, Arquette's character falls completely flat and as a result the film sort of does as well. Her relationship with Cage's character is clearly intended to be the emotional bedrock of the story, but as that fails (due to Arquette's humdrum performance) the film's forced to rely on the thrills of Cage's job and Scorsese's camera tricks to make up for this. Which, while it is entertaining, is ultimately empty and gets old after a while.

What do you think? Does the film's style make up for it's substance? Is Patricia Arquette worse than Juliette Lewis? Would the 90s be better if neither of those actesses were in movies?

Additionally, it sent me on a massive Sam Raimi binge, where I decided to watch nearly all of his films,even the not very good ones like 'The Gift,' and 'For the Love of the Game.' 

Now, I stand here asking: what do my fellow redditors think of Raimi? Do you like him? Hate him? WHich is it?

Personally, if I had to pick a single favorite director... I'd have to go with him. In my opinion, the 'Evil Dead' trilogy is the best trilogy ever devised. I adore the fast pace and frenetic energy that runs through the whole thing, I think the mix of slapstick and 'spook-house horror' in Evil Dead 2 is absolutely brilliant (it serves as my single favorite film for a reason), and 'Army of Darkness' is imminently quoteable. As for his other films, I love how Darkman is a superhero film with the pacing and atmosphere of an old Universal monster movie, I love the old school 'morality play' at work in a simple plan, I love how 'Oz, the Great and Powerful' genuinely embraces its more fantastical roots and doesn't desovle into mindless action-adventure (I'm looking at you 'Alice in Wonderland'), and I love every single god-damn second of 'Drag me to Hell.' Hell, I even enjoy 'Crimewave,' but mostly because of just how ridiculous it is.

I understand that his films might not be for everybody, as he gets most of his inspiration from older, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff era, horror and thriller films. However, I think his one of a kind cinematography, writing that is almost always hilarious/engaging/both, and his eye-catching style, make him a one of kind BAWS!

Dining in the restaurant nightly with his gang of cronies, hangers on and oppressed wife Georgina (Helen Mirren) he taunts the staff and customers and is generally loud and oafish – not missing an opportunity to cause a scene. One evening Georgina catches the eye of one of the regular diners, a quiet, bookish unnamed man (Alan Howard) – everything her husband is not – and they fall into a lusty corporeal affair right under Albert’s nose in the kitchens and bathrooms of the restaurant. Unable to tame their passion, they strive to avoid detection as a real love begins to grow between them.

A mere synopsis goes no way to describing the depth and ambition of this film. A study of tyranny and evil demonstrated in an unflinchingly brutal drama and presented in a wildly imaginative alternate reality, this is a unique, memorable experience. The theatrical design of the restaurant's kitchens and dining room is immediately striking. Vast ornate sets dripping with foodstuffs and elaborate details and bright complementary colours fill every frame like a living classical oil painting. Frequently shot with wide static camera angles and lit brightly from above, the cavernous sets have a strong feeling of the stage – heightened by the eccentric costumes (designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, no less) that fall somewhere between 70’s London, Elizabethan England and the distant future. It may sound incredibly superficial but writer/director Peter Greenaway has delivered enough weight to ensure the style doesn’t overawe the subject. Released in 1988 it can be read as a satire on Thatcher’s Britain, or a broader portrait of oppression and the power of evil – the interpretation is left to the audience. Predominantly playing as a domestic drama about lust and abuse, it is so well written and performed it can be enjoyed as such - the depth is there for those who wish to see it. 

Michael Gambon is electric as the bigoted, grotesque ‘Thief’. Belittling his customers and terrorising his diminutive wife, he stirs all the feelings of vitriol and hate the character deserves - a big dramatic performance dominating the screen and creating an unforgettable character in Mr. Spica. Helen Mirren’s Georgina, initially a far quieter performance, is no less impressive, making the remarkable transformation from meek wife to sexual, hard edged woman filled with carnal desire and hate. Both roles are delivered with such solid conviction and boldness it is impossible not to be captivated by their interplay.

The raw intensity and electrified feeling of a live performance is almost impossible to portray on the screen, but Peter Greenaway has come close with the blackly funny ‘The Cook...’. The surreal setting and peculiar cast of characters lends an unpredictability and sense of unease that locks the audience up in Le Hollandais with the customers, and leaves us yearning for some daylight and respite from Spica’s tyranny. A dark, bizarre and ferociously original piece of cinema – this will be entertaining and relevant for as long as brutality and injustice exist.

1365869844.0,43,self.TrueFilm,1c9vh4,Why did so many people miss the central conceit of the film Room 237?,63,20,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1c9vh4/why_did_so_many_people_miss_the_central_conceit/,"I just watched the great documentary/essay Room 237 last night. What struck me though when looking through reviews of the film, in particular general audience reactions, is that many people simply dismissed the entire film because they didn't agree with the five crackpot theories that were presented. What bothers me about this take on the film is that these people have in my mind completely missed the entire point of the film. If the film was meant to present a single idea, or even five ideas (ala something like Loose Change or Zeitgeist) in manner that would convince you of their validity, then why would the filmmakers continuously cut and chop the reviews together in a way that gives no full time for explanation for any one theorist? Why would the filmmakers never show us the faces of the theorists which would have allowed us to better appreciate who was talking when (I kept getting the Native American genocide and the Holocaust genocide theorists mixed up)? I fell this is because the point of the film is not to say ""here is the hidden meaning of The Shining"" but rather to say ""here is WHY these people feel there is hidden meaning in The Shining"".

What I appreciated so much about Room 237 is the way it forces you to live the same kind of life these theorists live and to see the film in the same way. The editing slows down each important frame, forcing you to watch the same image on loop over and over and over again. By the end you begin to start to feel their mania and their obsession leaking through the film and it shows you why the film so resonates with people who demand to unravel it's secrets. It's hard not to see many of their fabled images yourself as the simple acting of cutting and slowing down the footage changes the very nature of the footage itself. There's a great moment in the film where I feel an audience member will understand the purpose of the documentary or not. One theorist argues that Stanley Kubrick airbrushed his face into the clouds in the opening credits when his name appears. The film holds on the image of those clouds for a very long time and demands that you search with all your might to find the hidden image (spoiler alert: you never will see it). Either you are going to dismiss this film as nonsense or you are going to see how the filmmakers have tricked you into being a similar observer as the one's you hear on screen.

Think about it this way. If the film was done in a similar way about 9/11 conspiracy theorists, would it be a pro-9/11 conspiracy film? I wouldn't think so, because to me the brilliance of this film is showing an image that is the same to everyone with radically different results. Film is a static medium and (forgetting the two different cuts of The Shining) the version of the film I see today is the same version you might have seen on tape in 1993. It's the same image for everyone, yet five different people can see the same image and come up with wildly different ideas about it's meaning. I feel the same would be true of my hypothetical 9/11 conspiracy doc. To me that film wouldn't argue that ""This is what really happened"" but would rather argue ""how can five people see the same undoctored footage a thousand times over a see something entirely different from each other""? 

I feel bad because I absolutely never want to say ""you didn't like this film because you didn't get it"" but it's hard for me not to argue that filmmaker intent is being grossly lost on many who have seen this film. I also don't want to argue that the film is somehow a perfect gem that should never be hated. It's views are very opaque and the editing often felt incredibly random on the kinds of subjects it wanted to focus on. Because of that there isn't much of a conclusion but thankfully there's an interesting enough climax to give the film a slight feeling of closure. I do love the film, but I think one can understand what the film is going for and still feel like it failed.

So what do you think? Am I wrong that the filmmakers did want to explore the real meaning of The Shining? Is the film more about the act of seeing (as I claim it is) or is it more about the act of understanding (as many others think it is)? Is the film even any good?

Larry Malick was a guitarist who went to study in Spain with Segovia in the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies. Emil [Malick's father] went to Spain to help Larry, but Larry died shortly after, apparently committing suicide.""

It really makes me wonder whether Malick blames his younger brother's death on his father, since it's pretty obvious in the film that Brad Pitt's character feels at least partially responsible for R.L.'s death.

Interestingly enough, I was originally going to post a discussion asking how fellow viewers interpreted R.L.'s death. I'd thought from the first time that I saw the film that it was pretty obvious that he'd killed himself, but I've also talked to more than one person who inferred that he was killed in war (presumably Vietnam). But I guess now I know the answer to that question for sure.

So instead, I guess I'll ask this: Why do you think that Malick left the details of R.L.'s death ambiguous in the first place?

I've recently been spending a lot of time critically watching movies in an attempt to turn this gathered knowledge of literature into a lens for film.  I've noticed that due to the difficult to avoid time restriction of the medium, the ways in which these characters are quickly established is usually particularly creative.  It seems that some directors, in some of their work, are excellent at giving a character ""roundness"" with just a few simple shots.  For example, I'm actually in the middle of Kill Bill Vol 1 as I write this (movie is paused) and there is a shot at approximately the 17 minute mark where a sheriff approaches the scene of a crime in his vehicle, and on the dashboard there are a few pairs of aviator sunglasses.  This short shot gives insight into the sort of character this sheriff is in a Things They Carry sort of way. (This example suffers from the character's short lived screen presence, but I think gets my point across appropriately enough)

There are plenty of other ways a director can develop depth in their characters I'm sure, this one comes to mind simply because I'm experiencing it right now.

I ask, as somewhat of a film novice, what other directors/movies have well rounded characters who are informed by creative story telling devices?

It even has a fairly low IMDb score of just 6.9.

Now while some of that seems to stem from it being a non-commercial movie starting bankable commercial stars, but there appears to be a lot more to much of the arguments.

Pulling James Earl Jones' voice from other movies and putting them on the first *Star Wars* (mostly) works a treat. The tones of the voice are often very similar, and through appropriate editing, Jones' voice *fits* the physicality of Vader in the dialogue replacements.

What then struck me were the differences in Vader's tone of voice, his dialogue, and how he fits into the narrative world between the two films. In *The Empire Strikes Back* his voice has slightly more treble, sounds less booming, and altogether feels more *sinister*. But it's more than that: in *Star Wars*, I feel Vader comes across as essentially an immoveable force. He never leaves the Death Star. He is ordered by Tarkin, he’s ‘controlled.’ It feels as though the Empire is the primary villain in *Star Wars*, and Vader is a conveniently unsettling singular representation of the villain. However, in *The Empire Strikes Back*, Vader moves about a lot more. He’s on the command ship, he’s walking through the ice base, he’s at Cloud City. He could be around the corner. He’s *coming to get you*. In this film, it feels to me as though the roles have been reversed: *Vader* is the villain, and the Empire is the machinations of that villain.

I’d like to use this thread to spark discussion about the differences in not only Vader, but other characters and narrative between the two films.

For example, I noticed differences between the two characterisations of Han Solo, Leia, Luke, Threepio… it seems the only two characters that are really the *same* between the two films are Obi-Wan, and Artoo.

I've just watched Vittorio de Sica's *Bicycle Thieves* and I'll have to preface this by saying if it weren't in the top ten for Directors in the Sight &amp; Sound poll, I'd have stopped watching half way through. 

Most of the Sight &amp; Sound poll I understand. *Citizen Kane*, *8 1/2*, *Taxi Driver* are all clearly important and great movies. They aren't really locked in time, and each have a distinct style. *Bicycle Thieves* seemed like a normal movie with a twist. 

Was it a product of its time? Even so, why does it still remain famous? *8 1/2* will always succeed because it is (on the surface) a story of writers block, something we all experience. *Bicycle Thieves* has a conundrum that may cause some slight discussion. I just don't get it.

This occurred to me after re-watching ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home,"" and realizing that what the movie really is about isn't this wacky slob living in his mother's basement, but rather a goofy idealist trying to make his family have hope again. A similar theme shows up in ""Safety Not Garunteed,"" which also could have very easily been a movie poking fun about a weirdo who thinks he can time travel, but instead it's celebrates the weirdo. Every character in that movie overcomes their own person cynicism by the end of it. For Mark Duplass' character is the belief that he'll never find someone who understands him. For Aubrey Plaza's character it's the belief that nothing original or exciting exists in the world. For the dorky intern beliveing no girl will ever want to be with him. And it's especially true of Jake Johnson's character. At the start of the film he's nothing but the embodiment of cynicism, everything about him is calculated but by the end of the movie he's nothing but raw emotion.

These two films are the main examples that come to mind, but I think you can also see this downfall of world-weariness in the years blockbusters. People could argue about the ""marketability"" of The Avengers all they want, but I honestly believe the reason why it beat The Dark Night Rises was that it's a movie about hope, teamwork, the best mankind has to offer. Whereas The Dark Night Rises is a dark, depressing movie about the worst of humanity. I'm not coming down on the film, but the characters are all brooding, joyless, and hopeless. This isn't anything new for the Nolan Batman universe, but I just think America is done with the whole dark thing. That's why the movie didn't beat Avengers. Not because Bane's voice sounded funny.

Other examples I can think of to support this are: **21 Jump Street:** An earnest celbration of friendship disguised as a cynical cash grab. **Silver Linings Playbook:** The idea of a silver lining is in the freaking title. And, though it's not the best financial support for my argument, **John Carter of Mars**. If you ask me part of why the marketing of this movie was so bad, is that they tried to dress up such a heart-on-its-sleeve adventure movie as a tough, ""cool"", action movie.

It's a two-hour Hungarian film shot in black and white, completed in only 39 shots. I try not to think too much about what's coming before I watch a film, but I had a feeling this wasn't going to be Anchorman.

Cue the first ten minutes and I don't know what I'm seeing. People talking but badly dubbed, huge long takes. I nearly jacked it in but I always finish a film once I've started it.

Then, almost as if by magic, it sucked me right in to a point where I couldn't stop watching. Everything became fascinating; the walking, the noises, motion, the music. I was transfixed.

I still don't know what to make of it really. I *do* know three things:

* I felt no emotion whatsoever towards any character in the film.
* Watching a town spiral into chaos is riveting.
* Letting the camera roll on for ages can be fantastic. Actually I'm reminded of another, perhaps more 'mainstream' example from the recent film adaptation of *Les Miserables* - a film I didn't like very much bar one scene where Anne Hathaway sings 'I dreamed a dream'. There are no cuts - she's just allowed to do her thing and it works.

Tarr's direction is unique, and he makes every scene a journey. This is clever and exciting to watch, but I did also find myself thinking about what I was seeing on a technical level, constantly imagining the man behind the camera. More 'ooh how on earth did he pull this off?' rather than 'what's happening here?'. It's not a criticism of the film though since having scenes last as long as they do gives the viewer plenty of time to ponder these things.

I don't know if I could casually recommend this to anyone, but overall I was very impressed and, whilst it *was* thought provoking, I was also surprised by how entertaining it was.

I have never really done any reading on film or been educated in any way, so please forgive me if  my comments are somewhat ignorant or completely off the topic. Though Persona was an ambiguous film with room for various different interpretations, I'd rather leave that kind of discussion for someone more knowledgeable than me.


What I'd rather talk about instead, is the power of Persona as a film. The opening shot is almost of a surreal nature, instantly grabbing the viewers attention and challenging your senses, and to me, this is where Persona succeeded like no other film I've seen before: it challenges the viewers senses. I have always found that with Bergman's films I need to put in an extra bit of attention and focus, but this film sucked me in straight from the start, and those 85 minutes went by as if they were 5.

As the story progresses, the character played by Bibi Andersson slowly descends into a spiral of madness as she questions the true motives of her partner after one drunk night, and begins to find that their personalities are becoming one. This, ladies and gentlemen, is where Ingmar Bergman shows his true colours. Rather than have you watch the character's descent from an outside point of view, he brings you straight into her condition, as if to have you experience the torments that she is going through. The film loses all structure, and the narrative becomes blurry and confusing, but at this point you don't even care any more. In fact, if this movie impacted as much as it did to me, at this point you've forgotten you're even watching a movie in the first place. The camera work in this last hour shines out so much it might even succeed in making you think you've lost your mind..

Of course I'm missing out on a thousand things that make this movie brilliant, but right now these are the ones that are jumping out the top of my head, and I had to come here and share what was probably the best cinematic experience I've had in my life. Never has a film managed to influence my mental and physical senses in such a way, and I'm curious to see if any movie ever will again.

As I said before I may be completely missing out on what the film truly intends to do, but this is the way I see it.

It's genuine, opinions are respected, and discussion is encouraged, keep it up.  

I feel like I have the problem of looking up a movie on Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb, looking at the rating, and letting that affect my opinion on films. For example, when I first started to understand what a good movie is, I went straight to the top 250 on IMDb and started watching some of what the internet has rated to be the best movies ever made.  The first was The Godfather, a legitimately amazing movie, and I still believe this to be true after multiple viewings. But at the time I only assumed it was a good movie because other people said so.  

So fast forward 3 years to now.  I have a better understanding of what makes a good movie after taking a few film classes and watching more and more films.
Let me just come out and say that Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director/writer. I love his style. The music in Kill Bill, the directing in Inglorious Basterds, and the writing in Reservoir Dogs blow me away. But seeing all this Tarantino circle-jerking is making me feel like maybe my opinions are still not my own.

A lot of people love his movies and see him as one of those filmmakers at the forefront of cinema. Some seem to think he's over the top and likes to pound people in the head with his work, in a ""THIS IS ART!"" way. 

I really like his movies, particularly loving Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler. I like The Fountain, mostly because of how beautiful it is. Black Swan is an entertaining picture. Pi didn't really do it for me, although I haven't watched it in a few years, only seeing it once.

The Wrestler is such a great little character driven movie, with Rourke's great performance, and raw camerawork to match. I grew up a big wrestling fan, so it already had me in that regard.

Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that shook me up when I saw it back in high school a few years ago. Sure, the ""Drugs are bad, mkay"" theme was obvious, but seeing people's dreams blossom for a little bit and then crash and burn is a really tragic narrative that I can't help but feel for. But the filmmaking on display is what got to me. Very rarely had I seen a movie where the craft was so damn captivating. Some other movies that do this for me are Goodfellas, The Passion of Joan of Arc, A Clockwork Orange, Children of Men, Persona, and I Am Cuba. Aronofsky just pulls every trick out of his filmmaking hat to create this portrait of addicting and abuse in these people's lives and I just love that creativity. 

Editing in modern movies seems (in most cases) to do nothing for the film, just allowing the filmmakers to piece together their movie from whatever cameras were running. This movie uses editing to craft something. The cuts make an impact, and the shot themselves are strikingly composed, using all kinds of techniques. This is the movie that I feel is Aronofsky's best, at least until I see Noah.

Rattled me to my core. Never had I experienced a film whose message felt like blunt trauma to my psyche. I, as well as many others have assumed and come to the conclusion to, mistakenly saw it as a film that asserted the notion that men are indeed animals, and to ignore these base impulses is wrong and futile, as seen by Dustin Hoffman's character, David's, transformation from the milquetoast academic to the brutal killing machine at the end of the film, finally becoming a ""man"". This interpretation was both informed by the various reviews I read of the film, so controversial when it was released in 1971 that Pauline Kael notably called it ""the first American film that is a fascist work of art."", as well as my not truly paying attention to what Peckinpah was actually doing and saying with the film. Nonetheless, seeing a lot of myself in David, I emerged from that initial viewing feeling greatly troubled and sure enough, the film, as well as Peckinpah himself, has stuck with me since. 

But as I started looking more into it recently, I read [an interpretation](http://thehighhat.com/Nitrate/002/straw_dogs.html) (that I invite you all to also read) that shed an enormous amount of light and left me incredulous at just how widely misinterpreted the film was and still is. Even the people that *liked* the film seemed to have missed the point entirely. More in-depth, if you haven’t yet heard it, on the out-of-print Criterion DVD, there’s a commentary track by Stephen Prince that will blow your mind even further. He starts out by saying that it’s Peckinpah’s masterpiece, and over the next 117 minutes he puts forth an incredibly strong case for just that. 

I guess the point of this post is partly to share this interpretation with you, but I mainly am curious as to what you all have thought of the film. What were your reactions, your impressions? This is a film that truly and fiercely *provokes*, so I'd imagine strong opinions would be had.

I was thinking what that meant for the film as a whole. In particular, the System Purge scene holds great significance besides being an amazing showcase of horrors. First, why is that even there? It serves no purpose but to create a sense of disconnect for a murder-suicide. Plus it had exactly one guard. Besides being a nod to Big Red Buttons in general, it seems like the creators of the facility were waiting for a moment like that to happen. Also, consider who activates it. Not Marty, the Genre-Savvy pothead who realized something was up from the beginning, but Dana, the only person who had the possibility of surviving the ritual if done correctly, is the person who ensures doom for everybody. Now this could be seen as a subversion of how the final girl bests the villain of the piece, (in this case, the company) as she turns the horror on her captives. Also, once the creatures are released it seems to be an obvious metaphor for the creators of horror films being consumed by the arbitrary rules they have set up for their movies. My final point is that a theme running throughout the film is the idea that the status quo needs to change completely and to do that we need to just start over, which is why the film ends the way it does.

The rest of his filmography is a classic case of style of substance, IMO. *Coffee and Cigarettes* had some funny moments but I don't even think Jarmusch took that movie seriously. *Ghost Dog* was a disappointment for me, hiding its weak plot behind some facile Buddhist philosophy.

However, in the case of this incredible work of art, the forums are a bit lacking of a good discussion. 

I haven't seen much of Lynch, I saw Eraserhead and Mulholland Dr. a few years ago and did not understand a lick of either film. I saw the Straight Story long before I was even into film the way I have been for the last few years, but I have seen Twin Peaks which I liked a lot, although I wouldn't argue is the greatest TV show ever.

Blue Velvet is one of the darkest films I have seen. The surreal portrayal of an underground group of criminals, led by the sexually abusive Frank Booth, is incredibly dream like and downright scary. It doesn't belong in the real world. It's not real at all. It's all too much like a sick vivid dream, that explores the horror and imagination of something that couldn't possibly exist. 

The encounters between all of the characters are all memorable and fantastic. The dialogue between Jeffrey and Sandy is just downright entertaining to listen to, there's just something about it that pulls me into their little world and I can understand what each character is feeling. The acting is powerful in other words, although at first something seemed so different, almost as if the actors were reading dryly from the script they had just remembered, but it eventually becomes engrossing and real.

The suspense is all so gripping. The main character just goes deeper and deeper into this mystery and it becomes a mystery thriller in dream land.

The setting of events (I'm mostly talking about the apartment) is incredibly odd. There's just something, disturbing about the place and kind of trippy. Here's a [picture](http://wendysworld.myblog.arts.ac.uk/files/2011/02/Blue-Velvet-David-Lynch1.jpg) with spoilers.

I'm curious of a few things:

- What do you guys think of the ending, the robin?

- What do you think about the surreal qualities of this film? What does the dreamlike vision do for the story?

- Thoughts on David Lynch? This film compared to his other works?

- How do you feel about the acting.

- How do you feel about the campiness and unconventional qualities of the film?

- Any social commentary to be discussed?

Since it was my first noir-film it changed the way of me watching a movie with stereotypes of a man and woman, when i was younger.

The movie contains a couple of men who are about to make ""the perfect crime"". The main characters wife is a so-called ""femme fatale"", which is a woman who, typically, have a role of the bad guy. This role is represented in almost every noir-film made.

The femme fatale is more than often a woman who cheats on her husband or tries to get the money, or even killed her husband/ random man. Her role is to make the life of our prontagonist miserable. In my opinion this is a good way to keep the attention away from otherwise obvious plot points, for example if it was just simply a bad guy. If we for example take a scene where a wife or husband is murdered. When the police arrives the obvious answer is that the partner killed the other partner, but if the man is killed then it would be weird for the wife to be the murderer.

This leads me to the question i've been thinking about; what role does the gender play in movies today.

I know that women are usually judged by their looks and not acting skill, but if we think about the ""better"" movies made recently. How are women presented by todays standards? If we take the movie ""The Artist, for an example, the main character falls in love with a woman who then appears to fake her love for her own winnings. This was a common practise in the earlier days of movie-making. The woman there has a specific role to fulfill and therefore she is a not only a character, but a critical part of the plot.

If we take the movie Drive (which i personally love). The woman there is a vulnerable woman with a child and a husband in jail. Her role is pretty big, but the plot could easily make it without her. This goes for almost every movie made nowadays. The woman is there to look nice and therefore get more viewers, of course this is not always the case, but this is really common.

This topic was brought up by me watching The Killing and Swedens ridiculous gender debate. So my question is how does women affect the movies? How do you think the course of women in film have progressed? We have got a strong role by the not so good-looking Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs, but there are still sex jokes aiming at her being a woman.

Or maybe perhaps you think that art is almost universal. As in, a film can be a novel if possible. A novel can be a film. A story or a message or a theme can transcend whatever vehicle it lives within. There are no films that can only be films. There are no unfilmable novels. Novels can be adapted in plays.

So, as an example he compared the most expensive films of the ‘50s and ‘60s (e.g. Ben-hur, Cleopatra) to those of the 90’s and ‘00s (e.g. Spiderman, Toy Story). Older movies generally used stories from Antiquity, foregoing any ability to exclusively cross-market and merchandise the films, whereas newer movies typically have a complex web of revenues sources built into the story: toys, amusement parks, video games, books, television spinoffs, clothing, etc. 

The studios have been accomplishing this by reaching an agreement with license owners (e.g. Mattel for Toy Story, Hasbro for Battleship) or outright purchasing a content giant like Marvel. Biopics like Ray and Walk the Line can sell a lot of an artist’s music catalogue.  My question is, can anyone think of innovative ways film franchises in the future can be built around popular copyrighted or trademarked products? It seems like toys and comic books have been pretty fully tapped. I figured it could be a fun brainstorming topic.

One idea I had was a studio purchasing a large video game producer and making endless amounts of video game films. This has happened not so successfully before (Doom, Resident Evil) but appears to be the general idea behind successful Wreck It Ralph.

**Wait, what does this have to do with filmic art?**

Some blockbusters like the David Leans of old and the Pixars of recent are fine pieces of film art, and the trends discussed above will most likely lead to new masterpieces formulated initially on a commercial concept.

I just watched Take Shelter. If you're reading this, I can imagine you've either seen it, you don't ever plan to, or you're just foolish and want to ruin the experience for yourself.

No detailed review of the movie here. It's a masterpiece in my opinion. I'm still digesting it, so maybe I'll come down in the next few days and realize some cracks in the armor, but I'll never be able to erase its affect on me. I can't remember the last time I cried like that. The Road, perhaps? Benjamin Button? Wit?

I knew *nothing* about this movie, except Michael Shannon was praised in it, Ebert gave it four stars, and it had something to do with tornadoes.

I didn't know, for example, that it was about mental illness. Half the engagement of the beginning of the movie was just figuring out what was going on. If I had known the movie was going to be about mental illness, I would've looked at the dream sequences as simply marks on a checklist, fulfilling the dramatic irony.

I also didn't know anything about the ending. I see reviews of the movie now that say ""what a great ending"" and ""wow I love the ending,"" coming from people who aren't Cronenberg or edgy filmmaker fans. That would've removed a fantastic part of the experience for me, to know that it ended in a curiously positive manner.

We've all seen ""he's going crazy"" movies. Black Swan, Repulsion, Bug to name a few more popular ones. Half of this movie experience, me watching Take Shelter, was saying a silent prayer that it wouldn't end with a massacre, or any sort of unresolved matter-of-fact meditation on the negative aspects of untreated mental illness. Having my anxiety and intense faith in this movie, and having that faith ultimately rewarded (as a surprise), is what movies should all aspire to be. It's like falling in love with a girl, and then finding out that she's actually worth your love, and that awesome wave of satisfaction washes over you, and you think ""don't betray me goddammit, don't let me down now,"" and it doesn't.

There's no question in this garble of text. I want to just share a testimonial, when people foolishly tell you that ""spoilers don't matter,"" as if they had insight into everyone's perspective on them. So when someone says that, point them to this thread.

A large chunk of my emotional ride in this movie depended on wishing for certain things to happen, figuring things out for myself, and being rewarded for my involvement.

I'm definitely a cinephage--while I won't go and pay to see the latest movie at a huge theatre I will sit and watch some good ol' fashion junky movies (i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street series, Friday the 13th series etc.) as well as more intellectually stimulating ones.
**Should we be aiming to be one or the other or are both necessary?** 
Taking out any notions of pretentions with a cinephile it cuts out lots of movies that aren't necessarily advancing film or presenting any new ideas. Maybe a boring or unexplainable movie here or there but it stimulates discussions, readings, and again *new ideas on the table*. 
On the other hand there are cinephages who will give anything a chance. We ride the line of movies as art and movies as entertainment.
I guess I feel that both are necessary but I'm not sure why or how to explain it.

I found the film to be a good watch and after watching it for a second time (the first time was a couple months after its release) I get the feeling there could have been more to it. I get the feeling Diablo Cody should have directed the film herself. The script for the movie is great, it's easy to tell it's one of her screenplays when watching the movie. Although Jason Reitman made a 'good' movie - hitting the right beats, taking time during scenes to set a tone, and bringing the best performance from Charlize, Patton and the rest, it feels like a 'second-hand' film. He sets up shots that look good but ultimately feel detached from what's happening on screen. Something which has happened because, although he is invested in the material, he didn't write it himself and thus can't bring the story to its full potential. Reitman seems more of a producer than director to me, I like his other films (specifically Juno) but all have detached quality where he is a serviceable director. 




**The Story**
I would have liked a resolution, or better put a character redemption for Mavis. What sticks out most for me is that Patton (I forget his characters name) takes his opportunity to have sex with Mavis even when he sees that she is in a vulnerable position. He failed her. He was someone she confided in and was the only one where she didn't try to put on an act. Patton should have stepped up and helped her through this time in her life so maybe things would change for her. A fable? I'm not sure - the lack of resolution makes the film a little forgettable. I like it but not enough to warrant more frequent viewings. Also my favorite aspect of the film is how Mavis transforms herself through make-up etc into the 'normal' beauty that she is. 




**Sidenote**
What do you think of Diablo Cody as a writer? She is soon to be directing a film with Russel Brand called 'Paradise'.

I'll openly admit that I have a somewhat biased opinion because I had worked in an amusement park during high school and my first two years of college, and it just so happened to be in the same park where *Adventureland* was filmed (Kennywood Amusement Park in Pittsburgh). So this film has much sentimental value for me as it brings back so many memories.

For all intents and purposes, *Adventureland* was a tremendous flop, boasting only a $17 million gross at the box office internationally. Why was it such a box office disappointment? In my humble opinion, the marketing for the film was atrocious. The tagline for the film was ""From the Director of *Superbad*"" which was very misleading. It seemed like viewers were expecting *Superbad 2* with the same raunchy humor as its predecessor. These expectations seemed to leave a sour taste in the minds of viewers; they didn't necessarily dislike *Adventureland* but were really just expecting something different.

To me, *Adventureland* is one of the closest things to a John Hughes film (*The Breakfast Club*, *Sixteen Candles*, *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, etc.) that has been released in recent memory. The film coincidentally takes place in the 1980's (when director Greg Mottola had worked in an amusement park), but it seemed very evident to me that this decision was more calculated and could quite possibly have been made to correspond with Hughes. [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObZ3yBzNKKQ) brief scene really captures the essence of the film (no spoilers). The humor is much more subdued than *Superbad* and seems to have a much more plausible set of characters and dilemmas as well. I think Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg give great performances, although nothing too noteworthy. SNL castmembers Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader steal the show though, but appear very infrequently in the film.

I'm interested to hear what members of this sub think of this film. I'm not expecting others to find this film as fascinating and enjoyable as I do, but I'm curious to see if others agree that the film might have been received much better had it been marketed to audience's more accurately. If you've never seen it, I definitely recommend checking it out. Personally, the depiction of life as an amusement park worker is spot on and definitely worth the watch for that. Furthermore, I do find the subject or theme of young people trying to overcome the increasing difficulties of life to be very thought provoking and something everyone can relate to.

She has also seen it multiple times.  The joy of watching it with her is that she remembers it differently but still knows scenes that are coming up by their visual description.  A whole separate post sometime about the joys of a good viewing partner...

In the canon of Kubrick movies I tend to view this film as a lesser member.  By no means a bad movie, but the hubris involved in filming a Vietnam movie in England ruins a lot of the outdoor visuals.  The outdoor locations in some cases narrowly avoid a ""Themepark Vietnam"" look.  But this weakness is also a strength...

Because the best performances are in the first half of the movie.  Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle and Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant deliver with characters you believe inside and out.  

Ermey, of course,  *is* a drill sergeant and thus has no trouble commanding credibility in the role.  His is such a lasting portrayal that I would suggest that when people are asked to picture a drill sergeant in their mind Ermey's face would appear most; outside of those who've had an actual drill sergeant I suppose.

D'Onofrio is equally believable as a man who had no business being in the marine corps.  There are multiple cringe-worthy moments where the viewer is struck by how utterly ""outside"" of things Leonard is.

The second half of the movie, where Matthew Modine's ""Joker"" is deployed in country - in this case the English countryside - doesn't deliver the same quality performances.  Modine is a credible and sympathetic narrator but no one else in the platoon or the press corps stands out like the characters in basic training.

In all, still a compelling movie, but flawed in a way that is ultimately forgivable.  

After seeing this movie for the fourth or fifth time I've drawn another conclusion: the original score isn't great.  A little heavy on the synthesizer to be considered timeless...

I found Hubert's story to be the most gut wrenching. He realizes that a life of crime is not the way to get out of the cité, but selling hash is how he can support his family. He probably has enough talent as a boxer, but the only resource he had, the gym, was destroyed by the raw anger of the youth (represented by Vinz). Hubert spends the whole film arguing with Vinz about Vinz's plan to kill a cop, which Hubert realizes is a futile expression of pent up anger. Even though Hubert suspects Vinz had a hand in burning down the gym during the riots, he tries to help him and reason with him. Hubert recognizes that Vinz only wants to prove himself, but disagrees with the way he goes about doing it, as evident in the scene with the skinhead.

The worst part is that all three characters are fucked in the end. Vinz is dead. Hubert is either dead or going to prison (sucks for his family) and Said lost two friends and likely also lost the ability to hope for change to actually come around. That was Hubert's idea and he reneged on it in the final scene. (If Hubert shotthe cop, then he reneged. If the cop shot Hubert, then there's no hope as the only character with hope got killed).

- 1900 (317m)

- Cleopatra (320m)

- The Best of Youth (400m)

- War and Peace (431m)

- Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks (551m)

In mainstream American cinema (under the umbrella of which I include a lot of ""indie"" cinema, since those usually tend to clean up the awards pretty well), African-Americans are...highly unrepresented, to say the least. While occasionally there are films like Django Unchained, it seems to me that a lot of African-Americans end up getting typecasted into secondary characters, such as the buddy or the leader-in-the-shadows, and so on.

Even in films where African-Americans are a major part of the story, they seem only to serve the purpose of showing how selfless their white peers are: *The Help*, *The Blind Side*, et cetera. While there are exceptions such as the acting career of Will Smith (has played a multitude of character types and is pretty much a guarantee that a film will be a box office smash) and the film *Precious*, which was wildly successful (earned six times its original budget), they are still often exceptions to the rule; for most people, modern black cinema begins and ends with the works of Tyler Perry, which themselves have become a formulaic ""brand"" that seem to have morphed into movies ""only black people like"".

------------------------------------------

In Lars von Trier's documentary *The Five Obstructions*, film-maker Jorgen Leth is challenged by his former student (von Trier) to remake one of his early short films five times over. Each time, however, von Trier sets certain injunctions on the process (for example, each shot can only be half-a-second long). In the second remake, Leth is ordered to shoot the film in 'the most depressing place on earth', and thus chooses an area of Mumbai where the level of poverty has resulted in its inhabitants being reduced to beggary and prostitution, perfectly fulfilling the morbid criteria. Part of the narrative involves Leth sitting at an outdoor dining table set up in the middle of the street, surrounded by curious onlookers (many of whom are half-starved children), and eating from a silver-service banquet consisting of shredded lobster and Chablis. It certainly isn't one of the most subtle juxtapositions of opulence and squalor imaginable, but it is an incredibly provocative piece of cinema that has always stayed with me.


Few of us, I hope, could not, in that situation, enjoy our meal with such callous indifference to the overt suffering around us. Yet there is no moral distinction between gorging on these extravagant delicacies in the centre of Mumbai's red light district or in the privacy of your own home. The suffering is still there. All that's changed is your physical proximity in relation to it. It's more distant, it isn't as immediate, but that fact remains. (For a fuller exposition of this argument, see Peter Singer's *Famine, Affluence and Morality* [here](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm)).

For example, I've read that the whole ""hitmen chatting about nothing"" has roots in *Border Radio*, from 1987 (Haven't seen it though). Obviously after Pulp Fiction, many films were compared when it came down to sardonic humor, violence, and hyperreal dialogue. I'm curious if there are films with similar style made before Pulp Fiction, ones that didn't successfully make it into the mainstream or otherwise.

We've talked about choosing weekly movies to watch and discuss. There's no definite system for choosing them yet, but given the time of year I don't think anyone will argue with discussing a horror film this week. 

We'll keep learning as we go along, and can vote on themes or directors in the future, but I think this would be a fun experiment for right now. So, here's how I think this should work:

* Please suggest a movie that you think would **create an interesting discussion**. It's not necessarily about what your favorite horror movie is, but what movie you think will create the best conversations.

* I'd also ask that you try not to go for *blatantly* obvious suggestions or films that everyone is likely to have already seen. For instance, I **love** The Shining, but I'm not going to suggest it because I'm willing to bet a large percentage of this subreddit have seen it and it won't be a *new* experience for most people.

* In addition to naming the movie you want us to watch, please write at least a little bit about *why* you think we should watch and discuss it. Convince people to vote for your film! If multiple films get enough support we might have multiple film discussions.

*  If you could, include a link to the wikipedia page, IMDB page, and/or trailer for the film you suggest.

* It's definitely fine if you want to suggest a film you haven't seen before , but I'd still request that you at least explain why you *want* to see it. I'm actually suggesting two films, and I haven't seen either of them! 

* If you agree or disagree with a suggestion made by someone else, please comment on their suggestion and say why you think it would be a good/poor choice.

* Do not include plot spoilers in your suggestions or discussions about the movies suggested in this thread. If you must, use spoiler tags!

Vote for all films you'd be interested in watching and discussing. Like I said, if there's enough interest we could have multiple film discussions. 

Please, feel free to make comments asking questions, or about anything relevant to this. Don't feel limited to just listing things like in the favorite directors thread.

I'm thinking that Friday, early in the afternoon, would be a good time to post the discussion thread, but I'm open to suggestions and want to get Nixon74's feedback as well.

Edit: Let's vote *for* a horror film. Gah!

**Edit 2: The Reckoning**

I reckon that we can pretty much declare Suspiria the winner. We've decided to post the discussion thread on Sunday, October 30th in order to allow everyone time to procure and watch the film. We'll be adding information about this in the sidebar. Feel free to keep commenting and voting here, but I think it's fair to call it at this point. If there's some extreme turn in the votes in the next 12 hours or so, we can always change it.

My suggestion for choosing the films we watch and discuss each week is that we find a list of the 100 or 50 ""best directors"" and watch a film by a different one each week. [Here's](http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_directors.html) just one example of such a list. I suggest we make our own list of directors to work from and order it by voting.

Each week we could make a thread where we list all the films of that week's director and vote on which one we'd like to watch. The most upvoted film is the one we watch and discuss. Nothing would stop ancillary discussions of the director's other films as well.

This would be helpful in multiple ways because it would essentially let us know what movies by that director the community likes best, and could be used as a recommendation list for people unfamiliar with the director. It would also give us an excuse to discuss that particular director and the merits of their individual films.

This would not only get everyone watching films they might not otherwise see, but will also generate discussions on directors themselves, comparisons of different directors to one another, and invite users to become more educated on films as a whole.

So, what do you think? Suggestions? Comments? Criticisms?

**Edit:** After reading all the comments and all the awesome suggestions, here's my new suggestion:

What if we used a list of this subreddit's favorite directors (it can be longer than 100) and then **randomly** selected one every week to watch a movie by? The random selection would help eliminate some of the bias (like saintandre was talking about). We'd still vote on the movie by them, and in addition to this one movie selected for a specific viewing, anyone else would be free to create discussions about the director's other films as well. 

Alternatively (or even in addition to the by-the-director thing) we could have a monthly theme (like timconradinc and deadilyduplicate's suggestion). The theme could be just about *anything* eg: film's the 40's, french new wave, Russian directors, Gay/lesbian films, silent films, female directors, etc etc.(Salamosam suggested something similar to this as well). I suggest that if we do this we have a discussion on what the theme should be with the most upvoted suggestion becoming that month's theme. We then could have another discussion about what films we should watch that fall under that theme.

We could even do *both* methods and alternate weeks i.e. one week with a director as the theme, one week as a genre. (cppo suggested something similar).

So, what do you guys think of these ideas? Would it just be simpler to make a thread every week called ""What film do we watch"" and let the highest upvoted comment win?

I'm still looking into this and I'm going to message the mod from r/hiphopheads to ask about the similar thing they did and how it worked (like wallychamp suggested).

Woody Allen),47,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j74bl/blue_jasmine_dir_woody_allen/,"Woody Allen's films have always dealt with neurotic people going through the anxieties that life has thrown at them. He's become a master at it, which is fitting, given that the man spent decades undergoing psychoanalysis. And with Blue Jasmine, with Cate Blanchett giving a terrific performance as the titular character, he's created another neurotic that I'd rank among the best character's he's written.

Jasmine is wrecked after her Ponzi scheming millionaire husband goes down, loses her damn mind, and tries to get her life back together by moving in with her much less well off sister, who has problems of her own. Allen's script uses this to craft a story about people trying to take control of their lives, for better or for worse, and coming to terms how much control they actually have over things. Jasmine can't control her public ramblings and descents into her traumatic marriage. She needs a job, wants to go back to school and ultimately heal her broken mind, albeit with some alcohol and Xanax thrown in. 

It sounds depressing, but the movie is frequently hilarious and shifts between humor and drama naturally. The cast is a big part of that, and everyone is great here, even Louis C.K. in his small role. Bobby Cannavale's character might be in the running for Worst Haircut of All Fucking Time, but he humanizes what could have easily been a stereotypical blue collar grease monkey. And Andrew Dice Clay is good, too! Yay for the Diceman! But Blanchett is the star of the show, and shows us the flighty, hoity-toity, pre downfall Jasmine with as much conviction as the post downfall, slightly insane one, giving us a full performance and creating a character I'll remember for quite sometime.  My favorite performance of the year so far.

The movie is well shot, as with most Allen pictures, featuring his usual long takes and tracking shots, naturally keeping a certain pace to the scenes while putting us right in the mix with the characters. There's a particular shot with Jasmine and a dentist, who she's gotten a receptionist job from, that is filmed in one long take, lasting easily for a few minutes as it pans and adjusts to the characters, maintaining a sense of unease and awkwardness that you would get in a scene with a bunch of cuts. Woody Allen has perfected these types scenes with intricate blocking and framing, so it shouldn't come as a surprise, but he still deserves praise for it, especially when compared to other filmmakers. 

This is a great character study, folks. Sure, it borrows from A Streetcar Named Desire, as a lot of people have said, but really only on a framework level. And borrowing from Tennessee Williams is hardly a bad thing. I'd rank Woody Allen in the top 5 American screenwriters of all time, because I think his writing, when on point, is as good as anybodies. Sure, his movies have their flaws, but I feel that people can be really unfair to his work, especially his newer stuff. His recent work might not approach ""classic"" Woody Allen levels, but compared to other filmmakers, its pretty good. 

Blue Jasmine has something different about it that makes it stand out from the rest of his filmography. Maybe its a little more cynical, or harsher, particularly on the main character. But it definitely stands out, and is one of my most enjoyed movies this year.

I'm sure many of you have scene this but I'd still like to have a discussion on it. I think Gilliam raises some good points, especially when he references Kubrick's remarks on Schindler's List. But at the same time I do think Spielberg is an excellent filmmaker. His films are for the most part, easily accessible, especially when it comes to Kubrick but at the same time Spielberg's knowledge and command of motion picture language is reviled by few filmmakers today. There is something wonderfully charming about a Spielbergian film and at the same time there is something largely unsatisfying. For me, it's what Gilliam expressed. Everything is resolved neatly and completely. I think certain films of Spielberg's could have benefitted from losing his ""sentimental"" touch. What if Schindler's list hard a Brazil type ending? Surely that would be more fitting for a subject such as the holocaust.

At the same time maybe we do need someone like Spielberg to comfort us. To tell us everything is going to be okay. His films are loved by young children for these reason especially. Spielberg films are like a nightlight. They can be surrounded by darkness like Saving Private Ryan but there is always that tiny light of hope.

While SPielberg is far from my favorite filmmaker and while I find myself agreeing largely with Gilliam I've never fully bought into the hate lopped onto him by people like Goddard (I'm not saying he isn't a well respected director but the man does receive his fair share of criticism).

""This is /truefilm, we care about art and directors like Orson Welles and Terrence Mallick, why would we want to talk about some dumb racing movies?"" Well I'll tell you why! Yes, by and large the Fast movies are pretty dumb, the acting is pretty wooden, and the dialogue ranges from cheesy to absurd. So why is the series suddenly making more and more money and gaining more and more respect from critics? Two words: Justin Lin.

As a filmmaker, he's only made one film that was neither fast nor furious (Better Luck Tomorrow), so the only director he really can be compared to is  David Yates(The Girl in the Cafe, Harry Potter 5-8). Both are relatively young directors who took the reigns late in a series and gave their franchises their respective voices. But unlike Harry Potter, which is rich in mythology and symbolism, the first two Fast films are not very good. Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and The Furious"" is essentially a more ludicrous(no pun intended) version of ""Point Break"" with somehow even more stilted acting. It also gave us such dialogue gems as ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" and ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning."" I honestly don't remember much about John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" beyond its amazing title, but most fans and critics would agree that it's by far the worst of the series.

Enter Justin Lin with ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" Gone are both Paul Walker and Vinny D, and in their place is the reliably awful Lucas Black, yet somehow the film works. It's beyond stupid, yet Lin knows exactly how stupid it as and how to take it seriously enough. Though I couldn't tell you any of the character's names (apart from Han, who's the fucking coolest) or recite a single line of dialogue from the movie, I dare you not to enjoy a scene like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3MAmVpAbEo).

But Fast Five is where the series really starts to click. The initial premise of the secret underground world of drag racing is forgotten and in its place we get a fun heist movie that just happens to involve a lot of cars. Also by adding The Rock (who's essentially playing a roided out Javert) and bring back Han (who's the fucking coolest) the series gains some much needed charisma.

From here it would be easy for the series to devolve into a mishmash of absurd set pieces and over the top action, yet Lin is able to retain enough character and heart that the films seem grounded in reality even though in Furious 6 there's a fucking tank on the highway. By shooting on location, using mostly practical effects and focusing on family as a running theme, Paul Walker can tow a safe through downtown brazil and we as the audience buy it. Compare that to a relatively ""realistic"" scene from [2 Fast 2 Furious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCb_6mO6CmE). Terrible, right? Sorry you had to see that, but I needed to make my point. Here, have a nice [Fast Five palate cleaner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQEfEeBR3-M).

There's a lot more I could talk about regarding the series put the last point I'd want to bring up is how the series manages to stay fresh by changing its genre from movie to movie. More specifically when you look closely, each movie is its own remake of another movie but with the added element of cars. The original is ""Point Break"" with cars. 2 is ""The Rock"" with cars. Tokyo Drift is ""The Karate Kid"" with cars. (I haven't seen 4, sorry). Fast Five is ""Ocean's 11"" with cars, and Furious Six is basically just ""Mission Impossible"" with cars. The big question I have is: What movie will Fast 7 be? My speculation: ""Kill Bill""... with cars.

1368470958.0,40,self.TrueFilm,1e9dz7,Women and rape in Peckinpah's Straw Dogs (1971),44,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1e9dz7/women_and_rape_in_peckinpahs_straw_dogs_1971/,"I watched Straw Dogs last night and I don't think I have been so upset by a film as long as I can remember. My basic understanding before watching was that Peckinpah was essentially a director of Westerns, and that this was a revenge film set in rural England, which didn't really prepare me.

Now I know this film was controversial 40 years ago and I've only just watched it, so I looked to reviews and discussions online to see if someone else had articulated my discomfort with the rape scene better than I am able to. To my surprise, I've found a lot of what has been said about it seems to put less of a focus on this scene than I would have thought. [Ebert's review](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/straw-dogs-1971) makes virtually no mention of it, and the only [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/w0a1r/sam_peckinpahs_straw_dogs_one_of_the_most_widely/) I found on the film in TrueFilm has [very little](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/w0a1r/sam_peckinpahs_straw_dogs_one_of_the_most_widely/c59jvh9) mention of it.

I should mention that having looked at wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Dogs_(1971_film)#Censorship), I see there have been numerous cuts to this scene (particularly in the UK) which could significantly change how it comes across. I don't know exactly what versions exist so I thought I would just mention this as it could explain how people feel differently about it. Please mention if you think or know the US release is different to how I have described it. I watched the most recent UK version which is supposedly uncut.

I would describe the rape as a centrepiece to the film and I found it genuinely disturbing, not only in the graphic nature of it, but more importantly in the way it framed rape itself and the questions that seemed to be being asked about the nature of rape or about women, that were not really addressed (if it all) in the rest of the film. Particularly it was clear to me (and the BBFC in 1999) that Amy came to enjoy being raped after initially resisting to some extent, and only really reacted with horror when the second man was about to rape her. I would say this raises 'questions' about whether a woman may enjoy rape, except the film didn't really continue with it is a question, and this kind of leaves it as more of a statement which is: women enjoy sex, even if they might think they don't. I think it can also be said that the scene was filmed in an 'erotic' way, which is difficult to explain, but I think Amy was made to look attractive during it. Another thing that is of note is the earlier conversation between David and Amy in which he suggested she wear a bra to avoid the attentions of the men, and she refuses, and then goes on to openly reveal her breasts to the men directly afterwards. She's also shocked by them looking at her when she pulls her skirt up. This ultimately seems to be saying something like 'if an attractive woman is revealing or provocative, she deserves to get raped'.

This is all compounded with the fact that the other female character, the young girl Janice, essentially constructs a situation where she is alone with a man known to have a bad record with women, which is never explained but is implied to be some sort of sexual violence. Together these two female characters seem to suggest a really unpleasant attitude towards women from Peckinpah. Do you think that is unreasonable?

It's not so much that I think that films can't be used to ask the question of whether a rape might be enjoyed in some way, but I felt in this case it essentially amounted to really a disturbing mysogynistic suggestion.

I really want to know what other people felt about this aspect of the film, even if you didn't feel much at all about it. In case anyone wonders I am a male, I have no particular personal experience with rape or issues surrounding it.

1366583085.0,36,self.TrueFilm,1ctpw8,Discussion: Inception is almost universally misunderstood,164,128,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ctpw8/discussion_inception_is_almost_universally/,"Ok TrueFilm.... please bear with me and let me make a case that Inception is both almost universally misunderstood as a film, and also a much better film than almost anyone gives it credit for. I'm shocked that after this many years I haven't read anyone else critique the film on these grounds:

** Inception is Christian Allegory **

Inception starts with a shot of the false children building castles on the beach. It ends with the real children building a castle ""on the cliff"". This is a curious contrast and a strange line of dialogue to choose to close a film. It is a reference to the parable of the wise and foolish builders (Matthew 7.24) which serves to establish Cobb's journey as a ""leap of faith"".

There is plenty of evidence that Inception is a film about death, not the least of which is the constant reminder that one has to die to wake-up. And if invoking religion seems a stretch just consider the role played by Michael Caine. Not only is our father-figure a master creator, but his conversation with Cobb in Paris is nonsensical outside the context of free will and self-determination. Caine berates his son-in-law for his worldliness (""I never taught you to steal"") but when asked for help gives it in the form of a woman whose mythological name suggests her role is guide Cobb out of the maze that is the mortal world.

There is far too much supporting evidence for me to cram into this quick write-up, but if you watch the film again themes to pay particularly attention to that should convince you the script is intentionally playing with these ideas include mirror and water symbolism, the limits of rationality, general paternal imagery (note the mirrored subplot involving Fischer's alienation from and reconciliation with his father), Nolan's selective and meaningful use of blasphemy and/or clearly biblical terminology (""genesis of an idea"", etc.), all of the architecture and creation stuff, and of course the names of the characters. Some of this stuff is quite subtle, but most is frankly just hanging out there waiting for people to notice.

Moving on, what is truly amazing about Inception is that despite the massive attention the film has gotten no-one seems to have noticed that the ending is entirely allegorical! And just look: in a film that refers to Cobb's journey repeatedly as a leap of faith, it is hardly coincidental that Mal's final temptation of Cobb is framed as a test of faith: she attempts to convince him to stay with her not because he believes in the objective reality of limbo, but rather because ""you don't believe in anything anymore."" Cobb's rejection of her also takes the otherwise curious form of an affirmation in the objective existence of his real children ""up above"".

So the ending is a puzzle, but it is not ambiguous. Having failed to “buy his way” to heaven, Cobb gets there by taking a “leap of faith”. He undergoes a death sequence (baptism by water is both death and rebirth), passes through judgment and the forgiveness of sins (at immigration) and then ""returns to the garden"" where he is reunited with his father and his ""real"" children (who are named after two biblical apostles). And the spinning top? It was a crutch of faith throughout the film (it belonged to Mal) and is notable at the end for the way Cobb ignores it.

I'd like to just start a minor discussion or ask for some opinions on this short French film (I did search and found little by way of discussion about it on the entirety of reddit). I'm not well versed in things regarding the filming itself, but in regards to analyzing parts of the film, I found the red balloon to be a symbol of childhood. Subsequently, I felt as thought the adults attempting to grasp at the string of the balloon at the school were, in a sense, attempting to grasp at their childhood. Per what I saw, no other adult in the short film made an attempt at the balloon, save for those who were teachers in the school, which made sense to me because they spent their days around the endless youth of the children. In regards to the principle (or what I'm assuming was the principle, as he locked the boy in a room for the day and seemed rather commanding), I found it rather saddening that when he couldn't 'reclaim his childhood' (ie catch the balloon), he gave up and locked the little boy away (like locking his childhood away). I also found it rather interesting how all these young boys attempted to steal - and succeeded in stealing - the balloon from the boy. Again, following the idea of the red balloon being a representation of childhood, it's as though they wanted to regain their childhood, or at least hold on to it as long as they could, but in doing so they didn't realize that (still with the metaphor) they were taking a symbol of childhood from the little boy, in a sense taking his childhood from him. This is further supported by the fact that they keep chasing him to get it from him, forcing him to go to extreme lengths to keep it, and by the way they mock him for wanting to hold on to it, and eventually destroy it and pop it. I found it rather beautiful how the director of the film chose to have the balloon deflate before it was finally destroyed, because for a lot of people, childhood isn't just suddenly taken away, it's more grown out of, like an eventual happenstance that everyone knows will occur, but takes some time to fully recognize. What I found even more beautiful was the ending, with the boy floating away, supported by innumerable balloons, as though to put into mind the resiliency of childhood, and how there is always the possibility of holding onto our childhood, even if circumstances force us to face the realities of the world too early.

So, basically what I'm saying is the entire short film is a metaphor for the human attempt to hold on to one's childhood for as long as possible.

And that's all I've got. If I could get any opinions or other information about this film, that'd be delightful. Sorry about the babble - I tend to do that a lot.

One of the newer advertisements for James Bond 007: Skyfall quoted a New York Times review saying“BEST. BOND. EVER.”  The quote was dispersed between shots of Daniel Craig running through dirty urban bazaars and suavely entering a decadent Southeast Asian gambling hall in a tuxedo.  It’s been fifty years since Bond first hit the silver screen with hokey villains and disguised gadgets for espionage.  Bond 23 enters the conundrum of a progressing modernity lacking room for the old ways of the British Empire.  What makes this Bond film one of the best yet isn’t its adaptation to the modern world.  The movie conquers with a stoic and unchanging James Bond in a classic Bond film.


With a nod to Britain’s imperial history, Director Sam Mendes utilizes two masterpieces of fine arts from Britain’s Romantic mid-nineteenth century period as vestiges of a by-gone era that Bond, and Britain as a whole, have refused to accept no longer exists.  The first situation has Bond sitting in front of Joseph Turner’s 1838 The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up symbolically showing that Bond is no longer a soldier fit for duty in the modern era. The painting also suggests that Great Britain is stuck in an intermediary period, confused by expansive international growth over which they have little to no control.  The Temeraire was a man-of-war, second in command to Admiral Nelson’s H.M.S. Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, a naval battle that subsequently defeated Napoleon’s rule of the waves and provided England the strength to claim victory over France.  Once the war ended, industrialism and the age of steam arrived with all its urban sprawl and anonymity.  The painting shows the mighty Temeraire tugged toward destruction by a small steamboat.  The large wooden ship is useless in the new era.  Mendez uses the painting to overtly demonstrate Bond’s age and old ways as outdated. There is a subtle undertone that the same is true for Britain’s view of the world and their place in it.  In the film, MI-6 has just suffered a terrorist attack and the department is infiltrated and slowly being killed off by an unknown and unnamed villain.


The British government suffers terrorist blow after terrorist blow, always one step behind the villain.  Britain is stuck in a moment of stasis, unable to adapt to its new post-imperial global surroundings.  As with all Bond films, James sets out to countries around the world (mostly former colonies of the British Empire) to track down evil.  He chases henchman through sprawling urban poverty, a perverted view of what has come of England’s guiding hand forced to depart from its colonies.  It is a view from the eyes of the imperial age, a view that sees the colonized as “underdeveloped” or “Third World”, monikers of the empire that are no longer applicable in our modern era.  This is why Bond fails.  If it is not sprawling poverty of ex-colonies that the viewer sees, it is the decadence of the exotic “Other”, a position taken by Orientalism, another outdated worldview of nineteenth century Europe.  James Bond fails time and time again to catch the villain.  He cannot succeed chasing down bad guys through back alleys, and he cannot find his villain in the extravagance of a Macau gambling house so filled with decadence that I half-expected a Grande Odalisque to be smoking an opium pipe in the corner next to the Komodo Dragons.  For Bond to succeed, one would expect that he must adapt his worldview to modern understandings.  Instead, we get Bond being Bond.


When we, the audience, meet our modern enemy, we are thrust straight back into the world of the British Empire.  Bond meets Silva, an ex-British Secret Agent much like himself.  Silva was once under M’s command, the Bond before Bond. A previous Temeraire.  Silva and Bond are similar in every aspect.  They are agents betrayed and left for dead by their governments and matriarchal figure.  In a metaphor, Silva describes his grandmother having an island where his grandmother used to play sadistic games with the rats, making them fight over food just to make them fight each other for survival.  Mendez sets up this fraternal relationship to expose the horrific correlation caused by the horrors of colonialism that England visited upon the world during their imperial reign.  Bond is also from an island, has a queen mother who used to colonize lands and in a sense, divide and conquer peoples once viewed as inhuman in order to set them against one another to commit atrocities.  Skyfall itself is in Scotland, England’s very first territorial expansion. James Bond and Silva are both colonized individuals turned against one another, much like the grandmother’s rats. 

  
The only aspects of our hero and villain that set them apart are their placements in the colonial structure.  Bond is from Great Britain, has an English accent, looks English, and as we find out later in the film, comes from aristocratic wealth and was trained at Oxford.  Bond is the stereotype of the colonizing citizen even though his history is Scottish.  Silva is the colonized intellectual, the “other” as nineteenth century Orientalism would define him.  Silva, played by Javier Bardem, must be a British citizen to have been an operative yet Silva has a ""foreign"" last name and a ""foreign"" accent.  He is a colonized citizen, not of English birth and therefore not truly one of empire even though citizenship is supposed to extend to the colonized.  His highlighted blond hair makes his race and ethnicity ambiguous to the viewer when matched with his speech.  At one point in the film, he sensually touches Bond and discusses homosexuality, but also has a heterosexual sex worker in his employ. Therefore, his sexuality and national origin are left completely “in the shadows” as M would say.  Silva is an enigma, a paradox to the old definitions of the British Empire.  He is indefinable and incomprehensible to outdated views, and the entire British government must adapt and update their understanding of the world if they are to defeat him.  But they do not.


Mendez’s second use of British fine arts masterpieces from the mid-nineteenth century arrives in a courtroom scene of British MP’s harassing M over her tactics to find our villain, Silva.  She quotes the end of Lord Alfred Tennyson’s “Ulysses”, a poem that so well defines the goals of the British Empire that I still remember my high school junior year AP English Brit. Lit. Anthology had the final lines scrawled across the cover.  For those of you who don’t remember them, I place them here to refresh your memory:
 
“Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are---
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.”
 
In the film, Silva bursts through the door with his henchmen, guns blazing.  M has not found Silva.  Silva has found her.  He stands to exact the horror she let loose upon him, a reciprocating event of the colonized upon the colonizer.  In a moment where Mendez could have forced England to react and adapt to the modern world, the righteous indignation of acts of terrorism ignites the flame of British nationalism in James bond.  England is no longer the attacker but the attacked.  The film ends with a final battle at Bond’s family estate of Skyfall in the Scottish Highlands.  Silva comes to kill both his metaphorical brother James and his matriarch, M.  To do so, Silva must lay siege to an old castle-manor.  After Bond has won and M is dead by no fault of our hero, the film ends with the world righted once again.  Rather than adapting to the modern world, Mendez seems to say that British Imperialism will out.  Bond’s former female partner in the field introduces herself as “Moneypenny”, saying she took a desk job as a secretary rather than fight in the field with Bond.  This sexism states that Eve Moneypenny could not handle the job, to say that the tough work of killing and dying should be left to men.  Bond walks into the office of the new “M”, now a patriarchal man, and all is right with the world. 
Although this ending disturbed me as I walked out of the theater, I remembered hearing an interview with Daniel Craig where he said, “We wanted to make a truly classic Bond, like the old days.”  The old quote “Men want to be him and women want to be with him” was created for this 007.  This 007 is not anonymous or indefinable, nor has he ever cared to be.  He is the arrogant James Bond, and he tells the world with pride.  Mendez’s Skyfall reminds us of the power of the individual.  The hero's greatest qualities of loyalty, duty, and honor stay true to the very end.  The movie is, simply put, a great Bond flick referencing and paying homage to the old movies.  Anyone could be 007, but there is only one James Bond.  And that is why this ranks as one of the best Bond films ever made.  As long as James Bond is around; there will always be an England, real or imagined.

Full disclosure, out of Tarkovsky's films i've only managed to see Stalker, Ivan's Childhood and Mirror so far. Although there are definitely aspects of this film I am yet to grasp, I loved it. Much like Tarkovsky's other films it made me excited about film. 

I found the film to be an almost purely visceral experimental film. It's beauty and poetic nature infected my mind with its ideas. I often find some more experimental films to be very intellectual in that they need to be thought over and analysed a lot to truly understand. I often find myself thinking ""What does this mean?"" or over thinking experimental films as I watch them but Mirror just washed over me. Although I intend to delve deeper into Mirror, I found so much of it works in an instantly gratifying way. I didn't even realise until it had finished how much I had gotten out of it. In my eyes it encapsulates what makes us who we are and how we reflect on life (that sounds lofty and broad I know). I don't want to write an essay here so i'll wait to discuss it properly with you all.

Also, what are your thoughts on that out of all of Tarkovsky's films, Mirror placed highest on Sight and Sound's critic (19th) and filmmaker (9th) polls. ",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_yh1zc,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/yh1zc/i_recently_watched_tarkvovskys_mirror_and_would/,

1. The fade intro with dreamy music that usually begins with a shot of the character sleeping and then ripples into the dream world. The subject of these dreams are usually unrealistic situations but are consistent to the real world.

2. The humiliating or terrifying experience that results in the character springing up in bed gasping. These too appear consistent with the real world and are believable to the audience until we see the character awakening.

What I've noticed is the similarities to the real world almost make it impossible to tell that what we are seeing is in fact a dream. That to me seems unrealistic as the dream world is much more unpredictable. The most realistic interpretation of a dream I've seen was a completely unlikely place: Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Now this movie was not a classic by any means, and I only watched it recently because of my mother, but this scene did make me take notice.

It starts out normally, as if it is the real world. Michele is walking into a banquet hall without Romy (Even though they shared a car) there is no suggestion that Michele would have waited to leave the car after Romy had entered the hall. The beginning in the middle of the story with no question is realistic to a real dream. 

She enters the hall dubbed 'The Crystal Room'- which features school pictures and other party decorations. Romy's hair is also different. Michele has a few brief conversations before deciding to leave where she is hit by a limo. The hit itself is played off as physical comedy and she stands up completely fine. Also similar to a real dream.

Later as another character seems to disappear after he jumps out through the sun roof. Michele then re-enters the banquet hall, which is now called 'The Christie Room', the ceiling is higher and there are windows reaching the top as well as a formal stage. Things rarely stay consistent in dreams so this was interesting to see. The school pictures on the wall are now on easels and twice as large. There are also some carrots and bananas made of balloons (referencing something earlier in the film) showing the relation of past knowledge and memories. 

There is a brief award ceremony, and suddenly the cars are inside of the banquet hall and no one seems to notice or care. 

The attention to detail in this sequence is phenomenal in an otherwise less-than-perfect film.

This is obvious manipulation (another example would be the start of Bambi), however I'm wondering if you think that because it was successful at bringing out peoples emotions (mostly) that makes it ok for Pixar to use this technique.

An example of emotional manipulation that quite a few people saw through was Marly &amp; Me, however lots of people don't realise that they are being manipulated, although wording it like that makes me look super elitist...

There's so much I could say about it but I would rather turn it into a discussion.

I don't feel like I know enough about American cinema to be able to make certain claims, but I will say this: On the Waterfront, with the help of great storytelling through incredible performances, affected me more profoundly than any film I have ever seen.  It's not necessarily the greatest film of all time, or even the greatest film I have ever seen, but I was able to *connect* on a level that I have not experienced prior.  I was incredibly emotionally invested in the characters.  There was something about the way Kazan was able to convince me that not only were these characters real, but they mattered.  The setting was fantastic and unique.  And the film itself presented me with questions that particularly interested me.  I wanted to know the motivation behind each character's actions, especially Terry's.  Multiple times throughout I thought to myself ""I know what the right thing to do is, but how would I do it? Or would I do it at all?""  

So let's talk about it.  How does TrueFilm feel about the film?  Did it have an impact on American cinema?  And, to get specific, was Brando's performance more than just great, but groundbreaking?

By virtue of the film I think discussing the *Tim And Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!* is warranted. 

I liked the film overall, and I was impressed with Tim Heidecker's performance.

It seems that thematically the film was about the deconstruction of the man-child comedic trope, and the unfulfilled nature of a person who lives their life ironically detached from what most people consider important. Heidecker's character being removed from his father's death and estate, his friends (in the beginning they play a weird game of expressing how they feel about their friendship, but with complete sarcasm), the well being of other people, and ultimately himself. However, I'm still trying to figure out something; why Tim and Eric? They're know for their surreal, anti-humor and mockery of comedy in general. So was the aim to get their fans to watch the movie and maybe learn something about the humor which they love? Or are the associations they bring up conducive to understanding the ironic bubbles and pedestals in which the characters place themselves?

1345584486.0,40,self.TrueFilm,ylo1o,Greenaway: the most important and forgotten director of the last 30 years,44,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/ylo1o/greenaway_the_most_important_and_forgotten/,"First I will respond to the criticisms of Greenaway. People are turned off by his work as being too quirky/naval gazing.. I actually find PG's work to have very emotional undercurrents... underneath the technical bravado he expresses characters at the total mercy of their surroundings, stuck in elaborate mazes of only emotional puzzles but film structure as well. His work is anarchist and apocalyptic, yet in the context of stilted and repressed environments .. Then there is his cold and sterile camera is the outside observer to these complete messes that populate his films. 

Emotionally, his work is very Kafka-esque, with characters who are backstabbed, betrayed and humiliated in the most casual of ways, usually in upper class social dwellings. One of his favorite plots involves femme fatales who trap the protagonist through pregnancy (in Drowning by Numbers there are three of those)

There is real pain and drama underneath his technical mastery, which operates above the storytelling on another layer. There is another thing... his work can be deadpan and hilarious as well. 

Technically, he has invented an entire genre of deadpan, meta-structural filmmaking that guys like Wes Anderson come off as a total amateurs in their imitation of it. Those symmetrical, layered, quirky compositions. Anderson doesn't even know why he does that, but Greenaway uses it to contrast the chaos of what is happening (very Kubrick-esque). His work is constantly straddling the paradox of chaos and anarchy, and a structured, ordered universe. Greenaway is the sadistic yet bemused god of his film world. 

When I mentioned PG's stories being Kafka-esque, his camera work matches his stories, creating complex, symmetrical and 'architectural' tracking shots and images (his work is very '3-D') (check out Drowning by Numbers, and Belly of an Architect). Sometimes it gives you a frame similar to theater, sometimes his camera has a life of its own and steals the viewer's attention. Yet people mistake this as being distant. To me it reflects a brilliant and always curious mind at work. The Baby of Macon is probably his meta-masterpiece for its use of camera alone. 

I feel I have said a lot without saying enough, because I am talking about an entire filmography. However, after witnessing all his films, I can confidently say he is one of the last film masters and the most under appreciated director. 

I think people are too intimidated by his work. I would say to just go at it with the knowledge that it is all tongue in cheek, meant to be playful and puzzled over, meant to be futile even. He is way moreso the heir of European 60s cinema than the American indie new wave.

Ernest Hemingway believed that when writing a story, what you omitted was far more important than the actual written words. He likened it to the ice berg.

""If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing.""

There are many styles of writing, but this is a concept I truly believe in. The ice-berg theory coupled with the ""show, don't tell"" rule of filmmaking are both broken by writer's Lindeloff and Jon Spaihts. Many times throughout the film we get characters saying things like, ""I'm just the pilot, I do this."" or ""He's just the engineer, why would he do that?"". An expositional indicator to the audience of who that character is supposed to be, but never why and never with evidence other then the line of dialog.

This on-the-nose characterization feels very off when contrasted with the grand ideas about life, the universe, and Everything.

The ideas I ask myself about the Supermen and their experiments and how this could be an Answer far outweigh the sometimes sloppily written characters. It wasn't until the oh-so-obvious sex scene that I even picked up on the non-existent growth of the characters. Not to bag on Lindeloff, whom I admire, but he tends to define his characters with two, three, sometimes even one trait and then only exemplifies that narrow spectrum of emotions and reactions throughout the rest of the film resulting in non-growing characters.
The rebel Map Guy is just a rebel. He has a mohawk and face tattoos. The Charlize Theron character is a by-the-books cold hearted bitch, and literally only acts that way in every single scene. A moment of sexual tension with Idris Elba is the closest thing we get to a testing of traits and possible growth. All characters act their way and never change.

But we should also not forget that Jon Spaihts of ""The Darkest Hour"" - one of the worst scripts of last year - was attached to the writing credits as well. The obviousness of studio meddling in an attempt to shoehorn in a franchise was the greatest question presented to me by Prometheus. It wasn't until I learned of Spaihts involvement that it made more sense. I can almost see the studio meeting with Ridley... ""Say that Lindeloff fella is a swell guy and all - and a great writer - but we'd like to give you some extra help with our guy Spaihts. He won't meddle at all. He'll just make sure our main characters come out alive and off into space by the end for another film.""

The reason I made this post was a response to all the negativity I'm seeing for this film. I believe the problem lies in the writing of the characters, and nothing else. This movie presents grand ideas and questions that keep you awake at night. I consider it an antithesis to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Instead of the Creators ushering us along to better ourselves we are presented with the idea of a Creator who creates life not from a loving or benevolent reason, but because It can. And It can also decide at a moments notice to end this life. Perhaps out of boredom. 

These thoughts chill me and this coupled with the beautiful direction of Ridley Scott topple the only-sometimes on-the-nose writing of Lindeloff and Spaihts.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1339259914.0,,,True,t3_utawd,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/utawd/do_the_grand_ideas_of_prometheus_outweigh_the/,

Ever since the digital revolution hit its stride about 3-5 years ago, and the majority of the industry began to convert (even if stubbornly, at first), it was only a matter of time. More recently, the top 3 film camera manufacturers no longer make film cameras, Kodak is bankrupt and has stopped producing film stock at the same rate they did before, and the disproportionate costs between an analog production and digital one continues to widen. As a result of this (and other aspects detailed below), more and more hardened veterans of the film industry continue to release their nostalgic grip on the medium of film and embrace digital (or at least, give it a chance).

Meanwhile, the advancements in digital cinema production have been exponential. Practically any filmic look is able to be emulated or reproduced in the hands of talented individuals using digital tools. Comparison measurements shows the latest digital cameras either barely losing to, keeping up with, or even beating out film in scientific tests -- essentially narrowing the perceived gap in ""look"" or ""feel"" that has been a roadblock for some time. As innovation grows in this arena, products become more and more affordable; not only opening up paths to whole new varieties of filmmakers who may have never had the opportunity to showcase their talent before, but also enabling productions to be green-lit that might not have been with a previously-required larger budget. Additionally, the industry-approved standards for digital cinema distribution have been finalized and implementation has begun across the globe.

[This brings us to the news today.](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cinemacon-2012-fox-35mm-john-fithian-chris-dodd-distribution-digital-exhibition-315688) ""*Twentieth Century Fox has become the first major Hollywood studio to officially notify theater owners that it will distribute all of its films domestically in a digital format within the next year or two, bringing an end to 35mm film prints.*"" This news should not comes as a shock, but rather act as more of a caveat for resolute acceptance. The technology has evolved, the tools have evolved, the concepts have evolved, the mindsets have evolved, the audience has evolved, the industry has evolved, the art has evolved. It is finally time the medium -- on which the story is captured and experience delivered -- evolves as well.

I just rewatched it after not having seen it for something like 15 years, and... I only half enjoyed it. I still love Gilliam's visual flair, and - though dated by today's standards - the practical effects have character and charm that is absent from many later films.

The relationship with Jill is utterly implausible and, while I've never particularly *liked* the performance of the actress playing her, on this watching I actively hated it. The ""necrophilia"" line is a total clunker too.

Much as I like Jonathan Pryce, I find the central character slightly too unsympathetic at times - moments when he's just engaging in bizarre slapstick or over-the-top mania really put me off (eg. the whole chase sequence in the truck). This served to make the central romance even more unconvincing. To have this awful chain of events unfold for someone who is basically decent but has no control over his destiny is fine - but so much is essentially brought down upon him by his own ineptitude that it didn't sit well with me.

To me (obviously there are a multitude of different interpretations) both films deal with the idea of a higher power and the afterlife in a very similar yet completely contrasting manner.

In 2001 the surreal aspects of the film come from what man does not fully understand, the universe. When we are introduced to Floyd as a character his routines, conversations and motives are all clear and very human. The surreal and the aforementioned issues come to light during the interaction with the Monolith, an object of a seemingly higher power (or being at least).

 The 'afterlife' is explored through the last 30 minutes  of the film through Dave's journey after he comes in contact with the Monolith, and in one of the most confusing and widely interpreted acts he sees the creation and continuation of life through all things as our lives fare little in the grand scheme of things to come (err... Possibly). 

The Monolith is shown to be a higher power, however it is no god or Devine creator. We see the monkey's nature being perverted by the Monolith's presence, it seems to me that Kubrick is suggesting our search for a god can be lead back to something higher spurring us on, if not guiding us but by no means creating us. 2001 seems to present a more 'scientific' angle to the issue.

Now contrast this with Tree of Life, the film focuses on the subjective, surreal and fantastical side of childhood while using god and the afterlife as a harbouring point for Sean Penn's character. By no means do I mean this in a derogatory manner but the film seemingly presents the christian 'way of life' were, as mentioned in the beginning of the film all things are certain other then the actions of yourself for which you must choose a path. 

In comparison 2001 supports mans appetite for exploration and knowledge of what he does not know while Tree of Life supports the living of life to the most righteous and fullest extent with what is available.


The film depicts the afterlife as a certainty, our actions being the variable. Whereas 2001 shows the unknown universe as a variable that mixes with the actions of the methodical and predictable nature of man.


I would be curious to know your thoughts on this (albeit farfetched) idea, in no means am I slandering Tree of Life for the religious nature of the film rather I find it fascinating to compare it to a film like 2001.

I want to point to the middle of this movie as the best depiction of childhood I have come across. The editing and the cinematography come together to put you into the head of the eldest son in a way that captures the confusion and frustration of that time without being belittling to the character.

 The sensuousness of the film helps to put us into the subjective state of childhood. The vastness of space and time that is so beautifully depicted bring us back to the time we first encounter mortality and creation. *It all works together so seamlessly.*

And then it goes to shit. 

A movie that had built its strength on the awe of the hear and now switches to a closing scene that is dripping with symbolism of an afterlife.

Now it isn't so much that I dislike the idea of a *continuation* after death, of being refolded into the substrate of existence from which we come. What I dislike is Sean Penn stepping through a threshold and seeing all of his family members hanging out with all sorts of other people in what feels an awful lot like heaven is that it seems to be counter to everything else in the movie.

1372140463.0,38,self.TrueFilm,1h0tvl,Let's have a serious discussion about A Serbian Film (2010).,70,32,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1h0tvl/lets_have_a_serious_discussion_about_a_serbian/,"*A Serbian Film* is one of those films that pretty much everyone seems to know about, but very few people have actually seen, and even fewer have made an effort to look past its apparent flaws to try to pull some sort of reading out of its insanity and beyond the director’s statements regarding the film as a window into the Serbian psyche.

I watched it today and feel that it is honestly one of the most misunderstood films that I have ever seen. I will try to address this issue in stages, first by examining its plot and content, then its filmmaking techniques, then conclude my thoughts by addressing meaning. 

Let me start by laying out three important definitions I will be referring back to throughout this write-up. I’m sure not everyone will agree with them, but laying out some sort of definitions for these terms is essential to having an intelligent discussion about *A Serbian Film*. The first of those is art, which I will define as a consciously created work designed to elicit an emotional response based on ideas. Pornography I will define as consciously created work designed to sexually arouse. Finally, I will define a snuff film as a work designed solely to endorse humanity’s most sadistic urge to watch others endure unimaginable pain. I know the traditional definition of snuff requires that it be unstaged, but the term applies just as well to staged scenes for the purposes of this discussion. 

So let’s start with the content of *A Serbian FIlm*, which tends to be the sticking point most people have with this film. *A Serbian Film* is chock full of excessive violence of sex. But where I tend to disagree with most people’s readings of the film is that I don't feel that this content exists purely to disturb. Some feel that these attempts to disturb are so over the top and ridiculous that they mean the film doesn't even succeed on that level. While the film does have issues with how far to go with its content, much of the excessiveness is intentional, played both for very dark laughs (I point you towards the scene where the main character leaps through a window and another character exclaims “Our film just jumped out a window!”), and as a nod to audiences that the director is in on the ridiculousness of it all. This is the point where it is important to mention the plot at least briefly.

*A Serbian Film* is about a semi-retired porn star, Milo, offered an obscene amount of money to make an artistic porn film. The director of the film is obsessed with examining the nature of pornography and exploitation, as well as the entire Serbian victim culture that has a developed as a result of the nation’s recent history. What starts as a relatively conventional set of sex scenes quickly devolve into various disturbing acts of extreme depravity and violence. Not surprisingly, the line between Milo’s life and the film he’s making starts to blur and everything collapses in on itself. 

So, if all this talk of a semi-deranged Serbian director seeking to blur the lines between Snuff, Art, and Porn doesn’t seem a bit familiar, it should. And this, I feel, is where the film moves beyond the limitations of its content. I feel that *A Serbian Film* is intended to play as the film that the director in the film is making. What you see on screen, of course, is quite clearly staged, including the sex, but the director and actors do their best to make it seem anything but.

It is important here to briefly discuss the technical filmmaking behind *A Serbian Film*. In short, everything is excellent. Newcomer director Srdjan Spasojevic proves himself enormously talented, handling each shift in scene and tone with extreme grace and competence. The emotions of Milo’s scenes with his family come through as clearly as the violence of the sex scenes, and every aspect of the film feels controlled and fleshed out. His direction feels like Lynch meets Kubrick by way of Takashi Miike. The cinematography is similarly diverse and rewarding, featuring a number of absolutely sumptuous shots. The acting is also excellent, especially on the part of Srdjan Todorovic who plays Milo. He is as believable as a loving father as he is as an animalistic brute, reflecting just enough of the other in each situation. Even the blood and gore effects are expertly done, on the same level as something you would expect in a film by Noe or Takashi. 

Why, though? What’s the point of all this top class talent in what, at least at first glance, plays itself as pure trash? Spasojevic could have, if he had made just about any other film, guaranteed himself a career any young film maker could only dream of, based on the talent he displays here. The rest of the team could have moved beyond the confines of working in a market such as Serbia. But they didn't make a different movie, they made *A Serbian Film*.

The brilliant technique on display here lies at the heart of the potential meaning behind *A Serbian Film*. Of course, if Spasojevic is to be believed, this section of the write up should be pretty short. He has repeatedly stated that the film is a statement on the victim culture that exists in modern day Serbia. The trouble with this reading is that the director of the film within the film states that his art-porn film is an examination of this exact same theme. So this means one of two things. On the one hand, this suggests that this entire write up is for naught and *A Serbian Film* is a well made, self indulgent snuff film which uses its more or less villain to communicate its central message. The other potential suggestion of this internal statement is that *A Serbian Film* is about a hell of alot more than just Serbia. Instead, it is a statement on our fetishization of violence passed off as art, a sort of *Natural Born Killers* as porn film: by embracing everything it purports to criticize, *A Serbian Film* goes beyond the limits of true satire and enters that strange state between trash and art. If I had to sum up my reading of the film’s message in one sentence it would be this: “As a society, we accept bizarre violence and victimization as art just because it is the only way we can feel anything beyond self pity, while as pornography and cartoonish depictions of sex are the only way we can feel sexually aroused."" 

Its time to look back to those words I defined earlier. There are two easy criticisms to make of *A Serbian Film* that would seem to contradict the meaning that I just gave. The first is that the film is well made pornography. This is the easier of the two criticisms to refute as *A Serbian Film* does not meet the first requirement of pornography: the way the sex scenes are shot, they are more depressing or disturbing than arousing. Even the film’s “normal” sex scene, a completely pleasurable, consensual scene between Milo and his wife, is uncomfortable and more focused on characters than actions. The other criticism, that the film is a high end staged snuff film, is much harder to refute. Its a start to point out the fact that little of the violence occurs on-screen, but this isn't, in itself, enough. Just because you rarely see the shark in *Jaws* doesn't mean that *Jaws* isn't a movie about a killer shark. 

The real answer as to why *A Serbian Film* is more than a snuff film lies in the structure and plot. Early on, the director character asks Milo who watches a porno for the plot. The obvious answer is no one, and the same goes for snuff films. But in *A Serbian Film*, plot and character are everything. The cinematography, the direction, the editing, they all highlight the plot and characters, while shying away for the violence. Notice here the cinematographer's obsession with characters’ faces, especially during scenes of sex and violence. Going back to our *Jaws* metaphor, one can use the fact that Jaws is focused on the characters in all but a few select scenes, rather than just showing a bunch of shark based carnage, as reasonable evidence for arguing that, while *Jaws* is indeed a movie about a killer shark, its also a movie about a lot more. This is true of *A Serbian Film*. It acts like a snuff film.

I saw Nicolas Winding Refn's latest film today and saw that there was no discussion thread for it in r/truefilm, and I'm curious as to what others think of the film. From what I hear the film has had a polarizing effect: others love it, others (majority, maybe) hate it. I liked the film. 
It's definately not Drive 2, which is why so many have been let doen by it, I assume, but a step towards Refn's previous movies, especially Valhalla Rising. I guess you could say it's an art film. 
The cinematography and camera work in the film were incredible. Every single shot was gorgeous and carefully composed, with familiar strong, contrasting colours that have become sort of a trademark for Refn. 
Music in the film was great too. Drive was known for its soundtrack full of 80s sounding synth pop, but OGF had a more extensive original score (by Cliff Martinez), which worked amazingly for the movie. It was composed mainly of ominuous ambient humming and heavy synthesizers that made the theatre literally vibrate. 
As for performances, Ryan Gosling played the main character, Julian, reminding me a bit of the Driver in Drive. Kristin Scott Thomas gave an amazing performance as Julian's (Freudian) mother, and Vithaya Pansringarm was chilling as the main antagonist. Even though the performances were terrific, I felt many of the character's were a bit underdeveloped. Julian, especially, felt very distant and his true self and motives were a little vague. I still enjoyed watching the characters on screen, though. 
I think I need to see the film at least one more time before I can talk further about the symbolism and themes in the film. One of the themes in the film, as Refn suggested in a recent interview, is man's desire to not only become God, but also fight and defeat (and then ultimately become) God. I suppose Pansringarm's justice-dealing cop was a sort God in human form type of guy. 
There were also heavy themes of Freudian ideas on sexuality and aggression, to an extent. 
I suppose the main issue with the film was that it was too much style and too little substance, or at least substance was buried too deep under the style and visuals. The main story was a little weak, and there was always either too much or too little happening. The characters were left a little cold and distant, and I guess for many the film will be a little too artsy and may seem pretentious even. 
I would very much like to hear others' opinions on the film and discuss it further.

What does TrueFilm think?,50,14,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1bqn6s/kingdom_of_heaven_directors_cut_just_bought_it/,"Ok, lets talk about Kingdom of Heaven. I just recently bought the director’s cut, and I have to say, it is a much better film than the theatrical cut. I really believe this movie belongs in the upper pantheon of epic period pieces.  Maybe I haven’t seen enough period pieces dealing with the Middle East, but I can’t think of another major Hollywood film (with the exception of Lawrence of Arabia) where Muslim traditions and history were shown in a protaganistic light. The entire time, I find myself rooting for Saladine (which I believe was the idea). The DC blew my mind with how much additional plot was cut from the theatrical release. I read up on it, and apparently the studio was not interested in the scathing anti-religion themes, so they cut it drastically. 

I have a lot of favorite lines from KoH. For some reason the quotes have lodged themselves in my brain ever since I saw it in the theater. The final lines that Saladine has are really the cherry on the top of this film for me. Balian: “What is Jerusalem worth?” Saladine: (turns head while walking away) “Nothing”…. (takes a couple steps, turns again fists clenched together) “Everything”. If there was a better way to end the climax of the movie, I’d challenge someone to find it.

I’m curious to know if anyone else finds this movie to be as perfect as I do. Its entirely possible that I’m just a Ridley Scott fanboy, but I don’t think so. You’d have to try very hard to screw up a movie with a cast like this one has. What does the /r/truefilm community think of this film?

Here's a nice description of the film from Criterion, where it's [currently 50% off](http://www.criterion.com/films/27523-house)!

&gt;How to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi’s indescribable 1977 movie House (Hausu)? As a psychedelic ghost tale? A stream-of-consciousness bedtime story? An episode of Scooby-Doo as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, a demonic house cat, a bloodthirsty piano, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects. Equally absurd and nightmarish, House might have been beamed to Earth from some other planet.

Some of the main examples of this from last decade are Before Sunset, In the Mood for Love, Far From Heaven, Lost in Translation and (to a certain extent) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. All of these films focus on characters who wish to be with another person but can't do to societal pressures, cultural differences or because their past lives are haunting them. That's not to say romantic dramas and comedies aren't being made, it's just that very few seep through the cracks and remain relevant.

Certainly the anti-romance film is not a new genre as one of the greatest examples of it, Brief Encounter, was made during the heyday of romantic Hollywood filmmaking. So what is it now that appeals anti-romances to the cinematic culture of today? [If you look through this list](http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade), which is probably the finest aggregate of the Best of the 2000s lists, you'll notice that the only two films on there that are primarily focused on consummated romances are Amelie and WALL-E. Again both are radically differen from what we consider to be classical film romances, but the tropes are still present. Amelie features a clever twist on the stereotypical romantic quest; one where the lover leave clues leading to her. What makes WALL-E's romance so great is that it uses classical storytelling techniques of Hollywood musicals and silent comedies to achieve a believable romance between the two main characters. 

So if films can be made today with classical romantic elements but still be considered inventive by the critical and cultural community, why then do we always come we keep coming back to the anti-romance? Is it just the 2000s, where global communication and an overburden of media made us turn to meta narratives and unconventional storytelling? Has the idea of love changed recently? Is there something just more fascinating about two people attracted without sex? What endears you to anti-romance films?

&gt;There are few people of genius in the cinema; look at Bresson, Mizoguchi, Dovzhenko, Paradjanov, Bunuel: not one of them could be confused with anyone else.

[Steven Spielberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcM6sDKrX1M) feels he's 'style-less ' like Victor Fleming or Michael Curtiz, who 'didn't impose a kind of who they were on what that was.'

Basically, if these directors had the technology, they could have put a lot more of their vision on the screen. CGI isn't just for making creatures and explosions, it is also a vital tool in today's industry for simply filling in the blanks. CGI allows directors to make an empty room with a green screen seem like NYC, seamlessly to the point where most people don't even notice. It also allows directors to create shots that would be impossible to achieve practically. Take the shot from ""Zodiac"" for example, the camera follows the car from an aerial perspective and then drops into the car. Basically, it would allow directors to do what they want. Imagine the epic films of David Lean or Stanley Kubrick. Now imagine the visuals theses directors could achieve with these tools.



On the other hand, CGI is something that is very easily abused. Imagine if 'Alien' were made today. The alien would almost certainly be CGI, same for the chest-bursting scene. Would these great elements be ruined by CGI? Probably. Would directors have gotten lazier, leading to less elaborate sets and more green-screening? Less on-location shoots? Imagine if Carpenter's The Thing were done today? (You don't really have to, actually). Without the practical effects, I'd argue that film isn't nearly as effective. Had CGI not been in its infancy when Jurassic Park came out, we may not have had the incredible effects we have now. Spielberg was forced to use it sparingly, due to its cost and the fact that it didn't look great a lot of the time, and so we got a perfect mix of animatronics and CGI which lead to a beautiful mix, to the point where the casual viewer can't tell which is which.

Many of you probably saw my other post about selecting the movie of a week where I talked about creating our own list. I just want to say that this is **not** meant to be for the purpose of selecting movies of the week or anything like that. If the community decides to use it for that at a later date, that's your decision. I have a *possible* suggestion for using it in relation to that, which I have posted in an edit to the other thread. For any discussions about the use of this list for picking movies of the week, please post in the [thread concerning that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/lk4r0/can_we_discuss_the_weekly_movie_idea_further/)

This is simply an exercise for the community to get to know each other, and see what we're like as a whole. We could also use the list that this creates as a reference.

**Voting ""Rules"":**

* All comments representing a director should simply be the director's name. Just one director's name per comment. Add as many names as you want.  It'd be great if you made the name a link to their wikipedia page or imdb page as well, so anyone unfamiliar with them can quickly learn about them.

* If your director(s) is(are) already listed, simply upvote the post with his/her name. 

* I highly encourage discussion in this thread. If you want to say something about a particular director, I suggest that you post the comment as a reply to that director's name. This way we might have some interesting little mini-discussions going about each director. If you want to add a director to the voting *and* say something about them, just make a post that's their name only and then comment on that.

* **Please do not downvote director names**. This is not about which directors you dislike or think are overrated. If you want to express negative views about a director, please comment on their name. I hope we have a lot of interesting discussions in this thread.

Since I created this I'm going to wait awhile before commenting with the names of my favorite directors, that way other people will have a chance to list theirs first.

Also, if you get here early, please come back when the thread has matured to vote for other directors you like that weren't listed yet.

**Edit:** Hopefully people are coming back to vote for directors that weren't listed and that they might have forgotten. Remember to look through the whole list. I also wanted to post a reminder to check out the wikipedia articles on some directors.

In a large segment of A Personal Journey Through American Cinema, Marty explains the role of ""the smuggler"", the directors in the 40's who would sneak substance and themes past their studios and into their otherwise B-movie quality story. 
[You can watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzB_vx9PgU)

First and foremost, Hugo is a children's film. It was published by Nickelodeon. Big deal, it's a children's book and Nickelodeon asked him to make it, right? Well, anyone who knows Scorsese's significance in the Hollywood system knows that he has ultimate power on what films he does and *who* publishes them. Obviously money is not an issue. I forgot since when, but I remember reading somewhere that he's been funding most of his movies entirely for the longest time. I think the act of him picking a children's channel company is a pretty obvious indicator that he wanted this film to go to children, the newer generation that won't grow up with anything but digital projection and 3D and HD and so on.

I'm gonna level with you here. Hugo is not direct with a lot of the film commentary until the later half. As previously noted, this Nickelodeon produced film adaption of a children's book is quite clearly meant for children, which is odd because film isn't a real big cinematic interest for children. When's the last time you could get a kid to sit through a 2 hour film about film itself? So of course there needs a setting for this theme that entices children to watch. How about a train station filled with adventure? I think that even though the direct commentary on film doesn't appear until the later half, the meta commentary stretches throughout the film.

The whole entire first portion of the film is to me just a sloppy wet kiss to old film from the early 20th century. The type of films Hugo and Isabelle are watching are the type of films that Scorsese emulates. It's not complete Tarantino rip-off fest; he's not taking any glory for himself here, but there are some heavy nods to famous old films, particularly the clock sequence towards the climax, the very film the kids see in the theater. Even when he doesn't directly borrow, we are shown some moments from Hugo's perspective that are very reminiscent of old film, such as the recurring sequence with Uncle Dursely and that woman with the dog. I could easily see the being a preexisting flick from the early 20th century. There are other moments that pop up that have a silly old film feel to them as well, but I haven't seen the film in a while so I can't recall them all.

And Hugo watches them from different windows inside the clock, which is the center of the one motif in the film regarding man's creation, as well as finding your place in the world and doing your own thing, coming of age, etc. Hugo observes all these events from inside a clock. It's almost like he's *watching several old films in a theater*. And it's no surprise either that he has a fascination with film due to his father. 

The path to the strict lay out of the film meta commentary in the second half is laid out by the Automaton. It represents the wonder of an illusion. Even though they build it and it functions properly, the thing it produces, [a surreal drawing of a moon being shot in the eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Trip_to_the_Moon#In_popular_culture), is still a mystery that leads them to the George Milies stuff. Film is a pretty simple thing. Even to this day 100 years after the invention began, it remains to be 24 photographs run through a machine every second and everyone knows it. Furthermore, the content we watch on the screen is really a bundle of tricks being used collectively. But even though we know this, the tricks are still powerful, and film still affects us. That's this automaton thing. It's just a symbol of many in the film standing for this idea that there's a wonder to an illusion even if we know the trick.

You have the theater and the action and silliness, but film goes further than that. Where's the story? The film goes nowhere without his companion, who's obsessed with *books and adventure*. Of course all the adventure they get themselves into they barely escape, like when she almost gets trampled in the middle of public. I feel this is an important aspect to the film because the idealistic girl with romantic adventurous ideas gets trampled by people in a busy train station and they don't even look down. They are going to their jobs or home or somewhere far. They are not having adventures, and this is not an adventure. I think that clear distinction for the characters is meant to kind of lay the law down on recklessness. Film can't take you everywhere even if it can make you want to go. This just emphasizes the illusion aspect to film even more.

That's all I'm willing to muster up right now. In summary, Hugo is a kids film so of course it's supposed to draw kids in for the first half. However, that does not negate the gems of content and substance throughout that homage old film, nor does it undermine the very nature of the movie being about film and its magic. Scorsese smuggled it all in because he's one of the biggest aficionados of film and is considered the patriarch of American cinema. Changing to digital photography is a big deal for him and his fans and even cinema itself because he's such a prominent figure in cinema. He's 70, he's growing older into a new generation of film making, and he'll be damned before he lets the magic of film die out. So he made this film in order to preserve that magic that he has become a wizard of, a magician.

Next I will discuss **The Adventures of Tintin**

The Adventures of Tintin was a wonderful film. It's obviously a love project to these older adventures that inspired Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson to make wonderful films of fantasy and adventure.

One thing I've noted about Nickelodeon Pictures in 2011 is that they both got two fantastic directors who have ultimate control over production and distribution to make films *for* children and film makers of a newer generation in the age of digital photography and 3D. They are Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. I believe that Tintin is similarly commenting on the film industry, or more so what will happen after Spielberg passes away. If anyone were to take up his role in maintaining the heart and soul of adventure in cinema, it'd be Peter Jackson.

Throughout the entire film, massive nods to Spielberg's adventurous films, like Indiana Jones, Jaws and Hook for instance, are dropped constantly as Tintin solves this mystery. At first I saw them as playful homages, but as I read more and more into it (to be honest, I was a little high watching this film), I started seeing patterns and a pretty silly theory developed in my head that the whole film is a story of Spielberg passing on his role in cinema to Peter Jackson. Though I don't believe this is 100% valid, I still believe that it prompts some good discussion about the future of cinema, the roles of filmmakers and the importance of adventure. And also, I did some looking around on the internet and found that I'm not alone on a lot of this.

One thing I noticed is that the main antagonist, Sakharine, who stole everything that Captain Haddock was the rightful heir to, [looks incredibly like Steven Spielberg.](http://www.soundonsight.org/the-adventures-of-tintin-spielberg-brings-his-signature-blend-of-actionadventure-and-humor/steven-spielberg-and-sakharine/) Likewise, [Captain Haddock, who eventually regains the rightful ownership of his ancestor's treasure from Sakharine, bears a remarkable resemblance to Peter Jackson as well.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfkywS5YAzM) Both produced the film, WETA Workshops did the entire thing, and Andy Serkis, of Gollum and King Kong fame, plays the character that looks like Peter Jackson.

The way I see it, as Tintin and Haddock are thrown into all these brilliant, Spielberg-esque set-pieces soundtracked by the great John Williams, the film really is breaking the 5th wall by showing Peter Jackson watching a bunch of Spielberg classics. He sees the ship battles like Hook, an overlook of a city that looks like India (Temple of Doom), gets in a scuffle in a middle eastern marketplace filled with baskets and military tents (Raiders), and they are chased by a tank, which falls off a small cliff, in a motorcycle with a side pod (The Last Crusade). Tintin swims through the water towards some people he means to subdue at one point and his hair looks like a shark fin (Jaws). At one point, Sakharine throws a net on Haddock in a sword fight, which made me think of [Spartacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film), which is interesting because [Spielberg was granted the project of A.I. Artificial Intelligence by Kubrick himself before he died](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence). There might be musical cues as well, but don't quote me on that. There are so many more that I can't even remember, you can sit there for ages just pointing them all out.

I think that in the similar way that Scorsese made a film about the magic of illusion and the importance of film itself, Spielberg made a film about the importance of adventure and bravery and wonder and mystery. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time in that it actually touched me like movies did when I was a small boy. You could simply put it as ""classic Spielberg"", but being able to touch back on an earlier part of your career so flawlessly is no mere feat. Some people say that he's just shelling out the same old film, and he himself has stated last year that he's bored with action and could ""make one [action film] in my sleep"". I think this film is special because it could very well be his last action film. He's passing the helm to Peter Jackson, who has made efforts to innovate filmmaking technology and become the trailblazer for film's future. Best of all, take a wild guess who's directing the next Tintin sequel instead of Spielberg? Even if all this stuff isn't really intentional or valid, I think it brought a personal, enlightened appreciation for this underrated, overlooked film to me.

**I think that these directors are signing off their legacies and preparing for a new era of film that they unfortunately might not live long enough to see fully bloom. With these films as blessings for the new age of digital cinema, however, I feel prepared.**

1372628940.0,34,self.TrueFilm,1hdxyg,King Kong (1933) and the Visceral Effects of Visual Effects,40,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hdxyg/king_kong_1933_and_the_visceral_effects_of_visual/,"So I just saw the Blu-ray of *King Kong*; having not seen the film in a *very* long time, I was expecting it to be somewhat of a dour experience, the kind of film where you're watching more for the historical aspects rather than actual cinematic value. After all, this is primarily a VFX film, and we're talking 1933 here. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it seemed to flow.

For those of us who need a refresher, these are some of the events of 1933:

* Golden Gate Bridge begins construction
* Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor
* FDR becomes President
* DJIA has largest all-time 1-day percentage gain, from 53.84 to 62.10
* Prohibition repealed
* FM radio patented

The story is pretty straightforward: Entrepreneurial director Carl Denham grabs starving Ann Darrow off the streets of New York and sails to South East Asia to film the greatest movie ever. Along the way, she falls in love with Jack Driscoll, is kidnapped by natives, and captured by Kong, who prefers his ladies scantily clad. The crew comes across dinosaurs and Kong himself while trying to rescue her and face brutal deaths. Driscoll saves Ann, and Kong pursues them to the coast where he's knocked out with gas bombs. Cut back to Manhattan, and Kong's on display for New York society at $20 a seat (In 1933! That's ~$360 today!!). Despite the latest in chrome steel chain technology, Kong escapes and terrifies the locals. Horny Kong, who clearly hasn't masturbated in a while, tears through the city looking for girls, hurling away brunettes in search of blonde Darrow (roughly the same story will be told 25 years later in *Vertigo*). He climbs to the top of the Empire State Building, fights the Navy in the sky, and plummets 1,250ft to his death. Thanks to some half-assed calculations, that equates to a fall time of roughly ~11secs and a terminal velocity of ~110mph.

It's not a story that I think warrants or benefits from allegorization, other than the 'Beauty &amp; Beast' theme that's referenced in the film. It'd be evasive of me not to mention the 'racist' interpretations that have been leveled at the film. Given the time period and imagery, it's certainly understandable, but it's not exactly cut-and-dry because Kong is plainly depicted sympathetically at the end. Whether the filmmakers were aware of this angle is unknown, but they certainly don't dwell on it, preferring to keep the pace up during the brisk 100min runtime. Peter Jackson would rectify that fault 72 years later.

All levity aside, *King Kong* got me thinking about the visceral power of VFX, regardless of its technological quality. Nowadays, it is theoretically possible to render anything in CGI and get close to perfection. The subtler CGI shots can already cross the Uncanny Valley threshold to photorealism; even in TV there are many CGI shots that many wouldn't suspect are fake.

The VFX of *King Kong* and other heavy FX films is not subtle. It's not trying to hide at all, but rather invites scrutiny from the audience. And yet, while these overt VFX films clearly fill the theaters, as evidenced by box office figures, it seems to me that the emotional impact of these films hasn't really kept up with the technological advances. It's pretty common to hear ""It's all real, no CGI!"" when someone recommends older films like *Lawrence of Arabia* and *2001: A Space Odyssey*. In recent times, *Inception* was praised for the rotating hallway (which really isn't that special in the FX realm). I think it's fairly plain that even in the digital age, audiences do have a special appreciation for practical effects.

I don't think the issue is really analog vs digital. Both have their pros and cons, and both can age well or awfully. My personal theory is that due to the versatility and nearly unlimited boundaries of CGI, VFX films are taking it to levels of excess that audiences are growing numb to. Movies aren't real, they never have been and they rely on suspension of disbelief, imagery, and sound to create an emotional response. To put it harshly, audiences pay good money to be lied to for a few hours, but there's something about the way most heavy CGI films are handled nowadays where the artificiality of it is basically shoved in your face. Particularly with the constant superhero blockbusters being output, more and more it seems like the flimsy story is an excuse to show off computer renderings, rather than the other way around. The quality of those renderings can also vary drastically, however I think it's fair to say that at this time, CGI still has some technical limitations to overcome.

It's also possible that people have an intrinsic forgiveness towards practical effects that doesn't apply to CGI. With practical effects, there is an element of 'tangibility', the idea that what's on the screen is not only possible but actually exists and can be touched/visited/created in real life. This may benefit suspension of disbelief and may be more intellectually impressive to the viewer. For example, seeing *Vertigo* the first time, the dolly zoom totally stunned me, and there are some shots in *2001* using multiple perspectives that invite the viewer to wonder: ""*How in hell is this possible?*"" In the analog age, the solutions were sometimes ingeniously intricate or deceptively simple, but in the digital age, audiences usually just answer ""computers"" and think nothing of it. This is not to denigrate CGI artists, it is *not* simple or easy to create cinematic quality CGI, and right now the job has quite frankly become something of a thankless task. However, I find it hard to deny that there's an allure in knowing the magic on the screen was crafted in reality vs. the computer.

Really, I don't know what conclusions to draw from this. I think the problem isn't so much the technology itself but rather the people using it, and that's a debate so vast, complex, and subjective that I'd really rather not have it. I just find it illuminating that an 80-year old puppet made of rubber and rabbit fur that stood 18-24in tall can still entertain in a time when the latest CGI can be yawn-inducing. Another curiosity: You frequently hear, and see, actors having difficulty on green screen stages reacting to non-existent props, but somehow they had no difficulty getting an entire theater and whole crowds to react to Kong's intimidation and escape in 1933. This is directly referenced in the film when Denham tests Darrow's reactions to an invisible menace on board the ship. More food for thought, I guess.

Getting back to *King Kong*, the pacing is definitely integral to the success of the film. There's an inherent cheesiness to the concept of the film that I'm sure the filmmakers themselves were well aware of, so rather than being indulgent the film sticks to the necessities of the plot and skips over any troublesome areas. Need an actress? You'll get one in &gt;5mins. How to ship Kong to America? Nevermind that, cut to New York (and people have a problem with Scottie on the rooftop...*pssh*). He's climbing the tallest building in the World, how do we...Airplanes! This is a film that knows exactly how long it's welcome, does everything it needs to and clocks out on time. 

*King Kong* serves as the basis for every monster movie since, from *Godzilla* to *Cloverfield*, and yet there's an element that's still unique even all these years later. In choosing to make Kong an ape-human hybrid, the filmmakers allow and exploit a degree of empathy, identification, and even humor, something that's hard to imagine with other monsters, like *Jaws* for example. The menacing, uncaringly destructive monster is so familiar in cinema that *King Kong* almost seems like a fresh response to the trope, despite its age.

Robert Armstrong's Denham bristles with enthusiasm and panache. Special mention to Max Steiner, one of the greatest descriptive film composers, whose score is absolutely central to the pacing and atmosphere of the film. Anyone who merely studies shot sequences without the musical context, a common weakness amongst even the most prestigious film essays, is basically denying themselves half the experience.

Perhaps the best way to close out this post is a quote from the film that inspired it, and as good a description of cinema as any other:

I have been doing a selected filmography for Bergman, trying to get into his work, starting with Smiles of a Summer Night, The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, The Magician, The Virgin Springs, Through a Glass Darkly, and now Winter Light.  

I loved The Seventh Seal and Through a Glass Darkly, but I don't think they moved me in the deep way that Winter Light did.  Honestly, I was stunned by the impact Bergman was able to accomplish in 80 minutes.

Gunnar Bjornstrand's performance was, in my opinion, the best I've seen in a Bergman film so far.  Victor Sjostrom didn't really blow me away in Wild Strawberries the way he did a lot of people.  Bjornstrand I had noticed in Bergman's films, but he didn't really take the forefront until Through a Glass Darkly where he was great.  But in Winter Light, he was something else.  I also thought Ingrid Thulin was fantastic.

Thematically, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the last scene.  I recognize the film is about the silence of God and the torment that it causes Bjornstrand's character.  I'm not sure what I make of the presence of love in the film, though.  It seemed most pronounced in the last scene when the characters discuss love as proof of God.  Is the faith reaffirmed in Bjornstrand and perhaps Thulin through the love she has for him?

This may be due to the fact I live in the UK and this may be common knowledge to Americans of a certain age, but what an insane story it is, worthy of a Scorsese epic/mini-series itself.

In a nutshell...

In the early 1970s, Arthur Bremer was a bitterly unhappy young man who felt alienated and unaccepted by society and who became gripped by an overwhelming desire to prove himself with an act of masculine aggression. He wrote in his diary that his purpose was to ‘do SOMETHING BOLD AND DRAMATIC, FORCEFUL AND DYNAMIC, A STATEMENT of my manhood for the world to see’.  On 15th May 1972 Bremer shot presidential candidate George Wallace five times at a political rally, leaving Wallace paralysed.

After his conviction for attempted murder, Bremer’s diaries were serialised in several newspapers and had a profound effect upon Paul Schrader, who at 26 was divorced, out of work and living in his car. An unhealthy obsession with guns and pornography was born out of this period of intense isolation. 

Over the course of seven days, Schrader channelled his and Bremer’s isolation and frustration into the screenplay for Taxi Driver, later noting ‘it just jumped out of my head like an animal’. The script reached Scorsese who recognised his own anxieties and loneliness in Travis. When the film was released in 1976, many people connected with its largely sympathetic portrayal of existential rage and social isolation, John Hinkley Jnr being one of them. 

On 30th March 1981, Hinkley Jnr shot President Ronald Reagan twice as he left an engagement at the Washington Hilton.  At his trial, the would-be assassin was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and instead it was Travis Bickle who was held up as the guilty party. Hinkley’s defence claimed that the already disturbed individual ‘absorbed the identity of Travis Bickle’ having watched Taxi Driver repeatedly, adopting Travis’s dress code and becoming obsessed with Jody Foster.

Scorsese had already started working on The King of Comedy at the time of Reagan’s shooting and it was in production when Taxi Driver was screened in court (with special attention being paid to the scene in which  Travis Bickle stalks presidential nominee Charles Palantine at a political rally) 
and blamed for turning Hinkley into an assassin. 

Scorsese had said very little publicly on the Hinkley matter and instead seemed to channel his feelings into The King of Comedy.  The theme of an isolated man lifting his personality from media output is established before the opening credits had rolled, in a scene which replicated the notorious attempted-assassination scene from Taxi Driver. 

This must be the biggest gamble of Scorsese's career, and even though The King of Comedy was a huge critical and commercial flop on release, the fact that all of this was new to me surely proves that Scorsese succeeded in turning the scandal back on itself as well as carrying out a daring rescue mission for the cultural identity of Travis Bickle.

Does anyone out there have memories of this whole affair?  

Does anyone know if Scorsese rewrote the script for The King of Comedy to address the Hinkly business or was it just an incredible coincidence that he was working on this film at the time?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1ce31y,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ce31y/the_remarkable_tale_of_travis_bickle_john_hinkley/,

I have some questions.,40,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1bzbqq/the_french_connection_1971_what_an_interesting/,"Just watched this for the first time. Immediately I was into it and it didn't take me long to figure out why. I'm especially drawn to films that are dependent on visual storytelling, and this film does this very well. Multiple time, key plot points are revealed in an instant, and if you aren't quick enough, you'll miss it. This makes for some serious *watching*. And that car chase/train scene! Love it...

I have a few questions that may not have answers, but kind of just want to see what yall think.

First, how did the police get the car back to perfect condition after tearing it apart? Some shots show them slicing open and ripping through the panels. Did they replace the car? Or did they build it in near perfect condition in just 4 hours?

Also, the ending of this film struck me as quite odd. (SPOILERS) 

In the final moments of the film we watch the actual drug deal go down. In the beginning of this scene we see the drugs get hidden in the wall of an old building, and then the money gets hidden in the side foot-panel of an old car (which is then towed away). 

Here's where is gets strange for me. Charnier rides in a car to leave the deal, but is surprised by the police waiting for him on the other side of the bridge. At this point they speed back to the building and hide. But what happened to the car being towed? Wouldn't it have had to drive down the bridge as well? Therefor the cops should have snagged it. If it went another way, then why didn't Charnier just get the car to escape that way rather than going on foot? Maybe it doesn't even matter, but if this is the case then I'm still reaching for some meaning in this final scene. 

I also keep wondering if Charnier could have gone back for the drugs, seeing that he was the only one left that knew where they were. Or at least could get them before anyone else.

Then finally there's that gunshot at the end of the film. This I read about. Friedkin apparently added this for the sake of adding it, a joke almost; a whim in the editing room that he didn't think much about, almost as a poke at films in the era that had added final twists to make people *think*. Not sure how I feel about this, kind of childish in my opinion, but I can't get too upset, the film was damn entertaining.

Sorry this turned out longer than I wanted.

For those who haven't seen it, I suggest you watch Mulholland Dr. first to attempt to get yourself accustomed to Lynch's style.

To those who have seen Inland Empire, did you enjoy it and do you have any theories that can make sense of the story?  Seemingly nonsensical plot aside, I think Lynch's style is absolutely brilliant.  I love the way he purposely makes parts of the film look, sound, and feel  scripted and then interrupts the atmosphere he's created with sudden deadly serious events and disturbing imagery.  The contrast sends a chill down my spine and makes even the calm, normal scenes feel eerie.

I've been trying to find movies that can make me feel genuinely scared and Inland Empire definitely did it for me.  Typical Hollywood horror films have never really managed to get a reaction out of me so I've been watching a lot of psychological thrillers recently and Inland Empire is hands down the most unsettling, disturbing movie I have seen so far.

They both deal with similar themes (the inescapable nature violence, the treatment of the indigenous populations, attempts to civilize the West), and are both ""anti-Westerns"" in their portrayal of frontier life.
I think it's likely that *Heart of Darkness* also inspired some the characterizations, including Captain Stanley with his ""I will civilize this land"" refrain and Arthur Burns, who seems to be as Kurtz-like a figure as any.

"" The Three Faces of Asami: i.e. it's all psychological
Sorry about the lateness of this post. I didn't even hear about this movie when it first came out. I only discovered it recently, but boy am I glad I did. It's not just a good horror flick; it's got a deep meaning, once you find the key to access it. Besides reading the few posts here, I also read all 21 pages of reviews about it over at www.IMDB.com (Internet Movie Data Base). And while the majority of people enjoyed it, so to speak; very few of them even came close to understanding its message. So since no one else saw it this way, I may be way off base. But it makes perfect sense to me; so I'm glad to share it.

* * * * *

Spoiler Warning: This isn't a review of the film for those who haven't seen it yet. It's an analysis of the film's psychological meanings for those who have seen it already. Spoilers ahead: You've been warned.

* * * * *


The film doesn't EVER shows us the real Asami. Neither the submissive girl at the beginning, nor the psychotic fiend at the end is really her. All we are ever seeing is Aoyama's own perceptions of her in each phase of the relationship; perceptions which are not real but instead are colored by his desires and guilt and then projected onto Asami.

It helps in understanding the meaning of the film if you first understand the symbols used.
Consuming Alcohol represents having a blurred view of reality: The two men are drinking when they discuss their skewed, old-fashioned views of how a woman should behave. Aoyama is drinking when he is reviewing the resumes; spilling directly on Asami's resume shows that his view of her specifically is unreliable. Also he is usually drinking each time we see him thinking about her. Even just before the torture scene he is drinking, what we are to believe is a poisoned drink, showing that even that view of her is not accurate.
Feet represent adultery or fornication through the metaphor of ""running around"". Removing the feet then represents preventing infidelity.
A Tongue represents telling lies, usually; can also be just talking in general.
An Ear represents listening to someone; a missing ear, then, is not hearing what they are saying.
A Finger represents touching; typically physical or sexual abuse, but also may be intimacy.

As the film opens we see Aoyama completely lost in his emotions due to the death of his wife. It is only the appearance of his son that brings him back to stability. In effect, it is his relationship with his son that ""saves"" him emotionally.

He does not recognize that women have the same feelings that men have. This is indicated by the secretary who keeps announcing that she is leaving to get married, then waits for him to give a reaction that doesn't come. She's wanting him to be happy for her, because she has worked for him a long time and cares about what he thinks. But he has never noticed her other than as a worker that's there to do a job. Her feelings, if she has any, are insignificant. Likewise, in his discussion with his best friend about what kind of girl to choose, he likens it to picking out a car.

After he has been widowed for seven years, it is at last his son who suggests that he enter another emotional relationship. Since his son was once his savior and remains the focus of his life, he has put his son on a pedestal and listens to his advice. Their relationship is not a traditional one where the son always defers to his father; instead the father is submissive to the son, even though it should be the other way around. This is shown when the son tells the father to do the dishes and the father complies; when the son has a guest come over and the father gives up his dinner for the guest; and when the son enters the father's room without knocking.

Once he decides to look for a new wife and agrees to the ruse of an audition, he starts having feelings of guilt which begin to interfere with his desires; at first subtly, then more pronounced. He expresses several times that he feels like he is doing something wrong and even feels like he's committing a crime. He's not a bad man; he doesn't want to deceive anyone. He also can't bear the look of his deceased wife from her photo as he peruses the audition resumes. He still feels a sense of commitment to her, even though she's gone. His guilt is growing both from stepping out on his wife and from holding a sham audition.

Although we never get to see the ""real Asami"", we can gather from the dialogue that she was as she said -- an aspiring ballerina who had an unhappy childhood and whose career was cut short by a tragic event. But Aoyama never sees the real Asami because he starts projecting onto her his image of the ""perfect partner"" from the very start. As he reads her resume, her story that her hopes were ended tragically and she now feels dead inside serves to elicit sympathy. As he remembers his own loss he makes her into a tragic heroine. He then falls in love with his created image of her as the ""perfect Asami"" without ever having met her and knowing nothing about her.

When Asami comes into the audition room we cannot see the real her, we only see Aoyama's projection. His image of her is a sweet, shy, submissive, properly formal, ""good girl"". During the questions that his best friend Yasuhisa asks, we hear the real girl's answers, but Aoyama isn't paying any attention to them, he is only attentive to his projection. When he finally talks, he doesn't really ask her much; instead he does most of the talking, telling her how wise she is for her age. Her only responses to him are, ""Yes"" and ""Thank you"". These were the real girl's responses. We can hear her throughout the film, we just can't see the real her. Every image is colored by Aoyama's psyche.

Each time he calls her or even just thinks about calling her and we see her waiting by the telephone, we are not really seeing her in her apartment, we are seeing his imagination of her. As he calls her he is imagining that she is doing nothing but waiting by the phone for his call. When Aoyama begins thinking about meeting someone through the planned audition, even before the first resumes arrive, he ""sees"" a girl sitting in her room waiting for him; but at this point she is not yet defined enough to have features, those are put in place only after he sees Asami's photograph. This image of a submissive girl just sitting and waiting for him to summon her is merely another manifestation of his old-fashioned, male-dominant outlook.

After dating a few times they go away for a weekend together. Although the weekend was his idea, once there he imagines that he is the stuttering innocent who doesn't have sex on his mind and that she is the one who initiates the sex. After their encounter he falls asleep and most of what follows is only a dream. He is dreaming from the time he kisses her till he wakes up and finds he still has his foot. He's awake just a few minutes before going to sleep again. He then dreams again till the end of the film. The story told in the dream state is choppy and jumps a bit.

Prior to consummating their relationship, the real Asami admits to Aoyama that she was molested as a child. Previously she had only said she'd been injured, but now she wants him to know the truth before proceeding any further and for him to decide if he can accept it. She bares herself to him, figuratively, and reveals to him her scars; and he tells her it doesn't matter. When he had first heard of her abdominal injury he thought it was related to her dancing, so he felt sympathetic; but now that he hears it was a sexual encounter, he starts becoming disillusioned. His image of her begins changing to the opposite of goodness. Both her confession and his own act with her cause a change in his view of her from a perfect Asami to an ""evil Asami"".

Although Asami is young and beautiful, she has not pursued finding a boyfriend because she knows that once men find out about her past they'll reject her. But she recognizes that it's hard for a girl to live alone. So she takes a chance that perhaps an older man might not be so picky, especially if he's getting a beautiful, young girl in return.. She's also encouraged to take a chance with Aoyama since he's actively pursuing her. But she has guessed wrong: he is picky and wants a ""good girl"". She had tried to let him know early on by telling him her past in a coded way, by saying she'd been abused and had received an abdominal injury. But he was blinded by his projection of the perfect Asami and didn't comprehend what she was saying. His best friend, however, understood what she meant and so kept trying to dissuade him from the girl.

After they have sex and Aoyama begins dreaming about her admission, he at first thinks about losing her. He even recalls his best friend's warnings to forget about her. But then he insists that, ""No"", he still wants her. However, as his subconscience takes over, he begins examining everything she's told him and the details start coming apart and recombining in a more negative picture. As he thinks of the sexual assault he suspects the dance teacher. The teacher's feet are prominent, symbolizing his debauchery; but they are deformed, showing that his sexual interests are perverted. Aoyama at first imagines an old lecher who has taken advantage of a small child; he crawled between her legs and left her scarred for life. But as he continues to consider this he begins to think that she may not have been so young and helpless after all when it happened. The dance teacher asks him if he has talked to her (tongue), heard her (ear), and touched her (finger). Next, as he thinks of her employer, the imagined dialogue with the fellow employee makes that whole story ""go to pieces"". As he considers everything she's told him there are too many parts, and some of them don't fit together into a proper whole; there are details left over, figuratively. The scene culminates in the image of the severed tongue flapping around, which for him signifies lying. He comes to think that everything she has said has been lies and deceptions.

The missing record producer and missing bar madam are two of the pieces he can't make fit. These were just facts thrown into the story to allow for misdirection. We're supposed to think that it's the record producer in the sack and that the bar madam was murdered and dismembered. But actually it's just coincidence that the record producer left town and only because of insufficient detail that he can't find where Asami worked. Aoyama's best friend only says he can't track down the record producer and the bar madam; that doesn't mean anything has happened to them, it's only a lack of information. But his imagination turns these things into pieces that don't fit her story; so she must be evil and lying. The extra pieces of the dismembered body are described as three fingers, an ear, and a tongue (remember those?). That there are ""three"" fingers is a product of him imagining that she was touched by three people -- her Uncle; her Stepfather; and either her Aunt if we're considering any abuse, or her record producer if it only refers to sexual abuse. Personally I think it refers to the Aunt, and that the record producer had very little involvement with her before leaving town for unknown reasons.

He is also led to question just what it is he is looking for in a woman. A succession of images of different girls attacking him sexually -- an aggressive Asami, his secretary, and even his son's young girlfriend -- all serve to expose to him his conflicting ideas of women's purity, innocence, and sexuality.

His changed image of Asami is again indicated by his consumption of alcohol, in what we think is a poisoned drink. His picture of her has now been poisoned and takes a very dark turn as he begins to imagine the evil Asami torturing him and destroying every part of his life little by little. He is experiencing the pain that emotional attachment can bring: loss of freedom, visceral torment, and submission to another's will. Evil Asami is both the manifestation of his disillusionment with Asami who is now seen as not perfect, and the embodiment of his own guilty conscience which is punishing him for lying and running around, and his attitude towards women.

He comes back to reality momentarily when he wakes up with a start, finds he's still in bed with her, and to his relief still has his foot. He realizes that his perception of her has changed, but before he can figure out what to do she announces that she will accept his marriage proposal. He now feels trapped in a relationship with someone whom he no longer feels to be a perfect partner. So he goes back to sleep and dreams again, trying to find a resolution to his problem.

Prior to their weekend together he had always pictured her in dazzling white clothes and with a submissive demeanor, symbolizing her purity and goodness. But after he slept with her and after her admission, he could no longer consider her ""pure"". So he began picturing her in black leather and with a very dominant personality; the very opposite of what he considered a ""good girl"". He still didn't see the real her; but now instead of projecting on her an image of goodness, he began projecting on her an image of wickedness. His imagination put pictures to all of the negative metaphors of his guilty conscience -- telling lies (cut off tongue), tasting pain (syringe), feeling it in his stomach (needles), a playboy that ""runs around"" (cut off feet), searching for beauty and youth (eyes), losing his head, and so on. When the negative images first start making themselves felt, he tries to run and escape; but he is literally tripped up by the sack on the floor. He finally opens it to see what it is and is shocked by what's inside.

The sack represents his own emotional feelings toward Asami. It first appears when he considers calling her for a second date. Initially he is able to keep his emotions under tight control; completely bagged up, so to speak. But as he becomes more interested in this girl, his emotions wake up and start working to get out. When he calls her and the phone rings too long, he imagines she's deliberately waiting and his emotions jerk; but then she answers and the sack lies still. Each time his emotions grow we see the bag move. Later when he finally opens the bag and releases it we see a tortured man who has been stripped of almost all his humanity, completely enslaved to the whims of this woman no matter how sadistic and evil she may be. He cannot tell lies, or run around, or touch other women. In other words he is emasculated.

He is totally trapped by his emotions and powerless to free himself from this girl, despite projecting onto her a facade of great evil. Although he is now completely disenchanted about her purity, he is already ensnared by his emotional attachment to her. He will do anything she wants, even to the point of being treated like a dog and lapping up her regurgitated lies while she pats him on the head like a pet.

Only after he's realized this do his thoughts turn to his son. His son saved him from emotional helplessness once before, perhaps he can do it again. As Aoyama concentrates on his son, he appears. At first it seems the evil Asami may destroy him too; but their encounter is interrupted by Aoyama waking up briefly. When the dream begins again, Shigehiko and Asami battle it out in Aoyama's head to see which will prevail. At last Aoyama finds his love for Shigehiko is stronger than his attachment to Asami, thus he is able to break free of her domination.

He had become completely enamored of this girl despite his assertions early on that he was mature enough and smart enough not to be taken in by emotions. But as things progressed, neither his love for his pet, nor his love for his best friend, nor even his love for his dead wife were enough to prevent him from getting ensnared once he had decided to have an emotional relationship again. He had been lonely too long. Only his love for his son was strong enough to free him from his false projections and help him become emotionally stable again.

Once he had killed the image of the evil Asami he was able to hear for the third time the conversation from their second date. The first time he heard it, it was colored by his perfect image of her, and her family was rich and happy; the second time he heard it, it was colored by his evil image of her, and her family was abusive and hateful; but the third time, he actually heard the real her. And he comes to realize that there is a real person behind his projected images; someone with real feelings, someone just as vulnerable as he. As they had prepared to sleep together, her request that he ""love only her"" was seen by him as her attempt to assert control over him, and his mind rebelled against that. In actuality it was just a plea for him not to hurt her. Finally, once he got a grip on his emotional state, he heard their conversation one more time. In the third version he finally comes to understand the meaning of their relationship -- we take a chance, and we suffer a lot, but we survive. They both had taken a chance on the relationship, and both had exposed themselves to potential suffering at the hands of the other, but if they respected each other they could survive.

All the time that he's having the second dream, he is still with her in bed on their weekend trip. But the film doesn't show him awakening from the dream and doesn't tell us how he will resolve this in his waking life. Will he go ahead and marry her, or will he dump her? How he will now handle the real Asami isn't told. The story is about how Aoyama's ""projected views"" of Asami changed as their relationship progressed and how his feelings of guilt were made manifest then resolved. He goes from seeing women (Asami) as objects meant only to serve men submissively, to seeing that they are also people with their own needs and feelings; and those needs are similar to his own -- the desire for companionship, love, and respect. We don't see what he'll do with her when he wakes up, but we know that he will at last see the ""real Asami"" and will recognize that she's more than just a servant or a pet.""",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_12ugi8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12ugi8/found_a_cool_interpretation_of_takeshi_miikes/,

Of course there are plenty of filmakers that dont belong to those schools and neither to the one I will talk about (most Fellini or Bergman for example). 

This list represent a good __starting point__ to pragmatic aesthetics, in which ""expression"" replaces ""conception"" for the most part.

I looked around a few forums and websites which analyze the ending, and I'm wondering what you think. People seem to be convinced with absolute certainty that they are right - whether they are arguing in favor of the storm being reality or just another delusion.

Often, I hate when people over analyze the ending of movies when an ambiguous ending works in its favor. Much like this movie's director, other directors often decide to tell people that the movie ended ambiguously and you determine the ending. Fair enough.

However, I'm not sure how that works for this film. Throughout the entire movie, I was kept in suspense about what was happening, but before the final scene, the purpose of the film seemed incredibly clear to me: His illness (which I believe he had, either in the form of schizophrenia or something else) caused him to act destructively due to paranoia about a storm coming. Rather than working together with his family or truly seeking help, he let his paranoia build and build until it completely overtook him. When the storm hit (and when they went into the shelter), he saw this as the prophecy coming true. Meanwhile, his wife knew better, which is why she told him it HAD to be him opening the door to the shelter, and that everything would be ok.

Is this how you saw the movie? If not, how did you interpret it? Do you think the ambiguous ending works in its favor?

So I guess I have a few questions for you guys: What's different about film during this past decade that sets it apart from the previous decade? If you could think of a way to describe the overall (visual and narrative) aesthetic quality what would you say? Which films break away from this aesthetic? Are there any films that changed the ways movies look and how they are written? Changes don't always follow the neat decade marks, so if you can think of a year when the films of the 2000s began to feel like part of a cohesive era, talk about that, too.

I'm new to reddit- been posting comments for a few days- and thought I'd talk about about a collaboration between Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, Woyzeck. This is Herzog's adaptation of  Georg Büchner's final, unfinished play about the oppression by the upper echelons of society of a working class soldier and his eventual unraveling in 19th century Germany. Often considered a minor work by Herzog, it really should get more attention then it does. I'll elaborate.
 
 Woyzeck isn't demonstrative of Herzog's usual style as a filmmaker; it uses long cuts and scenes seem like acts. He's criticized for this decision, but I find the choice appropriate. It highlights what makes this film great, the performance of Klaus Kinski as the soldier Woyzeck. 

 Kinski's interpretation of Woyzeck is perfect. He shows every emotion through his face, his voice, his form as whole, at the exact time called for in the script. The oppression of the forces being thrust upon Woyzeck is palpable as each scene unfolds. Feeling along with him is crushing. The final scene, where Woyzeck finally breaks and stabs his wife to death, assaults the viewer. Kinski's face is a mask of pure agony. As I write this I return to that scene, and feel tears starting to form. I may never watch Woyzeck a second time.

Its really easy to slate 'The Last Samurai' for all its obvious shortcomings. Whenever one of these movies come along, people leave the cinema- basking in the not-so-amazing knowledge that, ""the story has been done before""- and guess what, it will be done again. Dance with Wolves, Fern Gully, Pocahontas, Avatar- they are all the same story, but range vastly in quality; plot is not the measure of a film. Its amazing how similar films are actually. But you know this.

Anyway, its the implications of the story that really rustles people's jimmies- but the question is whether or not the controversy is coming from that annoying group of people that are all too fast to yell 'racist'. Either way, the notion of the white American man entering an ""other"" or ""savage"" culture, ingratiating himself, and then become their saviour of sorts is sketchy to say the least. The Last Samurai is very much guilty of this despite what people say. The question of whether it is Katsumoto or Tom Cruise (and I'm calling him Tom Cruise- because thats really what the character is), who is the last samurai is ambiguous, sure, but that in itself is outrageous. Just watch Katsumoto's death scene to see how blatant this American feeling of superiority can be (watch from 04:00). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZTWCwqmgLc . Tom Cruise's train of thought can be roughly transcribed as ""God, are all these Japs bowing to me or Katsumoto?"" Its about 04:43 that you can see ""What was I thinking, of course they're bowing to me- I am a golden American god, praise me and my glorious white skin."" I only exaggerate a bit.

Despite how absurd it may seem, so far this is not new and very predictable- Hollywood doing what Hollywood does. Things become far more interesting when you take into account that Japan fucking loved this movie- it grossed a higher amount in Japan alone than it did in the whole of America, it is one of the highest grossing movies ever released in Japan, and the critical reception was far more positive than in anywhere else in the world. So as a Western audience our self-righteous bleating, trying to ""protect"" Japan from Hollywood's modern pseudo-imperialism, falls flat and is a bit ridiculous.

So why do Japan not only tolerate, but gobble up this film filled with historical inaccuracies seething with a sense of American superiority? Many reasons. Firstly, Japan has had a long history and has been famous for its ultra-intense nationalism. Examples are rife, some stereotypes, some not; duty to country over love for family, a deep seeded love for the emperor that embodies Japan, a national religion that doesn't even recognise the existence of the rest of the world, a country that even now clings on to a sense of ethnic homogeny, and the famous 'asian work ethic' fuelled by the love of their nation. Suddenly, however, since the war, ultra-nationalism in the global consciousness has become very much negative affair, conjuring images of cults of personality, dictatorships, nazism etc. (I'm coming to my point in a minute).

Japan has had to deal with a very similar sort of post-war guilt as Germany. A guilt that has had Japan terribly insecure regarding its common perception as 'the villain of Asia' from both America and post-imperial Asian countries. This once again is very apparent in American and Chinese cinema- the likes of 'Pearl Harbour', 'The Last Emperor', 'The Go Master' etc. The attempt to deal with the guilt, as well as the more forceful power of American occupants, and a changed of constitution- made the expression of Nationalism, the very tool that dragged Japan into a modern power, extraordinarily taboo.

Back to The Last Samurai. It is in fact the very naivety and revolting American-ness of the movie that allowed it to be popular. For one, it showed to the Japanese people a foreign entity portraying them in a positive light- it is the fruits of their labour, an international public relations success story. Secondly, The film is highly nationalistic- portraying the emperor in a position of power despite the reality of him being merely a figure head. It allowed the Japanese people to connect this nationalism without any sense of guilt. If the film were Japanese, questions would be instantly cast regarding 'what is the political motivation?', subversive and unsettling undertones would be present- corrupting an otherwise pure affirmation of Japanese nationalism.

The rabbit hole goes deeper, nationalism is not the only layer of Japanese identity that is clouded and peculiar. It stems from the fact that the Japanese have been told their whole lives that Japan is special, different, and weird; not only unique, but uniquely unique. This gives rise to an obsession of what it means to be Japanese, and a brand of literature referred to as 'Nihonjinron' i.e. The examination of Japanese Identity. Examples of characteristics include, a language that foreigners will never be able to truly speak, Japan as an island country that has an immaculately preserved culture, Japan as a 'groupist' society, Japan as a 'shame' society, the Japanese as having a dichotomy between who they are on the inside and on the outside, vertical social structures, Japan as one of the last surviving homogenous nations- the list goes on. But, it is ultimately a fallacy.

The Japanese are not to blame- Nihonjinron is a reaction to Western 'orientalism'- and in fact the Last Samurai is very appropriate in showing that. Orientalism is the western creation of an ""other"" to reaffirm itself. Just as the basic archetype of the movie is- show how awesome the American is by showing how savage or weird or different the [insert an interesting world culture] is. Nihonjinron is the adaption of this image to something that reasserts Japan as something more than a backdrop for an American story. Nihonjinron is very much the assertion that Japan is in fact better than the rest of the world in self-defense- uniquely unique.

The Last Samurai fills this need perfectly- it presents to Japan an image of what it is to be Japanese, an interesting one that carries the intrigue of the entire film- large chunks of the movie in fact serve as mere extended montages of samurai life. The Japanese consume this image, repackage it as Nihonjinron, and then once again export it to the west. The director definitely researched Nihonjinron as some sort of pre-production, content in ripples, as everyone else, of earlier examples of a false image of Japan, (think 'Chrysanthemum and the Sword' and 'Shogun'). Indeed we have all witnessed the western exotification of Japan, the weeaboos, and the wankers who insist they know what they're talking about. Unfortunately what we all see, including the Japanese, is the product of a long cycle of a self-perpetuating stereotype. In The Last Samurai we bear witness to a false identity, a fake history, and a magnificent lie.

I'm not denying the existence of the samurai but in actuality they were a corrupt group- described in actual history as content in their own power, unproductive members of society, and cruel. Nor am I denying the very broad historical facts in The Last Samurai- but in actuality the samurai were not in rebellion to preserve 'the old ways' because of honour, but because it would eradicate their standing in modern society- a guaranteed life of gambling, drinking without having to work. In the movie progress is represented by the progress of war, only slightly manipulative. But In fact not only were the Samurai standing in the way of progression of war, but of education, law, industry, science etc. When we root for the Samurai in the film- we're rooting against the country Japan was able to become. Nevertheless this is Nihonjinron, the identity of Japan, and what modern Japanese model themselves after.

The reality of Japan NOW is dire, (I'm going to get back to how it links into The Last Samurai and Nihonjinron): racism on a fundamental level- law and otherwise, a stagnating economy, a young population not getting married and having children, as well as an ageing population. Now, my statistics aren't going to be exact- so look them up, but in 40 years over 40% of the population will be over 65. If they don't decide to go on a mass culling of their elderly- for every 1.7 worker, they 1 old person has to be sustained. That number is going to grow- and won't sustain itself for long.

 For my final point, it is the very stereotype that is maintained that holds Japan back. The solutions can be found: importing foreign workers, increased interaction and trade with others, no more stupid international relations issues- but for a Japanese population that has convinced itself so strongly that what makes its country strong is Nihonjinron, this is difficult to accept- going against the principles of an isolated, homogenous nation. Katsumoto is the Japanese identity- the product of American orientalism, the obstacle of progress, and the subject of admiration from an oblivious Japanese population.

1340618144.0,33,self.TrueFilm,vkdfm,Prometheus - my interpretation - (Xpost from r/movies),58,25,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/vkdfm/prometheus_my_interpretation_xpost_from_rmovies/,"I noticed a lot of charts and pictures attempting to illuminate something about this film and most of them seem so far off I felt compelled to offer a counter position.

For starters, **the opening scene is not earth and it is not an engineer sacrificing himself to create life on our planet.**

The opening scene is a depiction of ""Prometheus"", he who betrayed his fellow ""gods"" and thus sacrificed himself to save mankind (remember him? You know, the god the movie is named after). That engineer drinking the weaponized organics (the black goo) was doing so to kill his own people, so that we might be spared. 

This is why there are dead engineers everywhere and why we constantly see recordings of them fleeing for their lives. It is also why the engineer's ship was already programmed to head to earth. ""Prometheus"" stopped them from visiting earth and attacking us with the weaponized organics just in time.

Granted, the engineers may have seeded life on earth and in fact may have seeded us specifically but neither is necessary for the film to be in tact.

As for the ""goo"" itself, I would assert that it is organic material that generates a kind of antithesis to whatever species it encounters. That way you could just drop some of this stuff on any planet and be confident it would be able to wipe out anything it encountered.  

My additional theory (and this part is a stretch) is that the Engineers represent a notion known as ""Teleological Evolution"". That is to say they represent the idea that evolution is ""going somewhere""; in this film's universe to the engineers. We have their DNA because life is evolving towards them (they are simply us minus the imperfections). This part is a stretch but is something I found thought provoking while watching the film. It also explains why the ""Aliens"" xenomorphs are so bad ass. They are the antithesis of the most highly evolved organisms around.



Note, multiple interpretations of a film may often be seen as having merit but the one that I see made so very often about this film (that the engineer in the opening scene is on earth and is seeding the planet with life) simply does not hold water for me. 

Edit: I want to add I think this movie is still flawed, especially in terms of the characters behavior. Here are some of the behaviors I found ridiculous:

- ""I've been on an alien planet for all of 5 minutes... you know what I'm going to do? TAKE OFF MY HELMET! YAY, lets all take of our helmets!""

- ""I'm a biologist but I think it's a good idea to poke at the snake like creature emerging from the black goo. Yes, ignore it's threat posturing, all alien creatures do that at first""

- ""Oh a large space ship is falling on me. I've seen the schematics, I know it's exact dimensions. Interesting, the longest part is falling towards me... I think I'll just keep running the long way instead of turning left or right and surviving""

There are more but you get the point.

**PS: after having read the reactions and the input here vs the dialogue going on in r/movies can I just say... I love you guys.**

I think the notion of ""The Decalogue"" as a TV series is overlooked by many filmgoers—although the ten-part series was originally released on Polish TV, ""The Decalogue"" is typically held as a collection of short films. So I'd like to discuss this particular designation, as well as general differences between TV and movies. 

When I first watched ""The Decalogue"", I watched each full film on YouTube, one at a time over several weeks, and fell in love with them. When I bought the full Criterion set, though, there was a slight difference (besides the quality). YouTube had the original TV versions, with each began with the same intro, credits, and theme song, while the Criterion left these intros out and simply began with the title on a black background, like a short film. Not that this edit detracted from the brilliance of each 'episode', but it felt like something had been ripped away from me, and that the series had been ripped apart into separate, standalone films. 

And it makes me further appreciate the brilliance of ""The Decalogue"" as a single entity, not only for the relations and intertextuality between each of its parts, but because of its intimacy with the viewer. To me, TV is about viewing from the comfort of your living room or your bed, sitting in your underwear, and hanging out with something familiar and loved. Although the stories, characters, cinematography, and score change with each of ""The Decalogue""'s parts, we come to expect a few of the same things: the cold Warsaw apartment setting, Artur Barcis (the guy), the ten commandments (to an extent). More than anything, a sense of style and *vision* pervades the series; we know the level of moral concern and conflict each story will present. There is something foreign and intimidating about a movie that is mitigated in the relative familiarity and expectation in TV. 

In addition, I think this notion of TV intimacy adds a new hermeneutic, or thematic interpretation, to ""The Decalogue"". Maybe the way the characters view each other, always with a sense of separation and misunderstanding, leavened by the metaphor of the socialist apartment complex, is similar to the solitary longing of the TV viewer.

I could talk about this a lot more, but I really want to hear others' thoughts.

Another film that contains many genres is Jean-Luc Godard's *Pierrot le Fou*, which steps into comedy (from slapstick to satire), crime, noir, action, thriller, adventure, drama, romance and tragedy . It even experiments by diverging into moments of musical, documentary and blatant advertising. 

Hybrid genres are common too nowadays (e.g. *Evil Dead*, *Cowboys &amp; Aliens*, *(500) Days of Summer*). Is it even possible for a film to be outside of genre completely? Once a film becomes too disparate in narrative or form, it then seems to comes under the genre of ""experimental"" or ""avant-garde"". One must also consider how to categorise genres, whether it is based on story, content, style, the performer, budget/production, artistic status, audience, racial identity, location or sexual orientation (again, stolen from Wikipedia).

I know a lot of people like reading reviews and stuff to decide whether to watch a film or not, thus there reviews usually try not to spoil the film or discuss the plot elements in detail.

I still have too many great famous classics to sift through to bother with reviews. If it's a famous classic it will usually be in my sphere of interest, so (right now at least) I go by general reputation and personal recommendations from people I trust.

But! I would love some good sources for after-view reading. Analysis of the films I've seen that might go through things I've missed (like some of you linked me great and convincing blog posts about why La Reglée du Jeu was in fact not so horribly overrated and dull as I first perceived it).

**Please Read this before commenting or voting:**

If you didn't know already, the theme for November's weekly movies is **""Revolution""**. Please suggest a movie that fits in with that theme and/or vote for other suggestions.


**Voting guidelines:**


* Please suggest a movie that you think would **create an interesting discussion**. It's not necessarily about suggesting your favorite movie; it's about what movie you think would create interesting conversations. I'd also ask that you try not to go for *blatantly* obvious suggestions or films that everyone is likely to have already seen.

* In addition to naming the movie you want us to watch, please write at least a little bit about *why* you think we should watch and discuss it, and why it fits with the theme(if it's not immediately obvious). Convince people to vote for your film! If multiple films get lots of support we might even hold multiple film discussions.

*  If you could, include a link to the wikipedia page, IMDB page, and/or trailer for the film you suggest.

* **Do not downvote other people's suggestions**. If you disagree with a suggestion, comment and say why. We love to hear dissenting opinions!

* Do not include plot spoilers in your suggestions or discussions about the movies suggested in this thread. If you must, use spoiler tags!

* If you get here early, please come back to the thread later to vote for newer suggestions you might like. I'll keep the poll open for at least 24 hours.

Sorry to be late about this, I've been a little busy. I'm going to post the winner in an edit to this thread. We'll also try to post it in a banner(if we can figure out how to make one) or at the very least in the sidebar.

Unless anyone has any objections I'd like to set the discussion date for November 13th. I know this means we'll only have 3 movies this month, but at least that gives people more time to watch them. If the top two movies end up being very close to one another, we may even hold two film discussions since we'll have more time(that'll also let us get 4 films in).

Is it a step in the right direction towards further realism? We do see in stereoscope, afterall

OR

Is it a technique that furthers the chasm between wealthy cinemas, like Hollywood, and those with less wealth? 3d is way more expensive, and Hollywood has a tendency to step on other nations by making films with technology they couldn't ever match.

What can we learn from the conversion from silent to sound cinema?

What can we learn from the conversion from B&amp;W to color cinema?

In the 20s and 30s, Hollywood's vertically integrated studio system viciously used patents and the inaccessibility of the burgeoning sound technology to walk all over the European cinemas.

In the 30s and 40s, Hollywood used block booking and staggered releases to control the market in America, squashing any trace of an independent cinema.

We know that Hollywood has a history of innovating in order to not only profit, but to destroy the competition. That is the definition of anti-competitive. 

Who is the competitor now? Hollywood is America's dominant cinema, and thoroughly saturates most markets. It's biggest competitor, Bollywood, is in essence a niche market. 

I contend that Hollywood's contender, now, is everybody. The Cuban's imperfect cinema has come to pass, and now everyone is a filmmaker. I can spend 1000 dollars and pick up a movie camera, and make a decent living on youtube if I'm funny enough. Camera's like DSLRs and even the RED make everyone a filmmaker. Literally every middle classer and up can viably make a sleeper sundance hit. I think that this threatens hollywood. Why do we go see their movies for 15 bucks plus popcorn, when I can go on vimeo and watch a pretty damn good ultra low budget indie film?

So, in response, we make 3d. Time to advance. It's been around forever! This is no new advancement. We don't suddenly have the technology. I think it is simply an attempt to pull further away from the competition in order to technologically cripple them. The plan isn't to make better movies, it's to train viewers to expect something that your everyday Robert Rodriguez with a camcorder and a wheelchair can't deliver.

That being said, good looking 3d is incredible, and I truly believe that it is one more step in the direction we have been going. Will it improve cinema? No. Will it make it more engaging? Yes.

Every aspect of filmmaking is incredible in each of his films, and work in a wonderful balance to flesh out the script. There Will Be Blood is one of my all time favorites for this very reason.

That being said, I didn't like the Master. I thought it was boring and dull, and this, for me, snuffed out my engagement in any sort of analysis of the film. I do not want to full-on gauge this movie, since I've only seen it once, but I want to hear what y'all think. 

Did you find it dull or boring? Even if you loved it, but did find it dull, is this acceptable?

I think film exists as one of the greatest of art forms because of its ability to expose more of our senses at once to more fully draw us into a story. When I think of the films I find to be great, it's a mixture of subtext and engaging action (not explosive action, visual action). I think TWBB is a perfect example of this. The cinematography, mise en scene and music drive the script in such an enticing way. It can be quiet and serene, yet you're engaged as the script goes along and relish in these moments, just as you do in the loud, action-heavy scenes. A delicate balance of eye candy and immersion in dialogue that slowly piques our interest takes you from the start to leaving you in a daze afterwards.

I don't ever want to pigeon-hole myself into a way of thought, but when it comes to film, I honestly think that seemingly aimless, convoluted scripts can quickly derail and destroy beautiful filmmaking aesthetics. I found the acting performances to be stellar in the Master, but that alone doesn't mean that I'm interested in what's going on. The script's roadmap was punishing to the overall story IMO, there was never a time where I was hooked into the action enough to wonder what was coming next in the tale.

I need to see it again, definitely. Before I cast a generally final opinion, I want to take it in and see if I see something different. I remember when I saw it the first time, I honestly tuned out because I was so unengaged. I used to think the basic three act structure and film formula was annoying, which it can be in the majority of instances. However, I now find that the most successful, thought-provoking films never stop riding the formula backbone, but spiral around it giving us a base to see the beauty of the story. For me, the master failed at providing the foundation necessary to engage in the story.

1356811578.0,34,self.TrueFilm,15my72,"Today, I watched Life of Pi... (Spoilers!)",50,16,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15my72/today_i_watched_life_of_pi_spoilers/,"Having read the book, Life of Pi, a while back, I was excited to see that it had been adapted into a full-length feature film and was curious to see how closely it compared to the book. I loved the concept of Pi's story, but found Martel's writing to be a bit dull in style and hard to plow through at times. The film is much more invigorating and I believe that Ang Lee definitely brought the story to life in an incredible way.

For those of you who have not seen or read the book, the story is of a young, highly-spiritual boy named Pi who is traveling on a cargo ship with his family from India to Canada to find a new life. During the trip, a terrible storm occurs and Pi's faith (simultaneously Muslim, Christian, and Hindu) is tested as he loses his family and is forced to survive in a small boat with a Bengal tiger, an orangutan, a hyena, and a zebra. 

Life of Pi is a beautiful example of telling a story visually. Every scene is stunning and vibrant, which came as a surprise to me, as I watched it in 3-D. I generally do not care for 3-D films at all; they are expensive, unnecessary, dull the colors, and give me headaches. However, Lee uses over-the-top 3-D effects sparingly and allows minimal 3-D usage to give the film a more realistic feeling - the entire reason why 3-D was introduced into the cinema to begin with. 

My favorite visual aspect is the way that Lee uses water in the film. The scene where Pi is playing with the bioluminescent phytoplankton is one of my favorite scenes in the entire film for how beautiful and rich the water looked. It has a very ethereal feeling, like you could jump into it and come up to the surface as a new person. I also admire the way the carnivorous island was portrayed in the film. It very much reminded me of the Garden of Eden because of its fullness and promise that it gave to Pi and Richard Parker. 

I loved Pi as a character in the book because he came off as meek, but wise beyond his years. I was extremely impressed with Suraj Sharma as an actor because although he did not match up with my vision of Pi, I felt that he did created a believable and relatable character. I was awed by how natural his passion for God came off in many scenes, specifically when he is standing and screaming up to the heavens.

On that note, I was a little disappointed by how Lee handled Pi's religious beliefs. Compared to the novel, the film does not go into as much depth as I would have liked to see about Pi's faith, however, I understand that bringing that into a film is very tricky. I would like to have seen Pi's Muslim belief talked about in greater detail. Hinduism was highly emphasized in the India scenes, and Christianity was emphasized on the boat, but I feel that Muslim got left out quite a bit. Pi's handling religions was shown well, though, which I admire because it is my favorite aspect of Pi's personality. He not only tolerates other religions, but he is fascinated and appreciative of them (like the interaction with the Buddhist man eating rice and gravy).

I enjoyed the addition of the unnamed writer to the film because I felt that it gave Pi an opportunity to explain things that would have taken too long, or been too much trouble, to show visually. I also was pleased that Lee kept the ending of the film true to the novel in that the viewer is able to choose which story they believe in. I think it amplifies the faith versus logic theme that had been running through the story, as whichever side that the viewer believes in is largely dependent on their beliefs. One who believes in a God will believe in the tiger story, where as one who does not will blame Pi's ridiculous story on starvation-induced hallucinations.

Overall, I felt that Ang Lee produced an excellent adaptation of Life of Pi, and I would highly recommend it to everyone, regardless of age, gender, religion, or personal taste. Even as a die-hard thriller fanatic, I found it to be an impeccable story with great visual elements. **9/10.**",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_15my72,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15my72/today_i_watched_life_of_pi_spoilers/,

1354425454.0,34,self.TrueFilm,1450ky,A lot of people are praising 'Silver Linings Playbook.'  Allow me to offer a dissenting opinion.  (Spoilers),75,41,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1450ky/a_lot_of_people_are_praising_silver_linings/,"I've talked about this a lot and thought about it a lot over the past few days, and I've listened to other people's opinion and read some positive reviews in an attempt to find something I might have missed.  But nothing has changed.

The problem with the film, for me, all has to do with the screenplay.  Nothing else in the film is lacking, but with a screenplay as flawed as it is, nothing else in the film can go beyond 'good,' resulting in a final product that is mediocre and dull.

Now I've gotten some pretty heavy flack for saying this.  People really seem to enjoy it, and people seem to be having positive experiences while watching it.  But this is not a critique of those experiences -- nor is it a critique of David O'Russell as a whole, or even as a writer -- it's a critique of this particular script.

Here are the things I thought were problematic:

1. Exposition - Throughout the film, characters say exactly what they are thinking.  There is a complete lack of subtext and subtlety.  Robert De Niro flat out tells his son that the reason he wants to watch football with him is to reconnect with him (although it's worth noting that there doesn't seem to be any disconnect to begin with).  Characters spend scenes talking about what they are going to do in forthcoming scenes, and even talk about what they've already done in previous scenes.  This violates a very basic rule of filmmaking -- **show, don't tell.**  Every character is guilty of this kind of dialogue, and it's borderline insulting to the intelligence of the audience, who would be able to figure all this stuff out without being led by the hand.

**NOTE: That's not to say that characters can't say what they're feeling.  Obviously, that's essential.  But when characters say what they're feeling and they are also stating the obvious, that's when it's bad.  In the case of this film, De Niro's little bedside speech was stating the obvious, as was his final line.  These lines were not only obvious to the audience, but to the character he was addressing, as well, making them doubly useless and that much more detrimental to the film.** 

2. Conflict - In damn near all films and literature, and indeed life, conflict is something that slowly grows.  Perfect example would be a film like Polanski's *Carnage,* where these four characters begin with pleasantries and end up hating each other.  Or Saura's *La Caza (The Hunt*, when a group of hunters go out as friends and end up hunting each other.  Thousands of years of drama have proven this to be effective and satisfying for an audience -- a slow build of tension and conflict, culminating in a climax that allows a release, and leads to some sort of resolution.  *Silver Linings Playbook* has none of this.  The characters routinely just start yelling at each other, or have outbursts.  The conflict spikes, completely blindsiding the viewer, and burns out.  It comes off as unmotivated, poorly planned, and unrealistic.

3. Consequences and Stakes - The film has none of this.  It begins with Bradley Cooper being released from a mental institution on a type of probation, but throughout the film, there's no real threat of him being returned.  De Niro's character says that he lost his job, presumably to create some financial stakes, (because he's a gambler), yet the family lives a comfortable suburban life, and there's no evidence of financial hardship.  Nothing to do with medical bills, nothing to do with the fact that Cooper has lost his job and is unemployed for the duration of the film, nothing at all.   Cooper's character has nothing to lose.  His wife was cheating on him, which made him angry, which put him in the mental institution, which brought us to the opening of the film.  Since then, she's moved away, quit her job, and taken out a restraining order.  He can't lose her anymore.  Jennifer Lawrence's character pursues him romantically from the moment they first meet, so there are no stakes there either (clearly he won't lose her, because she's obviously in love with him.)  There's no threat of legal repercussions, either, even though a cop character is prominently featured in the film.  (He's always there when the story needs him, and it's just unrealistic.)  The most egregious error in this regard is a scene at a football stadium where Cooper gets into a fist fight with a group of hooligans.  Everything leading up to that point has been saying that, if he gets violent, he'll be sent back to the mental institution.  Yet after the fist fight, he returns home with his friends and the entire thing is forgotten. The same thing happens with all of the other moments of conflict.  He and his dad start punching each other in the face, and the next morning they haven't changed (I'm not saying there had to be a 'scene of reconciliation,' but these characters continued like nothing had happened at all.)  There's that all-too-common scene where Cooper 'lets down the girl' (he's supposed to be practicing dancing with Lawrence), and even though she was adamant about how important it was to her, she doesn't react strongly and that, too, is forgotten.  There's a scene where Cooper is telling his friend that he needs to fix his broken marriage, and the friend says ""I know"" and the scene is over.  Apparently Cooper and his brother are supposed to have some sort of rivalry as well (his brother is the favorite), but this is only addressed in a line of dialogue, and never referenced again.  Lawrence's character gets mad at Cooper's character time and again, and they always end up ignoring it in the end. 

4. Dialogue - It's just bad, mostly because of the above points.  Most of the jokes fall flat, the emotional segments don't work because you don't care about the characters, and the dialogue just doesn't flow right.

5. Characters - The characters haven't been properly developed, and none of them really change, because there was nothing truly defining them to begin with.  The film seems to confuse 'quirkiness' with 'depth.'  Cooper is eccentric and socially inappropriate, which allows for a few laughs, but that's it.  Lawrence's character is eccentric and socially inappropriate, and that's it.  De Niro's character is eccentric and even less developed than his character in *Meet The Parents.*  Chris Tucker is a token black guy whose sole purpose is comic relief and to teach Cooper and Lawrence how to dance with soul.  There are also far too many characters.  In what's supposed to be a small family drama, you have 12 characters.  Cooper, his mother, his father, his brother, his father's friend, Lawrence, her sister, her brother-in-law, Cooper's ex-wife, the cop, the psychologist, and Chris Tucker.  It just doesn't work.

6. Transparency - the film is full of moments that are so clearly engineered by the writer and director to create more 'drama,' with many parts only existing to advance the plot.  The biggest example of this is the ending.  Shortly before the final sequence, De Niro's character doubles a bet with a friend on a Eagles vs Cowboys game.  Coincidentally, that game takes place on the same day that Cooper and Lawrence are supposed to compete in a dance competition.  For no reason at all, the bet becomes a double-bet, where the Eagles need to win and Cooper/Lawrence need to score at least a 5 in the competition.  The scene discussing this goes on for so much longer than it should have because it's so unnecessarily convoluted, but the biggest problem is that it's entirely unmotivated, and it's an obvious attempt to add a bit more drama to the final sequence.

7. Bi-Polar Disorder - now what a lot of people are saying is that these poorly written characters are the result of bi-polar disorder.  That they act erratically because of their disease.  I could buy this if the film accurately portrayed bi-polar disorder, but it doesn't.  Cooper's ""bi-polar"" disorder is pretty much non-existent.  He found his wife naked in the shower with another man, listening to the song from their wedding.  He ended up beating the other guy up badly enough to be committed.  Is this insane behavior?  Not really.  Happens all the time in movies.  He shows no real exterior symptoms other than some funny, quirky ones.  Same can be said of Lawrence.  Her husband died, and she fucked a bunch of co-workers to fill the void, and ended up getting fired.  Depression takes many forms, and it's somewhat understandable.  Her symptoms are also funny and quirky, with a few 'emotional' ones because she's a woman.  Both of their disorders are trivialized to the point that they can be fixed in the span of the two-hour movie.  And in doing so, O'Russell loses his right to have the form of the writing reflect the content of the story (and that shouldn't be done in the script phase to begin with because the audience isn't bi-polar).

The final result is a film that has a bunch of quirky scenes with people acting differently in social situations.  I found no substantial dramatic, romantic, or comedic content, and I felt that the film fell flat in every single way.  

And I'm not the only one who doesn't like it.  [David Denby](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/silver_linings_playbook_russell?currentPage=all) and [Richard Brody](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/11/the-book-on-silver-linings-playbook.html), both of *The New Yorker,* panned it.  

It was just messy and seemed hastily pieced together.  A bunch of disjointed scenes that didn't fit into a whole, and a cast of characters whose sole purpose is to get the film from point A to point B.  It just came off as disingenuous, fake, and, had the pacing been improved, formulaic.

But I think it may be Kubrick's worst film, and honestly I think it is a bad film all around. The only thing I got from it was that it was showing the absurdity of war, especially the Vietnam War. I think the main tool he used was that whole John Wayne impression people did in the movie. It gave this kind of kids pretending to be cowboys fighting indians against the backdrop of war. Which while novel and does the job, I really really disliked this, but I will put this as the positive of the film for the novelty.The film also had some good cinematography.

The film itself had so many shortcomings to me that overshadow everything else. The Acting. Oh god the acting. The acting was utterly atrocious, I at times think it must be a joke. There are these like small pauses between lines often that seem like the actors are trying to think of what to say. The dialogue itself was atrocious. There was no depth to the dialogue. It was words just for words sake most of the time.

A lot of the scenes have so little meaning, and have no impact on the story I feel they had no point. A few particular scenes really stand out here. One is the scene where the prostitute comes up. It is full of bad dialogue and no real point. They use it to make a joke about the size of black men's penises. In another they spend all this time on showing a cameraman filming troops to have people throw out witty one liners. But why? There is no point. They do nothing with this, the next scene they are gone and it may as well have never happened. In another they have this big thing about propaganda in the reporting office, with some nice monologues, but why? They never reference it again. There is no reason for it, they may as well have had a narrator because the only reason is apparently for a jab at the government in Vietnam. So many scenes seem to be there because it would be kind of cool, or because that is what vietnam war movies have.

The only good scenes in the entire moviewere the scenes with the Private Pyle and the Drill Instructor. The bootcamp part was pretty well done, but the climax between Pyle and the Instructor happens way to early as it then takes out the only interesting characters in the film.

While I haven't seen all of his films, I have viewed Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle recently. There is definitely something I want to make clear right away: the animation is the most beautiful I've seen, and in that right the accolades are well deserved.

While the worlds he creates are enchanting and engaging, I usually don't connect with the characters on an emotional level. Perhaps at the beginning of Spirited Away, I was reminded of that loneliness that permeates childhood, and I related in that way, but then the film went in so many different directions that it was a whirlwind of eye candy. I think my main problem can be summed up this way: random quirkiness does not equal depth (that's a problem I have with Amelie and some Wes Andersen films). After me and my friend finished Spirited Away, we first discussed the plot and how sporadic the beats were. I understand that Miyazaki doesn't direct simple yarns, and that he focuses on using ""moodiness as mood"" to engage the viewer in this foreign world, but all I felt during the film was incoherence. It bothered me how the main antagonist of Howl's Moving Castle was tossed aside half-way through, and not a second thought was given to her. Where's the arc? Where's the character development?

Don't misunderstand me... I love surrealist cinema (focus on mood instead of plot), and I appreciate childhood wonder. In fact, Miyazaki deserves tons of praise just for bringing his visions to life in beautiful detail (it blows my mind that studios budget millions of dollars to make these eccentric films a reality). But alas, I hear the famous stories of John Lasseter watching his films whenever he is in a creative funk, and becoming magically inspired--and I never felt that.

",43,13,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/x5huq/digging_deeper_into_male_archetypes_or_why_i_like/,"So, as I watched Bedazzled, a personal favorite of mine as a kid, I noticed something: there seems to be an archetype in film. The archetype is this, a man who starts out as a no body, very low and pathetic (socially awkward penguin). However, do to a magic element he gets some sort of power, but the power is not necessary beneficial. In the end, the man overcomes that power and becomes a self-actualized, functioning individual, better than who he was before. And he gets the girl too!

In Bedazzled, Eliot Richards is pathetic. He sells his soul to the devil for 7 wishes, but the wishes do not work as he intends. In the end, he learns to not be so selfish, and he gets a girl, not the girl, but a girl. 

In Yes Man, we have Carl, who is a negative naysayer, who will do nothing. When he attends a self-help seminar, he makes a covenant, and magically, he must say yes to everyone. In the end, he learns to be open to knew experiences, and he gets the girl. 

In Stranger than Fiction, Harold Crick is a tax auditor who has know social life. Magically, a narrator starts narrating his life, and when the narrator says he is going to die, Harold doesn't know what to do. He slowly opens up to life, and in the end, he gets the girl. 

I think the reason I like this archetype so much is because, like Twilight, its escapist. A lot of people are not their ideal selves, and they dream of living up to their potential. I know as a man, when I watch these films I get to live vicariously through them, and I can apply their Carpe Diem lifestyle to my own. 

Although these films are not masterpieces (although Stranger than Fiction might be my favorite movie), they at least have some merit for this archetype. Does anybody else have other examples. 

I think Dan in Real Life is another example as well. Although Dan in Real Life has no magical element, except coincidence.

1341695055.0,35,self.TrueFilm,w6ycd,Let's talk about Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup! (1966),38,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/w6ycd/lets_talk_about_michelangelo_antonionis_blowup/,"So I saw the film a couple of months ago, and it ended up being one of the most intriguing films I've ever seen. The message was really clouded and not easy to understand on this one, being a mystery like the one in the plot, in my opinion.

Some interesting things that I noted:

Antonioni's cinematographical footprint is really unique. For example, the scene where Thomas is in the park, taking pictures of the couple. In one shot the camera is filming from above, so a couple of trees, grass and Thomas can be seen. There is no wind at all, so the trees don't move and the camera also stays still. With only Thomas moving in the shot, it looks like a living picture, rather than a film. 
Shots like this can also be seen in Professione: reporter (The Passenger, 1975) which is also one of my favourite films.

The second idea is about the point (SPOILERS), which I'm not sure about, at all. The whole movie, I was waiting for the idea to emerge that the director is trying to amplify. I didn't see anything too powerful until the end, where Thomas throws the ball back to the mimes and then disappears. Later, when thinking about it, I drew some weird line between the somewhat missing idea of the movie, and the plot. Through the plot, the protagonist was trying to solve the mystery of the photograph, which is essentially the same as trying to understand the idea behind a film - both are solving a piece of art. When he finally got there, the body was missing, and the mystery had no conclusion. Maybe it's the same as the idea of the film having no conclusion, with Thomas just vanishing?
I might be really wrong and thinking too much about it, but shoot at me with your ideas!

If you haven't seen this film and plan on doing so, this isn't the thread for you.

---


I watched [Leon \(1994\)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/) last night on the back of some strong recommendations and reviews, and yet I completely fail to see the appeal to it. 

First, the positives. I thought all the acting was impressive: Natalie Portman gives a very impressive performance, regardless of her age; considering this was her debut, it's even more striking. Jean Reno, whilst understated, was good although there was not a huge development: he goes from keeping Mathilda distant to telling her he loves her with no obvious change in character; whether this is down to the script or the acting is up for debate. Gary Oldman was obviously having a lot of fun with his character, and he really hams it up.

The story and concept  was good: an action film with a twist, a hitman with a soul. Though not unique to this film, it's still an interesting area to explore.





Now, the negatives. The direction seemed to completely ignore the fact they were in New York. The film opens with a swooping shot of the city and closes with a panorama of the Manhattan skyline, yet in between it disregards the setting, except for the scene of the sniper training in Central Park. Why set a film in such an iconic setting if you're only going to ignore it? The sense of Leon's isolation in a sprawling metropolis doesn't come across because we don't know he's in this metropolis for most of the film, it's completely ignored.

Secondly, the soundtrack was awful, to the point of being detrimental to the film. Instead of heightening the mood, it told you what emotions to feel: this bit's fun because there's an accordion! This bit's sad because there's violins! This bit's cheeky because the music's jaunty! It was telling you rather than showing, it was very poor.

Having previously praised Natalie Portman's performance, I was extremely uncomfortable with her on screen. I read that Liv Tyler was considered for the role but wasn't picked because she was 15, which was too old. This to me makes no sense: Mathilda isn't portrayed as a child, other than she watches cartoons. She is an adult character with adult sexuality, and yet she is a 12 year old girl. Now there are interesting films about the sexualisation of children, but this just presented her as an adult and didn't deal with it. Are we just supposed to accept that she wants to have a relationship with Leon? 

The most uncomfortable I felt was during the dress-up scene (which in itself is completely out of place with the rest of the film); her impression of Marilyn Monroe is portrayed as fun and flirty, with a bouncy accordion keeping the mood light, but is, in essence, a 12 year old kid acting sexy with a late-30s man, and I found that extremely uncomfortable.

My biggest problem was that it doesn't seem to know what kind of film it is: is it an action film with a bit of romance? Is it a romance film with a bit of action? Is it an investigation of the sexuality of children? Is it about a hitman with a soul? All of these threads are present, but none of them are investigated properly.  Ultimately I think there were two or three good films in there, but they were all avoided for a deeply unsatisfying film that didn't make any of the points it tried to.

In fact, I like it less now that I've seen something that tackles the same issues, but what I believe is superior.

Woody Allen's *Stardust Memories.*  Obviously, it owes a debt to Fellini and Bergman.  It's about a film director (played by Allen) who is coping with what his audience expects of him.  The director in the film is one who originally made straight comedies, but moved on to more dramatic films (just like Allen.)  

It has flashbacks similar to what's seen in *8 1/2*, but I think it's superior just because it's united by a much more cohesive narrative, an element that I consider to be the most important and integral aspect of any film.

One of the roles mentioned as cementing him as ""the real deal"" was his portrayal of Amsterdam Vallon in Gangs of New York. It reminded me that, although I loved the dialogue, acting (DDL was brilliant in that movie, possibly second only to himself in There Will Be Blood in my opinion) and cinematography in that film I couldn't get past the constant conflict between whether the film was set antebellum New York or some alternate universe that was eerily analogous to antebellum New York. I felt distracted by the historical inaccuracies (in dress, technology, the ""Gang Warfare"") to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie.

However, another film that certainly departs greatly from history that I love is Inglorious Basterds. I believe this to be because, although the premise and conclusion were ludicrous, the aesthetics of the movie felt like a WW2 movie. It's plot and dialogue weren't as good as Gangs, but because the visual cues felt ""truer"" I preferred the movie as a whole.

What do you think?,35,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/n3d1y/i_made_a_schedule_for_this_months_film/,"Since we didn't get much of a chance to explore the theme of revolution in November, I thought it would be nice to continue it through December.

Metropolis won the [recent vote](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/mt3ew/vote_on_a_film_with_the_theme_of_revolution_to/) we had for a film to discuss under the theme, and we'll be discussing in a thread it Thursday (Dec. 8th).

The vote was the closest one we've had yet, it also seemed to be pretty polarized, with a lot of things being downvoted. I think I've come up with a solution that *should* please the advocates of all the top films. 

I've created a schedule for this month that will allow us to discuss pretty much all the most popular films. 

**The discussion schedule for this month:**

Thur -  **12/8** - [Metropolis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/) (changed from the 7th)

Thur - **12/15** - [Battleship Potemkin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/)

Sat. - **12/17** - [Grin Without A Cat](http://icarusfilms.com/new2001/grin.html)

Tues - **12/20** - [Z](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065234/)

Thur - **12/22** - [Duck, You Sucker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067140/)

Tues - **12/27** - [Marat/Sade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marat/Sade_%28film%29)

Thur - **12/29** - [1900](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074084/) (This film is 5 hrs. 17 min. long. That's why I put it at the end of the month. Keep the length in mind when you're planning time to watch it.)

For more information on the films we'll be watching and discussing, check out the [last vote](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/mt3ew/vote_on_a_film_with_the_theme_of_revolution_to/), where users used their own words to describe their suggestions.

This is kind of an experiment. I doubt it will be easy for everyone to contribute to the discussion on every film listed, but this way you can pick and choose what you want to watch/discuss. It *will* save us from having votes over and over again with many of the same films being mentioned. We can also see pretty far ahead of time when the film will be discussed, which will give us more time to watch them.

I'm not sure if I'll do something like this next month, or if we'll continue to have a vote every week. It might even end up being better to just have only two film discussions a month... we'll see how this goes.

I'll try to get this schedule posted in the sidebar and as a banner, if possible.

The schedule/film order is open to change if the community wants it (at least for the next day or two). As always, I'd love your input. Let me know if you have some issue with the dates, how it's organized, or anything else.

**Edit:** I talked with Nixon, the other mod, and we have decided to **delay the posting of the Metropolis thread until December 8th**. This will give those of you who are just finding out about it a chance to view the film.

**Edit2:** I've decided to delay the Potemkin discussion until December 12th. In addition to the youtube version listed in the comments, you can also download a free, remastered, copy of the film [here](http://www.archive.org/details/ApskaftPresentsTheBattleshipPotemkin)

**Edit3:** I'm once again delaying the Grin Without a Cat discussion until 12/17. This will allow the Potemkin one to grow a little more and will also allow me a bit more time to construct a few good discussion prompts and research the film more myself. Hopefully you guys don't mind waiting another day for a higher quality post. I'm also changing the Marat/Sade discussion to the 27th. I admittedly bit off a bit more than I could chew with all these films, but it still looks like I'll be able to cram them all into this month.",,False,,t5_2szp0,True,,,True,t3_n3d1y,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/n3d1y/i_made_a_schedule_for_this_months_film/,moderator

&gt;**William Friedkin**: For years, I did. But then I became conscious of a story about a post-impressionist painter whose works hung in the Louvre while he was alive and living in France. When he was in his 60s or 70s, he went into the Louvre one day with a small palette and some brushes and started to paint over one of his canvasses. Most of the filmmakers that I know have the same impulse. I would redo all of my films if I had the chance, because to some extent I've changed my attitude about a lot of the way I used to make films.""

There are the George Lucas's and Steven Speilbergs who go back and tamper with their films just because they can. And then there are some filmmakers whose work the studio interferes with and the filmmaker is never able to see their true vision out. 

Recently, Guillermo del Toro went back and re-worked Mimic into his 'Director's Cut' for the blu-ray release. Yet, inexplicably, he stays with the cheesy, terrible ending that was shot after poor reception of the original ending by test audiences. Perhaps the footage for the original ending was destroyed? Ridley Scott continued to tinker around with Blade Runner even after the Director's Cut. As far as I can tell from scanning over a list of differences, there's nothing too drastic that's changed, mostly just some Lucas-esque 'now that I can afford to cover up the shortcomings of the dated effects' and minor line alterations.

I know that for me personally, there are a few films that I would LOVE to see re-worked by the filmmaker into as close as possible to their original vision. Darren Aronofsky has suggested he may re-work The Fountain to try to make it closer to what he intended. Although I do enjoy The Fountain as it is, I'd be very interested to see what he would change.

Do you think it's always wrong for a filmmaker to, per se, go into the Louvre and re-paint their masterpiece? Is it different simply if it's tinkering that the fans give their stamp of approval to?

***Edit:*** Good discussion so far, but I'd like to probe a little deeper now. 

&gt;**William Friedkin**: But the audience is right. They’re always, always right. You hear directors complain that the advertising was lousy, the distribution is no good, the date was wrong to open the film. I don’t believe that. The audience is never wrong. Never.

Do you agree that the audience is always right? What about when the audience can't seem to make up it's mind? As an example, the I Am Legend test audiences hated the original ending. So it was changed. Then audiences hated the new ending. After the original ending was released on the DVD as a bonus supplement a large number of people all said ""Yeah, actually that original ending was way better."" More or less the same thing happened with Mimic, Little Shop of Horrors, Australia, The Golden Compass and many other films.

Sadly, it was not the disaster I was hoping it would be. Not to say that it was good, but it definitely was not among the worst films I had ever seen. Lindsay Lohan actually had genuine moments of good acting, but the script was all over the place in terms of quality, which is what I think caused its ultimate downfall.  James Deen was always better when he did not talk. The film contained too many wide shots, and not enough variety of angles, which was how I could feel the editing problems surrounding this film prior to release.

This leads me to Kickstarter. As many of you know, this film was funded in part by a Kickstarter campaign. This preceded *Veronica Mars*, Zach Braff, and now Spike Lee's use of the site to acquire funding for projects. *The Canyons* raised over $150,000. Though a large sum, it is much smaller than any of the previous projects mentioned. My question is what happens when people are thoroughly dissatisfied with the final project, especially when even more money is involved? These are not nobodies making these films, these types of projects have well-respected and famous people working on them.

Lastly, *The Canyons* has some commentary on the current state of cinematic exhibition. The film opens with shots of deserted theaters and is punctuated with pictures of them as inter-titles to separate the days in the film. Lohan's character asks the question, ""When's the last time you saw a movie you really thought meant something to you?"" She further explains that she does not mean attending a film's premiere party and that it had to happen in a theatre, not at home (which provides some great irony that this film will primarily be seen through VOD).

I know Lucas and Spielberg recently said that going to the movies will be like going to Broadway or a professional sporting event with tickets around $50 and internet TV will be the future of smaller projects. I feel like *The Canyons* reinforces that point. Even though it was publicly funded (for the most part), it still will have an extremely limited release due to its poor quality. So, will Kickstarter hasten or halt cinema's too big to fail schemes for theatrical exhibition?

It's based on an absurd, yet true story of three Florida bodybuilders who get caught up in a kidnapping ring that turns tragic. In typical Bay style. it's gaudy, raunchy, offensive, full of gratuitous shots of naked bodies...

but it's also probably the smartest movie he's ever made.

Watching it, I couldn't help but feel some sort of Jekyll and Hyde like battle going on between flashy Michael Bay, and some quieter persona that we've never seen before. Some scenes in the film, particularly the one in which Tony Shaloub's character figures out Mark Wahlberg is his kidnapper was pretty well directed. Same goes for the scene where Mark Wahlberg accidentally kills the porn king with the dumbell. I also loved the way the exposition scene with Wahlberg's character was handled.

On the other hand though, there was the usual styilistic camera shots, 360 pans, gratutitous Miami things I mentioned earlier, but it felt like a grown-up story, and one that showed that maybe, just maybe if he put his mind to it, Bay could create a decent crime thriller.

However I did have a slightly and tiny gripe with the film. Its considering the overall ending of the film or the final act of the film, where Plainview is shown gone mad, lonely, and secluded in his giant Californian mansion. My problem is that I felt it was a little forced into the entire movie. Everything that I liked and enjoyed about the movie is clearly there in the final act, yet the overall scene and character development does a feel a little forced and out of place, what I wanted was a little more character development. Am I alone in this, did you think the movie is perfect as is and does not need more?

And another discussion I would like to encourage is what makes this movie American? All of the praise that I've seen, seems to mention how this movie is the best American film.

While his influence is well known, how are his movies? Are they strong enough to stand the test of time? 

Probably his best known movie is **The Birth of a Nation**, considered to be the greatest movie at the time. This movie is often acclaimed for its revolutionary techniques, but it's often ridiculed for it portraying the KKK in a positive light.

[Link to Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzXYPJAGkg)

Finally, his last movie he is widely known for is the 1919 film **Broken Blossoms**. While not considered as epic as Intolerance, or as groundbreaking as Birth of a Nation, it's still considered one of the best movies of the 1910's.

[Link to Broken Blossoms on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_8T82GnC5M)

I wrote this up on my blog, but I'll copy/pasta here for convenience. 

And MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT for everything below.

Upstream Color can be viewed through the directors lens thanks to having witnessed three showings of the film that included Q&amp;A sessions with Shane Carruth.

He seems to think of the science fiction parts of the film as a framing device. Therefore, a way to look at the film is by looking at what exists without the scifi.

Shane Carruth made it a point, at least after questioning, to discuss what he's done to these characters. He has broken them down. Their identity is challenged. Kris and Jeff are forced to deal with a series of events that are outside their understanding. Jeff owns up to his identity. He becomes that guy that embezzled a bunch of money and now works off the books. He smartly does not bring up this part of his history until after securing Kris romantically. Kris too assumes her new identity as that crazy chick. In first meeting Jeff she purposefully brings out her two bottles of crazy pills she's prescribed.

*The worm, pig, orchid life cycle is one triplicate*. Another are the thief, the sampler, and the orchid ladies. From observation of the Q&amp;A, Carruth explained the former triplicate as, again, simply a framing device. He said it was necessary for this thing, whatever thing that's part of the life cycle that links organisms, to be something from nature. Something that persists itself. Aliens wouldn't do. I think to this Carruth was purposefully being vague in the mechanics of the linking. The how doesn't matter; only that it exists.

The latter was explained by their role in the film. The thief is pretty simple at face. He is someone that has benefitted from his knowledge of the linking. He uses this to his advantage to take advantage of seemingly random people he encounters. He serves as the negative use of the link. The orchid ladies are also pretty simple at face. They are an unaware beneficiary of the organism.

I think the most interesting person in the film is the sampler. He's the questionable beneficiary of the story. It's unclear if what he's doing is good or bad. On one side he's knowledgeable and benefitting from the linking by getting these unique windows into people's lives as an observer, unaware to the observed. On the other, he's not doing anything harmful. It's interesting to note that his link to the sampled may back feed in to the sampled as evidenced by the scene where Kris and Jeff toss items in a box over a high ledge; something the sampler did earlier. Also, when the sampler observes the husband who's wife went to the hospital the keyboard playing is mimicked by the husband as the sampler plays. A final example, the scenes in which the sampler is doing audio sampling are mixed between scenes of Kris and Jeff being awash in the sounds of their daily routines; the sounds are very similar between cuts, perhaps demonstrating the link.

Color comes in to play quite a bit. I believe I heard Carruth or a member of the audience mention something about the color blue being correlated with control. Yellow and orange come up as well and are are referenced in Walden as well. Be sure to check the song titles of the soundtrack as well.

The sound is an entire beast of its own to dissect. I will say that it stands alone quite well. Having walked through Central Park with it coursing through my ears made for its own adventure.

Another thing to note is Kate's false victory at the end. It's absolutely hilarious that she got the wrong man. The sampler was just an observer. The man that really wronged her was the thief; but she has no knowledge of this. Only the audience does. So there she is at the end of the film, unable to have children, embracing this little piglet that may not return the love she's giving to a similar degree.
The characters are as linked together as the plot is linked to the framing of the scene as the audio is linked to the characters and so forth.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1cglvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cglvu/upstream_color_after_three_viewings_and_qa/,

I don't worship him, but The Thin Red Line and The New World are two of my favorite films. I like his newer work more than his older work, because it seems that he has been allowed to explore more of his own unique style- fractured narratives, sparcity of dialog, amidst other trademarks more than his old films. But with that said (and having only seen TTW once) I did not really connect to it, even though it is really the most ""Malickian"" movie yet in the films he's directed.
   
There will be spoilers herein: The film is very very sparse in plot or character development. You don't learn anyone's name and I can't remember if Affleck even said a line the entire movie. You get the general idea of things from the movie- that they're in love and that they moved to the US. Nothing is spelled out. Dialog often trails off or is unimportant. Characters sit out of frame. There are some beautiful moments that remind me of things in my own life or things that I have felt before, but it is all very vague, very fleeting and there are a lot of moments of her(I don't know the characters name) just dancing in the fields or in the grocery store or staring sadly. It is very beautiful, but even as a Malick fan, I found myself getting bored after an hour and not much happening. I felt that even though there was no story and little dialog in Tree of Life, there were characters and meaning there, but this had little to hold my interest.

Of course, this will take some time to digest and perhaps another viewing but right now, although I am glad I Watched the movie, it is clearly my least favorite of his. Any other thoughts?

While film is actually both(as well as a musical medium), you often hear ""the book is better"" when people talk about film and I wonder why this is and why the story and dialog are placed above ambience and cinematography by some.   
    
It was maybe a post or perhaps a video I saw a few weeks back that discussed how modern movies were becoming more and more spectacle and visually driven than ever before. Although the visual influence of film has always been there, earlier silent movies and golden age movies were closer to the stage and radio plays. I feel like movies over time have focused less on the plot and more on the spectacle.    
   
Modern directors as diverse as Zack Snyder, Terrence Malick and Stanley Kubrick are/were very strong visual directors. While there are some directors who place a big emphasis on visuals with very little semblance of meaning to them(think Mtv jump cuts), the subtlety of Kubrick's shots is astounding and filled with meaning as are Malicks, PTA's or any number of very strong visual directors.   
   
While there are still writer/directors out there who I feel are very litereary(Woody Allen comes to mind), I don't think that necessarily makes them better, just different. My personal tastes lead me to the more visual directors, from Fritz Lang and German expressionists to David Lean and Malick, I don't know if that's necessarily better. The modern empty-spectacle of action movies doesn't interest me, but I believe there is a lot to be said wiuthout saying anything.

1364840948.0,32,self.TrueFilm,1bfs62,Watching **bad** film in order to better appreciate good film: Just watched 'The Fourth Kind'. Discuss?,46,14,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1bfs62/watching_bad_film_in_order_to_better_appreciate/,"I am rarely compelled to watch 'bad' movies, and I admittedly didn't know I'd consider 'The Fourth Kind' a bad movie until I started it, but I think it is and I finished watching it to attempt to analyze why I think it's *so* bad. I was compelled to write my immediate impressions down after viewing last night and this morning:

The Fourth Kind:

At the outset Mila Jovovich addresses the audience and indicates that the following film is based on true events and that any depicted scene in the feature is based entirely upon video or audio footage, and that, furthermore, actual video/audio footage will be used during the film to depict the drama unfolding. She than goes on to give a brief synopsis of the drama that will be told.

Immediately, I'm pulled out of the framework of the narrative. Immediately I'm beginning to think to myself ""is this a documentary? is this a 'based on true events' film? Why is the lead actress addressing me and imploring the factual and realistic nature of this story, completely shattering the fourth wall?' I'm confounded, I'm becoming very rapidly biased towards this movie, of which I've seen virtually zero actual film of. Methinks this is not good.

Why in the hell would you attempt to dupe your audience into believing that the film you're presenting to them is not only based on true events, but is also going to use 'found' footage, and edit that into the dramatized narrative when that footage is very obviously not the definite article? Footage which, at even a cursory glance, if taken as legitimate, would shake the foundations of not only the religious/supernatural crowd but unquestionably the scientific community at large? The mere fact that the footage, if legitimate, would undoubtedly cause such shock waves, (and yet clearly did not), is a major factor in pulling the viewer out of the narrative experience. Don't write checks your ass can't cash. The film completely breaks down when the viewer, rather rapidly realizes, that this is a farce, a fabricated reality built to attempt to add legitimacy to supernatural legend. I mean, it absolutely derails any potential the narrative had going for it.

A documentary is a documentary: it's about something real in the real world with real people, the viewer is compelled by it based on the fact that it's a real drama, being served to them as a package presented as a genuinely real and verifiable thing. A film is a work of fiction: presented to the viewer as a fictitious story about fictitious characters in a fictitious world portrayed by actors pretending to be real, in a real world pretending to be fake. The Fourth Kind attempts to blend these two narrative styles, giving the viewer a stylized film narrative intercut with documentary style footage purporting to be real, in an attempt to add authenticity to the film narrative. And it absolutely fails. Miserably. 

To me, comparisons were immediately obvious; films which attempted to blend the dramatized film narrative with documentary style footage, which is supposedly real. 'The Blair Witch Project': a film that presents to the viewer 'found' footage of a group of students who traipsed into the North Eastern woods to make a documentary about some legendary 'Witch'. 'Paranormal Activity': a film which presents to the viewer 'found' footage of a suburban couple who begin making recordings of themselves and their home after they've become increasingly suspicious that someone or something has been in their home. Both of these films I've mentioned do one thing that 'The Fourth Kind' does not do: they present the audience something that it claims to be real and it never veers in that portrayal. Both 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Paranormal Activity' are solely 'found' footage, there's nothing else. The audience is told ""We found these recordings, check 'em out for yourselves."" And that's it, the concept is blitheringly simplistic, and there in lies they're fundamental element of success. Those films don't immediately break down through simple (and logical) analysis, the actors never break the fourth wall, I'm not being presented with a film that at times appears to be as hokey as a 'Lifetime Network' dramatized portrayal. Even though I know those films aren't real, they're attempt at authenticity at least makes the experience engaging, I can completely immerse myself into the narrative and, like any decent film, begin to loose myself in the films world. 

Conceptually 'The Fourth Kind' seems like it had potential, given the appropriate treatment it had elements that could have made it a worthwhile sci-fi/horror film. They could have even gone down the 'found' footage road and still had a potentially good horror movie, but instead they opted for what amounts to two narrative styles that completely destroy each others authenticity. How can you expect the audience to take your film seriously when Mila Jovovich addresses the audience in the opening prologue, *as* Mila Jovovich? Mila Jovovich is saying ""Hi, I'm actress Mila Jovovich . . ."" stop right there. Never ever do that, never destroy the audiences invisible wall with the film world and our own. Mila Jovovich is an actor, I'm aware of that, I'm watching a movie; but when the actors attempt to add authenticity by stepping out of their roles inside the film to address the audience it kills the immersion. So from that point on I'm watching a movie where Mila Jovovich is portraying some psychologist who you purport is real and have a fair quantity of 'actual' footage showing her dealing with all the stuff going on in the movie? Anytime Mila Jovovich is in a scene hypnotizing a patient and furthering the plot, you (the filmmakers) are going to split screen and simultaneously show me the 'actual' footage that this now obviously dramatized scene is portraying? How do they expect the audience to be compelled by this? By showing the 'real' and the 'dramatized' I'm inclined to take neither one seriously, as I can think of no reasons why this would be a conceptually good idea. The idea of portraying an alien abduction story from the perspective of a psychologist dealing with the overwhelmingly disturbing notions that her patients are showing her while under hypnosis is in itself an interesting and potentially fresh take on the whole concept. The movie really doesn't need any actual aliens, or gore, or staple horror effects. The horror comes from those interviews with people who are only dimly aware of something ghastly, and even then only subconsciously. Why not make the whole movie found footage of the psychologists interview tapes? That at least would have been more compelling than riding this dual documentary/film concept. I mean, if you edited out anything with Mila Jovovich and Elias Koteas and Will Patton you'd have these poor quality interview tapes of patients under hypnosis giving dim details of terrible things, and than evidence of their ensuing madness. You don't attempt to explain to me why, let me work on that, you just focus on making this experience as authentic as possible. Less is more when it comes to scary. The less I know the better. The less you show the better. When the audience only has sketches and dim impressions their own imaginations will create far more horrific notions than you're going to be able to portray.

You're sitting there watching Mila Jovovich conducting an interview with a patient under hypnosis and than you split screen that with an interview tape of the exact same thing, word for word. These two things are juxtaposed; how do they make each other better? What justifies both? How is this story served better than if you just had one portrayal? Why are you bothering dramatizing a scene that you have footage of that portrays precisely what you're attempting to portray? There is no justification for both, together they make each other worse. Far worse. If you take only the dramatized footage you'd have a bad sci-fi/horror movie; but add the found footage and the interview they constantly edit into the film and the movie becomes something else, something which feels as though it's quite literally calling it's audience a bunch of blithering idiots. 

I could go on and on: how every horrific element they insert into the film is undermined by the fact that, in essence, they're telling me that this is absolutely not real. It's almost comical how in an attempt to make the movie more authentic (I guess) they've actually undermined that authenticity and made nothing in the movie feel the least bit authentic. This movie is an absolute sham. This movie fails on an elemental basis: they lost their audience from the word go.

Although it is obvious Hannibal is a villain and a psychopath he is glorified and almost idolised to the audience by the filmmakers.

What effect does this have on the audience? One could argue that it has none what so ever and that the audience can easily differentiate reality from film.

Where could I look to find out what film critics in China think of the film?  Is there a Chinese Ebert?  

From scanning a number of reviews from Metacritic, it seems like the central metaphor of the film (monsters as natural disasters like hurricanes)  just flew over the US critics' heads.  US critics talked about the film as popcorn entertainment, pointing to the robots-vs-monsters plot.  They seem to have missed that a number of scenes could be straight from news footage of the Japanese tsunami or the Chinese earthquake.  

I was absolutely floored by a dream sequence in the middle of the film:  Mako, the lead female character, is forced to revisit memories of an earlier monster attack that killed her parents.  The film's near-future, pseudo-Blade Runner, mecha-fantasy aesthetic is suddenly dropped: we are faced with a little ~~Chinese~~ Japanese girl in a blue coat, screaming in terror at the destruction around her.  Until the sea monster rears its head from behind a sky scraper, this scene could plausibly have been on the news covering ~~an earthquake~~ a tsunami (which happened ~~*earlier this year* in China~~ 2 years ago in Fukushima, Japan).   

I am disappointed that US film critics failed to see Pacific Rim as more than a summer blockbuster.  It's like examining The Avengers without acknowledging the terror attacks of 9/11.  As an American, I have a specific, gut reaction to street-level, shaky-cam shots of destruction in New York City, even when it is caused by space aliens.  There must be some comparable cultural reaction towards Pacific Rim, because it is a pretty huge hit in China, while Grown Ups 2 beat Pacific Rim at the US box office.  

Looking at those box office numbers, I don't think I am overstating the cultural resonance of this film, but I would like to know the consensus of Asian film critics.  I think Pacific Rim is worth analysis beyond its sci-fi blockbuster plot, especially when the 'mainstream' US critics seem to have missed the most basic metaphor of the film.  

Where is the best website to find out how a film is received internationally?  I'm guessing there are better review-aggregates than Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes?

It's about this serial killer roaming Japan and his exploits with women and his family. It's supposedly based on a true story but I'm not sure. The violence is unflinching and it rarely cuts away, showing the viewer every detail and mannerism in the act of murder. It's surprisingly modern in terms of camera techniques for a film from 1979, it ranges from shaky cam documentary style and long static shots. 

The main thing about it is how the director is basically just *showing* you. It shows you in detail the what, when and where (title cards pop up on victims of the serial killer explaining the time of death and the cause of death) but he never tells you WHY he is doing what he is doing. I guess this part is either left to the viewer to deduce (from his troubles with his father and mother) or it just has no relevance. **spoilers** At the end of the film his father does say to him that he only killed people who never hurt him, thus he couldn't kill his father. I'm not sure if this is an explanation or just an observation, but it serves as both I guess. 

One thing I found quite strange was the ending. **SPOILERS** The father and wife go to the top of a mountain to scatter the main character's bones, but every time they throw one, the bone remains floating in the air. At first I thought it was just a weird editing technique, and that they weren't actually floating (the frame freezes, likely a technical limitation of the 70s, can't CGI floating bones haha) but the father and wife both react to it as if it is actually happening. I'm not sure what this is symbolic of.

The structure of the film is also quite odd, using flashbacks as the majority of the film. It works though, as the flashbacks are presented in a real and gritty fashion. It definitely gave me an insight into the Japanese culture. 

I highly suggest watching this, but it might not be for everyone.

Just finished watching One Hour Photo again - great film! Very well shot, very atmospheric and really a triumph for Robin Williams in terms of his acting, IMO. It's a deeply disturbing look at the mental state one can reach because of envy and obsession.

The ending always confused me, but today I think I understand it. The plot is outlined on almost every site I've looked at as the same thing. According to them, Sy did these things to Mia and Will at the end in the hotel room but wasn't actually taking pictures of them, rather just pretending to take photos. The photo's Detective Van Der Zee shows Sy at the end must have been taken in his room before he went to Mia and Will's? That's a fair enough ending and one I've believed for years.

However, in the scene where Mia is sitting in the shower and Will has his head in his hands sitting on the bed, we're supposed to believe they're recovering from the traumatic experience Sy put them through - forcing them into sex acts etc. Mia however, doesn't have a cut on her head where Sy hit her with the door. They're clearly in shock because Will's affair with her has been outed. The fact Sy left the knife in the sink in HIS room, and all of the pictures are of an empty hotel room, says to me that the events he forced Will and Mia to do never happened. Just in his head. 

As soon as the scene in over where he forced her to give Will oral sex, he exits room 519, not 511 (which was Will and Mia's room). I now see that Sy really did steal the knife, really did take pictures of his boss' daughter, but fabricated the assault on Will and Mia in his head, a couple of rooms down from theres, so that he could relieve himself of his hatred for them.

How disadvantaged its reputation is by the circumstances in which it was made- all the discussion of the extreme lengths Herzog went to tends to overshadow the fact that the film itself is an enthralling and often brilliant work of art.

I was startled by how idealistic the film was compared to Herzog's other work, while never feeling false or trite. I think the tone is set early on, when the usher, touched by Fitz's passion, lets him into the opera- it's just a nice, sweet moment. It's the character of Fitzcarraldo that sets the film apart; he might have a screw loose, but there's such an innocence and idealism to him that we (and the other characters) admire and go along with him.

How great is Kinski in this? I don't know if it's my favourite performance of his (I find him so touching in Nosferatu- his self-loathing turning to anger in the dinner scene is perfect) but he embodies the character so well. As written he risks being a caricature of an eccentric- as played by Kinski, we never doubt him.

One thing that struck me is how it never makes hamfisted points about capitalism, either for or against. Obviously the subject matter is there; Fitzcarraldo is the capitalist hero *par excellence*; he has vision, money, and never does any labour himself- he walks around in that white suit like a plantation owner while others bring his dreams to fruition. The relationship between capital and labour is perhaps the whole point, the exploitation of the natives the source of much of the conflict an tension. But the film never devolves into commentary, marxist or neoliberal, on what is happening, something a weaker film certainly would. It asks questions rather than answers them.

The imagery- the ship being raised over the mountain, out of control on the rapids, that perfect final scene- is, and I hope you'll forgive the flowery language here (and throughout this whole thing)- unforgettable. Just a beautiful film, that really understands the medium in a way few do.

I'm not sure why it gets so much attention.  I get the impression some people are just forgiving because they think the presence of political themes(which are heavy handed and chaotic) and being foreign constitutes good horror.

However, I still believe Joon-Ho to be a fabulous director.  Memories of Murder was a fantastic film, featuring a final act, which I consider to be among the most haunting I have seen.  Mother has become one of my favorite films.  It works on so many levels for me.  The Hitchcockian mystery elements work great, but I also love the humor and insight into maternal relationships the film had.  I read reviews complaining how the film's final act kills the momentum and limps on, but I disagree wholeheartedly.  The final act is what takes the film from a *good* film to *great* one.  The emotions encapsulated in the main character coping with what she and her son did... Ah, it makes me tear up.  The final shots up the film are so perfect, conveying so much.

Fargo has from the first watch amazed me with how elegant and perfect the narrative seems; I can't quite find the word for it. Everything feels driven, almost inevitable.

Perhaps it's because in both, one scene means one thing happening. You can imagine telling the plot of Fargo in a flowchart.

Is the elegance of Fargo's narrative the result of one single factor or the interaction of many? The length is definitely a part of it, at a brisk 90 minutes. Perhaps it is the focus being purely on plot, with characters being essentially flat. Does the narrative grab us because of it's ingenuity alone? There's a purity to it, it's pure storytelling in a fairytale-ish way.

That being said,  I wanted to know if anyone can speak to the film's merits.  I know that Pasolini was considered something of a radical filmmaker in his time and that this particular film is still considered among the most gruesome and explicit ever made.  I also know that the film is supposed to be a commentary on fascism, political corruption, etc.

However,  is the explicit content of the film effective in presenting a coherent argument or set of themes?  Or is it purely an exercise in shock horror with the pretense of political commentary that critics use to justify its acclaim? Does the shocking content of the film distract from the narrative or purpose of the film?

I'm a firm believer that shocking visuals can be used in film with tremendous effects (Cronenberg and Hooper for example).  However I also realize that most directors have trouble balancing shock content with coherence as the explicit nature of some films can alienate the viewer and distract from whatever they are supposed to understand from the film.

To clarify:  I have not seen the film because it is not available to me through local libraries or online streaming.  The only access I would have to it is through buying the actual DVD or pirating it online.  I also live with my parents (I'm 19) and this would sort of be a weird thing to have them walk in on me watching... I know that's juvenile but the film sounds pretty fucking sadistic.

Going into the theater, I literally knew nothing about the film other than the image on it's poster.  I hadn't seen any trailers or commercial.  I hadn't read anything about it.  I just went in with no expectations or preconceptions.  What I saw was a film that both aroused my hope in the future of the crime film, and yet reminded me of the many, many problems good storytelling faces in the modern Hollywood system.

*2 Guns* is a film of modest ambition and in a way, that's actually kind of admirable.  Modern crime thrillers tend to inflate their worldview with dystopian paranoia.  Their heroes inhabit a deadly effective surveillance state, and must use their wits and improbable moments of happenstance to insure their survival.  The problem with this approach (other than the overwhelming same-iness it stamps on films)  is that both hero and villain become more machine than man.  *2 Guns* uses some of the same old bogeymen (the CIA, military conspiracy), but manages to do so without the accompanying paranoia.  The trials of the hero are still unbelievable, but kept (mostly) to a manageable human scale.  This is a definite step in the right direction.

Perhaps the film's greatest virtue is it's unselfconsciousness.  The direction is handled, like most modern films, with a bare minimum of style - it mostly photographs performances, paying little attention to blocking and mise-en-scene.  While it's sad to see a film of possibility handled with so little personality, had it been directed by a self-conscious stylist (a wannabe Tarantino, for instance), it could have easily been rendered an obnoxious bore like *Boondock Saints*.  (How I long for the days of the unselfconscious stylist - guys like Phil Karlson and Joseph H. Lewis who could add brilliant, subtle bits of visual direction to enhance the depth and impact of a film without being showy about it.)  What we get is a pleasingly amiable, if impersonal, film that showcases a great cast doing what they do best.  The script suffers a few flat jokes, material that borrows good bits from *Breaking Bad* and *Justified*, and characters that aren't particularly well drawn.   Yet, none of that seems to matter.  It's simply fun to watch veterans like Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg, Bill Paxton, and Edward James Olmos ham it up with genre 'types', especially when the types have a grit and brute force that recalls both Film Noir and the great crime cycle of the 1970's.  And there are a few fleeting injections of social commentary (such as a funny aside with self-appointed 'border patrol' rednecks) that aren't uninteresting.

The first 3/4th of the film stays within these modest parameters, and is likeable and entertaining, yet in the last 20 minutes the film lapses into the silly-Hollywood-soup of ridiculous explosions and pseudo-iconic posing (the circular ,back-to-back, gun firing partners shot).  You can almost hear the studio executives demanding that the film be ""punched up"".  It is at this point that the film loses all credibility, and disappointingly so because they almost had a good little crime film (albeit a flawed one).

Is it just impossible to make a gritty crime thriller of contained scale and scope in the modern Hollywood system?  Does the demand for explosions and over-the-top action require that all entries in the genre be reduced to stupid shit?  I doesn't take genius to make an interesting crime story, Hollywood used to turn out solid, two-fisted thrillers by the dozen?  What's happened?

*Drive* was a decent attempt at returning to the basics, but I think it would have been a tighter, more interesting film without the hyperbolic gore that undoubtedly made it acceptable to the studios.

I've just finished watching what is probably the most experimental film I've ever seen to date. I say this because I don't have much more to say about the film. 

It was an extremely interesting hour and a half, but I cannot come away with any great realization or ideas thanks to it. The only strong take-away I have from it is how well it serves as an expose of the filmmaking process (and even then, a very twisted one, with the crew (perhaps being led on to?) rebelling in some ways). 

I think it's a more captivating film now than ever thanks to the abundance of reality television, and the increasing abundance of film cameras everywhere. 

The best part of the film, and the most teasing element of it, is the way William Greaves lets us into the film crew's discussion(s?). He gives us a few ideas by letting us watch the crew talk for a while, but does not give us enough to really know what happened with the crew. Did they reach a resolution, a conclusion? Were their ideas explicitly proven wrong at some point? 

The best point of the film, and the point Greaves may be trying to make, is about the ambiguity and provinciality of whatever it is we see, because no one, not even William Greaves, knows the entire story of Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One.

Takeshi Murata is a video artist whose medium could almost be called the compression artifact. His work is in some ways similar to the glitch musicians of the 1990s taking an error in digital music and creating something beautiful out of it. Murata takes a few minutes of a  film and destroys it.  The images fall apart under a torrent of manipulation. A beautiful scene becomes digital sludge. It looks at once familiar to anyone whose ever seen a glitch in a digital video and all together much more strange. There's an order to the chaos of Murata's compression artifacts as they flow and move, the images sometimes snapping into focus only to be devoured again. In the Pink Dot Murata takes footage from Rambo and a titular pink dot in the middle of the screen as his backdrop. Rambo comes in and out of focuses being enveloped again as the pink dot stands in center, until eventually it to becomes pixelated and disappears only to reappear. Silver finds him using the 1960's horror classic Mask of the Demon as his canvas. The images are distorted so much at some point that the it begins to resemble more of a flowing river around the one silhouette. Eventually it stops and the images are static only sludge. The music here is worth mentioning industrial and oppressive perfectly matching the tone.

[*The Place Promised in Our Early Days*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07186dk9CPk)

[*5 Centimeters Per Second*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzAO_NeCmkM)

[*Children Who Chase Lost Voices*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhP1uFvam-E)

[*Garden of Words*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udDIkl6z8X0)

---------

I don't think anyone can deny the great animation of his movies, which have some of the best artwork in the business, but do they offer more than that?

*5CMPS* is, of course, his most popular and most critically acclaimed, but I've personally enjoyed his other work too. I haven't seen *Garden of Words* yet, but *The Place Promised in Our Early Days* was decent (though not, IMO, as good as the other two), and *Children Who Chase Lost Voices* was a pretty good attempt at a Ghibli movie.

To me, Shinkai makes remarkably pretty movies (an achievement in its own right, given the results) that cut to the chase and just attempt to invoke emotion. This is why *5CMPS* is his most successful (and my favorite), because it was an emotional roller coaster that really showed what Shinkai could do. And I don't think that that style of filmmaking is uniquely Shinkai's (or Japanese), because I might compare his movies (and their style) to the likes of Melancholia and perhaps Tree of Life.

He also uses the ""pillow-shots"" that you can hear [Ebert describe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=_9WEyuMq0Yk#t=275s) more eloquently than I can. In addition to those, he does what Ghibli does a lot in their films, which is to show mundane actions that illustrate ""life"" and build character. Perhaps the most well known/referenced of these, is the moment when Chihiro/Sen is putting on her shoes in *Spirited Away* and she taps the tips of her toes on the ground briefly to get a more comfortable fit (or to shake rocks/etc. loose). That kind of thing in animation is really cool to me, because it only gets there through intent. In a live action film, subtle things like that are done instinctively and usually ignored. But in animation, the only way a shot like that gets into the film, is if someone spent a lot of time observing behavior and then took time to illustrate the important, yet little considered actions.

All in all, I can see why someone may not enjoy Shinkai's films; they might try to hard to illicit an emotional response, or they might not tell unique/brilliant stories, but I love the art, pacing, direction, and ""effect"" that they have.

Yes they are making a film for themselves which some may find conceited, but it is that personal nature of many films that strikes such a chord with me.

When trying to find directors on the other end of the spectrum, I was often pointed towards Bresson.  I've seen 3 Bresson films now (Pickpocket, Balthazar, and Mouchette), and I definitely see the difference, but I prefer the indulgent side of things without a doubt.

Every once in a while in /r/movies we get a post talking about ""brilliant foreshadowing"" when two things occur and they're conceptually similar.

For example: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19382h/noticed_some_foreshadowing_on_einhorns_desk_while/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/14plo4/possible_foreshadowing_in_skyfall_spoilers/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/178wwx/spoiler_cant_believe_i_never_noticed_the/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/sw6s7/maybe_im_late_but_i_just_noticed_and_love_the/), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/p4nqm/my_favourite_lineforeshadowing_in_the_shawshank/) each one containing a nice dramatic argument with myself and the users, because I'm a child and can't help myself.

The way I learned it, way back in school, and the way I've always read it in film theory books is this:

---------------------

Foreshadowing is direct hints at how future events will play out.

Foreshadowing must *nudge* you. Evil music behind a character's entrance is foreshadowing. Someone entering via shadow hints at his motivations. The examples I've linked to would be considered ""motif"" for the most part.

Foreshadowing can be dialogue ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" *begs* us to apply it to the whole story. It can be repetition - seeing oranges around death in The Godfather gives us a pattern. Or it can be semiotics - The box of ""Ka-Boom"" cereal in Kill Bill is pretty distracting - ""why'd they name it Ka-Boom?"" it suggests.

Clearly it remains subjective, but an overt hint is much different than just conceptual similarities.

A clearer explanation is in [this cringe-worthy film assignment someone made.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdXA6zNgqU)

-------------------------

^ That's how I learned it. If the definition has changed, than we need a new term for that old definition.

Also, what I've described is very similar to telegraphing, but less overt. Foreshadowing hints at something that may or may not be true. Telegraphing just tells us what will happen.

A casual viewer is ought to look upon it as a cocktail of a road movie, a detective movie and a Nazi-criminal-hunt movie. But a keen viewer would be able to see through this facade discovering a deeply meaningful work of cinema. The movie can most aptly be looked upon as a soul searching journey undertaken by an individual (named Cheyenne) overwhelmed by his colossal fear of one day coming face to face with the reality of his own hollow existence. He wears a weird makeup like a mask to hide his true self from the rest of the world (and from himself). Thus, in a way Cheyenne manages to keep himself well protected in this cocoon of his own choosing. His life has a comatose feeling (except when playing handball with his wife) to it. And to watch Cheyenne drag his body (while walking) is like witnessing the drudgery of a man doomed to wander in fetters till eternity. 

There is a sequence towards the end of the film where Cheyenne finally manages to exact revenge on the Nazi who had humiliated his estranged father in the Nazi camps. The poetic beauty associated with Cheyenne's revenge not only underlines the true power of Sorrentino's filmmaking genius but also accentuates why most European filmmakers outwit their American counterparts in their ability to deliver strong and meaningful messages that despite the deliberate level of subtlety involved still manage to pack a powerful punch. The movie's slow pace may pose a challenge to some in the early going but the patient viewer will be thoroughly rewarded. 

This Must Be the Place is a testament to Sorrentino's range as a filmmaker. Watching the film makes one wonder whether one is watching only one film or a bunch of different films seamlessly blended into one. Sean Penn is a revelation in the role of Cheyenne, which in my opinion also happens to be his greatest performance till date. It's just incredible how great filmmakers push their actors to the limit and invariably get the best out of them (even when that actor is someone like Penn who has delivered so many memorable performances during the course of his long and successful career). Luca Bigazzi's cinematography is breathtaking to watch and the music by David Byrne and Will Oldham is simply hypnotic. The film is replete with visual symbolism and allegories and it may require multiple viewings for one to be in a position to appreciate it fully. The movie is recommended to all those who appreciate intelligent and thought-provoking cinema.

P.S. Another remarkable Sorrentino film to look out for is The Consequences of Love (2004).

For me this is probably my second or third favorite film by Park behind his masterpiece ""Oldboy"" and next to ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance"". It's his first directed film were he didn't write the script although it's hardly noticeable because the material is practically tailor made to his aesthetic. I thought the film was superb. THe story has the same captivating quality of ""Oldboy"" but what stands out far more in the film is the creepy and ominous overtones in this film. He combines minimalist set dressing with at times almost gothic lighting (all though for the most part he uses a cool color tone but it does have it's gothicish moments) and it really accentuates the looming threat of danger and then of course his cinematography is just as innovative and as inspired as ever.

While all the visual elements are great, the story is damn good as well. India Stoker has an almost sociopathic coldness to her and yet she is a fascinating character. I think the idea of her father try to distract her from the same violent tendencies that were present in her uncle was a very interesting take on the ""something wrong with the kid"" genre. But in the end no one can really escape their true destiny, can they? Her decision to shoot Uncle Charlie (no doubt a reference to Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"") was an interesting decision because she took this action while simultaneously accepting she was of the same breed. I think the difference was India was embraced by her father, despite her nature whereas Uncle Charlie was locked up at an institution. Uncle Charlie developed resentment towards the family. This resentment was exacerbated when India's father refused to let Charlie see India. Strangely it was because Charlie loved the family that he killed India's father. He loved it so much being away from it was torture.

I think theme of envy is very prominent in the film. Charlie envied the attention his younger brother got so he killed him. India's mother envied the attention India got so she resents India in addition to both loving and resenting India's father.

I think this was an absolutely brilliant film any fan of Chanwook Park will definitely enjoy as it's very much in the same vein of his other films. Also, if you like Hitchcock, see this film. certain parts definitely take on a Hitchcockian quality and Hitchcock seems to be Park's main source of inspiration while directing this film.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1aocj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1aocj6/chanwook_parks_stoker_what_did_you_think/,

1336628256.0,28,self.TrueFilm,tg1ze,The Thing (2011),42,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/tg1ze/the_thing_2011/,"*At the risk of writing a post that claims a remake is not good and an original is good, I am giving a tertiary review of The Thing (2011) in the hopes of starting a discussion about the state of commercialism in modern film. Specifically, the creation of film that eats its elders. I propose that this kind of blatant disregard for the content of a film in favor of brand recognizable products has existed since the thriller genre became serialized (Ex. Friday The 13th series) . I think this trend may have devolved to taking a past success as a 'sure thing'  assuming enough money is plugged into its advertising campaign. I would also offer the idea that if decadent Hollywood heavyweight companies are not fully to blame then perhaps it is telling of the psyche of present-day prepubescents. While fear-politics are still widespread there seems to be less of a perceived threat from spies since the end of the cold war. This fear of the enemy within has been gradually displaced to other fears. It can also be argued that the threat from a scientist's hubris is capable of wreaking far more havoc than the threat from espionage.*


The Thing, while having the same title as Carpenter's 1982 film is not a proper remake nor is it a sequel or a spiritual sequel but instead inhabits the territory of a quasi-remake prequel. This version's action takes place before the action in Carpenter's film. An argument may be made that this film is not necessary and is instead more of a business proposition than an inspired story. To follow in this vein, a lot is borrowed from its predecessor. For example, ""You like flame-throwers? We gots flamethrowers. You like big men with bushy beards? We got big men with bushy beards. How about the claustrophobia inherent to being isolated in the antarctic when a scary alien lifeform starts killing and becoming your crew? Ehm, ""we...

This movie is typical Hollywood copypasta tripe. I felt that the elements in this film would be more at home in a film version of a video game adaptation of the original film. Why is this? 

My impression of the original Thing was that it worked, not because of well-rounded characters, but because the subtext made the film-goer involved. The audience is constantly sorting through red herrings and being coldly suspicious of the most innocuous dialogue or footstep towards another character. Any of the characters on screen could be the alien. The difficulty enjoying the modern film version is that any opportunity the audience gets to read into the motives of characters is cut off by a cgi alien-splosion. There is a glaring lack of time to process the ""Alien Could Be Anyone"" threat that made the original so thrilling. There's even an overwhelming number of bearded russian men so unless you've never seen a gorey movie before you adjust your expectations from the nostalgia of the title to a run-of-the-mill movie where cgi beasties tears up nameless, faceless ruskies. 

I also feel like as a mammal, watching a predator that picks off vulnerable, isolated prey heightens and maintains tension in such an economical way. The further realization that its these burly men being taken out tightens the screws and delicately brews the atmospheric dread further. Ex. *Character fights blasting storm gusts and attempts to follow other character through the dark space between the buildings.* That scares me. The JAWS effect is magic. Its primal. Showing off your digital artists' cool alien configurations simply misses the point. 

 The conflicts are very overt and unsatisfying. The characters are flat but this is forgivable since all I care is who's a mutineer and who's a human. This version felt like the mutineer aspect wasn't even in play - sure the thing could become someone but at the first opportunity it would erupt into an alien. There was no guile involved. The aliens seemed more like time-bombs than (an) intelligent foe(s).

I finished the film and thought the only depth that went into making it happened to be coming up with using the title of a far superior product. In a world that relies on consistency in their fast food hamburgers it has long been apparent that the entertainment industry consistently practices the poisoning of a film and then offering it under a trusted label.

I have my own reasons for not downloading songs or film but isn't it a sad concept that something that costs a segment of the international community an estimated 38 million dollars can be worth less that a hamburger?

I was pretty much watching it from a WW2 history buff angle so I didn't really get that much from it. A few years later I saw it from more of a film lover aspect and while I really liked it more I still didn't get all of it. As of this past year it's become one of my favorite films and I've watched upwards or 10 times. So thought that I'd share some my thoughts on it.  

The main theme that I've notice from this film is the idea of Life and Death and how to function between both of them. This is best seen in Pvt. Witt and his journey in the film. Witt seen as a very kind hearted person, not opposed to war but more intended with Grace and Compassion. His main struggle is coming to terms with his own mortality in the same way his mother did when she passed; love and grace instead of fear and pain. While he's a very kind soul and peaceful in nature, he's struggling with finding what he refers to as ""another world"". This other world he speaks of isn't necessarily Heaven or an afterlife, but could be a state of mind. When Witt is surrounded by Japanese troops, he seems to come to a peaceful state of mind and openly accepts his death. His death is then cut to him swimming in the waters with the indigenous tribe he lived at the beginning. It could be argued that this is that 'other world', not heaven but a state of being at peace with mortality. 

A stark contrast from Witt is Sgt. Welsh, who clashes with Witt from the beginning. However Welsh's struggle isn't with handling death, it's handling life. Welsh always speaks of how rough life is and how one needs to make everything for himself. What becomes apparent of him however, is his inability to live with grace and compassion like Witt. As he says to him in their first discussion ""Maybe you'll just see things I'll never see."" Through out the film Welsh and Witt have 4 very important discussions. With each one Welsh comes closer to learning from Witt how to live with grace, and Witt is coming closer to being able to die with grace. The first discussion on the boat has Welsh saying there isn't another world and Witt being somewhat unsure himself. Later on before they take the hill on the island, Welsh shows he understands Witt to some extent and feels bad that he's stuck in the army and this world. While C Company is on their break from the frontline Welsh and Witt have a run-in at a small uncompleted house. Witt asks why it seems like Welsh pretends that he doesn't care about others and acts  Welsh remarks how Witt is ""still believing in the beautiful light?"" and that he's a magician with how he lives with so much focus on the beauty of life. Witt's response to Welsh is how regardless of his coldness, he still sees a spark in him. This alludes to the idea that Witt may be able to help Welsh learn how to live better. However the next time they talk is at Witt's grave. In Welsh's final words to Witt, he ask ""Where's your spark now?""; in which he's not really exclaiming that he's dead, but that Witt's love is gone and with that so his Welsh's chances to become more open and compassionate. The next time we see Welsh he's listening to the new Captain's speech with his helmet clasped tightly and a cynical look to his face. From what can be seen, it seem as Welsh has closed back up and abandoned hope.  

When looking at the film visually the themes come across through certain elements. Fire comes to represent hope in people at times. Witt is playing with matches in his holding cell, seaming letting go out and relighting them. He can be seen as a keeper of hope from this. Starros prays to a single candle for strength to not let down his men. At one point Welsh tells Witt that ""this army is going to kill you"" which later in the film we see him walking around while the company is sleeping in a field. He see's a few soldiers trying to stomp out a fire with out any success, possibly alluding to army not being what kills Witt or stomps out his flame. 

Birds are featured many times in the film, however they are almost always associated with death. With the tribe, the birds are colourful and beautiful; during the battle on the hill a dying baby bird is focused on while crawling from a tree. This is later spelled out in film with Train's voiceover ""One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain. That death's got the final word, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it."" Welsh is the one that sees nothing but pain, while Witt sees glory. A point that shows Witt embracing the glory of mortality is at the house with Welsh. As they finish speaking the camera focuses in on an empty birdcage with the door wide open. This image is seen before with the flashback to Witt's mother on her death bed reaching to an empty birdcage.

I like Greengrass a lot, so I'm sure that film will be fine, but if you are at all interested in the subject matter, you should try and check out the Danish film [A Hijacking](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2216240/). I saw it a couple of weeks ago knowing very little about it, and its been a hard experience for me to shake.

The most striking aspect of the film is it's starkness both in style and in character development. There are no real heroes in this film, there are victims certainly and there are men trying to find a resolution, but none of the can be called heroic in any traditional sense. The ships cook is the person you identify with  the most, but his journey is one of rapid deterioration.  The other protagonist, the shipping company's CEO, becomes more sympathetic as the film goes on, but still spends most of the film trying to find the right price for his employee's lives.  

If I had one issue, it is that the motivation of the pirates themselves is never really explored. The Somali negotiator is one of the scariest characters I have ever seen on film, the other pirates are never really given any depth. In fairness,  it isn't really the point of the film to explore the intricacies of Somali history or piracy, its about how people react when being held hostage, and the pirates serve their purpose as skinny, unpredictable menaces. 

It's by no means a perfect film, and it's hard to think most people would enjoy seeing it, but it's one of the most suspenseful films I've seen in a while, which is a feat considering it largely takes place in a ship's cabin and a cramped boardroom.

*World War Z* was filmed almost entirely in Glasgow, Scotland (which they spent extensive set dressing money to dress as Pittsburgh) and Budapest, two places with notoriously low labor costs. *Man of Steel* was outsourced to Vancouver, a place with a film industry that now mushrooms over New York and is rivaling LA. *This Is The End* was filmed in New Orleans, even though the entirety of the narrative takes place in LA. 

---

I think this makes for an interesting discussion and I have a couple of ideas about it. 

1. I think it's inevitable. As long as low labor costs in other countries exist, film work will of course exploit the financial advantages of filming abroad. 

2. As an LA native who currently works in the film industry here, I think it's ultimately a good thing. I'm tired of the world's media being principally a Western export and I think as more jobs are outsourced, this will fuel a grassroots effort to start getting more groups of film production workers living in other places, eventually giving way for studios and production companies to exist in other places. Just look at Louisiana or New Mexico - both places that have successful production companies basically making a monopoly on that area. Although most of the distribution and exhibition is still in LA, I think if production keeps getting pushed to these new places, eventually it will make more business sense to distribute films from there too... 

3. I think we will definitely see this change happen in our lifetimes, if not in 10-15 years.

---

I know this is an atypical question for this subreddit but I think it also will impact what types of movies will get made in the future. Could *Beasts of the Southern Wild* have gotten made in LA? Could it have survived pre-production if it didn't have Louisianan tax credits floating it's budget? No. I think tax incentives also throw a huge bone to independent filmmakers. Which is awesome if our goal is to take power away from the centralized nature of the studios. Not saying it is necessarily, but it's interesting to think about.  

What are your thoughts? Do you think this is just a hiccup trend in the industry or do you think jobs will continue to get outsourced (like virtually every other American business).

It's filmed in a very basic sense from a technical perspective, effectively capturing the poverty and desperation of its world grounded in realism. Yes, there's plenty of physical and sexual violence that will make you cringe. But most of it's off-screen and implied, as the violence isn't the focus here, but the suffering of the loved ones, as the title suggests. 

The story is simple with aesopian message of human's need for one another. In his usual fashion, the film ends with a ""magical"" and visually stunning shot while staying true to its realistic nature.

Riveting, gritty, and exceptionally well structured, this soft family thriller, if I may, kept me on my edge. I have a short attention span and normally end up checking how much time is left about midway through every movie. This was the first movie that I didn't know ended when it did. 

The ending could not have been better. Some would argue that it leaves the viewer hanging and off kilter. But I think it was just perfect. It was such a slice of life story of an ordinary family that the ending really wouldn't matter if the girl picked the father or mother. The point was that life goes on.

The acting and character sketches were incredibly perfect. They were lifelike and dove-tailed into one another in just the right way. The tension in the scenes and the natural progression of the story could not have been better scripted. One walks away feeling that this is just how the story should have advanced, and in no other way.

However, I am not sure if I missed something, but who did steal the money?

EDIT: I cannot help but contrast the two Iranian directors and take a jab at one of them. I just so happened to see Like Someone In Love by Kiarastomi a week ago and felt ripped off at the theater.

A couple of questions and observations (again SPOILERS, so don't look down if you don't want):











1. How do you think they recorded him playing saxophone at the end of the film? I was thinking that the other ""expert"" who tricks him at the party had that harmonica machine that used a telephone as a bug (Gene Hackman even calls it junk). Is this too far-fetched? If not, what are the implications of this?

2. When he tears his apartment apart at the end of the film. He is sitting there, playing his saxophone, with his broken house around him. I really liked this scene because he is so purposely distant from people, and, from far enough away, he broke his home because someone had access to it. Is this also too far-fetched?

3. I thought it was kind of cheap the way the inflection of the man in the titular conversation changed at the end. The phrase that gave Gene Hackman so much pause went: ""They'd KILL us if they had the chance"" but at the end, the emphasis is changed to ""They'd kill US if they had the chance"". He keeps replaying the conversation in his head, but only hears it that way at the end. Obviously it is a rationalization, but is it supposed to make more sense to him now? I think this would work without the change in emphasis.

4. Did anyone else worry when the blood flowed out of the toilet that his fingerprints were all over that room? I kept thinking through that whole scene that maybe he had hallucinated the whole thing, but still, don't touch anything if you think it might be a crime scene. If they find a bloody toilet, is that even something that would be investigated?

I know this might sound like a bit much, but this film truly transcended storytelling in film as a whole in my opinion. In using photographs to replace the cinematography, yet using the same sort of direction that would be used on a typically shot film, it creates a unique and awe inspiring way to capture a story. The heavy use of narration gives it a traditional writing style, turning it into the perfect blend of photography, cinema, and writing. The lack of any dialogue besides the atmospheric mumbling during the treatment sessions really emphasizes the novelesque qualities of this film.

I realize that the core concepts I'm trying to express are somewhat hard to put into words (I hate this essay style of writing)

Either way, in terms of the story of the film, I thought it was amazing and the ending particularly struck me as one of the most beautiful sequences I have seen to date.

If any of you have seen Harmony Korine's new film [*Spring Breakers*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101441/), I'd love to hear your opinions!

To me, it seemed to be a film characterized by *exits*, both in the sense of the hedonistic escapism they engage in in Florida, and the way that the four girls would - one by one - fall out along the way. When everyone leaves for spring break, and the four are left behind, we seem them framed in the empty corridors of their dormitory; trapped in the bathroom where they pool their insufficient money and discuss how they'll make enough to go to Florida. I kept wondering at what point along the way I would have gotten out, made my exit so to speak: was it when they decided to rob the fast food joint? When they got arrested - or when one got shot? Would I exit before I had to shoot someone myself - or would an exit be forced upon me, as it was on Alien? When *does* spring break end? (seriously, I'm not American and have a pretty hard time figuring out exactly how long ""**spring** break"" lasts)

During roughly the first half of the film, I was fairly conflicted. I liked the 'disneysploitation' parts, where the four girl - well, three of them, really - indulged in spring break rites (from beach parties to aimless scootering around) and dragged each other towards bottom, but the extended cutaway montages of the spring break ""dream"" were frankly too drawn out and seemed too exaggerated. 

But then they go to the drug-fueled party, filmed on what struck me as video, where they get arrested as the video starts dissolving itself; the dissolution lends itself to considerations about the fate of the plasticesque figures we see partying in the ""dream"" montage (and in the kind of culture it tries to mock). What happens when the camera is turned off?

Obviously, for most it doesn't go quite as awry as it does for Candy, Brit, Cotty and Faith, but I thought Korine very effectively dismantled this idealized fantasy of spring break as an eternal party. As they get bailed out by Alien, it seemed like focus shifted from spring break itself, to a more stylized, if caricatured, gangsta fantasy of money, drugs and eternal party. This fantasy world, symbolic of both the violence the girls - a little too happily - engaged in to get away, and the carefree escapades they sought is too much for Faith who leaves, presumably to go back to her church group. She seemed both scared of and intrigued by her co-breakers robbery, in the parking lot scene where they describe it to her, but unlike Candy and Brit (and to a lesser extent, Cotty), Faith isn't pulled towards danger/violence as a means of escape; she seeks something less conforming than home, but for her the journey is still spiritual one. For Candy and Brit, it's not so much spiritual as transcendent/transgressive. 

Faith was, to me, the weak point of the movie. A disproportionate amount of time seemed spent on developing her as a character in the beginning, considering that she opts out about halfway through, never to be seen again; conversely, I would have liked to have known just a bit more about Candy and Brit pre-spring break.

The film used repetition heavily, and had a very peculiar way of disconnecting the audio from the immediate picture, while showing us events in a scene in a haphazard order that looped back on itself. I'm not quite sure what to make of it, but it seemed to me an almost hypnotic experience. The neon-bent sequence at the end looked *amazing*, but for me the visual highlight was the one-take robbery that efficiently build tension (it seemed almost inevitable that they'd be caught), before releasing it in an exhilarating scream.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1aac1y,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1aac1y/thoughts_on_harmony_korines_spring_breakers_2012/,

Below are the Nine Satanic Statements and my interpretation of how they relate to *The Master*

1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.
2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.
3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit.
4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates.
5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.
6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires.
7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his ""divine spiritual and intellectual development"", has become the most vicious animal of all.
8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.
9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years.

Now not all of these fit as well as the others, but I believe all can be tied to the film and Freddie Quell in some way.  The biggest ones are undoubtedly the first and the last:  Freddie is a drinking, fighting, fucking machine; a champion of indulgence.  And he and Dodd's relationship is one that is truly remarkable.  They seem to be on opposite sides in their approach to life, but there's mutual respect and love.  And Freddie is, quite literally, the best friend that Dodd's church has ever had.  And Dodd's 'rehabilitation' of Freddie and those who are like him are what keep him in business.  

Freddie also seems to conform to the Nine Satanic Sins, being guilty of only a few (Self-deceit and herd conformity to a degree)

1. Stupidity
2. Pretentiousness
3. Solipsism
4. Self-deceit
5. Herd Conformity
6. Lack of Perspective
7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies
8. Counterproductive Pride
9. Lack of Aesthetics

There are also the Eleven Satanic Rules, which aren't quite as applicable as the ones I've already listed, but I think that they provide a degree of insight into Freddie's 'barbarism.'  The character is borderline primal in how he approaches life.

1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.
2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
3. When in another's lair, show them respect or else do not go there.
4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat them cruelly and without mercy.
5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.
7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.
8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.
9. Do not harm little children.
10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.
11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask them to stop. If they don’t stop, destroy them.

What stood out to me was that although his movies are very character-centered, his past two have been almost entirely character studies with the individual characters (Daniel and Freddy/Dodd) representing something of a larger scale. Daniel from TWBB is often seen as a characterization of pure capitalism, cut-throat and obsessed with success at any cost. His business is his life and any relationships he has he uses to benefit his business. It ultimately ends with him reaching that success, but to what benefit? I was left of a feeling of ""...well where does he go from here?""

Meanwhile, Freddy is a representation of the animalistic nature of man - completely impulsive and uncontrollable. Dodd is the antithesis to this, a man who seeks the ability to control every aspect of his life. Every time he speaks, the whole room is avidly listening. His entire cult following is based off the idea of controlling our emotions, and seeing Freddy's wild behavior that can't be tamed creates a magnetic attraction between the two. To me the film ended with the idea that we will never control the beast inside of us, despite our best efforts. 



My question is, do you view them as character studies first? Huge films delving completely into the character until we realize exactly how they tick and why? Or are the allegorical implications the real focus of the films?

I would also like to hear if anyone has looked more into his past films with this in mind. I've viewed Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk at least twice each, and while they are two of my favorite films, they don't seem to have these large analogies in their stories as much as his last two.

1347986946.0,29,self.TrueFilm,1034e4,Making Sense of The Master [I was told to repost this here from r/movies],38,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1034e4/making_sense_of_the_master_i_was_told_to_repost/,"So far, reviewers praise the movie for its performances and cinematography, but are confounded by the plot or meaning of the film. I think I have it at least somewhat figured out. Here is my review and analysis.

To be sure, this is PTA's least accessible film to date. In fact, each of his films has been less linear than the last, and the meaning of The Master is even more obfuscated and ripe for interpretation than TWBB. The themes of the two movies are remarkably similar. Where TWBB was about the tension between religion and a certain animal characteristic within man, namely relentless competition and drive, The Master is about religion's tension with another animalistic human trait: hedonism. Just as Daniel Day Lewis represented pure ambition in TWBB, Joaquin Phoenix assumes a role representing pure hedonism. JP is a drinking, fucking and fighting machine, without purpose or direction. He is scolded repeatedly by Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, a religious guru in the vein of L. Ron Hubbard, as ""an animal who eats its own shit when hungry.""

However, in the Master, the battle between religion and animalism is a more equal fight than in TWBB, where animalism is the clear victor. First of all, PSH and JP do not hate each other like DDL and Paul Dano did in TWBB, rather, they love each other. Furthermore, the guru himself struggles with his own hedonistic tendencies. At some points he uses his extreme charisma and strangely effective methods for good, genuinely attempting figure out how the mind works so he can heal people. But at others he abuses his power, basking in the attention of female followers as he sings and dances his way around a gathering (this scene is followed by the strangest scene in the film, where Amy Adams gives PSH a handjob over a sink, seemingly to discharge his animal sexual drive). Unlike in TWBB, where animalism is the victor over religion, there is no such clear resolution in the Master. If you're hoping for a explicit condemnation of Scientology or New Age spiritual religion, you won't find it. We never get a solid answer as to whether PSH's character is a charlatan or a genuine master, although he does seem to arc closer to the former as the movie progresses.

The main struggle, however, is portrayed by JP, in easily the most over-the-top intense performance in recent history, maybe ever. It could be criticized as somewhat of an one-sided acting fest, akin to going ""full retard,"" just because it's so unhinged and so extreme that there's little room for complexity. Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Cruise, and Adam Sandler portrayed restrained anger in their respective PTA roles, with violence ultimately forcing its way out from the behind the mask only when containing it became impossible. Here, restraint doesn't stand a chance against the animal within JP's character, and it makes for a somewhat less interesting performance. PSH puts JP through all sorts of strange and experimental methods and exercises to try to quell the JP's chronic misbehavior. Some seem very effective, and some seem to be complete bullshit. It is unclear in the end whether JP has actually been helped, or whether he was merely a freeloader along for the ride. There is evidence for both interpretations.

However, the lack of a more clear resolution is ultimately irrelevant because The Master is, more than anything else, a love story between JP and PSH. From their initial meeting, where PSH ""processes"" JP, and finishes by saying ""you're the bravest man I've ever met,"" the two are in a torrential whirlwind of ups and downs, embraces and fights. Both struggle with hedonism, and both make strong attempts to become more than mere animals using the civilizing force of spirituality and religion, even if they ultimately fail. The two are the best of pals, drinking buddies, twin adventurers, like two young boys going exploring. At one point the two don hunting gear and head to the desert to dig up ""treasure,"" in the form of PSH's early writings. In another they roll around on a grassy lawn in a giggling half-embrace half-wrestle. The love between them and the fun they have represents the life that happens while we're so busy trying so hard to figure ""it"" out, to find truth.

The performances of PSH and JP are each so powerful, and so equally matched, that they drown out everyone and everything else, including both the plot and poor Amy Adams. This could be a criticism, but it works here because that's what the movie is about--that love is so much bigger than everything else that's supposed to be so important, including the very serious quest for spiritual truth.

[SPOILERS FOR THE FILM MENTIONED IN THE TITLE AS WELL AS THE OTHER FILMS THAT I'M ABOUT TO MENTION]

I'd like to start off by listing these films:

[Man Facing Southeast [1986]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091214/)

[Happy Accidents [2000]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208196/?ref_=sr_1)

[K-Pax [2001]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272152/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

[Sound of My Voice [2011]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748207/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

[Safety Not Guaranteed [2012]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/?ref_=sr_1)

I'm not a big fan of many of some of these films as I tend to find them schmaltzy and somewhat predictable.  I never saw **Man Facing Southeast** but as I understand the filmmakers had [sued Gene Brewer (K-Pax's writer) and others involved for plagiarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-PAX_\(film\)#Plagiarism_lawsuit), although that was later withdrawn. 

All these films have an almost basic story told through different means. The story being that one person claims to be from another time/another planet and tries to make a connection with a person or people  in the present day which is always initially met with doubt, until we get to the end which either revels in ambiguity (**K-Pax** &amp; **Sound of My Voice**) or makes it perfectly clear whether or not they were telling the truth (**Safety Not Guaranteed** &amp; **Happy Accidents**). In almost all cases it ends with everyone's lives changed, for better or worse. I didn't like half of the four films I saw, those being **K-Pax** &amp; **Safety Not Guaranteed**  as those were the two I found to be the most cloying, despite one being ambiguous in it's ending and the other being clear. Whereas the two I did like:  **Sound of My Voice** &amp; **Happy Accidents** also were split between ambiguous and clear endings. Although Happy Accidents also falters to being schmaltzy there was, what I felt, something more genuine to the love story. I realize a lot of Redditors here and in /r/movies loved **Safety Not Guaranteed** I cannot adequately express what it was I disliked about the movie other than it's cheesiness. At first I thought it was the age difference between Mark Duplass' and Aubrey Plaza's characters but it turns out that  the actors current respective ages are 36 &amp; 29 and the year Happy Accidents was released Vincent D'Onofrio and Marissa Tomei's ages were 41 &amp; 36. So the age difference isn't too dissimilar although Mark Duplass looks older than he really is and Aubrey Plaza looks younger than she is. 

I suppose I'm just trying to understand where the difference lies in these films and why I would enjoy one and not the other. Perhaps people who have seen these films can relay what it was about **Safety Not Guaranteed** they liked.

On the other spectrum we have **K-Pax** and **Sound Of My Voice**. I enjoyed **Sound of My Voice** thoroughly. It is, in my opinion, a well crafted, low-budget sci-fi. I enjoyed the open ending where you, along with the protagonist, question whether or not Maggie was telling the truth. I haven't seen **K-Pax** since it first came out, but from what I do recall, it also had an open ending, whether the shell of the man who claimed to be from a different planet was telling the truth all along or he was just some crazy person. This film also resorts to many cheesy scenes in which Kevin Spacey's character changes the lives of those around him. I found the film boring and the ending just left me rolling my eyes. Again two different endings, however I appreciate one film and not the other and I still am not able to grasp why that is, so I am hoping for some insight from people who are more knowledgeable in film to provide some insight.

Lars Von Trier is one of my favorite directors, but I have to be in the right mood for it. I do believe however that optimism, especially in the science fiction genre, have been muted or is practically extinct outside of cartoons. 

Now pessimism has always been in movies from The Great Train Robbery (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oTdPklBE0Y) forward. There is an entire genre of noir and crime stories too, but no one goes to those genres to feel light and fluffy unless they are Alex from A Clockwork Orange. 

Science fiction once had a great deal of optimism. Check out George Melies' Trip to the Moon (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk) or The Jetsons, or even r/retrofuturism for images and videos of what our parents and grandparents believed the future would look like. They believed in a future with bright colors and affordable jet packs or flying cars.  

At the same time, pessimism about the future came away as cautionary tales about the future and what could happen if we didn't keep things in check (Metropolis, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, Alien, The Matrix, and a much longer list of movies). Bright colors have also fallen out of favor in most science fiction films as well, and most of the ones that show earth depict it as a wasteland, like the Matrix or the less pessimistic WALL-E.

The more science fiction movies I see, the more they keep in line with the less optimistic ideas, leading me to think that something has gone wrong in the imagination department. So, to my questions. 

1. Are we at our technological or imaginative zenith? 

2. Why do so many films show the earth as a wasteland?

3. How did cinema get to a state of mostly pessimistic movies?

4. Can anything be done about it?

5. (For my personal use) Has anyone seen more positive science fiction films in recent years?

After seeing ""The Draughtsman's Contract,"" (1982) ""A Zed &amp; Two Noughts,"" (1985) ""The Belly of an Architect,"" (1987) and especially ""Prospero's Books,"" (1991) Greenaway has usurped David Lynch as my favorite director.

A subversive crime thriller about misfits and love.",33,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1e2r5k/review_of_jacques_audiards_a_prophet_rust_bone/,"Unconventional crime thriller from Jacques Audiard about Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), a sheltered, partially deaf secretary who suffers from ridicule in her office and loneliness in her personal life. Given the opportunity to hire an assistant she interviews the affable bad-boy ex-con Paul (Vincent Cassel) and despite lacking any qualifications (or a shirt and tie) she hires him and shows the kind of tenderness and caring he has never experienced. After initially misreading this as a sexual advance, Paul and Carla form a mutually beneficial team - but when the criminal characters from his past begin to resurface their cosy office life is thrown into turmoil. 

A surprising genre movie with real depth, this begins as an almost sweet naturalistic drama verging on a workplace comedy, before later switching into more traditional thriller territory (albeit subverted). While utilising the tension and excitement of the genre, the film is still firmly centred around misfits, dependency and love. It is made genuinely moving by two unusual lost souls who are neither good nor bad – each one continually exploits the other so we’re not sure who deserves our pity, but as social outcasts they both retain our sympathies throughout. This creates an interesting dynamic that makes their relationship utterly compelling, posing constant uncertainties about their motivations and designs on each other. Emmanuelle Devos’s performance is exceptional as the awkward Carla who discovers confidence and her sexuality under these abnormal circumstances. From vastly different worlds, the strange chemistry the pair develop is at the heart of the picture. Beautifully shot in a style verging on voyeurism, the camera is allowed to linger on the small mannerisms or personal moments of reflection that truly create rounded character and silently progress the story – Carla looking at herself in the mirror, Paul silently smoking a cigarette. In this way the film is allowed room to breathe, embracing its characters as well as its plot.

Subverting the thriller genre and remaining unpredictable for long periods, it feels it could twist and turn in any direction. Some occasional wild implausibility does slightly jar with the film’s more naturalistic elements, but Paul and Carla have been shaped into such intriguing characters this doesn’t break the rhythm of the engrossing story. Despite not hanging together as well as it might, the film's audacity and subversion of the genre clearly set it apart from its peers. A character driven thriller tinged with melodrama, capable of poignancy and tense exhilaration.

Terrence Malick is one of my all time favorite directors. If I had to do a sight and sound poll his Days of Heaven would be on it. Malick is known for his abstract filmmaking style where story goes to inner self thought, incredible shots, and the connection of people. To The Wonder takes it to more abstract levels than The Tree of Life. There is a story with Olga Kurelynko playing a French woman who falls in love with the American Ben Affleck. A single mother, she and her daughter move with him back to the USA. This film is about marriage and trying to keep it. They love each other and fight and make up. The daughter is distraught and uncomfortable about living in rural Oklahoma compared to Paris. I feel this is a way for Malick fleeing America for 20 years to live in Paris and how he tries to see relationships as a bond but can be destroyed because of conflict. Javier Bardem's character as the distraught priest shows to me how the structures of religion do not help make whole a person. He is striving for a personal connection like the couple. His time with the two characters in different parts of their struggling marriage is key to the film. He envies what they have or should I say once had. In addition he is grounded to death and troubles of people's ordinary lives which gives him a perspective that neither can have. Overall this is a very good film but not at the top of the list for Malick and me.

Sometimes I love it, and then at a later viewing it's just a big disappointment. One thing that can always been said, though, is that it is quite an ambitious undertaking. You could write a book on the camerawork alone: Storaro and Bertolucci were a team that made some very beautiful movies. The camera in Novecento is never static; it floats from one shot to the next. For the most part, it's not distracting. The way it moves feels incredibly natural. When dissecting each individual shot, the camera movement is actually quite complex. The average shot length is much higher than your average movie, and much of the film was shot at golden hour. When you throw in the fact that most of the peasants were played by non-professional actors, every shot suddenly becomes its own individual feat.The amount of planning that must have gone into this is mind-blowing; it's no wonder that the production took so long.

Storaro's colors are incredibly vibrant, which is sort of his trademark. Whereas The Conformist from a few years earlier had some very memorable shots from blue hour, Novecento has some very stunning shots taken at sunset. One of my favorites is when the peasants first go on strike: the reds are just hypnotic. The colors overtake that whole scene. The colors and lighting are often very symbolic, so it's probably no accident that the reddest scene in the movie is when the proletariat first fight back. If anybody has seen Visions of Light, Storaro talks about his use of color from The Last Emperor (also made with Bertolucci): he would often isolate a single color to dominate a certain shot, depending on its symbolic importance.

The use of the seasons is also great. Summer is a perfect setting for the earlier childhood scenes, under the rule of the Padrone. It is very nostalgic, somewhat like an Italian Mark Twain story. The beginning seems to be a direct reference The Leopard. The Burt Lancaster character again signifies the older time. In Novecento, he is not the magnificent Prince from The Leopard; he was become a withered old man, senile from the beginning of the movie. Some have even gone so far as to say that Novecento is the follow-up to The Leopard; some of the connections made are certainly no accident. Winter is an appropriate backdrop to the rule of Fascism: many of the scenes shot under the Fascists are nearly monochromatic. It's like an old triptych, where the grisaille exterior opens to the saturated colors inside; for Novecento, it is the Spring and the fall of Fascism, something that appeared in many of Bertolucci's early movies.

Morricone's score is one of his best. It is certainly among his most diverse; it plays like a modern opera. The opening theme could be a national anthem. I especially like the music that accompanies the young Olmo and Alfredo - it is reminiscent of his music for Days of Heaven.

What are your opinions, /r/TrueFilm? Novecento is quite a movie, and there is a lot that I left to be discussed (namely the metaphorical elements and the acting). It takes a large part of the day just to watch the whole thing, but I'd say the payoff is worth it. If you can watch The Leopard right before, it becomes even better.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1c0idw,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1c0idw/novecento_1976/,

I decided to watch it after seeing [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AD3XqEGDIg) posted in r/videos.

Up until the last bit of the movie something strange happened to me. The film is quite depressing and harsh, but not in a violent, gritty way as I'm used to seeing in this kind of stories. Nonetheless, I felt inexplicably... calm and almost grateful? I want to say happy but that's not the right term. I'm not sure how this is done on a technical level, the main character narrates as if talking to a psychologist or something, and that maybe contributes to feeling next to him on grounds, not so much identifying and projecting ourselves onto him, but not as a character who goes about doing actions in a made up world either.

I knew that, since this subreddit was a bit more... ""intellectual,"" I didn't want to submit anything unless I had put some thought into it. That being said, let's talk about Leos Carax's latest film ""Holy Motors.""

To me, this film is a mournful tribute to cinema. It pays loving homage to everything that makes movies great; from deathbed melodrama to surreal abstraction, ""HM"" covers it all, while also lamenting on the possible future of the medium

I think Mr.Oscar is the living avatar of the actor, shfting from place to place, warping his personality accordingly. He gives each of his roles a unique physicality, and he is completely invested... only to later drop the act and shift into a different one. I don't think Denis Lavant is just playing parts, he's playing THE part. The role that embodies everything an actor does and aspires to do;the same goes for all of the other people with ""appointments"" throughout the film (Kylie Minogue and Elise L'Homeau)

I also think, as I mentioned earlier, that the film is mournful. There's a genuine sense of sadness that pervades alll of the proceedings with Mr.Oscar's cynical quip about modern technology and the final discussion that the limo's have amongst themselves. I'm sure that most of you know that, despite notable holdouts like Tarantino, standard film is on the way out. And, while I don't think digital film is inherently terrible, it really is rather sad that standard film is dying.

All in all, I think if you can find a penetrate it, I think you'll find a very personal movie concerning one man's eulogy for film.

Capote is one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years.  
Philip Seymour Hoffman gives an incredible performance in a chilling and very dark movie about the creation of Capotes ""In Cold Blood"".
I think it is nothing short of sensational what the team around Miler and his writers managed to tell with this character driven piece.  
Capote becomes more and more human in the course of the movie, with every manipulation and lie he comes up with.   
The cast is spectacular and keener, Hoffman and Collins all give the performances of their lives ( ok, that can be argued, just my two cents).  
I am a big fan of Hoffman and Keener and their Chemistry is as present as it was in Synecdoche New York.  
I have to admit I have a little crush on Keener, she plays, as always, a strong, very endearing woman, in stark contrast to Hoffmans fragile Capote.

1343064479.0,29,self.TrueFilm,x0wqc,An opinion on Roger Ebert's style of criticism,33,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/x0wqc/an_opinion_on_roger_eberts_style_of_criticism/,"Like many of you, I was first introduced to film criticism through Siskel &amp; Ebert, a wonderful and insightful film review show of which we haven't seen the likes of since. Being a child, I often tended to side with Ebert's more populist opinions than Siskel's, and to this day our opinions are still very much in line with eachother.

However, I strongly dislike Roger Ebert's written reviews. He holds little to no regard for spoilers, often summarising the first act of the film, if not the second. His matter of fact approach makes his reviews very digestible, but on numerous occasions I've had a film-watching experience tainted by the information he bestowed though his critique.

Besides being too in depth in his opening synopsis, he has often blatantly revealed major plot points in a film.

Examples:

* [Super](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110406/REVIEWS/110409992): He has since added a spoiler warning after uproar, but his published opening paragraph details the death of one of our leads that occurs in the film's final act.

* [Kick-Ass](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100414/REVIEWS/100419986): Details how the main villain dies and our hero gets saved in the film's final showdown.

* [The Jackal](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971114/REVIEWS/711140302/1023): Explicitly reveals who the assassins target is (a twist, in the film) due to the fact that he disagreed with it morally.

With each of these three films, I'm not sure if the fact that Ebert didn't like them and his recklessness are linked, but I think it's a possibility. All of his criticisms are on ethical grounds here, so he appears to adopt the belief that ""This film is morally reprehensible so it is subject to being spoiled. I may be assuming things, I'm not sure.

I'd love to hear from those who regularly read his work, and whether or not you think he is careful enough in his analysis. Any further examples of Ebert being too revealing are welcome as well.

On the other hand, some very good films (*Sword of the Beast* leaped out at me) were omitted. I'm sure that this is repeated in many other areas--for example, I am sure that a book on Westerns will feature every John Ford film.

Is this justified? Is filmmaking too collaborative for this to be valid?

A lot of the criticism written about the film seems to suggest an anti-capitalist message - OWS-like protestors in the street, a hot-shot corporate anti-hero getting his comeuppance - but to me that idea reeks of mired political thinking.

The late stages and excesses of venture (or corporate) capitalism stem from the excesses of *post-modernism* - the idea that man can somehow transcend his past, his environment, and his natural world to create whatever world he or she dreams of. To quote a line from the film, ""Destroy the past to create the future."" Venture capitalism tacitly creates nothing, only to bleed the real producers dry. Pattinson's character literally created his entire fortune out of thin air.

Giamatti's character, too, was a victim of post-modern excess. He couldn't contextualize any thought from second to second. He was constantly destroying any past context for his thoughts, and it drove him insane.

There are other things (the film's obsession with symmetry, talk about being able to ""read the future"", money creating time instead of the other way around), but the only thing most critics seem to be able to draw out of this film is ""Anti-capitalist!"" and ""It's a period-piece about modern life!"" and ""Occupy Wall Street!"" I can't help but feel these people can't see past their own noses and the headlines of The New York Times.

Lars von Trier seems so fancy himself as this generation's Andrei Tarkovsky or Ingmar Bergman. His films are weighty and philosophical and have a dream like presence, especially his last 2 films: Antichrist (2009) and Melancholia (2011). He also likes to challenge the viewer with a long drawn out film rather than a short, to-the-point one. He dedicated Antichrist to Tarkovsky and Melacholia was practically a tribute to The Sacrifice (1986) which was itself a tribute to Bergman. The painting ""The Hunters in the Snow"" appears in both Melancholia and 2 previous Tarkovsky films Solaris(1972) and The Mirror (1974).

The Sacrifice is about a group of people in a house in a remote area dealing with the possibility of WWIII and complete nuclear fallout. The sense of impending doom is heightened by the fact that there is a young child with them who would suffer the same fate. As a tribute to Ingmar Bergman, Tarkovsky used Berman's favourite cinamatographe Sven Nykvist adn even filmed it near the isle of Faro where Bergman filmed several of his own films.

Melancholia is a films about a family in a beautiful mansion in the days leading up to a collision between earth and another planet. They too have a young child with them to amplify the tragedy. It is also about depression and what it's like to go through your own wedding while suffering from severe depression.

The Characters in either film deal with their emotions in the same way each film maker would. In The Sacrifice, Alexander makes a plea to God as Tarkovsky was a religious man while John in Melancholia uses science to try to understand the apocalypse since von Trier is an Atheist. Both films show a group of people isolated from the rest of the world so we never see ow the whole world reacts to it, strictly these characters who never stray far from the house.

I happen to love Lars von Trier's work with Dogville and Breaking the waves being my favorites followed by Melancholia and Antichrist. Do you think future generations will appreciate his films as much as we appreciate Tarkovsky and Bergman? I think his last two films are evidence that he wants to go in that direction and be their spiritual successor. Melancholia and Antichrist are meditations on human grief and suffering but are also very spiritual and conscious of an almost sentient environment much like Stalker(1977) and sport stunning cinematography. The only major variance is that von Trier uses CGI and heavy distortion on his [surreal scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kP-vuOy8cU) whereas Bergman and Tarkovsky rarely used special effects.

1367836174.0,27,self.TrueFilm,1ds9zv,Discussion: Olivier's Hamlet,32,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ds9zv/discussion_oliviers_hamlet/,"Given its reputation I was expecting a good film; what came as a surprise was that it was an exciting one, one that seems to stand alone in visual style and the nature of its storytelling. So many classic films have been imitated to the point of seeming almost mundane at a glance; I couldn't name anything quite like this.

The number one thing- the photography. This is a beautiful film. I want to watch it again several more times immediately so I can judge if I'm being hyperbolic in my judgement that this is one of the best-shot films ever. There is something purely cinematic in the expressionist set design, the way the camera swings through the halls of the castle. Certain scenes- the one that stands out is the ghost of King- are just overpowering in their imagery, but the effect is consistent, and even less showy scenes are perfectly shot, in a way that grabs and directs your attention to the technique. 

Even mundane edits have something to them, something in the timing and composition that subtly defies continuity editing and makes each cut stand out in a beautiful, precise way. I'm being very inarticulate abut this right now, but I just saw it and am excited even though I don't know the film enough to understand these things fully.

Also good- The excisions made were the right ones, and this is probably the perfect length for any less than full production of Hamlet. The story flows well, maybe even better than full length; while the shorter version loses much of the impact of all the pieces coming together at the end, it also loses the hard-to-follow and uninteresting Fortinbras subplot, much of the less successful comedy and gives a sense of focus. Let's be real, nobody's missing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that much

The less good: The film is dated by the heavy influence of early 20th century Freudian psychology which is often distracting and embarrassingly heavy handed. That's not to say I don't think it's an interesting and valid reading worth exploring, but I don't know if having Hamlet repeatedly passionately kiss his mother or Ophelia flirt with and grab at a pouch at Laertes' crotch were the right choices. Also Gertrude's labia-shaped curtains, a clumsy and labored piece of symbolism it keeps returning to.

The other issue's the acting. I came in expecting pre-method, non-naturalistic acting style, but this can't really account for the blandness of some of the supporting performances. Olivier himself was the biggest letdown- I simply can't understand why he was so acclaimed at the time. His Hamlet feels uninspired, almost mechanical, he neither imbues emotion or reads the poetry of the lines well. I'm exaggerating, perhaps, but his performance just isn't that good, even compared to his contemporaries. He's unmemorable; he feels at the mercy of the films visuals.

Also, the opening narration- to say ""This is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind."" is both too reductive and far too blunt a touch

1363399507.0,26,self.TrueFilm,1adz20,Manhattan: A Story Of Maturity,30,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1adz20/manhattan_a_story_of_maturity/,"Woody Allen is a director who is almost consistently viewed as avery good, funny, and creative, director, yet no genius or master of film. On the most part, I agree, but, subjectively, along with a few others, I believe Manhattan is a true masterpiece. It is smart, funny, fantastically written, poignant, and offers a very unique insight into the lives of yuppy New Yorkers, even if it is a bit exaggerated. This entire review is a spoiler of a fantastic film, and I am not going to make anybody read a wall of white text on black, so if you have not seen Manhattan, please do so before you read this. I highly recommend it, by the way.

Cinematography: The way a film looks is always, in my opinion, integral to it's quality, and a major part of that is in what way the look of the film contributes to the story of the movie. Manhattan's is quite unique in this regard, because the message that the cinematography conveys seems to be opposite to the message that the film conveys. In the movie, the city of New York is a black and white wonderland, and whether you are getting off the highway coming back into the city, sitting by the bridge at the wee hours of the morning, or walking through a dreamy moon-surface part of the Rose center which must have been taken away before I ever went there, everything looks astonishingly beautiful. But within the film itself, all the characters are total self-absorbed assholes. I think that Woody's way of conveying that this film is not a criticism of new york, but a love letter. All the characters are people that I would hate if I were to meet them, but they really are just (only slightly) exaggerated caricatures of the snobby NY upper class, a group to which Woody Allen, in real life, belongs to. On their own, the characters of this movie would make you think that Woody holds disdain for Manhattan and its inhabitants, but the cinematography tells a different story. It shows the city as a wonderful place, where according to the visuals, everything is fantastic. I think this is woody's way of forcing the viewer to re-evaluate how they see his image of the city. Imagine if the cinematography had shown a dark, gritty city. The message would have been clear: Manhattan, according to Woody Allen, sucks. But the cinematography was wonderfully enthusiastic, making me think that there is more to the city, and therefore it's people, than nonstop annoying self-absorbed yacking. I would also like to address the fact that cinematography this beautiful elevates the quality of the film, therefore supporting my argument that this film is a masterpiece. 

Characters: Now I will addressing each specific character and the journeys that they take throughout the film in ""Story"" but for now I am only addressing the way woody is portraying the people of NY, NY. From the beginning, most everyone is likable, even if, with the exception of Tracy and maybe Emily, you find out they kind of suck as people within minutes of meeting them. The fact that they all have likable traits is important though. It show that Woody wasn't making a movie about a bunch of terrible individuals, but that he was making a film about a bunch of good-hearted and intentioned, yet flawed people, with a level of personality that only someone who was a part of that community could probably understand. Once again, I offer that this is to show that this is not a critical movie, but labor of love. It takes a high level of understanding and involvement with this type of personality to make such a poignant movie about them, and the fact that he's willing to admit such deep flaws about them, and therefore himself, says a lot about how much he cares.

Story: In Manhattan, Isaac matures. throughout much of the beginning of the film, in fact almost throughout the entire film until he is left by Mary, he is immature. This is characterized by both the decisions he makes, (IE: dating mary and quitting his job because it's unfulfilling), the way he talks to people (he is pretty much incapable of having a real adult conversation with anyone without cracking a bunch of silly jokes so often it becomes difficult to distinguish when he's joking and when he is serious.), and the way his life is contrasted by Tracy's. This last point is the most important, as I think that almost the entire point of having him date such a young woman was simply to showcase how immature he was: in almost every situation, she proves to be the more mature one of the group, despite her age: she is more willing to admit her love, she takes the breakup far better than Mary did, and she has the common sense to know the water is because the pipes are rusty. Even the activities she and Isaac engage in are far more mature than those of Isaac and Mary. Isaac and Mary go to a museum and walk on the moon base while discussing Mary's past husband in a way so romantic the only person who I could think of that would do so would be high-schoolers, in that they may not be able to identify what was wrong with previous relationships. Isaac and Tracy go to photography exhibits and eat chinese food in bed. Further evidence Isaac is an extremely immature character: He argues with his friend over girlfriends in a high-school, and he is afraid to sleep in his apartment alone. But from observing Mary's equally immature behavior, and identifying what was wrong with the way she left him, Isaac matured. He begins to understand that there is a reason that when he dates women who have pasts as being unstable in relationships, (I'm using this to describe his former lesbian wife, even if it doesn't work *that* well.) the relationships do not pan out. The first evidence we get is his restaurant conversation with Emily, where he has not fully matured, as evidenced by his nostalgia of Tracy, but there are a few pointers in this scene to show that he has, to some degree, matured. 1. Despite the fact that he is most likely lonely, having come out of a long-term relationship, he makes no attempt to court Emily, despite the fact that it would probably work, since she, to, is damaged. He doesn't because he knows this would be taking advantage of her, the way Mary took advantage of his availability. The second is the fact that he does not correct her when she says he introduced Yale and Mary. Before all this, he wouldn't be able to resist the opportunity to not only alleviate himself of blame, but also correct someone in the process. But he now realizes that this would only hurt Elizabeth's feelings, and he has nothing to gain by it, so he stays silent. But his transformation is not complete. He runs to find tracy, only catching her just before she leaves. She is mature enough to know that even if she gives the relationship that is fun another try, since he is more intelligent than her, even though that's mostly because he's been on earth longer than her, it will not work, and the smarter thing for them both to do is just to go on with their lives. Isaac realizes this while he is speaking to her, which is why he stops speaking, because he doesn't want to embarrass himself with his own stupidity any more, as well as the fact that he just wants to leave her alone.

My final thoughts are this: The movie serves two purposes, one to show both the good and bad sides of life in upscale NYC, and another to showcase a character study of an ignorant man learning about love and life.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1adz20,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1adz20/manhattan_a_story_of_maturity/,

&gt;A police sergeant is sent to a Scottish island village in search of a missing girl whom the townsfolk claim never existed. Stranger still are the rites that take place there.

&gt;The Wicker Man is generally well regarded by critics. Film magazine Cinefantastique described it as ""The Citizen Kane of Horror Movies"", and during 2004 the magazine Total Film named The Wicker Man the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. A scene from this film was #45 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

**Note that this is the 1973 original, not the 2006 Nicolas Cage remake.** I should think that most people would realise that, but I think it's worth pointing that out just in case. By all accounts, the remake was absolutely terrible and I wouldn't want anyone to be subjected to that. I've also been informed that there are also two versions of the film, a theatrical release and a directors cut. I'm not going to officially endorse one or the other as it doesn't strike me as a gigantic issue, I'll try and recap the differences between the two in the discussion thread to nullify any possible confusion.

The discussion thread for this film will be posted on Monday the 25th.

I watched this last night and was very pleasantly surprised. Granted, I'm a huge sucker for time travel films, but this one really shined through the rest for me.

I loved that the main character was just some regular guy. He seemed to just be blundering along, almost passively living his life. His character was developed so smoothly with little clues to who this guy was (e.g, a little overweight, clumsy, distracted, out of breath, bored, etc..)

The ""everything that has happened, will happened"" theory of time travel is what made this film so much fun to watch as the pieces came together. Just as it was getting predictable in it's execution of filling in the past, it threw me for a loop that I really should've seen coming, which kept things very interesting.

For me, the emotional heart of the movie was the bicycle girl. She felt like the real protagonist, and I felt myself more interested in how she was going to escape the craziness and the pointless trauma that she endured throughout the movie. Just when it seemed that things were going very badly for her, it turned around and it seemed that she would be ok, only to have things take a turn for the worse.

I had several problems with the film that I'd love to open to discussion:

First, the plot was very predictable at every turn. The second the robbers walk into the shop, you know that Tom is going to save the day. When Foggarty claims Tom is actually Joey, it is again obvious this is true. I obviously can't go through every plot point, but throughout the film very little caught me off guard. All of the supposedly ""surprising"" moments were moments that would actually be shocking if they happened in real life, but of course in the world of fiction the surprising thing happens more often than not, so you have to work a little harder to catch your audience off guard.

Second, the film was riddled with cliches. The storyline with Tom's son Jack and his bully has been done a million times, and this film's take was as stereotypical as it gets. The baseball scene was straight out of, well, every high school based TV show/movie ever made, and it wasn't even done particularly well. Another is the two dimensional, stereotypical portrayal of the idyllic small town. Another is the son shooting Foggarty (Something else that annoyed me is that the film never revisits this scene as far as I could tell, which seems odd considering how important it was.) Another is the classic fight-transitions-into-emotional-sex scene. I could go on...but I won't.

Now that I think about it, these two points go hand in hand, as the reason the film is so predictable is partly *because* of the fact it's riddled with cliches.

Also, the score was generic and the choreography was disjointed and too slow.

I guess what I'm getting at is that because of the reasons I mentioned and others, I had no emotional or intellectual investment in the movie.

I didn't entirely dislike the film. Most of the acting was great, the dialogue had a few shining moments and the intro was fantastic. I do, however, think it undeserving of its status as ""Critically Acclaimed"".

I wish they never hired Damon hack Lindelof :(,75,45,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/utci3/prometheus_in_space_no_one_can_hear_your/,"Edit: Also, sorry for the horrible grammar. I wish I knew how to write in a more professional manner.

Prometheus was a beautiful looking and ambitious film, yet it was horribly written and edited disappointment - I wanted to love this movie. I don't understand how the product I saw on the screen was the final cut.

For starters, it had one of the worse screenplays I've watched in a long time and they really dropped the ball with most of the story arcs it built up, dropping almost every single one. Lindelof seems to have totally misunderstood everything about Alien/s. His whole shtick is questions are better than answers, being vague allows each of us to have a different and unique experience like looking at a painting of abstract art. BAH regardless, creators of artistic material should aim to reach for something more than meh which this film was. I hate him.

If you ignore the flimsy characters, plot holes and heavy handed symbolism, you get a pretty thrilling sci fi horror though. Are there too many writers in the mix with modern movies? Multi million dollar projects seem to literally be losing the plot. Also, like tree of life it seemed like it was trying to encompass everything, yet wound up as a compilation of confusing rough cuts. It also has the plot of alien VS predator which is a film that I pretend doesn't exist most of the time. Uninspired, misdirected or confused by the writers. So many moments of excitement though. HR Giger art coming to life was cool. New monsters were cool even though they seem to have done it just because it was expected. Also the message of ""everything is alien and we have to get as far away from it because it will KILL YOU ALL"" was so clumsily narrated. 

The beginning/middle and end was horrible sludge. The squid baby was painful (in many ways) to watch and could have been one of those scenes which people talk about forever but the punchline fell flat. Why didn't anybody notice her injuries nor the squid baby in the next room? What happened to the people in the hazmat suits from the previous scene? Blown up?, but she didn't knock them out.. they just were never seen again. If there were other ships, why was there only one engineer left? and why did he chase down the last human when he could have just gotten on another ship (yes, he didn't expect the squid baby) but that's just stupid.

The religous theme was unneccesary, underdeveloped. Aliens spawning all life on the planet using their DNA... somebody doesn't understand science, Evolution doesn't work that way... Chariot of the gods boring crud ""AVP all over again"". There were a more than a few idiotic parts to the plot. There were humans, engineers, worms, dicksnakes, zombie humans, squid babies, soft skinned xenomorph.... too many fucking different/unexplained aliens

It was unsatisfying as a stand-alone film, they knew they needed to keep some kind of connection to Alien, but they didn't bother to make it fit in perfectly with continuity. 

I think this movie needed one of those “Parental Advisory” stickers with the warning “This was designed by committee”. I'm hoping somebody can convince me it wasn't as bad as I thought.

Thoughts?,31,5,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/liol2/the_big_lebowski_theory_donny_is_not_a_real/,"I heard about this theory in talking with friends and it seemed pretty interesting so i wanted to see that r/truefilm thought or if anyone else had heard about this as well.

The basic theory is: Donny is not real. He is a figment of Walter's imagination or a hallucination resulting from his PTSD from Vietnam. Walter is the only one that can see him and interact with him, and The Dude (i think anyways) just indulges Walter because thats his nature.

Some things to back up this theory:

All the bowling league teams are 2 to a team in the movie: Jesus and his friend, the guy Walter pulls the gun on and his teammate. (Walter and The Dude)

Donny only bowls strikes the entire movie

The only time Donny is acknowledged in the film by The Dude is a simple, ""Thank you Donny"".

So what would it take for a horror film to actually scare you? The closest I've ever actually come to being frightened in a film was when I was watching a little known Japanese horror film called [Pulse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286751/). It was poorly written, acted and shot but there was something so eerie about the sets, the dark and haunting soundtrack that is a lot more ambient than in your face and the way in which scenes would last longer than they naturally should have, instead of cutting away or having a jump scare in a suspenseful scene the shot would linger and my paranoia got the better of me, it freaked me the hell out.

I'd love to see more horror films have longer scenes that don't instantly cut away when the bad guy jumps into frame, being forced to watch a (hopefully likeable) character being killed/attacked and being helpless to prevent harm is a pretty powerful emotion if done right. It would an a great way to shock me, although I'd hope they had a bit more tact than something like the 9 minute rape scene in Irreversible.

1376400318.0,26,self.TrueFilm,1k9y6w,Weerasethakul and Lynch: Binaries of the Bizarre,27,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1k9y6w/weerasethakul_and_lynch_binaries_of_the_bizarre/,"Just as an ominous giant appears to Dale Cooper in his weakest moment in David Lynch’s classic television series Twin Peaks, Boonsong reveals himself to his father in Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, two liminal beings existing to deliver ethereal knowledge to the protagonist. These two filmmakers both have an obsession with the bizarre and a desire to explore the human condition as art. However, where Lynch sees evil in the hearts of men, Weerasethakul seems to see light. Not to say that Lynch does not have any harbingers of light in his films, but he certainly has an obsession with darkness and its control over the light. Weerasethakul is just the opposite: he has an obsession with light and its control over darkness. In this way, they are two halves of a whole or a cross-cultural yin and yang.
	
Why are these two cinemas of the bizarre so fundamentally different? A large factor must be a difference of culture in their lives. Lynch developed his art in the seedy underbelly of 1970s Philadelphia, surely revealing the darkness that so troubles his films. Weerasethakul spent most of his life in Thailand, until his film school training in Chicago, where the darkness of America could have influenced him, but his Thai roots seemed to be too strong for penetration. While he does address certain Westernized aspects of his own culture, such as the tackiness of Boonmee’s funeral, the film remains meditatively Thai in nature. Lynch’s films remain meditatively American in nature, but not the smiling American Dream kind of America, instead the “dream of dark and troubling things” that plagues us all. Lynch explores darkness and corruption of men, while Weerasethakul explores their escape from that corruption.
	
Lynch’s America is one of crime, seediness, and the supernatural. In many of his films, he creates hopeful protagonists who are striving for a chance to succeed in the cutthroat world, but ultimately they succumb to the pressures around them and allow darkness to envelope them. Even films with seemingly happy endings maintain an aura of darkness, such as in Blue Velvet. While Jeffrey Beaumont may have helped end the crime spree of Frank Booth, he sacrificed his innocence in the process. Having flirted with death and succumbed to the allures of intense lust, Beaumont is left a grizzled man where the curious boy from the beginning of the film once stood. So, even as he stands in the kitchen with his girlfriend watching a robin perch on the windowsill as if nothing has ever been wrong in the world, we know that things are not the same. That it’s only a matter of time.
	
This is the sort of darkness that Lynch toys with in his films. It is unforgiving and unrelenting. It ruins the hearts of human beings, and if it does not kill them, it changes them permanently. Lynch successfully blends slow cinema and the bizarre, and sometimes even the absurd, into something truly terrifying to the point where he makes us wonder whether torture can be art. While he uses many of the same techniques as Weerasethakul, his work is built on different, American foundations that do not lend themselves to hope. He challenges us to face the darkness hidden in the hearts of men and come out on the other side.
	
What lays on this other side? Perhaps it is Weerasethakul and his own brand of the bizarre. Where Lynch explores the darkness of America, Weerasethakul explores the hopeful nature of Thailand. While not refraining from criticizing his own culture, he seems to embrace many of its aspects.  Uncle Boonmee recalling his past lives is, on a human level, the escape from Lynch’s darkness. It is a reflection on things that have passed in order to move towards the light and escape the burdens of the material world. Uncle Boonmee recalling his past lives is, on a societal level, Thailand reflecting on its past states of existence, in order to reconcile them with its current state of existence.
	
Uncle Boonmee is dying and he wants to be reincarnated into something better or at least something equally good, so he reflects on his life and all the steps and missteps it contains. These reflections stare into the face of darkness, perhaps a strange form of Lynch’s darkness, in an unrelenting fashion, until one or the other recedes. Uncle Boonmee forces the darkness to recede. 	The arrival of Boonmee’s dead wife and transformed son is not merely a meeting for sentimental purposes, but a meeting of reconciliation. Boonmee gets a chance to say all the things that he should have said to his wife while she was alive. He gets a chance to speak to his disappeared son one final time. In these chances, there are more reflections on darkness. Boonmee had a part in the fate of his family and must tackle those issues. If Boonmee had been a better father, his son would not have felt the need to disappear into the jungle in order to become a Monkey Ghost. In these moments, Boonmee’s past lives are his family’s lives and their reflections. They are not meant as strictly Boonmee’s, but as all the lives Boonmee has affected and lived through. If he can confront the mistakes he’s made, the darkness will recede and Boonmee makes it one step closer to light.
	
Uncle Boonmee’s light is death. All he hopes for is a peaceful death and a satisfactory reincarnation. As Weerasethakul takes us through the mystical, and sometimes disturbing, events of the film, he is taking us through Boonmee’s confrontational journey. Having returned to his original birthplace, Boonmee lays down to die. Throughout the film, he confronted different elements of darkness: his family, his violent past, his allegorical past (which may have been a literal past life), and the possibilities of his future. In Boonmee’s mind, he has done as much as he can. He slides into death, both hopefully and peacefully, with his loved ones surrounding him.   The light succeeds.
	
Boonmee’s death is juxtaposed to a Lynchian death, which would have been torturous and violent, with no hope for any future but some unpleasant purgatory. In this way, the two filmmakers’ work creates a bottleneck of the bizarre, which visually manifests itself as a bowtie. In the beginning of a David Lynch film, the darkness exists, but there are many courses of action that the characters can take (the wide, left end of the bowtie). As the film goes on, options decrease, thus creating a bottleneck of darkness (the tight point in the middle of the bowtie). Here, as options have run out, we succumb to the darkness of the film. Out of that bottleneck, Weerasethakul’s work begins, leading us out of darkness and into light (the widening right side of the bowtie). By the end of Uncle Boonmee’s journey, we have reached the other side along with him, and go forth into the light (the wide right end of the bowtie).
	
Lynch’s work seems to hold no hope for the state of America, but *Uncle Boonmee...* does seem to contain an element of hope for Thailand. By reflecting on the country’s different states of existence, Weerasethakul is proposing a future. The allegory of the catfish and the princess could be interpreted as a past state of Thailand, one dominated by mythological religious practices. Boonmee reflects on his murder of communists in a war, revealing political issues that rise to the surface of his life, which most likely remain prevalent in most Thais’ minds. Political reflections remain vague, but they are certainly present. Perhaps the vignette of the militants’ relationship with the Monkey Ghost is another form of allegory for Thai politics. Boonmee’s reversion to a secluded life of agriculture perhaps suggests a reversion within the Thai societal landscape. If we are to look past individualistic interpretations of the film, some leaps must be made in order to reconcile the allegorical nature of the film with the real life politics of Thailand.
	
The ending of the film, after Boonmee has died, seeks to present a new status quo for Thai society. Traditional religion has been replaced by a religion of the media. Boonmee’s family remains glued to the screen, not even noticing their body doubles, which stand not five feet from where they are watching. This sequence makes viewers acutely aware of the fact that they are glued just as intently as the family is. We must be looking at screens all of the time. The pure, natural world has been replaced with a virtual, digital world. The status quo of civilization has changed.
	
If we are looking at Lynch and Weerasethakul as a kind of yin and yang, we are also recognizing the necessity of both sides of the coin in order to create equilibrium of mood and style. This recognition is what allows us to accept both Lynch’s darkness and Weerasethakul’s hope, without rejecting one or the other. They can both exist and do, in fact, complement each other. The success of these kinds of cinema proves that film is still alive and well as a medium, and perhaps reaching a new golden age. When pertinent binaries and comparisons can be drawn between two filmmakers that are seemingly worlds away, such as what has been done here, we can be confident that film has succeeded. It has become a global art with a universal language that we can all understand, and it has accomplished the task of turning the human condition into an art form.
	
'The most beautiful thing here is that, with this slow, bizarre cinema in this postmodern, post-Structuralist paradigm, these interpretations are merely interpretations. The art is so raw that emotions billow forth from the most unusual places, rendering the playing field so that my interpretation can be emotionally different from the next person’s interpretation. In this, I am confident that both Weerasethakul and Lynch would be extremely satisfied. They did not set out to create something concrete or definable. They set out to create a brand new kind of cinema, one that is based around feeling and not thinking, sensing and not understanding. It's about believing.

I refer to films where the element is visible to the audience, but invisible to the characters.

Fight Club, Stranger Than Fiction, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, and even the director's cut of Donnie Darko used this technique to memorable effect. I feel like, as with any special effect, it was effective because it was used sparingly or only when appropriate.

Compare this with the recent Tai Chi Zero, which had a lot going for it with a gorgeous aesthetic, great crane pan shots, and clever transitions. But it cranked this technique up to 11, eventually distracting me from the story. I see the technique popping up in more short films as well.

What are your thoughts on this phenomenon? Will it become a common trope as a way to give context (compared to the Saved By the Bell/House of Cards technique of directly addressing the audience)?

I understand some of the criticisms leveled at the somewhat one-sided portrayal of Oscar Grant.  I too, found the film a little manipulative, playing up his good qualities, and down-playing his flaws.  It helped that it showed his tendency to lose his temper, but it still seemed relatively one-sided.  Some of the dialogue felt a little corny/clunky in places too.  Maybe a little too conventional of a narrative for my taste also.

But, all of that stuff was pushed from my mind during the final half hour.  Sure, the police and the guy that Oscar fights with on the BART are one-dimensional characters, and the film has felt somewhat manipulative in its portrayal of Oscar up to that point.  I think the climax still works though, because it is a terrible tragedy with or without the insistence on Oscar's inherent goodness.  It was absolutely gut-wrenching.  I haven't seen a film that left me so stunned in a long time.  It wasn't the best film I've seen this year, but it had a unique effect that none of the others have had.

I'll reiterate that these are my quickly thrown together thoughts having just gotten home from the theater.  We'll see how I feel as the film marinates a little bit.  What did /r/TrueFilm think though?  Powerful tragedy?  One-dimensional portrait?  Heavy handed?

1375045660.0,24,self.TrueFilm,1j8gvn,"""confessions of a dangerous mind""- 2002, George Clooney - film discussion",29,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1j8gvn/confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind_2002_george/,"So there was a discussion about a month ago about George Clooney as a director in whole. I would like to have a conversation about this movie in particular, exclusive of Clooneys overall career. I'd rather not talk about his celebrity but rather this instance of really good film (IMHO)

I first saw this movie years ago and loved it without knowing why. In discussion with my girlfriend, I found she had not seen it, so we watched it together last night. As its been a while since seeing the film I didn't remember every detail but enough so that I could focus on some of the more interesting aspects surrounding the story itself. A few of which I will discuss.

First I want to touch on the cinematography. Newton Sigel is a TV DP that has in the last ten years moved into film. Most notably he shot Drive for Refn. Anyway, this film is a standout in Sigels career and deserves mentioning. The most striking aspect of the visual for the film was the use of color. The color pallet of the 60's and 70's is well represented in the production design, and echoed in Sigels use of colored light. This visual echo provides a compliment to the world that Barris lives in. Each different portion of his life has its own color scheme, feel and visual reference point. For example, the scenes in Helsinki and East Berlin are in stark contrast to his appearances in the TV world as a producer and later host. This dichotomy of visual elements enforces the divide chuck feels in his life. 

The second visual aspect that really added to the story is centered around what's on the screen and how it is shown. The first notion of interest is when Chuck is taking a tour of CBS studios and asks for an application. As the shot continues on the tour, he is revealed later as a tour guide himself, he has become part of the world he was earlier looking in on. After that we see two girls talking in the break room and reveal him, theoretically several months later, as he overhears what he needs to do to get laid, and applies for management. The movement and theatrical devices used in this shot are similar to techniques used in live theatre and TV. The shot itself feels like a choreographed dance from a broadway show, but instead of singing the story we glide through events seamlessly in one fluid motion.
The next time this happens, we are in penny's bathroom and he comes up with e idea for the dating game. The whole set is replaced with a boardroom as he pitches the idea. This was done in one unbroken take. This effect coupled with the earlier example provide a sense of expediency. His life at those times moved quickly and we feel a bit of the whirlwind he must have felt caught up in.

The film uses several key moments like this to instill a sense of what Chuck is going through. This is important because he is by all accounts not a very likable character. He's an asshole to his friends and coworkers and his game shows are about ridicule and embarrassment of individuals based on core emotions like love and acceptance. Despite these truths though, you end up sympathizing with Chuck and his flaws because you live the film through his eyes.

The last of these visual elements that help to instill the story's deeper ideas is toward the end of the film. As he begins to deteriorate under the criticism and eventual failure of his shows, he slips into a dream state that reflects his inner turmoil. His real life is fading. His fantasy/escapist life of being a CIA agent is falling apart because of the mole and he is paranoid beyond reclamation. The way this scene is presented through visual motifs and creative camera work is engrossing and painful. When he breaks down on stage throwing the unknown comic off the gong show, my girlfriend was cringing so hard she had to turn away! There is a moment also where he sees a matte painting of the place in Helsinki, where he shot his second kill. As his world is falling apart around him, so is the word of the film that we trusted. We take the film for fact all be it possibly stretched fact, until he himself starts to question his sanity. Than we begin to loose faith in the truth of the narrative. Just like he does in his own life.

This is where Clooney has masterfully connected the brilliant Kaufman script to a compelling screen version. The film itself twists and turns through the world of Chuck Barris. We are told the story through his eyes, Through and through. Even when he looses his grip and is presented with the secrets of his childhood, we learn this for the first time, though we've seen it before in the film. Example; There is a brief glimpse of him in a hotel room being sung happy birthday to by a prostitute. We see this and than cut away. No explanation no relevance, it's just something he did. Than later we see that he was abused by his mother, and the image of the prostitute comes back, with his mother in her place. We now know this image, but not in this context. Barris himself asks the prostitute to sing to him with the veil. Neither of them know why he wants this, but he does it anyway. We are shown his repressed emotion in the same way he would have experienced it later as his world is breaking down. We connect both images at the same he does.

There are several small mistakes or holes in the film, I understand this. I am also willing to forgive these flaws due to the large amount of great filmmaking crammed into this one movie. Many movies coming out now have two hours of schlock and maybe ten minutes of interesting thought provoking filmmaking. I applaud the effort and thought that Clooney, Sigel, Sam Rockwell and even Soderbergh (who was the EP) put into making a well rounded and interesting movie.

I wanted very much to like it - it was well shot (especially given its small budget), it was well acted (mainly on the part of Elejalde), and the first act provided a good hook. It had the strength of its convictions in committing to a deterministic model of time travel, which contrasts with the “anything goes” interpretations found in most Hollywood treatments of the subject. But I think this commitment to a concept is the film’s greatest failing: by the time it was over, I felt as though I had just seen a sequence of arbitrary things that had no reason to be put to film. All the events were dictated by the logic of “it happened because it happened” - looking at the movie as a whole, they reduce to *things* posited in an atemporal manner. Literally anything - from no story at all, to the most absurd story imaginable - could have been justified in this manner. Perhaps the film was meant to pose an existential question (why is anything as it is, really?), but I don’t think this made for good storytelling. By the time the third act rolled around, and I knew that I would just be seeing the same causal loop for the third time (albeit from a different point of view), I had lost interest in the story and just wanted it to end. There’s an unexpected element at the conclusion - it’s revealed that Héctor had really killed the biker, not his wife - but for me, this didn’t add much of substance.

I would contrast this movie with two others that deal with causal loops more successfully: *Twelve Monkeys* and *Primer*. *Twelve Monkeys* provides the viewer with engaging elements of mystery as the story unfolds, and it only unfolds once - it never falls into tiresome repetition as *Timecrimes* does in its third act. *Primer* uses causal loops as part of a bigger story in order to explore issues of scientific discovery, friendship and trust while amazing the viewer with its complexity. A film that strikes me as similar to *Timecrimes* is 2010’s *Rubber* by Quentin Dupieux, which has no time travel at all. *Rubber* opens with an ode to “no reason”, explicitly informing the viewer of the arbitrary nature of what they’re about to see - *Timecrimes* adheres to this credo too, constructing its plot from arbitrary, atemporal propositions as I mentioned above. And *Rubber* commits to its concept - it definitely does depict a sentient, psychokinetic tire which kills people. But it’s also got a metastory about the “directors” of its surface story, who kill their audience by feeding them a poison turkey. Their leader, played by Stephen Spinella, starts out in control of things but is eventually killed by the monster that he’s unleashed. He’s reminiscent of *Timecrimes’* time machine controller - played by Vigalondo himself - who seems to know what he’s doing at the start of the film, but ends up as the hapless pawn of the crazy man whose journey he has facilitated. Both films are about the mechanics of things happening. And both seemed more like conceptual exercises than films, leaving me with a sense of empty dissatisfaction by the end. *Rubber* never rises above its anti-Hollywood conceit to provide a story of any depth, just as *Timecrimes* never rises above its time travel mechanic.

But what I want to know is, have I misjudged *Timecrimes* (or *Rubber* for that matter)? Is there something here that I’m overlooking?

There were beautiful interior shots of homes, outdoor shots of festivals, a few beach shots, and street shots showing vendors and daily life.

What struck me as odd was that all of these shots presented a very idealized version of India. There was no trash in the canal, the streets did not have raw sewage flowing in the gutter, the festival was much nicer than Indian festivals typically are. The streets were rather empty and vehicles were absent, specifically the ubiquitous scooter. Even the market was just selling flowers rather than normal goods.

Putting this in context of other movies about India made for Western consumption that I have seen, a theme develops where these movies often gloss over the extreme poverty and suffering in India (more people starve to death in India than all of Africa combined). Some movies like Slumdog Millionaire even treat the subject rather lightly, presumably with the defense that this makes it more palatable to Western audiences who would otherwise ignore the issue.

I compare this to movies about Africa. I cannot think of a mainstream Western movie set in Africa that does not acknowledge at least briefly the suffering and poverty in that continent.

I want to specifically talk about the composition and long takes.

   We see a very different approach here than we do in traditional film. But I think it fits the film very well. He manages to encompass and properly address multiple hot button issues in todays society without ever feeling preachy or pushing opinions/solutions on the viewer. 
I think first and foremost does the camera work support the theme of authenticity. The long takes give the viewer the impression of being IN the scene. Most of the time camera movement is kept to a minimal to provide an **unbiased** view of the event. I find it very easy to place myself in the scenes and through that feel much more connected to what is happening. Haneke shows plain and blunt what is happening as not to influence any opinion the viewer might be forming. Traditional film is much more obvious in the regard that it tells you what to think most of the time.

   Another thing I want to talk about are the cuts. Often in the middle of a conversation or action we just cut to black. It's almost like we're sitting in front of a TV switching the channel but Haneke has the control. This is where much more of his intentions shine through. We see exactly what he want us to see. Most of the time uncomfortable scenes that makes us want to look away. But he makes us watch and therefor think about how we would act in such situations. The cuts show how unconnected everything is in the end. The first time I watched this film like you would any other from beginning to end. Then when I got more interested I started watching single scenes over and over again. I really think this movie is designed to be watched multiple times. The loosely connected plot almost invites it. We never see the whole picture though. Just bits and pieces... As promised in the title ""Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys"".

I could go off on several scenes and go into detail but I don't want to turn this into an essay :)

What are your thoughts on the matter?

It's also funny to see Tommy Wiseau thrown into the lot, but what's amazing is that he seems to fit in! There's no denying that Wiseau has a signature *style* that he's established with The Room; maybe you could argue that The Room is merely just the sum of lots of happy accidents and failures (which it is), but there's a certain way that the elements of the movie coalesce into something wholly distinct (the fact the guys in the video can imitate it so perfectly indicates that). The Room isn't just the average throwaway movie; it's a movie that practically invents its own style. It's hard to give Wiseau and The Room less credit than David Lynch gets. After all, how many of Lynch's own scenes can Lynch himself find any way to explain? The dialogue and cinematography in Lynch's films are also possessed of their own intense eccentricity to a point that obscures method or intention--just like Wiseau (yes I've compared David Lynch to Tommy Wiseau-THIS IS /R/TRUEFILM!)

I suppose this is where I'm going with all of this: what should we give more credit to when it comes to appraising these cult movies? Is it the deliberate choices and motives of the director (as interpretable as they are in such murky movies) or is it the distinctness or maturation of sundry elements into something that feels whole?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1e3r4y,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1e3r4y/what_makes_the_work_of_more_mysterious_cult/,

I finally got the chance to see this movie the other day.  Starting out, I felt like it had some of the freshest and most genuine writing and acting that I had ever observed in a film.  Usually, I don't get engrossed in movies with this style of camera work, however I found myself very into it while watching this film.  Anne Hatheway's Oscar-nominated performance needs no vying for, but I was very surprised to see that Bill Irwin's stellar performance went unnoticed by the Academy.

However, as engrossing as the film was to me in the first half, there was a pivotal moment where things began to fall flat for me.  I am specifically writing about the *dishwasher* scene.  The scene in question is extended to such a length that, if you're paying attention to structure, you begin to question to point of it until its climax, where Kym's father is shaken by the appearance of his son's plate.  I feel like this is a beautifully orchestrated scene, but what it did was build up an expectation for the rest of the movie, namely the wedding reception.  As drawn out as it is, I expected the montage of people dancing and having fun to top the dishwasher scene in terms of a sudden interruption of their celebration.  I personally felt let down as an audience member when this didn't happen, although I acknowledge it as an artistic choice to subvert the audience's expectations.

Pixar is known for making amazing timeless movies with each one they bring out (arguably there are a couple weaker ones, but over all I feel it can be argued that most of them are classics)

Brave, though, I feel wasn't as good. It didn't have the Pixar magic.

The question is why. I think it's because the other Pixar movies, the ""classics"" went much deeper than what's on the surface.

The Toy Story trilogy on the surface is about toys that come to life, but really it's about growing up and moving on from the world you once lived in.

Finding Nemo is about overcoming forces that you would normally never in your life attempt to tackle if it weren't for trying to save your lost son.

The Incredibles looks at xenophobia, superheros being forced into hiding by a society that doesn't accept them any more. Shunned because they're different.

Wall-E is the story of coming to terms with feelings of abandonment, alienation, and outdatedness, and then overcoming those obstacles. (Along with another huge side-message about humanity fucking ourselves up through over-consumer tendencies)

Up is the story of almost giving up on your hopes and dreams and then finding new life in a new adventure, essentially telling you to never let go of your dreams.

Etc.

Brave dealt with a ""going your own way"" type of message, but I feel it did so in a very simple way. The main character didn't want to follow tradition, so she went against it. There wasn't any deeper message in there, it was all pretty much on the surface.

Also, I think there's a certain level of fantasy that's in all the other movies that was missing from this one. Living toys, superheroes, robots from the future. This movie played out basically like a Scottish legend (though I think I read somewhere that they were going for that kind of feel)

Also I felt like the movie was pretty predictable. Once [her mother got turned into a bear](/spoiler) I basically had the rest of the movie figured out.

What do you guys think? Would you consider Brave to be a classic movie like (most of) the rest of Pixar's catalog? Or was it a weaker movie from an otherwise top tier studio?

Also, I neither know nor care about ""The Hunger Games"", so let's ignore that franchise in this discussion.

***

My reasons for finding the film bad:

1) The direction was bad.

- Most clichéd shots ever used very often (like the final couple smiling at the camera and the subsequent walk into/from the camera).

- Poor storytelling (character motivation pulled out of the ass, character background only defined by flashbacks and WTF dreamsequences).

- Many unrelated WTF scenes (basketball, riverbank walk with Kitano, the intro scene with the previous(?!) winner) trying to put some hidden meaning or metaphor that I can't find, try as I might.

2) The acting was bad.

- Actors dying in the most theatrical way (pronouncing their last word, then hanging their head lifelessly).

- Some actors acting as if they'd been literally retarded (Shuya's best friend waving like Rain Man at the WTF reversed basket ball scene).

3) The screenplay was bad.

- Don't tell me how great BR was at showing the demise of system and humanity, because all the related metaphors were thrown right into the viewer's face. That's not how this stuff works.

- Plot devices all over the film, things happening right when needed, things not happening when not needed etc.

- Plot holes (no one fighting a whole one night; none of the parents caring about their kids being killed off by one another; none of the army personnel doubting Kitano's ""it's over"" decision, who the hell was Kitano supposed to be anyway?).

- Characters behaving like total fucking idiots (Oh no, I just poisoned my friend, let my other friends kill each other, then free the guy I hated and wanted to kill in the first place and commit suicide! Hey, my classmates want to kill me, I'd better go for a run; fortunately I brought my tracksuit and running shoes to this field trip!)

4) The music was poor.

- Generally it sounded like an 80's ""B"" action movie's soundtrack.

- It didn't fit the atmosphere of many scenes at all.

5) The WTF moments

- Some characters dying after a single shot, others living and killing with 30 bullets in their bodies; wounded characters climbing steps and ladders effortlessly and then walking with a stick, looking barely alive and things like this.

- The WTF scenes already described above.

- The WTF painting at the end. Was that supposed to be drawn by some child?

- The kid eating a handful of confetti at the basketball scene.

- That good guy that had survived the game once already dying at the end, just like that.

- Kitano resurrected for one more call and one more cookie and then dying more theatrically than all the others have managed so far.

- And many others in this category…

( 6) Poor effects, but I don't really care about this; the film's 12 years old and I'm always willing to ignore bad effects when the movie's good otherwise )

The main characters in both were extremely emotionally detached from the world and their lives. They both, somewhat innocently, committed murder without actually having violent tendencies. Both protagonists even denied alcohol, but smoked and drank coffee excessively. 

The pace of the stories seemed similar, as well as the overall mood. Even in the finality of the stories (both were executed), they expressed no remorse or regrets over the events that lead them to their death.

I suspect this has something to do with Hollywood's uneasy place on the intersection between art and commerce.  One can view a film as art that achieves something between the sublime and the ridiculous, or as product that is either fresh or rotten.  Then there are weird systems that are neither here nor there, such as Ebert's imperious thumbs up/thumbs down system that judges films as if determining the fate of gladiators in Ancient Rome.  And let's not forget the star system -  I've got an idea of what a 5 star restaurant is like, but what does a 5 star Dalí look like?  Perhaps we'd know if he'd ever worked for Jack Warner. Ah, but he [did](http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/dali_painting_and_film/dali_moma_0708_20.htm).  No matter.

Anyway, I describe this mingling of art and commerce to provide some context for a discussion of what I find to be the most irksome concept bouncing around film discussion forums; The idea that an older film that a reviewer fails to connect with simply ""doesn't hold up"" - that it might once have been good, but isn't any longer.  There are many reasons I find this idea problematic, but I will try to consider only the most pressing of them here.

Firstly, when one pronounces that something ""doesn't hold up"", one is assuming the comparative sophistication of modern audiences to their historic counterparts, and I don't think that's a necessarily easy case to make.   Are the works of Robert Ludlum really more sophisticated than those of Ernest Hemingway?  Are the songs of John Mayer more intricate and relevant than those of Bob Dylan?  Television viewers of the 1950's might not have had shows of the depth and complexity of a *Justified* or *Game of Thrones*, but neither did they fritter away their time on the abject banalities of *Here Comes Honey Boo Boo* or *16 and Pregnant*.   I say this not to deny that people in the past also wasted time, but to suggest that the shift in the rube-to-sophisticate ratio might not be as one directional as some of us would like to think.

After all, the plays of Shakespeare were written long, long ago, and only arrogance would lead us to believe that we appreciate them more now than did his contemporaries (or our many generations of ancestors).  Indeed, what would we think of he opinion of a high schooler who proclaimed that *Macbeth* ""doesn't hold up""?  If his point were that the language and virtue of Shakespeare isn't immediately accessible to the uninitiated modern audience, it would be unassailable - but that isn't what this particular condemnation means.  It is true that popular social tastes and grammars change, but expressive art is so intensely personal in both creation and appreciation that it would seem impossible for social trends to render a once-great artwork universally unenjoyable.  One might need to familiarize himself with the language of Shakespeare for the beauties of *Macbeth* to be revealed, but that doesn't mean that they no longer exist.  The wisdoms, the insight, and the sheer awe that has always existed in Shakespeare's art remains there, waiting to be experienced by future generations willing to engage with it.  Similarly, one might need to immerse themselves in the screen grammar of silent cinema before they get the most of Keaton or Chaplin, but the films still possess the expressive qualities that they did 80-90 years ago.

Products can become redundant with the passage of time, but art does not; art remains as wretched or triumphant as it was in the moment of it's creation.  A savvy film goer in 1939 could have recognized the hollow spectacle of *Gone With The Wind* as easily as a savvy film goer in 2012 could recognize the hollow spectacle of *The Avengers*.  These weren't films that were once great art but went bad through the years: they were never that great to begin with.

This brings me to my next (and more mercifully brief) point about the dismissal of ""doesn't hold up"" - it's not only a flattery of  the sophistication of the modern critic, it's also an excuse not to engage with the unfamiliar.  If a critic can view his failure to connect with *Citizen Kane* or *Rebel Without A Cause* as an unavoidable consequence of the passage of time, he can settle back into his comfort zones (be it the work of Terence Malik or 80's Hanna-Barbera cartoons), content to believe that he's missed nothing.  That's neither a serious nor responsible approach to film criticism, and it's one that grossly inhibits development as an intelligent, well-rounded human being.

No one has to like any given film, but it is the role on an interested critic to account for his reactions, and attempt to assess what unique qualities within the artwork provoke those reactions.  Claiming that something ""doesn't hold up"" is an avoidance of that role, rather than an acceptance of it.

The article mentions that Wan originally shot the film expecting a PG-13 rating, and was told that the whole film in general garnered an R, and not one scene by itself could be removed to change the rating.

In my opinion, MPAA is right to make this movie R just for being scary and nothing more. In fact the sheer nature of the rating system was set up to avoid emotional trauma/general negative scarring of kids. I think what truly scars kids is horror. I don't personally believe movies should be rated R for swearing and (to a degree) sex. Violence is negotiable, but I think scariness should garner an R mostly all of the time.

Over the years Cronenberg’s interest have migrated from the sort of “body horror” he was best known for. While his interests have remained about transformation he seems more interested in psychological transformations. But what is he trying to tell us in A Dangerous Method?

The performances and the film are incredibly mannered. Each character is dressed fastidiously, each syllable said seems to have been carefully considered before being enunciated (Mortensen’s Freud has the best ‘voice’ this side of Daniel Plainview), all the characters seem to be so …........... analytical. Which might still seem plausible for the characters of Jung and Freud but look at how Jung’s wife reacts to his affair, she doesn't rage, doesn’t threaten but instead ask questions in a very level tone (“Will you be coming back now?”). I refuse to believe that Cronenberg thinks that this is actually how these people acted. He is trying to tell us something but I’ll be damned if I know what it is.

That is whats confusing me the most about this film, the deliberate lack of emotion. Even when Fassbender has tied Knightly to the bed and is whipping her with his belt he barely seems excited. He might be exercising for all the passion he seems to exhibit.

And what happened in the end? Jung admits to Spielrein that she is the great love of his life. She leaves. And we are left with a shot of Fassbinder, sitting in a chair looking slightly sickly. The End. What did Fassbender’s Jung learn in this film? How did he change as a person? What was his character’s arc? What the fuck is the ending telling us?

Because I can't. I'm not sure if it's the result of my stupidity or bad filmmaking but I have no idea what happened in this movie. It's very confusing in a logical sense.

As far as I can tell the whole point is some sort of Faustian Fable about choosing between righteousness and temptation. That much is obvious. But, whether Tony (Heath Ledger/Johnny Depp/Jude Law/Colin Farrel) is ""bad"" is still unclear to me. Isn't he trying to save Valentina's soul in the end? Doesn't this count as atonement? Why should we want him to die. And why does the devil want him to die if he's supposed to be bad?

On top of this, on a whim, Valentina just gives herself to the Devil and he wins. Why would she be so stupid as to freely give away her soul? Out of spite for her father? It makes no sense to me.

Lastly I'm confused by the ending. This whole movie confused me. And I'm someone who loves bizarre, head scratching philosophical movies (my favorite films are 2001, 8 1/2, Daisies, The Seventh Seal, etc.). So am I missing something here or does everything just move too quickly in this film to make logical sense.

But I believe that *Two-Lane Blacktop* is worth talking about.

This movie took me three views to make it my favorite movie. It is multifaceted; a different movie to other viewers. You can just enjoy it for the cars that are in the movie. It can be viewed as some sort of western, [according to Richard Linklater.](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/622-ten-sixteen-actually-reasons-i-lovetwo-lane-blacktop) Or it could be a French New Wave teen picture? For me, I think it's about people without a past or future. For The Driver and his Mechanic (James Taylor and Dennis Wilson), it's all about going faster. But there may be something else, I think. Warren Oates' character is driving to escape some sort of hurt. When ever he picks up a hitchhiker, he tells a different story of why he drives. But when he's talking to James Taylor, a divorce and the Korean Ware fueled a need to escape some unwanted memories that the audience is supposed to create their own narrative. This movie stands out for me with the dialogue. Or the sparseness of it. Dialogue in film should as punctuation; it shouldn't be the other way around. Monte Hellman's direction keeps the non-actors from turning this into a poorly-acted attempt to cash in on *Easy Rider*. Again, the lack of dialogue may have some help with this.

1371518633.0,25,self.TrueFilm,1gk1ag,Still Waiting For Superman [MoS Review] (X-Post from r/movies),46,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1gk1ag/still_waiting_for_superman_mos_review_xpost_from/,"I was not expecting Man of Steel to fit entirely within the bounds of my own nostalgic conception of Superman; I was actually hoping its filmmakers would go in some uncharted directions, just as many of the more artistically adventurous graphics novels of the past decade have. My distaste for this film concerns the uncoordinated, visionless, and calculated-to-please manner in which it was ultimately assembled.

I should get the few things I did appreciate out of the way: the Kryptonian art direction, costume design, casting and the performances from Clark’s two fathers and Michael Shannon as Zod were particularly top-notch. Cavil also carries himself like a god: dignified and able to communicate his character’s great strength without having to demonstrate it. I wasn’t sure how they were going to handle Kal-El’s bumbling alter-ego considering how classically handsome the person they cast him with was, but I’ll return to that later.

The main selling point of this film was that the makers of The Dark Knight trilogy were bringing their somber, thoughtfully-written, and mostly-grounded approach to the superhero of superheroes and the adoptive world that he inhabits. This would have been a cinematic first for the character and like most people I was excited by that prospect as it had worked so effectively for the Batman mythology. As of now, whether or not that could have been a good fit for Superman is still unknown, because Zack Snyder and company only half-heartedly committed themselves to it, and only in the most superficial ways.

When I read the reviews complaining that the highbrow sci-fi approach the movie was sold as to the public was misleading, I shifted my hopes to seeing some of Snyder's until-now unique approach to action do something creative with Superman. However, Kryptonian scenes aside, Snyder's usual colorful flair and confident direction were completely absent. I would never have been able to tell Man of Steel was directed by him from just looking at it. They asked him to emulate the visual style of The Dark Knight trilogy, and the end product was a second-rate, strangely confused mix of restrained and epileptic camerawork. I do think that had Snyder been allowed to handle things with his trademark style it could have been at the very least, a visually fascinating film. People like to deride slo-mo as a cheap commercial Hollywood trend, but the content and framing of the way he put images together in 300, Watchmen and especially Legend Of The Guardians was highly artistic, and made to linger in order to be featured more communicatively.

In Man Of Steel, the schizophrenic direction made for sometimes messily composed and awkwardly choreographed action, washed out to drab blues and grays (excluding the opening on Krypton, which I thought contained the bulk of the film's creativity). When I got out of it, I was stunned to realize that strictly with regard to action, the Transformers franchise (which I’ve thought to be the embodiment of everything that’s wrong with Hollywood) were probably more entertaining watches, because the CGI and the physics they operate on seemed more consistently realistic, and the colors were vibrant. Man Of Steel isn't quite as frenetically disorienting as the universally-derided Revenge of The Fallen (the one glaring exception to my aforementioned comparison), but for a movie that was clearly going for a more realistic aesthetic, it's something analogous to that.

But as is usually the case with almost any film I’ve not enjoyed, the main reason Man Of Steel didn't work for me lies in its writing, which from a story standpoint puts a promising framework in place, only to fill each component scene with generic, sometimes awkward dialogue that the intelligently cast, fine actors make every effort to sell with little help from some amateurish framing and sluggish editing. The script in Man of Steel is far less cynically shallow than in something like a Transformers film, but it’s also painfully mediocre and clunky; other than Superman's two father figures, nobody is given much to say. I left Man Of Steel with a new appreciation for the Marvel Studios film universe. Plotting aside, the script in the worst Avengers film, Captain America, was cleverer and the actual quality of the filmmaking on display was more consistent with itself than that of Man Of Steel. Now that I think about it, every Marvel Studios film seems to have been directed more coherently.

Fan complaints about Superman Returns (2006) being pretty much devoid of any superhuman physical brawling were responded to with an almost laughable overcompensation: Superman gets to show off his powers by combating more than one physical equal, but he uses them carelessly and to devastating effect. It's just absurd how much collateral damage is inflicted during these extensive fights: skyscrapers tumbling as they’re ripped through, trains, cars, planes being routinely tossed into populated areas – all without Superman making any kind of an effort to steer the fights elsewhere or even seeming to notice what was happening to the tens of thousands of innocent bystanders; he's just fighting to prevail over the bad guy. That's something which runs directly counter to the character's traditional depiction but also counter to any character that purports to value human life enough to make it their life’s mission to protect. Superman saves humanity in a broader sense during a key part of the film’s finale, but during most of the brawls he shows little empathy for the individual mortals who are dying horribly right before his eyes, save a few key characters that are essential to the plot. Turning Metropolis into a video game environment and conveying barely any emotional regard for the consequences of all that death and destruction is what caused me to start hating the film. That’s just not the Superman I know. Superman’s real weakness isn't Kryptonite (thankfully absent from this film); it’s his love for all mankind, and this isn't something that’s effectively exploited until the very final fight between he and Zod, which I must admit to appreciating, but it was far too little and much too late for me to be able to care.

[MINOR SPOILERS]

There were a number of other smaller annoyances that helped to drag the experience down even further: the utterly silly way that Pa Kent is dispatched, the blatant and relentless product placement, and the way Kal-El’s transition into Clark the reporter is carelessly tacked on almost as an afterthought. He strolls into The Daily Planet, having no previously-established relationship to his new employers, no apparent background in journalism, and just as handsome and put-together as ever. Then he puts on his glasses, in full view of everyone, and exchanges a knowing look with Lois, as though the entire world and more specifically, the U.S. government doesn’t have his fingerprints along with footage thoroughly documenting his appearance and voice from the interrogation scene earlier in the film. To me, that was the most egregious insult to the audience’s intelligence.

It's not as though the filmmakers didn't have basically good intentions, there is just practically zero artistry being used effectively in this film. Yes, it's not Green Lantern, or Ghost Rider or Fantastic Four or X-Men Origins: Wolverine; but it is painfully mediocre, and it could and should have actually been so much better. Man Of Steel cost far too much and the character of Superman is too beloved to have what we received be considered an acceptable end result.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1371520390.0,,,True,t3_1gk1ag,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1gk1ag/still_waiting_for_superman_mos_review_xpost_from/,

I did not like it. I stopped the movie after 104 minutes because I couldn't handle it anymore. The costuming and set design is very elaborate, and I think a lot of that is good. 
But the comedy irritates me. Like when that girl came to the main character's apartment and sang an invitation to him and then he sang it back. I found that to be the opposite of entertaining.
The way the movie doesn't seem to follow any rules irritates me. When the main character tries to ""rescue"" the short-haired girl and they go driving, he asks her if she trusts him about 25 times without really explaining anything. And she goes from violently resisting him, to just being pissed at him, then laughing and sympathizing with him, then instantly back to being pissed at him.

The characters (and plot) just seem illogical.

I feel like it was written in a way where you can disregard whatever just happened prior in the film, because whatever happens next will not make sense in regard to what just happened.

Also, the guy with the sword and the fairy makeup chasing the girl in the cage with the blanket thing over her... the reason I watch movies and not theater is exactly to avoid things like that.

And the whole movie felt like it had this feeling like it was a theater production vs. a movie production. Like dramatic, loud, sort of slaptsticky stuff.

As a person who thinks of death often, and I mean OFTEN, I am incredibly impressed with the way I'm So Proud of You deals with it.  A particularly great monologue from it goes 

""He pictures himself having trouble breathing and waking to a room of concerned faces. He’d be terrified of dying his entire life and as much as he tried not to think about it, death was always in the back of his head; Around every corner and hovering on each horizon.

He had brushed shoulders with death on a few occasions but in his care free youth it had always seemed like an abstract, impossible thing to ever happen to him. But with each passing decade, he had began to gauge the time he probably had left. And by his forties- what he had considered his halfway point at best.

He had come to know one thing: You will only get older.

The next thing you know you’re looking back instead of forward. And now, at the climax of all those years of worry, sleepless nights, and denials. Bill finally finds himself, looking death in the face. Surrounded by people who no longer recognizes and feels no closer attachment to than the thousands of relatives who had come before.

And as the sun continues to set, he finally comes to realize the dumb irony in how he had been waiting for this moment his entire life. This stupid awkward moment of death that had invaded and distracted so many days with stress and wasted time.""  

Why don't more movies view death this way?  Most movies seem to treat death like no big deal.  A lot of movies even encourage it.  Even more movies glamorize it.  

I mean, I love Tarantino and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies as much as the next guy, but death is so downplayed so often.  I respect this movie for really tapping into the feeling of terror, helplessness, confusion, and tragedy that can occur from the ability to ponder our being and mortality.

One can easily point to subgenres like mumblecore where almost nothing is explained or stated, but I think that this kind of approach is also visible in more mainstream films.  Consider something like *The Road* -- not much is explained at all.  Really, there are massive gaps, but it doesn't really detract from the experience.  Or *Children of Men* - we know enough about Clive Owen's past (he was married to Julianne Moore, they had a child, the child died, and they somehow drifted apart).

HAIL (2012) is the true to life love story of real life ex-con Daniel P Jones and Leanne Letch who both play versions of themselves based in the Australian crime underworld.,28,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/12rldj/blending_documentary_and_fiction_hail_2012_is_the/,"I've been thinking over this film and it's success so far in Australia. The fact that Daniel P Jones was not only willing to go on screen and 're-tell' his story but also successfully act it out so convincingly is striking to watch. The sense of 'realness' that it creates is chilling at times. It seems to take the idea of improv and turn it up a notch, offering probably the most chilling re-telling of the Australian underworld that I've witnessed.

The director, Amiel Courtin-Wilson, had experimented with this idea in his short film CICADA which reddit had previously enjoyed:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9SWEwIb-h8&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

but HAIL has taken this further, not just filming Danny re-telling events but taking it further by having him re-enact them. 

I'm sure this isn't a new concept, and could also have possibly gone terribly wrong, but HAIL is seamless in it's portrayal of a criminal in his own habitat - a world which can at times seem inaccessible and impenetrable - but it also is able to meld in experimental filmic elements from people like Tobe Hooper and Stan Brakhage to amp up the sense of turmoil on claustrophobia experienced within it. 

A few months ago I'd started talking with Amiel here in Melbourne about the film because he is local to me and easily contactable, but my love for what this film represents is based on a gut emotional response to its technique and content. Watching it is like being on a ride at a fair where you know it will make you ill but you do it anyway. And you enjoy the journey because its affects resonate well beyond its screen time.

Could this process be as successful if the subject wasn't about a criminal? I remember being similarly excited when I'd watched Nicholas Jasenovec's 'Paper Heart' (2009) with Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera and to a lesser extent, Joaquin Phoenix in 'I'm Still Here' (2010) but they are actors playing themselves and where as they definitely blur the line between cinema and reality there is something else going on it 'Hail'. 

I'm not sure if this technique will become some kind of filmic sub-genre but it's place in cinema is still striking and completely engaging.

Most criticisms seem to focus on the film being too ""talky"" and ""static."" These criticisms however are incredibly misguided; Cosmopolis is a profoundly cinematic film that just so happens to be about language. Where A Dangerous Method illustrated the therapeutic possibilities of the act of talking itself (via Sigmund Freud’s revolutionary “talking cure” in the early twentieth century), the new film shows how language can be wielded as a dangerous weapon in the modern day world of international high finance. Cosmopolis also simultaneously and gratifyingly harks back to Videodrome in its depiction of a world where human beings seem capable of merging with, and are thus ultimately in danger of being replaced by, technology.

1335280065.0,27,self.TrueFilm,sq1c6,"Sex, ""mumblecore,"" Lena Dunham, and revisiting / revising intimacy",36,9,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/sq1c6/sex_mumblecore_lena_dunham_and_revisiting/,"I may not be the biggest proponent of so-called ""mumblecore,"" but I have appreciated the trend toward frankness in that ""movement's"" interrogation of sexuality and intimacy (think Joe Swanburg). Greta Gerwig, for example, displays what I think to be one of the more intriguing sexual performances of 2010 in *Greenberg* (Note: I'm talking about Gerwig as a figure founded in whatever ""mumblecore"" is or was; I'm not making a statement about *Greenberg* itself being a mumblecore film), showing both the casualness and the frankness of her sexual desire, mixed with the generational awkwardness of Ben Stiller's character.

Now, Lena Dunham (also, not making an argument about Dunham herself being ""mumblecore,"" just that her narrative intentions take some cues that have been setup by this ""movement,"" as well as the utilitarian benefit of being able to lump her into this broader project for the purposes of discussion) strikes me as doing something both radical and expected in *Girls* in terms of her representation of sexuality and intimacy on that show. She has represented sexuality, sexual desire, and the flaws of intimacy several times over her brief and young career, but it really is intriguing to me. In *Girls,* the *fact* of female desire is simply accepted, which is an obvious state of affairs and might only be interpreted as a radical advancement in feminist achievement in the mindset of 30 years ago, if even that recently.

But the *awkwardness* is an interesting, new thing for me as it feels entirely within the context of this generation - It feels very fresh, very real. It also, it seems to me, seems to be among the first meaningful representations of the complex social norm of *access to pornography*. What I mean is this: for the past several years, there's been an ongoing discussion culturally about the rampant access to pornography being a potential problem to true intimacy (here is [one](http://www.salon.com/2011/10/27/is_porn_ruining_our_love_lives/) of many, many examples of this discussion), and thereby, the *potential* sex lives of young people, who are exposed to and inundated with graphic sexual imagery via the internet (leading to teenage sexting, etc) essentially throughout their lives.  This is generationally new (Or is it? Obviously, everybody has had access to sexuality as children - porn mags, videos, movies. The difference here is its overall coverage and true ease of access). One sex scene in s01, e02 of *Girls* shows Dunham's character seeming conflicted desire / ambivalence indulging a very porny wish with her partner. 

So, here's my point of discussion around this idea - an idea that is forming, and certainly not fully formed:

What are some scenes or moments that seem to indicate a fundamental shift in our representation of sexuality? What are the sex scenes that really reformed how you felt sex could meaningfully be portrayed? I'm not interested in simply lurid sex, but those scenes that seem to use sex to indicate something else of significance. 

I think of some of the mumblecore films, but also *The Piano Teacher*, perhaps, etc. ... Think of this as ""research,"" not perviness.

* Weekly film analysis: Once a week (preferably on the weekend) we pick a movie to watch and then we hold an official discussion on it were we discuss themes, breakdown plots and characters, add interesting context and tidbits ETC. This would differ from r/movieclub as the actual discussion would be the main focus of the activity and not just watching the film.

* For a monthly activity we could choose a film to not discuss but breakdown analyse, and suggest metaphors/analogies/theories that arise from the film, the community will then decide what is more plausible/convincing/coherent (probably through plain old upvoting) and the winner gets to decide the next film, the catch being they will have the advantage in trying to 'keep their crown' for the next round.

1375335725.0,24,self.TrueFilm,1jh681,My interpretation of the ending of Magnolia and why I find it cruel and saddening,29,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jh681/my_interpretation_of_the_ending_of_magnolia_and/,"I watched Magnolia yesterday as part of a PTA marathon (one movie per week) and its my favourite PTA movie so far though I haven’t seen PDL and H8 yet.

Reading many of the discussion posts of the movie here and around the internet I was surprised that people find the end to be about redemption and that by the end things are better for most characters.I couldn’t agree less to this.I saw the ending as cruel and discomforting seeing how the rest of the movie plays out.The message that seems to come out from  the movie is that “random things happen and it did happen” but I feel a deeper message is,to borrow from BSG,”all this has happened before and will/might happen again.”So here’s why I believe that Magnolia is actually in most cases a sad ending than a happy or bittersweet one

In the beginning we are shown characters who are lonely-Donnie,TJ,,Claudia,Jim,Phil(maybe) and to some extent Earl who is more regretful than lonely.At the end some  of these characters find that someone in their life or the redemption they seek and that makes it a ‘happy’ ending.However except from Claudia and Jim most other characters don’t end up better off than they actually are.Infact some of them are worse for it.

The entire movie shows how TJ’s poor relationship with his father has deeply affected him.It’s sad that even though by the end he has had some reconciliation with Earl,we are also shown the first hints of a bad relationship between Stanley and his father since unlike Earl or Jimmy Stanley’s father is actually abusive to his child and he seems to be the last person who would react kindly to a child’s demands especially now that the show is over and he will definitely blame Stanley for it.This felt like a cruel bait-and-switch.While Stanley has been spared from becoming another Donnie he might become another TJ or Claudia ie in a badand/or abusive relationship with his father.

But what about Donnie himself?By the end nothing has changed for him.He is lonely,out of money,has no job and has a lot of debt.His life is still the hell it was for the entire running time of the film.He may haved saved his ‘soul’ and maybe an arrest but that’s it 

Now let’s talk about the big redemption that happens in the movie that we all remember-TJ and Earl.However its not even clear whether Earl has even realised that TJ was there.It was stated that after  taking  liquid morphine one practically ‘dies’ and since TJ meets Earl after Phil has given him the morphine its possible that Earl is already ‘dead’ and he has died without meeting his son for the last time and with all his regrets and sorrows.There is no redemption whatsoever for him.TJ might be even worse off.For a man struggling with loss and loneliness all his life he is shown the briefest hints of family happiness before it is snatched away.This along with the expose that he is lying about his past may badly affect the only thing htat he has got going for him-his S&amp;D work.In his case it’s a case of loved and lost being crueller than never loving.

The worst creatures however are Linda and Jimmy Gator.In the beginning Jimmy has everything-a wife’s love,his show and his belief that he isn’t to blame for Claudia going away.By the end he has lost everything.If you thought Earl’s position was bad then imagine how awful Jimmy’s position will be when he will be dying all alone with nothing but regret and sorrow.He was about to commit suicide but by the end of the movie nothing has changed in his situation that will cause him to not contemplnt suicide anymore

Speaking of suicide the other character who has it bad by the end is Linda who also attempts suicide.She is now in the same position as Earl-having to spend the rest of her life with nothing but regrets.I am not sure which is worse-Linda having to live a lonely life or Jimmy having to die a lonely death?

The only people who get their happy ending is Claudia and Jim which is perhaps why their scene is the movie’s last scene as if to give the effect of “alls weel that ends well” which can cover up the fact that everyone else is worse off.What hurts the most is that for a movie which shows people having a sad and regretful life it also ends with people having sad and regretful lives.

This is what I think.Maybe I am wrong but given that this movie can be interpreted in so many ways I believe the ending can be seen from many perspectives

Box office returns for both ""Stoker"" and ""The Last Stand"" were less than satisfactory, especially considering the Arnold factor in ""The Last Stand"".

I was expecting a moody, run of the mill Yakuza film, but **Branded to Kill** is anything but. Seijun Suzuki's bizare twisted tale of a killer's dying days is confusing, moody, dark and great. What I find really jarring is the sudden jumps in space and the lack of establishing shots: suddenly we are here and suddenly someone is shooting. Normally, it would be easy just to write this off as being bad editing, but I don't think this is the case for Suzuki's film. It gives the impression that No.3's memories are beginning to blur together, that it's all the same to him, that he is somewhat removed from his actions. It definitetly gave the film a dream like feel. And the boiled rice fetish? I really have no idea. 

(spoilers) the bittersweet ending stuck with me as well. Alone, dying in a gym after shooting the woman he (supposedly) loves repeating ""I'm no.1!"" is tragic, ironic and pathetic. Just the way the scene is lit, darkly and surrounded by an ocean of shadows, makes it unforgettable. 

 A film that requires multiple viewings, I honestly am having trying wrapping my head around it. Has anyone else seen this? What do you think? How did you read it?

1371771669.0,21,self.TrueFilm,1grf91,"Let's talk about Jim Jarmusch's ""Mystery Train"" (1989)",26,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1grf91/lets_talk_about_jim_jarmuschs_mystery_train_1989/,"I saw it for the first time yesterday, and to be quite frank I was pretty underwhelmed, even somewhat bored, after I finished watching it. I came into the film excepting something more like Jarmusch's Night on Earth or Coffee and Cigarettes, with a lot of humorous dialogue and little emphasis on the plot, or something like Scorsese's After Hours, more of a surreal comedy about night-time adventures.

Mystery Train was in fact very much character-driven as I excepted, but I felt like the characters had very little going for them and that is what killed the experience for me. The dialogues were insipid, not intriguing or funny in the slightest. The diner scene during the 2nd part of the film, [where the strange man tells Nicoletta Braschi about the hitch-hiking Elvis story, sells her the purported Elvis' comb, and subsequently tries to talk to her with his suspicious looking friend outside of the diner](/spoiler) is the only scene that made regain attention because of how surreal it felt after the relatively drab first part of the ""chapter"".

Had Jarmusch played up the ""intertwined stories"" aspect of the film, and made the characters interact even more directly, making them meet and talk to each other rather than link them with a simple [gunshot they all heard at one point throughout the night, or an Elvis song they heard simultaneously](/spoiler), I think I would have enjoyed the film more, but that's just a matter of personal preference I guess.

I very much enjoyed the whole Americana, run-down atmosphere that was there throughout the whole movie though, it reminded me of Paris, Texas in a good way. The Japanese couple has a very romantic view of America that they formed through listening to blues and rock and roll and watching American movies and television, and when I watched it, I saw America through their eyes as well. The whole movie feels like an Edward Hopper painting in a certain way. For that reason I have to say that the first story about the Yokohama couple is the one I enjoyed most of all three.

1369709752.0,24,self.TrueFilm,1f6ddb,On Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951),29,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1f6ddb/on_wilders_ace_in_the_hole_1951/,"So, I had to write a short essay on this movie and thought you guys might get a kick out of it. If you haven't seen it, it's on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/movie/ace-in-the-hole), **legally**, uploaded by paramount.

*Ace in the Hole* does not discover or unearth a hidden tension, it deals with the ever-present cultural contrast between urban and rural populations, an issue as old as agriculture. The economic growth spurred by the second World War, did little to change the Jeffersonian ideals of the agrarian utopia that had become fixed in the American collective consciousness as an element of their self-perception, that’s to say, despite the increasingly industrialized economy of the US still perceived itself, the citizenry, as mostly made up of farmers, tradespeople and merchants. The extending cultural reach of the urban was still to be regarded at best with suspicion and at worst with hostility. What it provides is not discovery but rather examination and commentary.

The demographic aspect is perhaps the most important to consider when analyzing Ace in the Hole’s socio-cultural commentaryand in turn there are three major aspects when considering the demographic shifts and divides that were becoming apparent during this period: first, the growing population of the US; to illustrate, consider that from Wilder’s birth in 1906 to the release of the movie the total US population had almost doubled in size, second, urban populations had reached their apex at the time in 1950 (for example, New York’s population reached an all-time high in 1950, which would not be surpassed until the 70s, and which would not stabilize at a higher number until the 21st century), and third, the relatively new state of New Mexico, which had only been part of the US for about a century, had a mostly rural population. It’s also worth noting that the eventual cultural hegemony of the Metropolises wasn’t a foregone conclusion before the advent of television.

Kirk Douglas introduces himself, significantly, with a geographical modifier: not simply as Charles Tatum, but Charles Tatum From New York. This modifier forms as much as part of his identity as his job, that is to say, the way he thinks of himself necessarily incorporates his urbanity^1. An identity he constructs not on geography but rather on negation, in the way he insists on his urbanity he’s mostly asserting himself as not from “the country” rather than from any particular city^2. This sets him up as an agent of the city forcing itself upon “the country” by emphasizing the disconnect between himself and the space he finds himself.

Kirk Douglas looks at the embroidered maxim of “Tell The Truth” and quips, “I wish I could coin them like that,” simultaneously letting us know that he rejects the edict and that he considers it part of a larger con. The embroidery sparks the thematic momentum of the movie, it sets up the frame for the central event in the narrative where the maxim is twisted around and pulled from its moral foundation until the final act where in an excessively ironic turn, Douglas’ effort to embrace its original meaning is met with deaf ears, scorn or derision by the members of The City.

Our first taste of Tatum’s twisting of the maxim comes during the scene immediately following, where Tatum shows himself to be highly skilled in sophistry, and indeed the way it is established might go unnoticed by the inattentive viewer even though they might perceive him as a conman for some reason or other which they might not be able to pinpoint or articulate at all. The answer here lies in the “I’m a pretty good liar[…]” dialogue: the con he’s pulling is that of using honesty in a completely insincere way, which becomes a recurring theme of the movie. What he is doing is ensnaring the paper’s owner by telling him flat out that he is a liar^3, which is true, but in the nonchalant confession there is an implicit element of submission and a hint of reformation wrapped in the veil of aloof pragmatism, but the truth is that Tatum wants to appear as if he is at the end of his rope and thus as having no bargaining power but his disarming honesty, whether he really is or not is merely incidental. In reality, he is using the truth as a weapon, as a means of manipulations. He is perfectly aware that “coming clean” will result in a hire, a maneuver worthy of Iago, and this skillful use of a dishonest truth is one that will provide the foundation for the movie’s depiction of Big City media. This pattern is repeated in the central event of the movie, Leo’s story, and in minor ways throughout it, as in Tatum’s business pitch that convinces Lorraine to not leave Leo.

Midway through Tatum meets and makes a deal with the sheriff to have Leo’s rescue delayed to have the story, along with Tatum’s value to the bigger newspapers, grow to sensational levels. At this point he’s opened the proverbial Pandora’s Box; as he eventually finds out, once corruption is ignited it cannot be extinguished^4. The scene is a remarkably accurate depiction of the birth of petty corruption, in that it often stems from a public servant with low wages which causes him to hold little loyalty for his employer (i.e: the public) at the symbolic level and a relatively big incentive to disregard “the spirit” of the job. It’s important to point out that even if Tatum is the catalyst for it, the corruption was itself already there, incubating as it were, since you can’t corrupt the honest, or so the the film goes.

The film also raises a potential answer for the question of why ruthlessness is so pervasive in the “lot of hardboiled eggs”^5, perhaps without necessarily trying to justify it, in its constant references to war and soldiers. Interestingly, the very same cause for the amorality is also presented as its own cure: is it not also the bond of the members between the band of brothers that becomes the redeeming entity for Tatum? The movie makes a case for a humanity that is flawed but not inherently evil^6. Tatum himself, like Iago before him^7, isn’t evil in vacuo, he’s working from the principle of revenge to the industry that scorned his talent for what he considers irrelevant or petty reasons.

Stepping back then, we can formulate the movie’s stance as one condemning the alienating factors of city life and the media culture it creates; since Tatum was in the army, he must have at one point lost the loyalty and solidarity he in the end affords to Leo. Unfortunately, the movie shies away from saying exactly what it is that urban life does in order to achieve or perhaps intensify the post-war alienation of the veteran population, perhaps deliberately.

Similar themes appear in *Chinatown, Sweet Smell of Success* and *Force of Evil*. While *Ace in the Hole*’s inclusion into the noir canon, even the informal one, is contentious, its inclusion is not baseless. It is a sort of predecessor to the sub-subgenre of “sun-baked noir”, like _Red Rock West and Chinatown, and it’s white-collar anti-hero would eventually become more common than the grandiosely hardboiled detective protagonist. It’s thematic resonance (e.g: struggle with the inescapability of fate, dramatic irony, an amoral but relentless pursuit of an arbitrary telos^±) with the rest of the noir canon is undeniable.

Both reviews from my Letterboxd account

**The Mirror**

Tarkovsky amazed me again with a film that deviates from his already solid and legendary film-making style.

This films is far more surreal at times than some of his other films and strongly reminded me of some of Imgar Bergman's films at times. Though some may find the structure polarizing, I managed to follow the story-line of the film quite well. It revolved around an army man, his ex-wife, and their son, often time having the one actress portray both his ex-wife and mother.

The symbolism in the films is sublime and evokes some of Tarkovsky's strongest imagery ever. The characters in this films also feel stronger than his other films, giving us a stark look at the modern female working class woman in Russia. - ★★★★★

**Ivan's Childhood**

HOLY SHIT GUYS!

That has been my reaction to almost every Tarkovsky film I've seen so far but his work always manages to surprise me. This film especially astounded me to see how much of a master he had become so early in his career. I try to bring into words my feelings on this film and all that comes to mind is the word perfection. All I can say is that Andrei Tarkovsky's first film (in my humble and greatly biased opinion) surpasses masters of cinema such as Kubrick and Wells in the prime of their careers(I know).

First off I'd like to say that if anyone is looking for a good starting point to delve into Tarkovsky's filmography, this is exactly where to start. This is the most straightforward film I've seen of his yet it captures his tremendous directorial talent perfectly. This film is very character focused and pushes the plot forward making it much more accessible to someone not versed in his style. That being said the film still maintains a good deal of the surrealism and subtext that fans of his adore.

The acting in this film is fantastic, and this is coming from someone who hates child actors with a passion. Such a performance from a child in any film is to be admired. The supporting cast did a great job as well, and really sold what could have been a cheesy story line.


How can you discuss Tarkovsky without talking about the cinematography(a word being overused more, and more to the point of becoming groan-worthy)? He turns a drab-war torn Russia into an almost surreal wasteland with some of the most haunting imagery in the history of cinema. A mix of some truly breathtaking scenery paired with such superb composition left my jaw on the floor more than once.

I wish I could approach this film with less unbridled energy and stay more reserved, but I can't help it. I absolutely loved this film to it's core. I've always been a big Tarkovsky fan but this film really resonated with me on an emotional level. This film is a must see and I recommend it completely.  -★★★★★

That organ on the soundtrack is very unsettling. This film was excellent viewing for late at night which is what I did last night. I think I enjoyed this film in retrospect rather than while I was watching, as I didn't quite know what was going on until I read about it and had it put into perspective. 

Now this movie is just really eerie. There are many many interpretations on what it all means too. Or not even what it ""means"" but what is really going on. Either it could be really a guy either lying about a meeting he had with a woman yet trying to put his advances on her anyway (or not lying and upset she doesn't remember their meeting last year), a woman with repressed memories, or I've read about a heavy rape implication, which would make sense because towards the end some pretty intense scenes comes up. I guess on my first viewing I attributed it to just a woman who is afraid and reluctant to go with this man because she still loves her husband. Then there is the scene where something violent happens which I wont spoil here and the male protagonist says ""I need you alive!"". It can be confusing, which is why I need to rewatch it and analyze it more.

What are your theories on this film? Either ones that you really believe in or things you've pieced together from either facts or clues within the film? Either that or what did you think about this?

&gt;Metaphysical films tend to work on two levels: the entertaining and the philosophical. These two planes often coexist and help metaphysical films become a favorite among avid film lovers, as well as remaining accessible for wider audiences. Usually having plots that challenge our perception of reality, using memorable visuals, and lending itself to a wide array of genres, I think there is a little something for everybody and more than enough to create a firm discussion afterward that's not just about the film, but about the philosophy behind the film.

Set during the early 1900s four girls disappear from their college trip to the Hanging Rock for a picnic. They are not able to be found. Like L'Avventura the film is not about finding the lost girls. 

I found it interesting that the main character is the girl left behind. Basically she is more of the outcast because she can't afford to be there and is more punished. The rest of the girls are bland. The only other remotely interesting one is the girl who is fearful as a band of them search the Hanging Rock. 

The Hanging Rock is his mysterious place where weird things happen. The smitten Michael's experience of trying to find the girls reveals that to me the Hanging Rock is someways Supernatural. He basically becomes inept and collapses. Same with the recovered girl.

To me this is a device for the start of another plot just like in L'Avventiura. The plot of the two lovers searching for the girl in L'Avventura leads to jealously and grim human nature. This is played out in the college where the outcast is fighting against the administration. This later leads to the end which I will not spoil.

To me this is a very good film that has great cinematography showing the Hanging Rock in this glowing sunlight basking in the area. I read that the DP put a wedding dress veil over the lenses to give it that look. The film shows many natural scenes invoking how nature conquers over those trying to settle this land (Remember, Australia is a conquered no mans land).

I am surprised by this because I had heard such great things about it. That's not to say it was bad or poorly made, but I still have issues with it.

Perhaps it is because I have read the book, but I found this movie to be a distinct departure from what the book was trying to say and what the movie was trying to say. The movie seemed to have this soft lighting sort of glow to it that, combined with the soundtrack, felt like it was attempting to present a romanticized picture of the French and Indian War. That's not necessarily a bad thing for some people but it irks me. Romanticizing anything can leave me feeling like the movie (or documentary) is being emotionally manipulative. 

The movie did have a few elements of grittiness to it what with the scalpings and cutting out of a heart but they felt very out of place give the general ""air"" the movie. The feel of the movie didn't seem to match with the images presented in the book. The book felt very gritty and even cruel in some parts. There were a few select scenes from the book that I was hoping would make an appearance in the movie due to their moral ambiguity. Instead, the movie seemed focused on making DDL a romantic interest and had him do nothing that could be considered anti-heroric. He didn't bury the people but had a good reason. That was not a moral quandary though, just a question of ritual. 

Consider The Road (2009). It managed to omit some of the more brutal scenes of the book but kept enough of the moral quandary and atmospheric feel to be considered a good adaptation of the book.

Now lets say the work exists on its own. I'll forget about the book for a moment.

The second sister, Alice Munro, was barely developed and Uncas even less so. Their ""relationship"" was established over the course of approximately 20 seconds, maybe. Then, when Uncas dies, I feel bad because I know that Chingachgook loved his kid, but I don't feel bad because I don't know Uncas as a character. In addition, when Alice throws herself off the cliff, it also means little because she was barely developed as well. The only emotional attachment I have to these characters is through their relatives who have been developed (Alice's sister Cora and Uncas' father Chingachgook). I feel bad for Cora and Chingachgook, not for the people who died. 

As for DDL's performance, eh. This was my first whole movie in which I've seen him act (I've seen clips of his other movies) and I wasn't impressed. I understand that Native Americans are not extremely expressive, so it can be hard for certain emotions to come across for the audience. If that is the case, then he did an admirable job of acting as someone who was raised by Native Americans. Other than that, I found nothing very noteworthy of his performance. 

All that said, I thought the battle scene at the fort was an exciting portrayal of battle. I enjoyed the civility between opposing officers. Magua was a decent villain who's emotionlessness worked for him. He had a good reason for wanting the general dead (though eating his heart is a bit overboard). The fighting was good and evoked that feeling of watching someone fight in a way you've never seen before (a feeling I got when watching Ong Bak (2003) and Ong Bak 2 (2008)). The soundtrack was good but I think it only helped to establish that romanticized feeling that I take issue with. Lastly, the scenery and landscape was good as well. The colors made the American frontier seem pleasant and peaceful juxtapose to the violence happening around the cast. 

I was downvoted in /r/movies for saying that I didn't care for the movie much and I'm wondering if I am alone on that opinion.

Many have likened this film to Kurosawa's Ikiru. While I see parallels, I personally found Umberto D. to be a bit more relatable and less overly-sentimental. In the end, it felt more real to me.

In addition, does anyone have any thoughts on the ending?

Those few fans of early Japanese films probably know about Benshis.

Whereas in most countries (like America) a silent film would be accompanied by a live musician/s - in Japan, films were also accompanied by a Benshi, a man who would perform along with the film, AFAIK they would act out the intertitles and also comment on the action on the screen in general. These guys developed fan bases of their own and actually - sound came to Japanese films later than in other countries because the Benshis were so popular.

Indeed, sound made the Benshi's obsolete.

Anyway, its something I have read about but never really thought I'd ever get to see in action.

Not because of the depression, but because the film was an experience -- and I was trying to find out why.  What was Haneke doing?

I read some reviews, and one from Ebert mentioned the shot in the beginning: the long shot of the audience during the concert.  How we never got to see the stage.

And then I remembered the anxiety and frustration I felt during the majority of the film, because I knew that this poor woman was suffering, and Georges was monstrously selfish in his tormenting her, and prolonging a life that she no longer wanted to live.

When he offered a second nurse, when the nurses were cleaning her, I felt such absurd anxiety, that I wanted her to just -- talk!  Emote, tell someone what YOU want.

And then after I read the review and remembered that first shot, it just clicked with me.  The idea of becoming an audience -- a helpless entity watching what happens on stage.  Georges as a helpless audience to his wife's struggle (albeit somewhat participatory), and then our being an audience to her struggle.  We're unable to do anything.  There is a limit to what we can do, at then at some point, we become an audience to our own lives, which was the most depressing part of the story.  That this woman became a victim to her existence, just watching herself slowly and painfully dying.

In general, the commentary was very similar and generally amounted to two difference perspectives, which I paraphrase: 1) The movie is dumb, with a simplistic, cliched plot and bad acting; 2) The film conforms to tropes associated with B-movies made during a particular period. It occurs to me that at least when it comes to the mainstream, you don't see a lot of lip service paid to the genre film, yet genre films do endure as influential works, receiving regular tribute from people like Quentin Tarantino.

Genre films are a great interest of mine. It's always interesting to hear about the commercial interests which have often influenced a particular style of film. The studios will shamelessly chase a demographic--like Nikkatsu turning out action films during the 60s and later pink eiga during the 70s to capture the young male demo. Likewise, you have producers Menahem Golan and Yorum Globus making films during the 80s that tried to cash in on every fad imaginable, from breakdancing to comic books to Reagan-era jingoism. That said, these production-houses certainly have no illusions about the quality of their movies: I once watched an interview with Jean-Claude Van Damme where he recounted that Menahem Golan had initially planned to shelve Bloodsport because he thought the movie was terrible, yet the movie became a surprise hit. It seems like these sorts of movies have become an investment vehicle of sorts in recent years; many B-movie studios will make flicks for less than $10 mil and use rental/home video/international sales to make quick cash.

I suppose my point is that while everyone can certainly roll their eyes at the flawed mechanics of these pictures, they do matter to audiences who will pay to be entertained. I feel like this is maybe an understanding that has been lost in recent years with studios putting even more money into pictures which may flop at the box office. It's a very interesting contrast to see the big studios groping for an audience that they don't understand while Stallone makes a movie for an audience that he knows well and also knows will come through for him.

Edit: To correct an ambiguity, I use the term 'genre film' to avoid saying B-movie because I don't want to mean 'low production value'--moreso a lower budget genre film, like a spaghetti western or martial arts film, that's made to minimize risk and satisfy an audience.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1345480167.0,,,True,t3_yhtf6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/yhtf6/how_do_you_value_genre_films_and_where_do_they/,

I watched this film when I was a junior in high school. I couldn't stop talking about it the next day to my teachers. As a science-oriented student, it instilled in me a fantastical wonder.

I will explore these themes in a way that draws very directly from my analysis of ‘Apocalypse Now’, in hope that in doing so it will help sculpt my opinion on a very complex and contentious issue.  






When I use the term ‘the perpetrators’ of Imperialism, I use it broadly, depending on the instance, in relation to either the government who orchestrate it, the military who enable it, or the media who present it to the rest of the world. In this text I will also use the words Imperialism and Capitalism interchangeably, because Imperialism, as Lenin put it, is “the highest stage of Capitalism”.


Kurtz himself appears perhaps as a satirical allegory for the perpetrator’s ideal outcome of modernity, and ‘transference’ to capitalism. He has total power over, and the god-like idolisation of a group of people he deems as inferior, they gather resources for him and carry out any work that needs doing – a clear representation of Dependency theory, or “the notion that resources flow from a ""periphery"" of poor and underdeveloped states [in this case, people] to a ""core"" of wealthy states [Kurtz]”1.


Kurtz represents an opposition to the tendency of anti-Imperialists to ‘romanticise tradition, and ignore any of the benefits of a capitalist society’2. This is supported by Kurtz’s monologue, in which he describes how after his special force’s team finished inoculating a group of impoverished children – they were called back to find all of the inoculated arms cut off, in a pile on the ground. 


These subtleties leave me in comfortable disagreement with Frank P Tomasulo’s suggestion that Coppola ‘subordinated content to style’3 – Instead I feel that Coppola made content and style equal, to present sensitive and engaging themes to do with War and Imperialism in an accessible and entertaining way.


Another example of how Kurtz is an allegory for Imperialism is the way that he has little philosophical problem in killing innocent people in attempts to gain order, power and control – this is made clear by the severed heads around the temple in which he lives, and through the photojournalist (Dennis Hopper)’s quote that “He likes you, because you’re still alive”.

Kurtz is also a character used often to highlight the hypocrisy of Capitalist society, stating that ‘We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write ""fuck"" on their airplanes because it's obscene!’

The photojournalist’s character, in my opinion is an allegory for the American media in the early stages of the war when, as in the Korean War, it blindly supported the U.S.A’s actions, and the stories it reported were almost solely positive. This only goes to further highlight the importance of media opinion in ending the Vietnam War – it was after all, photographs, such as the nine-year-old girl burned by napalm, which helped change the American citizen’s opinion4. He is also used as a method of foreshadowing the events of the war: “This is the way the fucking world ends! Look at this fucking shit we're in, man! Not with a bang, but with a whimper. And with a whimper, I'm fucking splitting”, is not unlike the circumstances under which America withdrew from Vietnam.



An interesting observation of the military perpetrators in ‘Apocalypse Now’ is the way members of different races and social classes respond to orders and the War/Imperialism on the whole. It is a known fact that a large number of the soldiers in the Vietnam War were from poor backgrounds, and especially in the beginning of the war, many of them were also black, Clean being a good example - “Mr Clean was from some South Bronx shithole and the light and space of Vietnam really put the zap on his head” – black soldier’s death toll numbers were double those of white soldiers in the beginning of the war5 and Black rights campaigners were extremely vocal about it, important because it proves that Wars in foreign countries also spawn social dissent at home.


In my opinion, Kilgore represents true insanity6. Kurtz understands the philosophy behind, and the consequences of Imperialism and the resulting capitalism – an intellectually superior (though equally barbaric) man who took the initiative to outcast himself, to distance himself from the mind-set of the likes of Kilgore. Kilgore is a fitting representation of the absurdities involved in the Vietnam War. Even in War morals exist, and as French philosopher Jacques Maritain wrote, “Moralists are unhappy people” – Kilgore is certainly not a moralist, he is a sociopath so unaffected by the death and suffering surrounding him that he is cheerful enough to regularly go surfing on the beaches of villages he helped to raze to the ground. 

 In the ‘Redux’ version of the film, Willard has dinner with French Colonials working on a plantation - their act of “staying put in a land that's rejected them”7 should be seen as both a warning to Willard, but also a foreshadowing of the War’s resolution for the Americans.

The struggle the American characters in the film face when matched by the vast number of Vietcong is a testament to what can be done with enough dedication. It is clear that the Americans on the Imperialist venture heavily outgun the natives. That thanks to the soldiers’ self-doubt and chaotic organisation, the bullish bravado of Capitalism is thwart-able, even by the natives whose lives they eventually intend to ‘improve’.

Between his early horror classics of *Frankenstein* and *Bride of Frankenstein*, James Whale brought his gothic, well-skilled touch to the timeless tale of *The Invisible Man*. Shot with such elegance and paced with dynamism from the outset, I was absolutely enthralled with this archaic piece of studio ""horror"", much more so than some of the other so called classics in this period of the genre. Because of the exceedingly short running time (70-odd minutes) there is very little room for hackneyed sub-plots or trite and instead the story is pulled down to it's bare bones and the themes of isolation, madness and the perils of messing with science are all explored neatly, if not entirely deeply. There is enough light, almost slapstick, comedy in there to keep the proceedings from getting too dark (Universal seem to have a habit of having at least one crazy old person in each of their films for some comic relief) but Whale really manages to heighten the scary aspects of the character/themes superbly, especially in scenes during which actors have to perform on their own. I never saw an Invisible Man as being something particularly frightening but when characters are unsure of whether they are alone or not, unsure of whether they are being watched, Whale ratchets up the tension with well timed musical cues and special effects that have stood the test of time. In all honesty, it might be my favourite of all the Universal horrors from this time as it never tries to present itself as anything but a tale well told yet rarely puts a foot wrong. It's simplicity and accessibility has gotten me thinking about how these films were received back then and how they are still being received today.

Are people on TrueFilm of the opinion that the Universal Horror films made during the blossoming years of cinema were there purely to scare/entertain or was there a more subversive message being put across in these films? Did *Dracula* go deeper than simply being a gothic tale of bloodlust? Or do films with titles like *Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman* indicate that these were nothing more than money making ventures?

The visuals were arresting - languid and subtly erotic. The sets were meticulously chosen, and beautifully ""exposed"" (for the lack of a better word. Strictly, I mean from a photographic point of view). I was reminded a lot of *In the Mood For Love* with the coy romantic overtures, and heavy use of almost-invisible facial gestures.

I think I am in love with the director's lazy early morning scenes that he spends a good deal on - the brother and sister rolling awake, playfully bantering about who got into whose bed (the sexual tension subtle, but evident), the music, the brother grunting and doing exercises while the sister stretching lithely like a cat, her straight, shiny, tousled hair framing her beautiful face, the shared cigarette, the curtain of rain outside,...it was sheer poetry.

[The Deceivers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094979/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3) was one such movie. I am not much into period dramas, but I am an Indian, and I have a soft spot for movies made in India, especially, if they explain how things were under the British.

This movie was informational at the least, and quite well made. When Captain Savage (a dashing young pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan) comes to learn that a gang of bandits (called Thugees) have been mercilessly strangling, killing, and looting travelers in his district, he decides to go undercover and unearth evidence of their acts. While snooping, he becomes intoxicated with the lives of the Thugees, and, before he knows it, is himself garrotting people. By the time he snaps out of his daze, he has gotten himself into a deep mess, and people he thought were friends turn otherwise.

It's an interesting movie, no doubt, bereft of any happy running-between-trees musicals or clichéd plots that plague most Indian movies. I was astounded at the locations at which the film was made. It had all the gritty elements of colonial India with crude street markets, executions by elephants, forts, nauch girls...the works. I was very impressed by Brosnan's immersion into his undercover role. He passed off quite well as a native, though the veracity of the whole thing could be questioned - how does a white man stay brown for weeks without notice.

Shashi Kapoor and Saeed Jaffery, two Indian thespians, don masterful roles, and execute them with the perfect Anglo-Indian equipoise that people expect from them.

With WRONG, I was particularly impressed by its entirely playful execution, as well as by the fact that he apparently handled a huge chunk of the production himself as writer, director, cinematographer, editor, and music producer. 

The plot is lightheartedly wacky in that it centers around a young white-collar man-- Dolph -- who wakes up one morning to discover that the love of his life -- his dog, Paul-- is missing. Dupieux invents plenty of fun absurdities inside Dolph's world as he woefully searches for AWOL Paul. There's his job situation, in which it inexplicably rains inside the office and no one seems to mind (I appreciated the overbearingly soul-sucking fluorescent lighting for those scenes). The small cast of characters are an absolute riot; I personally loved the eccentric Master Chang. 

Perhaps I'll give RUBBER another shot, but WRONG certainly won my heart. I wouldn't call it a scratch-your-head surrealist movie (which is I think what annoyed most people about it), but it contained just the right dollop of absurdity that welcomes you to just let go, and get lost in Dolph's world where [the clocks strike 7:60.] (/spoiler)

The movie's plot is very straightforward: Tomás Tomás, a womanizer struggling with his job, juggles with different sexual partners, but one day a beautiful new tenant moves to the apartment next to him, and he feels he is falling in love. In short, the movie is a sex comedy, but it differs from other films of the mexican comedy subgenre in that it boasts a great script from Carlos Cuarón, and it also marks the breakout role of Daniel Giménez Cacho, who went on to be one of Mexico's leading modern actors. Also, this was Emmanuel Lubezki's first feature film where he shot the cinematography (he later did many popular films, such as *Burn After Reading* and *The Tree of Life*).

Like *Y Tu Mamá También, *Hysteria* is decidedly mexican, containing over a dozen references to mexican tradition and pop culture (for example, Takeshi and Koyi, the names of the Japanese characters, are also the names of two of the main characters of *Komettu-san* a Japanese live-action TV series that was extremely popular in Mexico during the late 70's and 80's). It features a lot of quite modern emerging themes from the early 90's, such as the rise of Personal Computers and the HIV/AIDS panic.

Now, it struck me rather odd that this particular film had gotten a Criterion release. I don't mean by this that *Hysteria* is not a good film, but I find it hard to see how a modern Mexican sex comedy and social satire would fit in with the rest of Criterion's collection

From the film's Criterion webpage:

&gt; Beautifully filmed in widescreen by the inimitable Emmanuel Lubezki (The New World), Cuarón’s wildly successful feature debut (which has never been released in the U.S.) gave voice to a Mexican middle-class that had remained largely unseen onscreen, and surveys contemporary urban sexual mores with style to spare.

So, it's more or less obvious that this film was influential over more recent films, but does influence alone award a film with high recognition? Now, I am not wondering why didn't any other Cuarón film (e.g. *Children of Men*, *A Little Princess*) earned that release, but rather why did it earn it at all?

Pi, understandably, replaces traumatizing details from the story of his survival to construct an alternate story which is full of unbelievable detail but is essentially the same.

In the end, we're told that the Zebra symbolizes the sailor, the Orangutan his mother, the Hyena is the brutish cook and Richard Parker the Bengal Tiger is Pi himself. This is the first instance where Pi replaces the traumatizing, believable details from his story with euphemistic symbols.

What I haven't understood is the significance of the carnivorous island that Pi encounters on his journey. It's made clear at the end of the film that the Japanese insurance agents think it's highly unlikely that the island exists, which is exactly what they think about Pi's original story. This leads me to believe that the Island, like the animals from the original story, is a symbol for something. What does it signify?

I think it might symbolize Pi's lack of faith. 

Pi's boat is caught in a storm and the scene ends with Pi screaming (at God?) ""I lost my family, my everything. What more do you want from me?"". They then drift overnight to the carnivorous island. Pi and Richard Parker both find food and nourishment on the island, but what the island gives them during the day, it takes away at night. I think this could mean that, having lost his faith, he is free to take nourishment (and knowledge?) from his surroundings while he's awake but when he's asleep at night, he is unprotected.

Also, do you think there is a reason why the island looks like a man lying on his back?

1329845411.0,21,self.TrueFilm,pzjfb,The Value of a Bad Movie,24,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/pzjfb/the_value_of_a_bad_movie/,"I’d like to share my opinion with the rest of r/Truefilm on the value of a bad movie.  Regardless of what criteria we differentiate a “Good” movie from a “Bad” movie; I don’t believe the main purpose of this subreddit is to inventory the “Good” movies out there for other’s consumption.  The best feature of this subreddit is the discussion involved in helping to define why a particular movie is artistic, moving, and special to us.  If the discussion inspired by a film is more important than the film itself (but being a product triggered by the film, the film is still important to us), then shouldn’t any film that warrants a **meaningful** conversation have a place here?

In as much as we can describe why we love a film, we should be able to explain why we dislike a film.  A few good questions to ask are as follows:

1.	*Is the basic premise itself a good story?*  There are many films out there that take adaptations of classic story-lines and motifs and completely bastardize it.  We can recognize the inspiration for the film, compare the current story with the original story and its moral or theme, and then draw conclusions on why the current film’s attempt at retelling this story is a failure.  On the other side of the spectrum, there are films that manage to create a relatively unique story-line, but have too many instances of immature toilet humor, superfluous explosions, or plot deviations that the original, interesting story is lost in the mix.  My favorite examples of this are the Saw movies and Final Destination.  The films deal with people fighting against an almost certain death in unique situations (which is an idea I find very interesting), but the details of the story focus more on the gore and fright factor of Rube-Goldberg style death trap.

2.	*Could the movie have been saved if roles had been changed?*  Unless we get an almost immediate remake (see: [The Incredible Hulk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\(film\))), many times we will never get to see what another, current generation actor/director could have done with a film.  This is one of the reason I love stage productions of shows.  The change in venue and cast can highlight parts and emotions in ways that I had never dreamed, and my imagination is sometimes too poor to even consider it.  What would Will Smith have done if he had taken the role of Neo in The Matrix?  What does that possible change show us about the abilities of Keanu Reeves vs. Will Smith?  What about if Kubrick would have actually completed A.I. while he was alive?  How would the maniacal and depressing styles of Kubrick have contrasted with Spielberg’s more hopeful and linear storytelling?

3.	*Are the artistic and stylistic intents in the film working per the original intent?*  I usually try to watch and judge a film based solely on its own merits, but sometimes the original intent of the writer/director/actor can play an important part in realizing why I react differently to certain scenes.  Why do we laugh at scene in horror movies where it’s clear the artist was trying to depict horror?  What do we believe is missing from the film that can actually project “horror” more accurately?  Is the dialog unrealistic?  Are the motivations of the characters not fitting my ideas of how people would react?  Comparing and contrasting my own beliefs on what makes a good movie to the artists original intent help define an opinion, similar to an argument with a friend over some trivial detail can help broaden your own personal knowledge while deepening your reserve.

I know that this subreddit enjoys sharing the beautiful movies that are out there with each other, but we should remember that’s not all we do.  Sharing educated opinions on the entire spectrum of movies, including bad ones, can be a helpful tool in helping to define our personal tastes.  It may even make bad movies bearable to watch, knowing that you have a place to go to and gripe about terrible movies[.](http://i.imgur.com/BD10Y.jpg)

1318954950.0,22,self.TrueFilm,lgetb,Are heroic narratives about labor critical of capitalism?,23,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/lgetb/are_heroic_narratives_about_labor_critical_of/,"I read [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-work-ethic-of-breaking-bad-20110808) about Breaking Bad and its place among recent television series that appear to be about people trying to do their jobs well. The author proposes that shows like Mad Men and Friday Night Lights are about men struggling with two opposing forces: being good, and being good at their jobs. These series contrast with more popular American procedurals like Law &amp; Order, where the hero's job is a noble duty. You would think that this difference would imply a criticism of capitalism's alienation of labor, but for the most part these heroic characters are bosses and managers. The labor they're being alienated from is the exploitation of workers. So what is really going on with these shows? 

Mad Men makes a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle references to Ayn Rand, who had a particular attitude toward labor and achievement within capitalism. The show doesn't seem to bear her out, though. Rather than tying life choices to consequences, the show constantly pulls down characters who attempt to take their destinies into their own hands. Draper's reward for starting his own company is anxiety, alcoholism, a ruined marriage, a miserable daughter, financial instability and loneliness. There are people who are successful based on nepotism and politics, but those people are just as likely to be good at their jobs as the hard-working poor people like Draper and Peggy Olson. If there is a message in the show, it's that everyone is a scam artist one way or another, and [the Spectacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle) (as Draper understands it) is just a big version of the thing every person has to do just to get by. Is that a Nietzschean justification of shitty behavior, or a Marxist/Situationist criticism of capitalism?

I thought it would be useful to compare these shows to the kind of films about labor that were produced by communist regimes in the 20th century: mid-century Chinese kitchen sink melodramas about women trying to balance work and family life, or Soviet montage films about the noble collective farmer and his wonderful cream separator. Unfortunately, there's little in terms of existential crisis going on in these films. Chinese housewives, like their American counterparts in the films of Douglas Sirk and Michael Curtiz, struggle with *getting* what they want, but not with *knowing* what they want. Soviet dairy farmers aren't even afforded the heroic subject position for the most part, as these films employ the ""collective protagonist"" approach Eisenstein used in Potemkin. 

Tarkovsky's films, produced under the Soviet regime in the 70s, could possibly give us a model for anti-capitalist existentialism (which would be backed up by Tarkovsky's own writings about the negative impact of capitalism on the soul), but none of his movies really deal with labor as such. Andrei Rublev could be said to be about a painter who struggles with the question of why he paints, but his struggle isn't with the art market or patronage. His battle is with the validity of achievement in the first place, and his relationship with God in a world full of suffering. As adventurous as Tarkovsky is, even his movies that appear to be about the absence of God (Stalker, The Sacrifice, possibly others) still come from the perspective of characters wrestling with their souls. 

A show like Friday Night Lights, on the other hand, makes spirituality look like a kind of sad consolation prize for people who aren't in control of their own destinies. The job here is football, and the church (and everything else) is in service to that. People care so much about doing a good job that football becomes a receptacle for the feelings of disappointment, helplessness and fear that comes with living in the middle of a literal and spiritual desert (Texas, America, the immanent universe, et al). Matt Saracen is much like Andrei Rublev; the world in which he lives is torn apart by violence and tragedy, and the only things that don't strike him as absurd are art...and football.

And love, of course. One thing that Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights, Mad Men, the Wire and Deadwood have in common is that people love each other. These shows are bleak portrayals of the working week, but all of them offer love as a shelter from existential crisis. No one ever wonders whether they should love. They just do it, the way that cops in action movies don't question whether they're part of a destructive apparatus for keeping capitalism afloat. In fact, any criticism of capitalism present in these shows would probably be rooted in their presentation of a dialectic between jobs and love; that is, between duty to a position in society and duty to a position in a family. The social construction of these motivations is not questioned. Few would likely stomach these shows if they did criticize romantic love. Mad Men, which has the darkest view of romantic entanglements, still puts forth Draper's love for his daughter and his sham ex-wife as possibly redemptive. 

Is that attachment to the narrative of love the flaw in the critical potential for these series? Christian Marxism would say the opposite: loving people is why we're critical of capitalism in the first place. So then are these series just insufficiently inclusive of radical ideology? The Wire doesn't exclude much in terms of pessimistic attitudes toward systems of power. The police can't do their job, the teachers can't do their job, the union workers and the journalists and the drug dealers and the lawyers can't do their job. You can't get much bleaker than a world where murderous thieves are tragic heroes and the biggest villains (the politicians) never face any justice at all. But is the Wire like Dilbert, in that the criticism is de-fanged by a playful and hypocritical nihilism? The Baltimore of the Wire is like Sisyphus' boulder, but like the old joke says, at least Sisyphus had job security. Is doing your job pointless because it serves a system of power and not you, or is it pointless because the world is bad and endeavor is hopeless?

I think there's a limit to the degree any of these shows can really criticize capitalism without depicting characters actually struggling with capitalism as an idea. Marxist filmmakers like Bunuel, Pasolini and Godard draw explicit links between the suffering of workers and the systems in which they are trapped. Of the shows I mentioned, Deadwood feels the most like a descendant of an explicitly critical Marxist tradition. David Milch won't let anyone be a ""hero."" Everyone is either exploiting someone, hurting someone or a victim of someone else. Love means less here than in any of the other shows, possibly because the warping effect of capitalism on the ""frontier"" means that no one can afford to look after anyone else while they're looking out for themselves. No one loves anyone enough to choose not to sacrifice them when the time comes. There are no Marxist Christ figures in Deadwood. That may be why Milch's follow-up project was a mystical Marxist-Christian surfing series (John from Cincinnati).

-Roger Ebert

I recently viewed **Ugetsu** (1953) and, admittedly, am still processing it.  I wanted to have this discussion before my ideas set in because, frankly, I was a bit underwhelmed, and I don't feel I understand why the film is considered such a masterpiece.

Now, I don't require an explanation of Mizoguchi as an auteur.  This is actually my 8th Mizoguchi film.  I understand his aesthetic, the long takes, the detailed period settings, the lack of close ups, etc.  I'm not sure it has ever really appealed to me, though.  Prior to **Ugetsu**, the only of his films that really appealed to me was **The Life of Oharu**, and to a lesser extent, **The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums**.  Now, approaching other Japanese directors like Ozu and Kurosawa, they didn't always hit, but when they did, they hit big.  I haven't had this reaction to Mizoguchi, aside from **The Life of Oharu**.

I recognize the films strengths relative to other Mizoguchi films.  His characterization was very strong in the film.  I can't think of any other of his films where the characters were so clearly established and define.  In the 7 other of his films I watched, the characters have always seemed a bit flat and unstable, in addition to when they just plain out fall into the fallen woman archetype, which is present in **Ugetsu** to a lesser degree.

I appreciate the emotions in the film, too.  The second ghost scene with Miyagi was moving, perhaps as much as **The Life of Oharu**, but, again, it didn't push me to emotional catharsis the way a film like **Tokyo Story** does.

The boat scene is one I often see praised.  I must have missed something.  It was a well shot scene, I guess, but it didn't stand out as any better than any other scene in the film.  I also see the later scenes with Lady Wakasa praised for their atmosphere.  I admit that I liked some of the use of shadow, but these scenes didn't stick out to me as particularly notable either.

So, I guess, for those of you have seen **Ugetsu**, why is the film considered to great?  I realize film reactions are subjective, and I am entitled to my meh reaction.  I don't intend to forcefully overwrite my feelings just because of the film's praise.  But I just can't help but feel I missed something.

Please, debate it with me.

**edit**: It's worth mentioning that I watched the film again keeping these comments in mind, paying special attention to the camera movement and staging of scenes, and, I gotta say, I was deeply moved by the end of the film, humbled even.  While this wasn't the liveliest thread to begin with, still feel free to contribute if you haven't already because I think the film's prevalence in critical culture is plenty worth discussing.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1376536824.0,,,True,t3_1kc2rv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kc2rv/why_is_ugetsu_considered_one_of_the_greatest/,

Here's my argument, however, for why it's one of my favorite pictures, Fincher or otherwise.  

Spoilers, of course.

Overall, Panic Room is constructed like a play: a small ensemble cast, a single setting (where we see the relative positions of everything in that one swooping shot of the entire house), and a dense, A to B to C Frederic Knott-esque plot where each character has a clear, almost bluntly obvious motivation and arc. 

The plot borders on cruel: not quite Funny Games, but the situation is unpleasant. Taking Hitchcock's techniques for suspense, we know too much...far more than the characters - every time something bad happens to someone, we see why it'll play out first, squirming at their ignorance. Once the chain of events is really set in motion, there's no other logical outcome, and the film drags us roughly to the gory, natural conclusion. Bringing in the ex-husband to cap off the first act is almost soap-operalike in it's horrible perfect timing.

The casting is strange and seemingly perfect. Nicole Kidman originally played Meg Altman, but dropped out due to an injury. I can't imagine anyone but Jodie Foster playing Meg: ferocious, neurotic intensity. She's angry about the situation, but that divorce is really what's lighting her up. Kristen Stewart looks like Foster, and feels like a generation-removed copy of Foster in Freaky Friday. Dwight Yoakam wears on Raoul's skin in a way that still creeps me out when I see him. Forest Whitaker is a perfect chump-in-a-hard-place. Jared Leto showed up for filming in those cornrows.

The production is the part I get hung up on the most: that unreal house, built as a giant practical set; the almost-real-night dark photography; the microscopic sound design. A criticism against this movie is that it is almost clinical, leaving viewers a bit cold. Everything pre visualized, no allowance for chance. The result, to me, is an almost impossibly tight, precision film that I can enjoy over &amp; over again.

I loved every second of *Berberian Sound System*. I find this film first and foremost to be an existentialist and psychological drama inside which other genres such as thriller and horror are played out. The horror most obviously comes from the film inside the film, *The Equestrian Vortex* (not really about riding horses), which is being edited by the main protagonist, the sound editor/foley artist *Gilderoy* (great acting by **Toby Jones**). We never see any gore or violence, but we're instead immersed in it through the soundscapes of the movie. Even when the sounds are shown to be fake (stabbing cabbages, blending tomatoes), they don't lose any of their impact and creepiness. One less obvious and much more visceral source of horror is the sound studio itself along with its inhabitants such as the perverse and menacing director *Santini*. There's a constant sense of danger and inevitable failure for *Gilderoy* even in the most ordinary of situations such as reimbursing his plane ticket. This is further amplified by the visual style of the movie which contains dreamlike frames and scenes. We get the sense that there is no escape for *Gilderoy*, mistreated and pushed around as he becomes aware of the gravity of the situation he found himself in.

The movie is pretty much open to interpretation especially when considering many scenes towards the end of the film that depict hallucinations and the blending of realities. It appears that *Gilderoy* himself becomes a part of *The Equestrian Vortex* as he starts being overdubbed in Italian and is consumed by the burning film tape. Or is it the other way around, is *The Equestrian Vortex* bleeding into reality? It's hard to tell.

Some hints seem to point to *Gilderoy* being in some sort of personal hell. Apparently the flight he took from London never existed, he's being forced to torture other people, and he goes through constant retakes of portions of *The Equestrian Vortex*, a film he detests. Furthermore, we never find out why was he chosen to work on the movie. A professional accustomed to working on serene documentaries about nature, hired to work on a horror flick which he can't stand watching. That sounds like hell, doesn't it?

There are bits and pieces in this film that evoke **David Lynch** (*Inland Empire*), **Dario Argento** (any of his movies, really), and **Roman Polanski** (*Rosmary's Baby*), but all in all *Berberian Sound System* is pretty unique and quite unlike any other film. Oh, the soundtrack by **Broadcast** is also great and the film owes quite a bit of its atmosphere to their music.

One thing that surprised me is that this movie is relatively unknown, even though it received quite a few awards and **Peter Strickland's** first feature length movie (*Katalin Varga*) was pretty successful. Hopefully it's just gaining momentum. It really deserves praise and attention.

There,now that we have gotten that out of the way lets talk about the thinly veiled symbolism of The Prestige.The symbolism is that The Prestige is a movie about moviemaking,that the the ‘magic trick’ represents cinema.This is obvious from the concept of the 3 principles of magic echoing the 3-Act Structure which the movie itself follows.There are questions about originality,trying to understand what goes on behind the scenes and much more.


*(Note-The words ‘illusion’ and ‘movie’ are interchangeable in the following passages,ditto for ‘filmmaker’ and ‘magician’)*

But I’d extend the symbolism further by asking the question”If the illusion is cinema then who do Angier and Borden represent?”The answer is obvious-they are filmmakers.To generalize=if the illusion represents an act of creation then the 2 magicians are ‘creators’.Talking about these 2 men reveals the most important question ever asked about any piece of media and how you udge the answers defines your understanding of ‘art’ and ‘entertainment’.Lets figure out who Angier is


**“Haw!....The Great…….CAMERON!”**

The best way to describe Angier is that he is the maker of mainstream Hollywood blockbusters.His movies.His illusions are spectacular,huge in scope and full of thrilling moments.He represents the ‘movies are entertainment’ view.For him,its all about giving the audience what they want.He’ll do whatever it takes to create s vision that he knows the audience will appreciate.But most of all he needs that people actually see his movie.If nobody is ‘watching closely’ he doesn’t care.He is motivated by the audience and not in the process of creating the trick.Its all about giving the people what they want and evelling in the following applause.His purpose is pure escapism.He doesn’t want to remind people of rmundane life but will do his best to create the sense of escapism because for him escapism is the purpose of the illusion.Also he doesn’t shy from plagiarism cause for him its not about who did it first but who does it better.Explosions are an old movie trick but no one does explosions like Cameron can.Likewise no one does the Transporter Man like The Great Danton can.If he likes found footage then he’ll make the biggest found footage movie evr(Cloverfield).If he likes retro B &amp; W,the he’ll make the best retro B &amp; W movie ever(Schindler’s List).He is above all,a performer and he lives for the performance.Even his stage is opulent-nothing but the fanciest theatre shall do,no less than a NewYork premiere shall satisfy.He doesn’t ask”Are you watching closely?;he’s made sure you definitely are.His critics will say”By bowing to the whims of the audience you have lost a sense of self” and “it’s a good trick but its overblown-it could be much simpler” but he doesn’t care cause all he wants is that he get the desired effect on people-doesn’t matter if he has to use a drunken double or clones

**The Filmmaker’s Filmmaker/The Magician’s Magician**

Borden is the opposite.He believes that its all about the process than it is about the final product..He could care less about how others view his illusions cause he is satisfied and that’s all that matters.He is making and living art here not just big cheap tricks. He wont exchange the process for accessibility .He is Bergamn before he got famous,he just might be Tarr.Even his stage is low key- a college screeing at worst,Day 4 at the TIFF at best.But the beauty of his illusion is that its deceptive to the casual viewer cause undernesath the drab appearance is a truly great trick and if you ‘get’ it you’ll be blown away.That’s why while the audience gives a few claps,the magician in the audience(Angier) is blown away by the immensity of it all.You need atrained eye and atrained mind to see beneath the surface.If you can’t then Borden is a bore;if you can then he is legendary.He is the filmaker’s filmmaker-making the movies only someone like him will understand fully.His critics will tell him”FI nobody’s watching,why do it?”.Borden is a craftsman-he takes pride in the process of creation rather than what he creates.He is pure esoteric,indie cinema.

**Art lies in the process of performance**

So we have established that both Angier and Borden are 2 artists with opposing views and that most directors fall in these 2 categories.But if filmmakers were only either a Borden or an Angier than cinema would be very bland.A movie would either be a Transformers or a La Jette.The only people watching movies would be fanboys and ciname snobs.Luckily there is a 3rd kind of filmmaker and he combines both Angier and Borden.For if Borden loves the process and Angier the performance,this 3rd kind relishes the process of performance ie he makes the movie the audience wants but he’ll make it his way.The brilliance of such a director is that while an Angier may make a lot of money and a Borden will have the critics foaming in excitement,the 3rd guy will be making the indelible cinema that stands out amongst the rest and is still talked about years later.

The best example of such a man is Francis Ford Coppola.Apocalypse Now is a illusion  both men of The Prestige would be proud of.Its bombastic,high on emotions and sensually arresting.Its message is blunt”War Is Madness,Madness is Hell” and there’s no attempt to shroud the fact.Every trick in the book is used to prove the message but FFC does it better than others.From the slowburn madness of Willard to the chaotic sort in the USO show FFC shows us everything-he nevers holds back.If a scene inhibits the ‘show’ he removes it(plantation scene) cause the performance has to be perfect.But this movie is all about the process-it could be done anywhere but FFC chose to do it in a jungle and battled the elemnts as witnessed in A Director’s Apocalypse.Watching him rave about life and death and almost kill Sheen,you’d think he is crazy but then you’d think 2 men sharing the same life just for a trick is crazy.Its a film for a big stage yet its made with such passion and need for perfection that the proess itself has become stuff of legends.These are the movies and illusions that stay on forever.They are built with passion and their purpose is to create passion.By being both entertainment and art they transcend into something more than a Angier illusion and a Borden trick.So thank the gods for the Coppolas,the Herzogs,the Gillians,the Welles and ofcourse one Chris Nolan

**Final Note** 


A question for the readernow,if you agree with me then which filmmakers do you think best represents Angier and Borden.And if you don’t agree then that’s just your opinion,man(kidding,I’d love to know your opinion)

Why does this scene resonate so much with audiences? I want to discuss not only what this scene does for the film narratively, but the affect of the scene and what it does at the embodied level instead of the cognitive level. 

Looking at this scene narratively, we can discern that the plastic bag may be seen as a metaphor for trash/objects that are disregarded or tossed to the side. We see this to be a valid explanation because of Ricky's desire for Jane and he sees her beauty disregarded by others. 

We can take a step further though and think about how this scene is commenting on cinema itself. Ricky throughout the film is constantly filming things through a camcorder which the audience sees POV shots of grainy footage. When contrasted against the glossy, almost melodrama (use of color pallets), look of the cinema camera, we see a noticeable difference. What is Mendes trying to say about film and cinema by using these two different cameras? I believe he is demonstrating the illusion that cinema cameras and Hollywood (the dream factory) can create to deceive an audience. So why is this scene significant? Why does this floating plastic bag shot with a grainy camcorder mean so much to Ricky?

A little bit of background on Ricky, he was sent to military school for smoking pot and while he was there he almost killed a kid because he made fun of his haircut. He had problems, but he has grown up and now acts somewhat normally. Ricky says at the end of his monologue in this scene, ""Video is a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember ... I need to remember..."" Ricky is using film as blinders, not to hide behind the camera or separate himself from the world, but to view it objectively. He wants to extract himself from his family situation, but he can only do it through observing his unedited, objective footage. He is unable to do it through cognitive grasping because his thought and ability to create a narrative in his mind will always bring him back to the old way of viewing life.

This is where I want to discuss the power of cinema and what it does. As viewers we are too often watching film and building a narrative in our minds and when we do this the autonomy of experience gets lost. There are rarely scenes like this in movies where you just have to sit there and watch with very little narrative context yet it moves you so much on an embodied level leaving nothing for the cognitive. Does /r/truefilm like this scene in particular, does it move you emotionally but you don't quite know why? I believe it's because it you can't really create a narrative about it and therefore you are unable to describe the feeling it gives.

Here are some other examples from films that tackle this same idea of embodied cognition.

1366674040.0,21,self.TrueFilm,1cwd40,Why Do We Cheer for the Villain?: A Discussion of Horror (x-post from /r/horror),30,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cwd40/why_do_we_cheer_for_the_villain_a_discussion_of/,"*Note: this is a bit of a long read (at least in reddit terms; I’ve written things six times the length of this and I will have to write even longer things in the future), but once I began typing, I couldn’t stop. I also haven't really edited and formatted it, because it was a bit of a spur of the moment and I just wanted to get my thoughts in...pixels. If you read it, I hope you at least find it enlightening or thought-provoking.

Why do we cheer for the villain? I recently watched The Loved Ones, which was quite good, but I found myself confused by my reaction to the ending. I still think that the ending was disappointing, but the more I thought about it, the more confused I got. At first, I found it really “disrespectful” (for lack of a better word) the way the villain met her demise. It annoyed me that the guy got away without any comeuppance. Through some thought, I realized that the guy didn’t actually do anything wrong. He handled the situation in the best way possible, so what was the problem? This just led me back to the original question. No one goes to a horror film to watch the villain die, unless he or she gets right back up by the end. This is the one thing that separates horror from any other genre. If the villain survives an action film, a sci-fi film, a western, etc., we demand restitution. So, why do we want the villain to survive? Why do we want an evil, dream-invading pedophile, a sororicidal maniac or an inbred cannibal to make it through and kill our peers?

I think it comes down to two contradictory positions. We, as the viewers, are confused about our identification. We wish to be the villain, but we also wish to be the victim. Many film scholars have written on the sadism that is inherent in horror films, particularly slashers and body horror. The audience for a horror film usually consists of outcasts, young people who are more desensitized to violence and who, more than likely, deal or have dealt with bullying in school, or just generally people who do not want to deal with “the man”. The viewing of a horror film allows these viewers to gain power which has been consistently denied them in their day-to-day lives. While a select few people will take this act into their own hands (countless school shooters, etc.), the average person harbours resentment towards their peers, but lacks the psychopathy to attempt to harm them. The next best thing is to watch a representation of himself or herself (the villain) kill representation of his or her peers (the other characters, who are killed, who tend to be similar in age and position to those who cause harm to the viewer). That’s why we get offended when our avatar dies; we wonder what compels the director to kill us, the scorned party, people he or she has never met!

The other representation comes from the more suppressed thanatotic impulse. We will refuse to admit this, but we do want to be victimized by the villain, because, subconsciously, we do want to die, which accounts for the other reason we watch horror films. Why would we want to die? There are two reasons for this. The first is simple, while in contradiction to the first above reason: As much as we hate the characters who represent our peers, we also wish to be more like them. Who dies in horror films? Other than the occasional adult or “nerd”, they are always attractive, young people who have the world going for them. The viewer’s life is difficult, but these people seem to have it figured out. The other reason is more complex. One of reddit’s favourite adages is “don’t stick your dick in crazy”. Ignoring the crude connotations of that phrase, it does come off as common sense. However, through the modern media, “crazy” has been fetishized to the point where we actually seek out crazy. The villain tends to be psychotic and that carries a set of condition. In cases where the villain isn’t deformed, she or he is always sexy, overly sexualized, has a voracious sexual appetite and is always ready to go. Despite our human survivalist instincts, we would rather die at the hands of a sexual beast than some other, more boring method. Ultimately, the viewer, craving the sexy psychopath wishes to be in the position of the victim, allowing access to a sexual release before the more physical one.

That’s why we cheer on the villain. We want to be the villain, so we can be more powerful, but we also want to give up our power to the villain. Thoughts?",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_1cwd40,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cwd40/why_do_we_cheer_for_the_villain_a_discussion_of/,

The main proponent was obviously James Cameron. There's a particular (what I thought was funny) scene where he brags that not one shot of Avatar was filmed in a forest and that with the advent of 3D it's hard to tell the digital from the real. This claim seems a bit ludicrous to me as 3D films look completely unnatural and (for me) almost take the viewer out of the experience rather than immerse them (as he claims.) I never watched Avatar in the cinema but I did see Hugo (one of the other 'good' 3D films) and the experience felt almost like a chore. It was hard for me to keep the 3D glasses on as I got minor headaches and the picture was dark. The film itself wasn't half as enjoyable as it could have been. During the release of Hugo, Scorsese said several times that he plans to shoot his future films in 3D which really worried me but as we've all found out, his next release (The Wolf of Wall Street) isn't being shot in 3D. This shift in opinion shows two things: a) Scorsese was merely promoting rather than advocating b) 3D isn't necessary for every film. Ridley Scott also said similar things during the release of Prometheus but has since continued not to film in 3D. With these major directors pulling out of the pro-3D corner it got me thinking that 3D cinema isn't here to stay. Without serious filmmakers continually pushing good content into 3D cinema what we're left with is films like Piranha 3DD where the 3D is a gimmick rather than an asset.

Allegedly the lack of standard ""Welles"" shots, and the brilliant editing were supposed to act as a incentive to Hollywood, an advert for Welles' diversity as a auteur. The fact he was never took up on the offer, adds another chapter to that infinite book entitled ""How Hollywood screwed Orson Welles"", but I digress.

The film, while wavering in places, is still a film thats designed for rewatching. You realise that not only is the subject fakery, but that the admitted Charlatan behind and in front of the camera is commiting fakery himself. I noticed, watching for the third time, that he presents the same shots in different contexts - he commits this film fakery, several times. He shows us a camera crew filming Welles' the realisation dawning that, there must be two film crews, one to film the second. Similar shots throughout.

Now, this isn't a perfect film: Welles' has made a film using someone else's footage and edited his own ideas around it. This means that his ideas aren't always as clear as I imagine he intended. Welles' narration while compelling (Orson Welles is blessed with the voice of God himself), skirts around the stories he's presenting, and refrains from detail.

I'd love to go into more detail, but it's 4am here, and my dental pain isn't completely gone. Suffice to say, I find this to be an underrated movie in Welles' catalogue and was wondering what the rest of /r/truefilm thought of it.

* I am thinking about the process of making the film (writing, shooting, acting, editing, etc) and the choices that were made.

* I am thinking about all the previous films that are similar or dissimilar, or unrelated.

* I am thinking about the politics of representation, of language, of commerce, of sex, of history, etc.

* I am thinking about the feelings that I have when I watch the movie and what they say about me as a person, and whether other people have similar experiences or if I'm missing out on something (or they are). 

* I am thinking about whether I like watching the film.

When I talk about movies, I generally try to synthesize all this stuff using the things I've learned from watching movies my whole life, and reading books and making movies and what have you.

I mentioned to a friend that I had a problem with the gender politics (woman as sign, alienated from the subject position, reinforcing regressive heteronormative relations) and he said that I had been ""fucked up by film school.""

In certain situations, it's easier to talk to people about the *other stuff* in movies. Triumph of the Will, for example, is a pretty, well-made film that is morally horrifying. It's easy to draw a distinction between ""I enjoyed it"" and ""those people should burn in hell,"" even if you experience both of those things when you watch it. What's tough is when the film is marketed as mainstream entertainment, and the person you're talking to is convinced that taking it too seriously is a waste of time.

1375479762.0,21,self.TrueFilm,1jlafa,Symbolism in AKira Kurosawa's Kagemusha,23,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jlafa/symbolism_in_akira_kurosawas_kagemusha/,"I watched this film last night(the Criterion cut, which has an additional 20 minutes of footage), and I thought it was great.  I haven't watched Ran yet, but Kagemusha was definitely one of Kurosawa's best films, and to see him get back on the horse after the disappointing Dersu Uzala and the abysmal Dodesukaden was, in its own way, endearing.  Kurosawa's direction here was excellent.  My favorite scene would probably be when the Kagemusha watches the Noh play, and from the orientation of the characters and intercutting, Kurosawa makes a brilliant comparison to the Kagemusha acting as a double and the Noh actors.

This is more observations than strict conclusions, so sorry if I ramble.

But throughout the film, I noticed there was a lot of repetitive Christian symbolism.  Firstly, the thief who becomes the titular Kagemusha is initially saved from Crucifixion.  If I recall correctly, there are several more references to crucifixion, though I do not remember them all presently.  The Kagemusha eventually dies at the end of the film, which would seem to correlate to Christ, but that doesn't suggest any kind of resurrection, unless you would consider him being rescued in the first place the resurrection.  Another instance of Christianity might be the presence of the priests shown briefly in the film.

Now, I think ideas and beliefs are central to the film, the human need to have an ideal to believe in in order to continue(how can we have a shadow without the man?)  Obviously, the purpose of the Kagemusha is to make people believe that Shingen was still alive, which allowed his armies to keep on and prevented his enemies from attacking.  Another recurring image that I think conveys this theme would be water.  It appears multiple times throughout the film, the lake when Shingen was buried, the pond the Kagemusha stomps through in his nightmare(perhaps this image suggests the extent of the Kagemusha actions, the trivial actions of a thief augmented to the thunder of a giant), and most importantly the image of the dead Kagemusha swept away in the current of the sea, floating past the drowned flag of the army he sacrificed himself for.  Of this image, Roger Ebert writes:
&gt; But Kurosawa's last image -- of the dying kagemusha floating in the sea, swept by tidal currents past the fallen standard of the Takeda clan -- summarizes everything: ideas and men are carried along heedlessly by the currents of time, and historical meaning seems to emerge when both happen to be swept in the same way at the same time.

And on the theme of belief, Ebert writes(I hate to keep quoting him, but he puts it more eloquently than I could):
&gt;Kurosawa seems to be saying that great human endeavors (in this case, samurai wars) depend entirely on large numbers of men sharing the same fantasies or beliefs. It is entirely unimportant, he seems to be suggesting, whether or not the beliefs are based on reality -- all that matters is that men accept them. But when a belief is shattered, the result is confusion, destruction, and death. At the end of Kagemusha, for example, the son of the real Lord Shingen orders his troops into a suicidal charge, and their deaths are not only unnecessary but meaningless, because they are not on behalf of the sacred person of the warlord.

So, I suppose the connection I make between the Christ imagery and the human need for belief is Kurosawa making a larger statement about how the Christ myth or more broadly religion functions in our day-to-day life, perhaps even about the similarity of myths that people engage in across cultures.

I think it's one of Kurosawa's most thematically complete films, certainly the most intricate below the surface since Ikiru.  I was surprised to learn it had won the Palm D'Or, but I can appreciate that now.  Kurosawa wasn't making a Samurai epic as much as he was a condemnation of war and a statement on the nature of human belief.  A final note on the film: Moreso than in Kurosawa's other Samurai epics, I felt a certain dreamy quality to the film, the absurd premise, the muted quality of the performances cast amid the Samurai social code, and the surreal imagery(particularly the dream sequence), a quality I am certain extends from Kurosawa's renewed emphasis on his painting following his inability to find funding for his films.  I guess it gave the film a certain reality.  It didn't feel like a historical film, or even a modern one.  It felt like a universal work of art.

It begins with Malik El-Djebena (Tahar Rahim), being thrown into a prison outside of Paris. Malik’s struggles, and triumphs are depicted in his six-year prison sentence.  In his prison years, Malik liberates his Muslim people from the corruption of the Corsican mob. A Prophet is very much a coming of age story. Malik enters prison at nineteen misguided, but leaves a peacemaker. Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) corruptibly runs the prison, although he is also imprisoned. Cesar has tight control over the guards because of his Corsican mob affiliation. Malik is forcibly taken under their protection, and in turn, murders an enemy of the Corsicans, Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi). Malik’s murder of Reyeb, a fellow Muslim, sparks a spiritual plot turn. The ghost of Reyeb appears in Malik’s dreams. His ghost teaches Malik to be like A Prophet, a man of utmost wisdom and integrity. Moreover, Malik moves up the Corsican mob hierarchy by being a loyal member, which induces a loss of respect from his fellow Muslim prisoners. But Malik reconciles his Muslim beliefs, through liberating his brothers from Corsican extortion. Malik’s rapprochement to his brothers reveals that he has found a comfortable moral outlook, even within the grit and filth of a prison. A Prophet affirms Malik’s progression towards manhood, through the morally contentious challenges he faces as a prisoner, friend, and drug trafficker.

When one says the name, some people cringe and some people shrug. He's had some good performances, most notably Scott Pilgrim and Superbad, but a common complaint is how he plays the same character every single damn time. It started with Arrested Development, where the performance was actually very fresh and a breakaway from other portrayals of teenagers at the time. Now, it has grown into Cera's ""thing"", a phase of synthetic awkwardness that never ends. Except, it might be.

Take his [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelCeraJash), for example. He's directed two shorts, **Brazzaville Teen-ager** and **Failure**. He also acts in **Gregory Go Boom**, created by someone else. There's a common thread in these shorts; they are all dark, a little strange, and very emotional. I found them to be quite good. In Gregory Go Boom, he does play a character similar to the one he so often plays, but he is so socially inept and also wheelchair-bound, that even when he makes a racist comment, I felt sympathetic. In Brazzaville Teen-Ager, Cera is in an odd crisis where he must convince his boss (Jack O'Connell) to perform backup for a pop song. Cera and O'Connell's performances were great, and the cinematography was beautiful. Failure is a shorter short, and could be representative of a harmful relationship. All-in-all, these shorts are excellent, and would highly recommend them. These were the first signs that he was moving away from his typecast.

Now, in Season 4 of Arrested Development, we saw a developing George-Michael. Apparently, Cera got a writing credit on the show at this point, and I have to say this was a very good decision. George-Michael becomes less of ""awkward teenager,"" and more ""trying-to-settle-in"" young adult. He becomes ""overtly-sexual,"" and becomes very successful with his [(fraudulent)](/spoiler) software. I liked the evolution of the character. In ""This Is The End,"" Cera plays an insane coked-up version of himself. This is possibly a result of his ever-similar roles.

I find it to be a fascinating, insightful look into a specific moment in time in a specific place (much like an impressionist painting) from the view of a non-judging outsider. Truthfully, Byrne's Narrator character doesn't seem to have much to say as far any of the other figures and seems content enough to comment on the history of the place and inanimate objects. Rather, he lets the other figures comment on relationships within the townspeople and the incidents unfold before him. 

There is also an underlying commentary about consumerism, mass production for mass consumption, the nature of the disposable world we live in, and correlation with these things as almost a religion of their own. The fashion show scene depicts the townsfolk basically being turned into inanimate objects for show, with them getting larger and more absurd as the show goes on. I love the contrast of these constant images of the entire town population living and breathing in a cookie cutter lifestyle that they all willingly participate in, then having the entire movie lead up to the town's Celebration of Specialness. Even during the parade scene, nearly every Shriner/ Majorette/ Stroller pushing mother is identical to the rest. 

I also find it interesting that the entire town essentially does everything together and could be considered one living entity instead of individual people. Nearly all of them work at Vericorp, all participate in the sesquicentennial celebration, all shop at the mall together, and even all go to the bar (including the kids!) together on open mic night.

There's several bits of imagery repeated throughout the film that you could either choose to associate with a specific symbolism, or chalk up to Byrne's look/aesthetic... maybe it's a little bit of both? For example, the large amount of twins that appear together, dressed alike (which is verbally acknowledged only once, though there are dozens of sets); almost every scene being largely primary colors + green, lack of names for several of the main characters (and instead referring to them by distinguishing traits), etc. 

That said, for all the message of sameness, I find the movie to be beautiful and affecting. I love the monologue at the end while he's driving away and he's talking about how you need to leave a place for an amount of time before you re-visit it, so that you can really see it for the first time again, and therefore know what it actually looks like. It's a nice thought that you could look at your repetitive every day life of home, office, home, office, etc. in a brand new light if you could only step away from it for a little while.

What a great plot, and what a great ending. I can't help but feel nonetheless that Vertigo - as with other of Hitchcock's films - is in many ways a little antiquated now.

There are certain pitfalls in making this argument, I know. Hitchcock popularised so many thriller tropes that we now take for granted, so it's not really those I want to focus on. Nor am I referring to the fidelity of the video and audio - which, for obvious reasons, are always going to be 'of their time' as technology moves forward, despite restoration. I'm referring more to the way it was shot, and aside from the garish technicolour visuals and (in my opinion) unpleasantly grating soundtrack, there are a two specific examples I'd like to point out try and illustrate what I mean...

1) There's something very odd about the continuity of some of the cuts, things that may not have bothered a contemporary audience but bothers me as a modern viewer. Like when Scotty climbs that stepladder in Midge's flat (or is it his flat?) and falls into Midge's arms. There's something very awkward and unrealistic about this, as if there are a good number of frames missing. I noticed this sort of thing in various other places. Sometimes a character will be sitting on a sofa, and then in the next shot they'll be in a *slightly* different position - nothing major, but something that adds to the overall subtle awkward feeling about some of the scenes.

2) Sometimes the shots can be really un-subtle to its detriment. That bit in the art gallery where Madeline is sitting looking at the painting of Carlotta Valdes dressed as Carlotta Valdes. Are those zooms really necessary? Wouldn't there be a better way of showing that her hair and flowers are the same as the painting without drunkenly zooming in to each object so violently? And why are these zooms so wobbly anyway? In the same way, as brilliant as the now popular 'Vertigo' dolly zoom effect is whenever Scotty looks down - do we really need to see it so many times, each time accompanied by a music stinger?

--------------

On their own these sorts of things are no big deal, but in sum they add to a feeling that this film is somewhat antiquated that somehow I never got from other contemporary films such as 12 Angry Men, which is something I find salient considering this film's status as purportedly one of the all-time-greats, sometimes even *the* all-time-great. What do you think?

And yes, I am well aware there are much later films from the 90s that look even *more* old-fashioned.

The moment of the actual crisis, Whip is calm and collected.  He is in complete control as the passengers, flight attendants, and even his God-loving co-pilot are in a state of utter fear and panic in the ensuing chaos.  His control while flying is, to me, in his nature and persists in every action he takes throughout the film.  It is apriori.  The protagonist's ability to stay level during the surrounding chaos of his life is a defining feature of his very being that he has never, up to the point of the crash, had to alter or fight against.  In a sense, the cliche ""born to fly"" comes to mind.  His spiral, in life and in the plane, are controlled and handled.

   Throughout the film, his life continues to fall apart due to his rampant alcoholism and drug abuse.  He attempts to take flight from his problems, hiding them, running from them; never facing them.  His true talent is for balancing and controlling this fall.  Harling, the devil on his shoulder, is his co-pilot into despair as he makes a controlled crash and wreck of his life.  He goes back to his father's farm, meets Nicole, even begins to get help for his abuses.  Zemeckis, I believe, was too obvious with the metaphor of his actual desire to flee to Jamaica in his old training sessna but oh well.  The point is, Whip is only in control when he has control over how his life falls apart.  He must, and eventually does, fight his nature and talent to take flight in order to do what he knows is right.  He must accept his criminal actions, face the truth, and allow himself to go to jail.  The redemption for our protagonist comes when he denies his inner nature which in a sense means he must let go of his control over his alcohol and drug abuse and truly let it spiral out of control until he cant be fixed.

His works to date are Donnie Darko (2001), Domino (script only, dir. By Tony Scott, 2005), Southland Tales (2006) and The Box (2009). 

Kelly’s works are extremely divisive among critics and fans alike. Although his cult classic Donnie Darko is very well regarded, Southland Tales was almost universally booed at 2006’s Cannes. Since Donnie Darko has been discussed a lot in this subreddit and /r/movies alike, I' like to focus more on his later movies

In my opinion, he’s an excellent writer and a good director, but not in the same way I consider Rainer Werner Fassbinder or Peter Greenaway good directors. His films have a very visible wackiness (for example The Box, which is an “alien” mystery film based on a Matheson short story while borrowing themes fom Sartre’s Huis clos). Southland Tales still remains one of the strangest films of the noughties, taking radical marxism and Nikola Tesla theories in a futuristic, post-nuclear attack America. I think he has a lot of potential, though he hasn’t made a movie in quite a while, and since he cancelled his Texas epic Corpus Christi, there aren’t any of his movies in the horizon.

1365830931.0,21,self.TrueFilm,1c9835,The Ballad of Narayama - 1958 - have you seen it?,25,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1c9835/the_ballad_of_narayama_1958_have_you_seen_it/,"[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Narayama_%281958_film%29) - [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051980/reference) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsi1Oi63y6I) - [Buy it on Criterion!](http://www.criterion.com/films/28240-the-ballad-of-narayama)

So this was a total blind buy for me. I had been wanting to pick this one up for a while (since it was announced) solely because the story is very interesting. Or at least, at the time it sounded very interesting. But the release comes with absolutely zero special features, and almost out of protest I decided to pass on it. But, I recently decided to pick it up and I'm so, so glad I did.

The movie is really strange and unlike anything I've ever seen. It really had me captivated from the start of the film. See, it's part movie and part Kabuki theater. Because of this approach, nearly the entire film is shot in a studio on sets, but it takes place in a remote mountain village. And the sets are simply incredible. Highly detailed and deep with colors, the whole movie has a dream quality to it. It's not one of these films that feels or looks cheap, no, it's quite enchanting.

The lighting and the manner in which the movie moves along is also worth mentioning. Because it's attempting to be a theater piece, the lights are very deliberate and dramatic, which is not unusual for Japanese cinema, but in this film it's taken to a whole new level. It's so surreal and beautiful. The skies will be rich purple and bright pink, shining through dark green trees. The lights will go completely out and fade into a deep night blue, and a single light will illuminate a character as they speak. In one scene, while the town attempts to punish a thief, everything is under heavy green lights, but they carry torches, and the effect it other-worldly. Maybe my favorite thing about the movie is how this style is used to shift between scenes. The lights will go completely out and we'll be left with silhouettes of the foreground, and then whatever was in the foreground will slide away and reveal a new scene hidden behind it. Just like in a theater show. It's pure style and man it's fun to watch.

As the story unfolds, there is a LOT of traditional Japanese music and singing (SEE EDIT) that explain what's going on in the story. It may seem needless, since the characters and their actions are obvious, and it's not a complicated or challenging story, so there is no *need* for it, but it's a great way to solidify the concept and I love the way it sounded.

The story itself is really fascinating. It's based on Japanese folklore, though I don't know much about it. The movie focuses on a remote mountain village where the food is very scarce. Because of this, when somebody reaches their seventieth birthday, it's customary for them to be carried to the summit of Mount Narayama and be left to die. The story in the movie is that story, and it focuses on the self-sacrificing character Orin. She's amazing in this movie and I really loved watching her interact with her family as she tries to basically prepare everyone, and herself, for the inevitable journey to the mountain. It's very touching and the whole style of the movie does a great job of accentuating the emotion of the characters.

I'm not sure what else I can say about this movie. I'm so glad I bought it and I really fell in love with it and I highly, HIGHLY recommend it. If I could I wouldn't gladly put it on my computer and get some screen shots, but I can't. But I can provide you with some from the DVD Beaver review. So check these out and give this movie a try.

There is another movie of the same name that was released in the 80s that seems to have become more popular over the years, and a lot of image searches and video searches will show that, to be aware of that if you go digging around.

Soooo have you seen it? Did you like it or hate it and why? What did you think of the Kabuki style, the singing, and the lighting?

EDIT I did a bit of research and have learned this is called Jōruri. The intro to the movie is also true to Kabuki theater in the sense that it involves a man wearing a mask clamping together oak blocks and announcing the story. The movie opens this way, and traditional Kabuki theater does also. Jōruri is also commonly used in Japanese puppet theater, and you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcUAePfj8wI) video to get a better idea of what I mean. The curtain that draws immediately is very much like the curtain in The Ballad of Narayama that opens up with the movie. The music you'll hear in the video is very much like what you'll hear all throughout the film too, so if you don't get any enjoyment out of it, or find it annoying or something, then you probably wouldn't be able to enjoy The Ballad of Narayama.",,False,,t5_2szp0,1365840837.0,,,True,t3_1c9835,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1c9835/the_ballad_of_narayama_1958_have_you_seen_it/,

That distancing certainly had an impact on my interest in seeing The Hobbbit, and after it being in theatres for over a month I'd felt no compulsion to go and see it. But, inevitably, some friends wanted to get together and go and see it and my arm was twisted, so I went. Hadn't seen any reviews for it, spoke to a few co-workers who'd seen it but they only indicated vague impressions, and other than that had no pre-formed impressions going in. One thing I was consciously telling myself as I watched the movie was to ignore my preconceived notions of the story from the book, I really wanted to watch the movie and not be constantly irked that something was changed or modified from what I'd been expecting. Movies are not books, and they should not be judged as though they are.

I thought that the duality of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield served the story quite well. Apparently The Hobbit will be part one of a trilogy, that being the case each individual picture has to stand on it's two legs while also giving equal room to set up it's successor. Bilbo is a contented home body, who prefers the quite of a relaxing evening taking on an adventure through the pages of a book. Thorin is war hardened and contemptible individual who's seen the ravages of greed and war dominate his life and leave him pitiless and remorseless to achieve contentment in a world where he's seen none for time out of mind.  There's a rather obvious conflict between the two: Thorin feels that Bilbo's lack of commitment to the company and the journey at hand has the potential to put the whole of the group at risk and that makes him wary of Bilbo. Understandably so, one can hardly fathom the callused nature a man might adopt after hundreds of years of toil, strife and loss all now hinging on one little Hobbit who can't even begin to relate his own life to yours, one little Hobbit who's apparent selfishness and lack of empathy at what you're attempting to do will cause utter ruin for all. Resentment indeed.

At first (again my book bias rearing it's head) I was irritated with the Azog antagonist and the whole Orc pursuit throughout the story. However, as I continued to watch and think a bit it occurred to me to be rather necessary. One could argue that the company needs a drive to move forward, one beside the obvious goal which drives them (reclaiming The Mountain). In order to build tension in a story which isn't going to be concluded at the end there needs to be some insular triumph to an outer threat to give the whole of the story a balance. If the film followed the book verbatim to the point at which they ended the story would feel dry, even though what happens at the end of the movie is virtually identical to the book the antagonists in question are not, nor is the mended internal strife of the company. By creating a vendetta enemy with Thorin, and a story-long pursuit of that enemy you allow a natural progress of typical ebb and flow of story. You allow the story to end chronologically where you need it to, while also giving the singular entity (The Hobbit part One) a satisfying ending.

I thought it was smart to use the Azog/Orc pursuers as a way to simultaneously bridge Thorin and Bilbo's conflict. Even though it does feel a bit ""typical"" it was still fitting and allowed the various conflicts to wrap up tightly. You allow Bilbo to show his mustard by intervening in what would otherwise be Thorin's death thwarting Azog's plan, (enter battle Dwarfs) and we're given a nice little speech by Bilbo qualifying his commitment to the company. And I thought that Bilbo's speech at the end was quite nice, the notion of his love for his home and the fact that he's always thinking of it being the motivation to help the Dwarves reclaim the home they'd had taken away from them so long before.

On the other hand I thought that the movie was far too action heavy. Any opportunity for slashing and dashing was taken, fights were drawn out, and at times almost parodically stylized. I thought that the troll scene would have been a great opportunity to tone the action down and couple the tension of that scene with the comedy that made that scene such a hallmark from the book. And though they did follow the scene pretty well, they still managed to throw a massive battle into it. The mountain goblins sequence late in the movie played out to me like an over the top two thirds comedic one third tense chase scene that should have been a third as long. Not just the length of that chase scene but also the sheer overload of frame cuts made my head hurt, I could barely focus on what was happening (possibly intentional) before the frame would cut to another far too busy perspective, and on and on.

Although I can understand a need to introduce the audience (and Gandalf) to the Necromancer and Dol Guldur early in the film(s) I have to say that personally the choice of character with which to make that introduction is a bit odd, but even ignoring *that* the film makers take on Radagast was *way* too over the top. Almost the whole time he was on screen I kept saying to myself: ""Rabbits?!?"" I felt as though the whole thing as far as Radagast was concerned really just resulted in pulling me out of the movie. Though I don't know if I'd say Radagast single handedly makes the film *bad*, his character does achieve it's purpose; I just thought he seemed a stupid inclusion.

Initially I was uncertain how I felt about the films opening sequence. I clearly understand that the audience needs to be made aware of what the historical significance of what the Dwarves are undertaking is, but initially I thought that it might have been cooler to slowly hint at it over the course of the film. Give Bilbo these impressions of a mighty kingdom upheld through the generations, and than make the coming of the Dragon like this pained reminiscence that Thorin lastly admits while his companions nod in silence, leaving Bilbo with this monstrous impression that will haunt him in the nights. On the other hand that slow build might not be commercially viable, and the way they handled it with the prologue was satisfactory, and it also recalls the prologue in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" film.

**TL;DR**: Overall I would summarize ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" as a 'popcorn movie', a typical action adventure with *so* *so* substance. However, I do think that there are enough elements within the film to warrant some analysis, and the structure of the film is not incompetent.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_184h7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/184h7h/discussion_topic_the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey/,

Initially, we will fidget awkwardly around it; after a while, we will learn how to interact with its interface meaningfully and make lovely music. Perhaps, some of us will practice and practice and eventually give concerts in front of vast crowds.

But this sensor will not only change the way we play music; if it becomes available to the masses, it will change the way we think. After getting used to it, we will be able to interplay between sounds and gestures more freely and we might eventually be able to use them interchangeably. Such a kinesthetic approach to music could lead to experiencing dance more powerfully, being simultaneously the music itself and an expression of it. We might come up with new metaphors to use in poems, we might walk in ways more pleasant to the ear; in other words, the sensor will change the way we think and feel and live.

Cinema is, before all our fancy abstractions, a piece of technology. So, in the way this imaginary sensor changed music, in the way writing has changed language, in the way every piece of technology changes its user: how has cinema changed us?

I was thinking of starting a weekly or fortnightly thread called What Are You Watching or What Have You Been Watching (inspired by /r/malefashionadvice's active What Are You Wearing threads). It's basically exactly what it sounds like. You comment in the thread saying what films you watched that week and you give thoughts on each film. It's a mixture of discussion and recommendation and generally a way for people to contribute more to truefilm and also find new films to seek out and watch. I tried this at /r/movies for a few weeks earlier in the year but some people didn't seem to be getting it.

Another plus is that if it becomes a consistent discussion then we'll start to recognise users who have similar tastes to our own and whatnot. It will also inspire us to check out new and interesting films to talk about.

I've had the debates on reddit, been linked to the infographs, read the books (Dawkins, et al) and I'm still a church attending Catholic. I'm not here for you to pour your scorn on that part of my life, so please refrain.

My point with this is, I found Mel Gibson's *The Passion* to be incredibly moving. I was in tears. Non believer friends of mine however, were less impressed. A similar situation emerged with *The Tree of Life*, which I believe to be a masterpiece that will live forever (I prefer it to 2001, to commit the ulitmate cinephile heresy), but people I spoke to found the whole thing ""unrelatable"" owing to the religious aspect (I myself would hesitate to call it a religious picture, but then I am not these people) and pretentious because ""they didn't understand it"" (In my opinion) . [If you search the Tree of Life on reddit, FYI, you get lots of confused /r/movies posts from people unaware that this was 2 1/2 hour art film.] (/spoiler). 


Similarly, I can't objectively watch a film about Child Abuse. As an abuse victim, I find them mostly really powerful to a fault. I just avoid films with that subject matter. My shrink once told me that amongst her child abuse patients, the two movies she heard about most were *Drop Dead Fred* and *Freddy Got Fingered*. Both of which I can understand (Rip Torn in *Freddy Got Fingered* behaves exactly as my stepfather did in some respects, and *Drop Dead Fred* offers abused children comfort in it's own way) and both are films that I remember being critically destroyed.



These pair of experiences lead me to wonder - how much do you, yourself, bring to a film? Are you watching a film for what the director and writer intended, or in fact are you watching a film based solely on your own experiences? Are their intentions largely irrelevant?

I wrote this for a cinema magazine that went bust after a few issues but I figured I'd share it with people on here, as it may as well have some life.

**Jean-Luc Godard's King Lear [1987]**

When I tell people that Godard made a near incomprehensible Shakespeare adaption starring Molly Ringwald, Woody Allen and Burgess Meredith, people look at me strangely. If I go on to further explain that Godard himself plays a ""Swiss Rastafarian"" who has electronic cables instead of dreadlocks, talks out of the side of his mouth, which coupled with Godard's accent makes him impossible to understand and is called ""Professor Pluggy"", they usually back away and call the authorities. It's a film that I sounds as if it shouldn't exist: Godard signed the contract to make it at a restaurant in Cannes ...on a napkin, he claims to have only read the first and last three pages of the play he was adapting and he seems to have driven original writer Normal Mailer away on purpose. As well as all that, (it also marks Julie Delpy's second Godard role, but it's quite small) Quentin Tarantino used to lie to casting directors by claiming to have been in this film. 

Godard's King Lear is a very odd film, even for late Godard, an [even more] arthouse *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead* mixed with Norman Mailer's script and parts of an unrealized Godard project which are thrown into the mix to add to the incomprehensibility. It's clearly a film he didn't want people to understand. The plot, in it's purest form, is that in an alternative world William Shakespeare's ancestor, Shakespeare 5th, has been tasked with restoring Shakespeare's plays after Chernobyl wiped out most the human race, and nearly all culture (remember that Godard quote about his goal being destruction of culture?). He ends up staying in one place, pondering whether he is writing the characters, or that they are acting on their own while he writes it, looking for meaning in these people that surround him. Ringwald and Meredith play Cordelia and Learo and their lines appear to all come from Shakespeare, Mailer's script and Godard's unmade *The Story* about Jewish gangsters in Vegas (an early title reads: Three Journeys into King Lear). Godard then lets the film play out, slowly, cutting between Ringwald's silence as Cordelia and Meredith's ranting, and William Shakespeare 5th trying to find out what he can from Professor Pluggy. He repeats scenes. He shuffles titles cards around (commonly repeating a black card reading NO THING, referencing not only Cordelia's silence but Shakespeare 5th's search for meaning). He creates beautiful sound collages with animal noises, thunderstorms and overlapping speech. He uses still images and paintings to reinforce his themes. By the time we get to the end (at which point he even repeats the Cannon Group logo from the start of the film) Godard's intentions are not any clearer. He's presented us with a collage of meaning. Different narrative. A purely psychically linked set of things. A distilling of Shakespeare down to one single moment. For some reason it makes a whole, and it's beautiful. 

Godard's claim to have only read six pages of Lear are clearly not true. He follows the themes of the play, albeit in an obtuse manner. His ""three journeys"" and use of three texts is clearly supposed to mirror the fact that we have three different texts of Lear available to us, all from similar dates, all with different versions. Godard further muddles by adding in his own Shakespeare. At one point, Shakespeare 5th claims to have 99% of the play recovered. Yet, we haven't seen hardly any of it. Cordelia's sisters, Regan and Goneril, aren't banished but absent from the very beginning. There seems to be no-one in this version of Lear but Lear and Cordelia. The play is no longer about power, but virtue, specifically Cordelias. Her silence is her virtue, her love (one title that is repeated is Power vs. Virtue, eventually becoming Virtue is Power). Her end is more tragic than ever, as she's done ever less than in the play. Her end is shocking, and a massive emotional punch. This is in part because his imagery leads into it. Close ups on shrieking faces from renaissance paintings, sometimes lit by candles, accompanied by shrieking seagulls and rumbling thunder that leads us into Cordelia's death. I had tears in my eyes and I wasn't sure what was going on.

Woody Allen supposedly plays ""the fool"" but this amounts to little more than a cameo at the end as a film editor named Mr. Alien. Peter Sellars' William Shakepeare 5th, makes little impact. Ringwald isn't on screen that much either. Godard himself makes the most impact, but again not too much. What makes the biggest impact is the film itself. It draws you in on the strength of itself, not it's contents. Godard had long been experimenting with form by this point, and he finally perfected his playing here. He creates a film that succeeds as *a film* not as a result of great direction or great performance. 

There are bad points: Godard's gift for image, for moments that make you smile just slightly even in the darkest places, seems missing here. Towards the end his repetition and shuffling become grating time fillers. 

However, as a whole, this might be Godard's best film since the end of New Wave.

What directors are experiencing a rise or fall in popularity, and what do you think about that? Do you think how brave a director is perceived in challenging the status quo significantly influences critical opinion? 

I read in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/movies/new-on-dvd-shoeshine-adua-and-her-friends.html?_r=1) review of [Shoeshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038913/) Vittorio De Sica is losing popularity, perhaps because as the writer puts it, De Sica was reluctant to challenge authority or assign blame to anyone. But a [1947 reviewer](http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502EFDE1731E13BBC4F51DFBE66838C659EDE) points out Shoeshine rallies against corruption and ""is a brilliantly executed social document"". The modern reviewer says

&gt;Much like “Bicycle Thieves,” “Shoeshine” comforts as it criticizes by insisting on a lack of agency: It’s no one’s fault, no one’s responsibility, but life sure is tough.

A film like [Kes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064541/) is direct in its social criticism and doesn't 'insist on a lack of agency' for the teachers who bully Billy. Should how a film agrees with your worldview affect how good you assess a film's greatness?

Critic [Pauline Kael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael) describes what's great about De Sica's film Shoeshine .
&gt;[...]after one of those terrible lovers' quarrels that leave one in a state of incomprehensible despair. I came out of the theater, tears streaming, and overheard the petulant voice of a college girl complaining to her boyfriend, 'Well I don't see what was so special about that movie.' I walked up the street, crying blindly, no longer certain whether my tears were for the tragedy on the screen, the hopelessness I felt for myself, or the alienation I felt from those who could not experience the radiance of Shoeshine. For if people cannot feel Shoeshine, what can they feel?... Later I learned that the man with whom I had quarreled had gone the same night and had also emerged in tears. Yet our tears for each other, and for Shoeshine did not bring us together. Life, as Shoeshine demonstrates, is too complex for facile endings.

Both Kes and Shoeshine left me with tears streaming down my face but I think Shoeshine is a greater film even though Kes has a stronger message and I related to it more. Does personal preference fit into a certain theory about film criticism? Are changes in polls like the Sight &amp; Sound poll because of a change in taste which reflects social change more than the refinement of film criticism?

Now... Potemkin! As before, I'll start off with a link to a [more recent review](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980719/REVIEWS08/401010302/1023_) by Roger Ebert. I haven't been able to find any contemporary reviews, if anyone can, please go ahead and post them.

With this film, I think it's worthwhile to link to a description of the actual event it's based on. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Potemkin) wikipedia article is very interesting, especially the sort of ""play by play"" description it gives of the mutiny. It might also be worthwhile to read up on the failed [1905 revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905) that the film is set in, and the eventually successful [1917 revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917) that the film allegorizes. Just a few years later, Eisenstein directed  [October](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018217/) about the 1917 revolution, that is definitely worth checking out if you were interested by Potemkin.

I'll  start us off with a few questions to think about. Please don't feel obligated to answer these, and feel free to talk about anything you'd like.

**Some questions:**

* From a purely technical perspective, what did this film do that was ""new"" for its time?

* The film doesn't really have a ""lead"" character. Does this work in its favor?

* Originally, the film began with this quote by Leon Trotsky:

 &gt;""The spirit of mutiny swept the land. A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts: the individual personality became dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.""

 It was later, in the time of Stalin, replaced with this quote by Lenin:

 &gt;""Revolution is war. Of all the wars known in history, it is the only lawful, rightful, just and truly great war...In Russia this war has been declared and won""

 What is the significance of this change? In addition to its political meaning, how does changing the opening quote affect the film?

* What are your thoughts on the character of the priest? What do you think about the scene where Vakulinchuk says ""Beat it, sorcerer!"" and knocks him over? How would contemporary viewers have felt about that? 

* What was the purpose of the scene where they beat up the person who says ""Kill the Jews!""?

* In 1943 the film was[ ""modernized""](http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990DE5D81530E53BBC4D51DFBE668388659EDE) (i.e. changed greatly) by the English and made into a film about resisting the Nazis. How do you feel about this?

* Could a film about socialist/communist revolution made today be as effective as Potemkin was in its time?

* Could a film advocating capitalism be as powerful as Potemkin?

* What later, or modern films, would serve as their era's ""Potemkin""? How have propaganda films developed over time?

* Propaganda is often viewed in a negative light. The word is often used insultingly to mean a work full of lies and extreme bias. Is this a just use of the word? Can propaganda be positive, even necessary? Can propaganda be honest?

* There have been [numerous soundtracks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#Soundtracks) created for this film. The director felt that a new one should be made every 25 years to reflect the current times. If you've seen multiple versions, how does the change in music affect the feeling of the film? What do you think of the specific alternate soundtracks you've seen it with?

* This is one of the oldest films about revolution. What about it is completely outdated, and what is still relevant today?

I know I already linked to it, but just in case I want to again tell you to keep checking the [schedule thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/n3d1y/i_made_a_schedule_for_this_months_film/) to learn the dates of future discussions and keep up with any changes. You will also find links to places where you can watch the films online for free. Please post any questions you have about the schedule or future films that will be discussed there.

**Edit:** I'm once again delaying the Grin Without a Cat discussion until tomorrow(12/17).

Anyone got any thoughts on this series? I've been enjoying it immensely. I like Cousins' analysis and his eye and ear for nuances, connections between directors and their aims. It's amazing that he's managed to interview so many of the most important film-makers and actors from all over the world. Best of all, every episode has given me a couple of films that I really want to see. The one I've enjoyed most so far is [Black God, White Devil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058006/) but my must-watch list is growing every week :-) 

I'm not aware of any documentary series on cinema that matches The Story of Film...IMO it's the [Civilisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilisation_(TV_series)) of serious film crit documentary.

As suggested and discussed by other users, we're going to try voting for a ""theme"" for November's movies of the week. This is an experiment and will only be continued for further months if people like it.

**Rules/suggestions for how to go about this:**

* It'd be nice if you list your idea for a theme, along with **why** you think it would be a good choice. Feel free to list some examples of movies that would fit into your theme, but remember that we're not voting on movies right now.

* I think it would be a good idea to keep the themes broad, in order to avoid watching several very similar movies. For instance, instead of ""French New Wave"" or ""German Expressionism"" it would be better to have more general themes like ""madness"", ""revenge"", or even ""class struggle"". Feel free to get really abstract with it, if you like! Genre themes should be fine as well. We'll be watching something like 4 movies under the chosen theme, so it's best if it can include many different types of films. 

* Don't downvote someone anyone's suggestion. It's not only disrespectful, but pointless because we'll be counting only the total upvotes. If you disagree with a suggestion, comment and say why.

* If you get here early, please come back to the thread later to vote for newer suggestions you might like. I'll keep the poll open for at least 24 hours, unless one gets ridiculously far ahead.

**I'm going to announce the winning theme in an edit to this post**. I'll wait a few hours before listing my theme suggestion in order to avoid it getting unfair attention. We'll be having a vote for the next film as soon as a theme has been picked. 

I don't like to clutter up the front page with ""movie of the week posts"" so we're going to start posting the ""movie of the week"" as a banner for the subreddit once a clear winner has appeared in addition to declaring the winner in an edit of the thread. This will allow there to only be 2 posts a week: the vote and the discussion (and another once a month for the theme, if we keep doing that). 

Also, feel free to post any thoughts or suggestions you have about any of this. We're making it up as we go along and I'm always happy to have additional input. Hell, even if you think the monthly theme, or even the whole idea of a ""movie of the week"" is a bad idea, let us know!",,False,,t5_2szp0,True,,,True,t3_lx6ou,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/lx6ou/lets_vote_on_a_theme_for_novembers_weekly_movies/,moderator

At what point does the character development stop being engaging and helpful to understand and care about these characters? Or does modern cinema do too little to help understand characters?

I actually think that I the ""Romanian style"" is actually great at storytelling. I think it helps engage the viewer more and, has a greater sense of what this character is about. Most of the movies nowadays just give too little information about these characters that we're supposed to care about and at that point, I think, I can't get that involved into a movie because I don't have enough information about these people so I can't care about them.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,t3_lfxsy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/lfxsy/how_well_do_you_need_to_know_a_character_before/,
1376504781.0,14,self.TrueFilm,1kd46y,Pain &amp; Gain vs Spring Breakers. Comparisons are odious but I ask for them,30,16,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kd46y/pain_gain_vs_spring_breakers_comparisons_are/,"Hi everybody!

Now, I've just watched Pain &amp; Gain and I enjoyed the film regardless the unnecessary 130 minutes length. It has its several flaws, no doubt, but it's fast, the plot is somehow original within its own genre (idiots involve in a crime they eventually botch up) and the overall result is a pretty decent black comedy.

I know a lot of people is hating the film because of Michael Bay (and probably The Rock). I wonder if these people liked Spring Breakers. I personally didn't like it. It was boring, dialogues looked like made up at the very shooting, the story was loose, extremely wasted, and the ending disappointing no matter what you come up with to explain such incoherence. Pretentious without intelligence behind it. The aesthetics were cool, though. That's it.

To me, both films can be addressed as similar on the topic of accomplishing the American Dream in the bad way (getting rich easily, through crime instead of effort), both films exploit the beauty/hotness culture, drugs culture, both films are also shot in the same location (Florida). And the final lesson seemed pretty much the same: on this way you will end up dead or in jail.

Can you see these similarities between the films? Do you think Spring Breakers is more intelligent than Pain &amp; Gain?

**EDIT**: I noticed some of you focus on the director's career. I'm specifically talking about these two movies. Try to leave your hate for Bay (and your love for Korine) aside from the discussion.

1376500241.0,19,self.TrueFilm,1kcxjo,[Theme: Westerns] #3. Winchester '73 (1950),21,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1kcxjo/theme_westerns_3_winchester_73_1950/,"#Introduction

With the demand for more psychologically complex and morally ambiguous films after WWII, directors looked to expand the Western from its humble beginnings, exploiting its antiquated settings to include risqué story elements and testing the limits of the Censorship Board. Howard Hughes' *The Outlaw* (1943) and David O' Selznick's *Duel in the Sun* (1946) are 2 early and notorious examples of ""sex westerns""; *The Outlaw* is primarily remembered today for Hughes' design of an underwire bra using cantilever bridge principles to emphasis Jane Russell's bust, a story later slyly referenced in *Vertigo* (1958).

After the release and critical success of Billy Wilder's *Double Indemnity* (1944), the stylistic and thematic conventions of what would later be called ""Film Noir"" pervaded Hollywood. Studios strove to copy the film, sometimes to a shameful degree (Ever hear of *Single Indemnity*? You have now.), and dozens of directors were tasked with turning out B-movie imitations. One of these was Anthony Mann, who between 1944-1950 directed roughly ~10 low-budget noirs. With cinematographer John Alton, Mann exploited the shadows and angles of noir to disguise deficiencies in production values. As his success and reputation grew, his eye turned towards Westerns as a new genre to infuse his noir talents with. With *Border Incident* (1949), he straddled the gap before fully committing to his 1^st Western, *The Furies* (1950).

With James Stewart also on the lookout for psychologically complex roles in Western settings, the stage was set for one of the great Western director/actor collaborations.

#Legacy

James Stewart had done 1 prior Western, *Destry Rides Again* (1939), but otherwise shied away from the genre. What prompted his return in 1950 was a string of financially disappointing films; while *It's a Wonderful Life* (1946) and to a lesser extant *Rope* (1948) are well-known today, at the time they were not box-office successes, to say nothing of Stewart's lesser-known efforts. Faced with a career downturn, Steward chose Westerns as a venue for showcasing his acting range. The success of *Winchester '73* would reinvigorate his career and pave the way for 16 more Westerns, 4 of those with Mann and 3 with John Ford. His financial arrangements would also profoundly affect the studio/actor relationship; For the 1^st time, he would waive a salary and instead be paid a percentage of the gross, a practice that continues to this day. The windfall from *Winchester '73* would guarantee him a degree of artistic freedom in his subsequent choice of roles.

The role of the Indian chief is played by Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis plays a soldier in one of their earliest roles.

1375792666.0,20,self.TrueFilm,1jt32h,Carlos Reygadas's 'Post Tenebras Lux' (2012),24,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jt32h/carlos_reygadass_post_tenebras_lux_2012/,"Below is a short review of Post Tenebras Lux that I originally posted on my [blog.](http://www.shelfheroes.com/2013/08/post-tenebras-lux.html) Have you seen it? What did you take away from it?

—

Beginning with a startlingly beautiful scene of a young girl alone in an ominous field at dusk, surrounded by a bounding pack of dogs and skittish cows, this film is instantly captivating – raising unanswerable questions and pulsing with the power of nature over human vulnerability. And so ‘Post Tenebras Lux’ continues, as a series of vignettes with a few recurring characters and an elusive plot. The closest it comes to a conventional narrative is with the story of Juan (Adolfo Jiménez Castro) and Nathalia (Nathalia Acevedo), a middle-class Mexican couple who, having moved their family to the country for a more wholesome life, find Juan’s problems with addiction and violence unsettle their apparently idyllic life. The film slips back and forth through time without explanation depicting the couple and their children, a local tradesman, a French orgy, a rugby match and a haunting glowing red devil-like creature. A hard film to pin down, expectations twist from one scene to the next.

One of its problems is the sheer amount going on. Each segment apparently explores new themes and is inflected with slightly different styles (the influence of several European arthouse directors is clear), creating the impression of a visual collage lacking any obvious focus or intent – enigmatic and visually arresting, but as the story wears on without shaping its ambiguity into something tangible the experience does begin to frustrate. There’s a fine line between poetic ambiguity and pretentiousness, and ‘Post Tenebras Lux’ rests precariously upon it. Raising multiple unanswered questions it’s hard to get a handle on what director Carlos Reygadas is trying to achieve here, and it appears more like a personal study. What it does capture beautifully is human frailty, the characters at the mercy of the vast imposing natural landscape or their own vices and desires.

The cinematography is exceptional, utilising an unusual 1:33 aspect ratio that, thanks to expert framing and use of light, remains authentically cinematic but keeps a feeling of claustrophobia and closeness that would be absent on a wider screen. An intriguing, almost kaleidoscopic vignette is also present in most of the scenes, distorting the edge of the lens in a way that mimics human sight and our peripheral vision. This amounts to an alluring spectacle that all but physically draws you in to these strangers' lives.

Despite its flaws 'Post Tenebras Lux' makes fantastic use of an air of mystery and short, digestible stories to form an addictive watch full of invention and the unexpected. Ultimately not as spiritually satisfying as it often promises to be, the spectacle and the bizarre experience are more than rewarding. Although the distributors have chosen not to change the title for the British release, 'Post Tenebras Lux' translates as “Light after darkness”, a beautiful phrase that perhaps communicates more about Reygadas’s intent.
