I am attending both weekends of Coachella and stagecoach.

Friday, no swag today but sunglasses saturday or sunday, and prizes can be won. Including VIP wristbands all day.

A very successful weekend. Met over 150-200 redditors. Gave away many sunglasses. If you guys took a picture with me please post it! I met many amazing people and handful of not so friendly redditors.

For the disillusioned rookies to jilted veterans, finding a fling or bringing your long-time partner to Coachella can be (not always, of course) taxing. Throw in some mild to severe intoxication and things can become downright amazing or deadly (or both really). Here is my (happy) story about finding love at a lovely festival...

Last year (my second), I flew into LA with a friend and drove to Indio to meet up with the rest of our crew driving down from Sacramento. My crew consisted of two of my best friends from high school, whom I rarely get to see, and a few of their friends. My love runs deep for my friends and this is an incredible reunion. For the first day: cool weather, heavy day drinking, and a stellar Break-Bot set made for an unbelievable combination. This continued throughout the night and into the morning at camp. You see I had recently broken up a five year relationship and was being shit-on by a bad rebound. This was more than a vacation. This was pure escapism.

We revved up for another day. The shows were incredible, see groups I never thought I would have the chance to see (GY!BE? are you fucking serious?!). Needless to say I was flying from the friendship music and the booze. Before the Radiohead (fuck yes) set we took a quick water/smoke break. Shit! I left my smokes at camp. Feeling desperate for a smoke, and more than a little chatty, I scanned the crowd for an easy target. Then I locked eyes with a super cute girl with this curly top-knot and leopard pants. Jackpot. Simultaneously we said: ""Do you have a smoke?"". Shit. I was hammered and she was way cute so I said something cheezy and we decided to look for smokes together. Conversation was a breeze and her friends were cool. I ditched my buddies. Bros before.... yeah right.

We hung-out for the rest of the Radiohead set and with me not wanting to stop there she says ""We're driving back to LA."" Shit. I quickly countered with my phone number, and she said she'd call. Oooohhh-K. I know the drill.

No call all day Sunday. Better luck next time... We went hard that day. Non-stop dancing, laughing and soaking up the last of the Indio sunshine. My phone rings. Meet at the fire-lobster thing? Done. There she was in all of her glory. Cat-eye glasses, tank, tight pants and a heavy yet very hot miss frizzle-vibe. We caught up on the days activities and got to dancing. 

I was really digging this girl. Thoughts get going tough. She's in LA, maybe I can just take her back to camp now. Maybe I can just go with her to LA and catch a cab to the airport. I wonder if she even likes me. This is stupid. I'll try to steal a kiss. 

Theft was busted. So I tried to ply her with candy. ""Five jelly beans for a kiss?"". a cheek is only so interesting. She keeps smiling and touching my hands and back. Maybe I'm ok? Just be cool. Tupac comes and goes and she says she has to leave again. Shit. ""Can I walk you to your car?"" ""That would be great."" So me, her, and her friend hop in a bike cab, and head for the lot. I keep trying to kiss her. Mixed success. We really did have a lot of fun all three of us and regardless of the romantic interest I say we should stay in touch. We get to her car. I say my goodbye and get a real kiss. Long and soft and sweet. My motivations have shifted. I don't think I could just hook up and ditch her. I let her go. I text her as she heads back home. We reiterate the need to stay in touch. I'm head over heels, but cautious since I'm pretty faded. I come back to a grumpy camp, apparently a cell phone was lost and nobody cares about ""that stupid bitch you ditched us for"". I get little sleep, wake up and pack up camp, and head back to LA for the flight home.

About two weeks later I get a texts from her and her friend asking how I am etc. Romantically disinclined at this point, I enjoy the novelty of long-distance friends and I suggest we become pen-pals, all three of us. Who has a pen pal anymore? it'll be a nice way to introduce our selves. I start it up. I send the a package: A journal for the letters, a pin I made, a small plastic dinosaur, some glass-wear from the lab I work in, a local news paper and a letter about where I come from. The receive the package and return it in the like. This is great. It's about June now and I am preparing another letter. The same day I mail it, I get a call. It's from the girl.

She starts casually asking how I am, etc. We exchange pleasantries but soon, our conversation gets serious. She was having some serious personal issues, and didn't know who to talk to. She called me because essentially I was this fictional character. Not in a bad way. Just someone she knew well enough to talk to, but didn't know her or her friends. A stranger you can trust, if such a thing exists. That night we talked for 4-5 hours. I couldn't sleep the whole night. I called her the next day after work, another 5 hours down. This continued for two weeks. At this point we were falling for each other. Even now I cringe to say that to people. I feel so childish. But it was real. Its amazing the type of relationship you can build when there is no physical aspect to blur your objectivity. We decided to visit. Her first, we'll split the ticket. 

When she arrived 10 days later, it was better than anyone could have imagined. Conversation flourished, romance ensued, and things were great. She left sad, but hopeful.

We continued to visit every 2-3 weeks, luckily flights between LA and SLC are relatively cheap. I am a graduate student about to finish my Ph.D in June, and she just graduated with her bachelors in December. Leading up to her graduation we discussed the future. She says she doesn't really have anything to do until she gets into grad school in the fall, and maybe she could just move to Salt Lake...

So we did it. 

She's lived here for a month now and we couldn't be happier. We a building future plans and daily realize how much we really love each other. If I told myself a year ago that I would meet the girl I am going to marry (believe me, I am), at Coachella I would have died laughing.

So go for it. Dance with someone. Trade jellybeans for kisses. 

Also: wrap it up, No means no, and try not to steal an SO from someone.

I hope to see you there. May love guide you.

**EDIT**: Pure Filth Sound (listed on the 2nd day lineup) is a collective that will MOST LIKELY be hosting DJ's in the Oasis dome, so they don't have a song on here. Another possibility I heard from [poxi](http://www.reddit.com/user/poxi): ""Pure Filth Sound is a new group that includes Sam XL, the founder of Pure Filth who curated the stage last year""

(sorry in advance for the long post, I'm a verbose writer.. haha)

I'm a local here in the Coachella Valley.  A friend of mine set me up with me a job working at an ID Check station on both weekends this year again.  It's actually a cool gig, because I meet a ton of people, the job is often relaxed, and we party hard for the last few hours of each night after we shut the booths down.  We also take turns leaving our post to see our favorite acts during the day. I get paid to largely enjoy the experience.

To be clear, I'm not a cop or narc.  I'm a guy who was talked into doing this job by a friend because it's fun. I'm writing this to help people avoid some trouble and to understand the process.  I happen to agree with checking people for ID, especially when you consider that Coachella could lose their liquor license. I'd prefer no one gets arrested, but that's not my decision.

--------------------

EDIT for description of valid ID:

A valid ID must be issued by a government agency, have a current description and a picture of the person presenting the ID which should state their date of birth, weight, height, sex, color of eyes and color of hair and the card owner’s signature. Under no circumstances can a valid ID be altered or expired. Examples of valid forms of ID can be a driver’s license, state ID card, military ID, passport or in some cases, an immigration card.

--------------------

A few words to the wise...

1) The California Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) police will be on site at ID check booths randomly.  They are in plain clothes and do arrest people.  In fact at my booth alone last year, I probably saw 40+ people per day get arrested and taken away to be cited.  They confiscated hundreds of fake and borrowed IDs.

2) ID Checkers at Coachella are trained to spot fake IDs.  In fact, we go to a mandatory class and are taught to look for forensic clues. Many of the people working the booths do so each year (and at other venues), and they are good at it.  We know what to look for on the ""good"" fake IDs too.  Yes, that means the high-end ID sellers, such as ID Chief.  If you see people looking at your ID with a magnifier and checking it for other things you probably never noticed, this is why.

3) ID Check people are instructed to keep your ID if it appears to be fake or borrowed.  If you are dumb enough to try to reclaim your fake ID when the ABC people happen to be in the booth, they will arrest you.  If a checker spots your fake ID, and it doesn't look like you are going to be busted by the ABC, *walk away* and forget it.  Last year I watched a guy stand there and demand his ID back for like an hour, while the ABC people were away.  When the ABC people came back from citing a bunch of people, they busted him on the spot.  Dumb.

4) EDITED TO ADD INFO:  Fake ID is considered fraud, and according to some information I have seen such as this page (http://www.shouselaw.com/driverslicense-fraud.html) you may be charged with a misdemeanor or a felony.  

What I was told and witnessed at Coachella last year was that the ABC take you off site, write you a citation, then drop you back off at the front gate. I don't know what people were actually charged with, nor do I know what the DA's office will do with you if you get busted. I don't believe they take away your access to the fest, but rules change every year at these shows. 

5) *You don't look like the person whose ID you borrowed.*  Unless you are a family member with ridiculously similar looks to the person on the ID, you will likely get caught.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that borrowed IDs are easier to spot than decent fake IDs.  We look at thousands of IDs per day, and our brains adjust to spotting even small differences in the photos very quickly. Especially the eyes.  Also keep in mind that the ABC will *keep* the legit ID of the person it was borrowed from, and potentially cite them as well.  You have been warned.

6) ID wristbands... the people who run the Coachella show can and will change the ID Check wristband without warning, both the color, and the arm it must be on.  They will make us re-check everyone, and your old wristband will have to be replaced.  If you are going to drink, carry your ID with you into the show each day, or risk having to walk back to get it (some cases a very long distance) in what is going to be 95+ degree heat this year.

If your ID wristband looks like it has been taken from someone else (damaged, too loose, etc) the beer garden entry guards will send you back to us, and we will have to ID you again to give you a new one. It doesn't matter if we saw that you already had one on.  We still have to card you.

Edit:  Much like bars, if you stumble in from camping completely hammered, you probably won't get a wristband.

7) Psychology - The ABC people can spot a lot of faker ID holders while they are still in line.  Some of these people just clearly look too young, and others look nervous and dodgy.  In fact, they have fun guessing who has fake ID before they even see it. They are almost always correct, in my limited experience watching them.

8) Your memory sucks.  If there is some doubt about your ID, you will often get questioned about details on the ID card.  Stuff you should know, like your birth date, the address on the card, etc.  They busted a lot of people this way too. You will be under stress / mind-altered, and you will probably screw up.

9) Drugs... do not try to present a fake ID to get a bracelet while you are carrying your weed or whatever else.  You'll get busted for all of it, because the ABC will search you.

10) Be Nice.  Not every ID Checker is as gung-ho about checking ID as others at these booths, unless you are being a dick.  In fact, we don't have to give you a bracelet at all.

11) DRINK LOTS OF WATER! It's going to be hot! .....and SUNBLOCK!!

Hope this helps!!

This is going to be my first year going to Coachella and I'm sure I'm not alone in having some questions. I figured this would be a good place to compile a bunch of info and where people could ask questions instead of having a ton of different threads.

There is some good information on the Coachella site [HERE](http://www.coachella.com/festival-info) and [HERE](http://www.coachella.com/travel-lodging/on-site-camping), but I'm sure some of the Coachella vets will have some really good insider tips. I like going into something not knowing fully what to expect, but I like trying to be prepared as possible. A lot of these tips are more geared towards camping since that's what I'm doing. I haven't done much research on hotels. (If anything maybe this will help someone remember to bring something they might have forgotten)

EDIT: I added everyone suggestions as of 2/5/13 and broke it down into different aspects of the festival. Some stuff is relevant to multiple aspects so I still recommend reading it all. No one has offered any information for people staying at hotels so I didn't add anything. Also I don't have anything specific about the actual music since I figure there is enough threads about the music already.

Some “essential” things I have read and compiled:

Preparation/Packing

* Build up your immune system before the festival – Vitamin C
* Wristband - Register it before you get there.
* Cash - I have read there are ATMs on the grounds but the lines get long and the fees are high.
* Refillable Water Bottle - There are a few free water bottle refilling stations inside the festival. Water station by the food court is usually pretty empty.
* Camel Back – The site says they are not allowed, but multiple people say they’ve brought them in easily if they are empty.
* Bandana – Cover your mouth when it’s dusty/windy, wet them for the back of your neck where main arteries run to keep you cool, provide some shade inside.
* Backpack
* Car Charger - For phone/iPod
* Extra batteries - Phone, Camera, Etc.
* Collapsible Chairs - For hanging out around the campsite.
* Pop Up EZ Shade - To get some shade at the campsite.
* Tent, air mattress, pillow, Sheet/light blanket/sleeping bag - It gets cooler at night but it will be really hot early in the morning. They make tent locks in case you are worried someone will come inside your tent.
* Tie Downs/Stakes – Make sure your tents/pop up shades are secured so they don’t go flying in the wind.
* Toiletries – There are showers.
* Baby Wipes/Dry Shampoo – Make shift shower if the lines are too long
* Camping Shower – If you want a fancy make shift shower. If you can, bring a pallet or something to stand on to keep off the mud that the shower will create.
* Sunscreen/SPF chapstick - This is mentioned a lot so it must be important.
* Toilet Paper/Flushable Wipes - Who knows if the port-o-potties will be stocked all weekend. Plus that one-ply stuff sucks.
* Ibuprofen/Advil/Aspirin/Pepto Bismol/Imodium - Just in case.
* Allergy Medicine - If you have allergies. There will be lots of dust, pollen, grass, and cigarette smoke floating around.
* Saline nose spray – Clean out the nasty dry dirty boogers in the morning.
* Gastrolyte electrolyte powder packs - To mix into your H20, keep your electrolytes up if you're worried about getting dehydrated.
* Hand Sanitizer
* Condoms
* Small First Aid Kit
* Gold Bond Power – Sweaty balls, swass, chaffing
* Flashlight/headlamp/lantern - For the campground at night.
* Power inverter – If you’re camping and you want a couple power outlets.
* Jumper Cables – Inevitably someone will have a dead battery at the end of the weekend.
* Cooler with food/beer/booze/ice/dry ice – Dry ice helps keep your ice longer but it will freeze anything it touches. The line to buy ice can be really long. If you don't want to stand in long lines and eat expensive event food all weekend then bring food. NO glass allowed in the campground or the festival. ""Please remember that all packages, coolers and equipment will be fully searched by security personnel upon entrance."" (from the Coachella website) There's no hard alcohol “allowed”. The rules say one case of beer or box wine per person. If you're going to bring hard alcohol you better hide it well because apparently they're serious about searching vehicles entering. Some people say the security doesn’t care about hard alcohol as long as it is in plastic.
* Snack food – Power bar, dried fruit, trail mix, etc. Easy stuff to snack on. Not allowed in the venue but good to have standing in line or in the morning.
* Ear Plugs/Sleep Mask - To help sleep at the campground.
* Duct Tape - Always good to have.
* Garbage Bags
* Small Blanket - For sitting on the grass at the festival.
* Camera - Take a photo of your contact information and have it on the camera in case you lose it. Maybe a good person will find it.
* Fun clothes – Accessories, hats, glow sticks, face paint, group themes?
* Bathing Suit, Flip Flops, Towel - Showering
* Hat - Sunburned scalp = no good
* Sunglasses
* Sweater/Jacket - Gets cooler at night.
* Comfortable Shoes - Bring a couple pairs if possible and rotate if they get sweaty/nasty. Sandals are bad in a group of thousands of people jumping all over up and down.
* WATER WATER WATER - Drink it, dump it over your head after a long day of partying, brush your teeth, etc.
* Bring clothes you are comfortable in. It is fun to wear funny/interesting clothing as long as you realize you will be sweating, you will be dancing; you will be sitting on grass. Also light colored flowy clothing is cooler than no clothing.
* Bring more than one set of keys to your car, if possible. You will want to keep your valuables inside your car, and people in your group will want to have access to the car at inopportune moments. Some people hide their keys under their tires or in other places, but I’d rather stay on the safe side.
* Light up Totem – Useful for finding groups at the campsite and in the festival.
* You'll have a much better time if you prepare for Coachella in advance by listening to a lot of the music from all the bands you are thinking of seeing.

Camping

* It is a good idea to fill up your gas tank before you get to the festival. Who knows if you will need to run your car to charge your phone, how long you will be in traffic, etc.
* There is usually a ton of traffic into the venue, especially on Saturday and Sunday from about 1PM-3:30PM. You can save a lot of time if you come in from the east (exit 144) and don't take the Monroe or Jefferson exits.
* Arrive in a caravan of cars. Figure out who you want to camp next to and meet at a gas station or restaurant in Indio and drive in together from there. The order of camping spots goes according to the order of the procession of cars. It is way more fun if you are camping in a big group than if you are all spread out, so make sure to organize that ahead of time.
* If you have a smartphone with Google Maps, drop a pin or similar when you park so you can find your car. If you leave after the last show, it's really dark, crowded and confusing, and you also don't leave the exact same way you go in, so it can be hard to find your car. Alternatively you can get a balloon with about 20ft of string and tie it to your car. Not sure how long it will last, but it is an option.
* There is a store at the campgrounds – Sells basic necessities including ice.
* Pre-game – Pace yourself, but as I’m sure you all realize, alcohol is expensive inside, lines are long, etc. If you plan on drinking inside, get your bracelet as early as possible before the bracelet lines get a mile long.
* Shower at night. In the car camping lots, there are shower trailers that aren’t so bad if you know what to do. If you try showering in the morning you will spend hours waiting in line just to get extremely sweaty right away. Try to shower at sunset, when it’s still light out but the temperature is cooler. There will be absolutely no line at all, and you won’t feel gross immediately after showering.
* No Fires - No fires in the campgrounds. Propane stoves are the only cooking appliance allowed.
* Once you park your car you cannot leave and come back – There is a shuttle that will take you the Ralphs.

Inside the Grounds

* Security can be tight - This means longer wait times to get into the festival. Don't miss your favorite band because you're waiting in line. Make sure to plan accordingly. I have also read that security is more relaxed later in the afternoon if you’re planning on trying to smuggle anything in.
* Buy the t shirts/merch you want early - They sell out at night and the lines are very long.
* The tent bars are shaded and have air blowing inside in case you get overheated during the day. Also there are advertising tents that are air-conditioned.
* Last year there was a tent set up that had phone chargers, not sure if it will be returning, but possible in case your phone dies.
* Air Conditioned Trailers with Flushing Bathrooms – Between the Sahara and Mojave. Also inside the beer garden, and near the outdoor theatre area between the theatre and main stage.
* Don't be afraid to adventure on your own, but cell phone reception can be spotty so pick a spot and sometimes to meet with your friends if you get separated unexpectedly. Use one of the many landmarks that will be at Coachella.
* If you care about a band, go to the appropriate stage/tent before the show before the one you want to go and then work your way to the front. It's really awesome to see your favorite bands up close and live. It's generally more rewarding to be way up front for a few intense shows and then take breaks than bounce around from one thing you think is OK to the next.
* Realize you will be giving up on your expectations of personal space.
* Don't text ""Where are you?"" or any text that requires a response because by the time you get one, your friend won't be where they said they'd be. Also, Text affirmative statements such as ""Meet at Sahara Tent at 6:30pm"" or ""Meet in beer garden by main stage at 8pm"". Finally, Time stamp your texts because ambiguous times like ""Meet me in 20 minutes"" doesn't mean a damn thing.
* Enjoy some of the other stuff - You’re obviously at Coachella for the music, but there’s also an art gallery, installations, beer gardens and a damn ferris wheel! You’re not going to have enough time to do everything, so when you do have time in between bands, rest and go around to check things out. Try a spicy pie.
* Don’t do anything you don’t want to. Don’t think that you’re not getting the full experience if you’re not doing some kind of crazy substance. Coachella is a world entirely of its own, and the way to make the most of it is to just do you.
* Accept the fact that you won’t see everyone you want to see. There are going to be conflicts. You’re going to miss someone that’s on your list of “acts I am seeing for sure”.
* Have fun, explore new bands, make new friends, and enjoy good music

Misc

* If you plan on going to any hotel parties, after parties, pool parties, etc. get on the guest lists.

A man grabbed the girl, who at this point looked like she had a seizure, and forced his way to the front of the audience to get her the hell out of there. People waved their hats around her to cool her down.

Instead of being a total, clueless asshole, Jeff said ""Oh my God"", stopped his set, and helped get her out of the pit. He then proceeded to tell security to get medical attention ASAP. A few minutes later, he sat back down to face the audience and said how one time he saw an artist who just sat there the whole fucking time doing nothing while a girl passed out at his show, and how he's not just gonna do nothing about it for the same thing. Audience cheered him on and when he heard the girl was doing okay, he finished the night with Two Headed Boy.

I happen to belong to a large group of 20+ people who are planning on attending Coachella this year. I'm sure that some of you guys have bumped into issues of what weekend you or your group is planning on attending, as ours has. This thread is here to hopefully find people who are willing to trade weekends. 

As far as my situation is concerned, our group has a total of **FIVE GA Weekend One Passes** and **FOUR Car Camping passes**. We're looking to trade for the **Weekend Two** equivalent. (Keep in mind that you **cannot** use a Weekend One Car Camping pass for Weekend Two, or vice-versa.)

Hopefully everyone is able to get the tickets they need so they can party in the desert with friends come April.

EDIT: As sgreenha has reminded us: I have four GA Festival Passes that are linked to four Car Camping Passes, and then one extra ticket not linked to any camping pass. Those four tickets that are linked to the Car Camping HAVE to be traded with passes that are also linked to camping passes. Make sense?

&gt;Please note: Camping passes are non transferable by themselves. They will only work when scanned with the festival pass it was ordered with originally. If you bought multiple festival passes and one camping pass, the camping pass will only be valid with the first one from your group that arrives. This is to help thwart scalping of camping passes and making camping available to actual onsite campers.


EDIT 2: SHIT, GUYS. 

EDIT 3: So I've spoken to a few of you, and might be out of Weekend 1 passes to trade. Not 100% sure yet on that, though, so don't fret just yet. My group still has a few people who have weekend 1 passes, but they haven't decided if they will be able to go to weekend 2 yet (work, school, other crap...). MANY THANKS for those of you who were willing to trade. And don't give up if you're still looking! Other people may be wanting to trade, too.

Yes general admission tickets are all sold out for both weekends. Don't worry. You can still go, but first off some rules:


* Do not buy the VIP or crazy-priced Eldorado and Sahara ticket packages.
* Do not start scouring Ebay or Stub Hub and bid on expensive tickets.
* Do not exchange sexual favors with people on craigslist for wristbands.
* Be patient and wait.

Right now is the worst time to buy tickets. Wait until mid to late March and check out Stub Hub and Ebay. Every year tickets drop to within $50-$100 of the face value because around this time people find out they can't go and big-time scalpers find themselves with a cache of tickets they need to unload. 

I've watched this happen every year since 2007 when I bought tickets off of Ebay at face value two weeks before the festival... this was after tickets sold out in January and were going for up to $2,798 at one point.

If you find it, ask whoever is around for Victor (me) and look forward to me giving you a big hug and a possibly a beer (depends on how much I'll be able to sneak in). Why am I doing this? I honestly don't fucking know, but who gives a shit because I love you.

We released in just in time for Coachella, [posted it on here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/s4uqg/two_redditchellaers_and_i_have_built_a_navigation/), and got some amazing feedback and even got featured in the header for the week leading to the festival. 

We've continued working on it since then, and a bunch of your suggestions (and more!) are now part of the app. It's still free, and still doesn't have any ads.

To give you a quick overview of what Falcon does:

 * It has a navigation tool based on a compass. It points you towards your destination and gives you distance, and so it doesn't rely on roads or require cell service

 * You can save any location -like your tent or car spot - with just a couple of taps, and find it again. 

 * A complete in-app messaging system lets you share messages, meetup spots, and maps (sets of locations, like all the stages) with your friends who use the app.

 * Your shared locations get autofilled with time and date so if it's received late (we've all dealt with shitty reception), your friends will know.

 * Stages will include set times for easy reference.

 * The locations and info are all crowdsourced, so if there's an awesome party somewhere in the campgrounds, just save it publicly and everyone else can find it!

The newest Coachella map isn't in there yet, but we'll put it in as soon as we get good data on where everything is.

You can [download it from the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon/id506151543?mt=8) for free. It's iOS only right now, but we're working on releasing an Android version asap.

And in case you wanna stay posted on future developments, you can check out our [facebook](http://facebook.com/falconapp) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thefalconapp).

Also, here's a [random picture of the three of us](http://imgur.com/Bm7hAQ7) on the grounds last year with one of those awesomely designed trash cans. Our friend designed this one so we took a picture with it.

1366425737.0,39,self.Coachella,1cpwde,Just an FYI for those of you with drugs at Coachella.,49,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1cpwde/just_an_fyi_for_those_of_you_with_drugs_at/,"I posted this as a comment in a previous post but I'm posting it again as a new thread. I attended weekend one and saw this happening everywhere. 

My neighbor in car camping had his weed and grinder confiscated by security right in front of me. They asked where their drugs were and told them to hand them over. They then quickly left on their bikes. Minutes later I go to buy a bag of ice and I see the same two security officers taking the drugs along with BAGS of other drugs they had confiscated from other campers to the information booth where I was standing. These amnesty boxes are emptied and given to runners that go and re-sell the drugs to festival goers to make money.
I've reported this to Indio Police which reported it to Goldenvoice. They seemed to be pretty interested in what I knew. If you get caught with anything you'll most likely be scammed into handing it over instead of having an actual police officer do it who has to take a report. I talked to a worker who was so high on percocet 5 and free beer from campers that he continued to try to pick up a single piece of trash in 37 mph winds for a few minutes straight. Da fuq is going on at Coachella?

I'm convinced that there's some kind of drug ring going on amongst the security there. If you see this going on report it to the police there. Taking your stash is one thing but turning around and selling it is just a whole other level of wrong. Don't be too confident smoking in the camp ground. Smoke in your tent, lay low and don't get fooled into giving up everything you have like our neighbors did.

I can guarantee you that none of them want to take your stuff, they're just doing they're job. Imagine how much your life would suck if you got bitched at all day for doing your job.

1337316338.0,39,self.Coachella,tsua6,Dear Goldenvoice if you actually care about stopping scalpers then institute a ticket registration...,47,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/tsua6/dear_goldenvoice_if_you_actually_care_about/,"...It's simple. [Glastonbury has one](https://glastonbury.seetickets.com/Registration/Register) and it works perfectly. All it takes is a simple registration system, which you [basically have set up](http://coachella-weekend2.frontgatetickets.com/signup.php), and then requiring all ticket exchanges to go through your system.

But in reality you don't care. You're more concerned with manufacturing hype, with [creating headlines](http://www.businessinsider.com/sorry-slow-pokes-coachella-is-already-sold-out-for-next-year-2012-5) and increasing demand in order to raise ticket prices each year. You could fix this but you wont. **Because the truth you smile about behind closed doors is that the scalpers are on your side.** They inflate the market value for the tickets, they decrease supply, they push people into buying VIP passes *cause it's only a few dollars more than regular passes on eBay.* 

You could fix all these problems but instead you have one of the easiest systems for scalpers to circumvent. Last year you sold out in record time. But the dirty secret no one is mentioning; during the month leading up to this year's festival tickets were selling at cost. Why? Because there really wasn't the crazy demand. It was all created by the secondary market. So Goldenvoice keep screwing over the real Coachella fans for a quick buck. Sooner or later your hype is going fade away. 

Sincerely,

*A Coachella ticket holder who's sick of dealing with this shit every year*

1366816331.0,36,self.Coachella,1d0hif,Fun Things to do at Coachella,43,7,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1d0hif/fun_things_to_do_at_coachella/,"So this was my first Coachella, and I thought I'd put together a list of fun non-music things one can do.  Please feel free to add your own.

* The Activities Tent in Car Camping - lots of hard-working people help you to make buttons, design clothes, color, make iPhone cases, and read Zines while a DJ spins.  We had a great time here on Friday!

* The Farmer's Marker in Car Camping - I'm all about that Green Drink.

* JBL Tent - Free Coffee, wi-fi, and the slowest possible charging docks for your phone.

* Get to know your neighbors - Before going to Coachella, my wife and I were very sure that we would just keep to ourselves and not bother making friends.  That changed really quickly - best neighbors ever!

* People Watch - we had a ton of fun watching the bad mushroom trips in the charging tent on Saturday night.  I also played a fun game called ""What Are They On?"".  

* Walk around car camping - saying ""Happy Coachella!"" and getting hugs from strangers.  Coachella is probably the friendliest place on earth.

* Drugs.

* Zia Records - the staff was rude and unhelpful, but they had a good vinyl collection for sale, and had record signings all day.  

* Crab Fries.

EDITS:

* Use the charging lockers (they're to the right when you walk into the festival, across the way from the record store).  We found them the last day, and they are awesome.  You don't have to sit with your phone while it charges like at the JBL tent, and your phone is safe!

* Bring a game and play it with strangers.  The dudes across the way from us had a bunch of buckets and a softball, and played a larger version of beer pong.  There were a ton of beer pong tables (which I would totally play with water, were I you ... I saw a lot of miserable, dehydrated hung over people miss entire mornings).

* Watch the hippos / snail / sharks / balloon chain carrier guys / performers at the Do Lab.  Coachella is full of oddities and freak shows, for those interested.  Don't miss the Tesla Coils - they're amazing!

* Watch the sun rise.

* Pick your sunset band carefully.  My highlight came in the form of Portugal. The Man performing The Sun at sunset.  It was blissful.

* Spicy Pie - worth the lines and the screaming shits it will give you.

* Sharing with others.  We brought a shit-ton of food with us, and ended up sharing a lot of it with passers-by.  There is a kindness economy at Coachella, and it does not experience inflation.  My neighbors shared meals with us, brought over some weed, and offered us all kinds of love.  The generosity at the festival is inspiring.  

* Talk to people.  Talk about where people are from, what they do, who they're there to see, what they like, etc.  Getting to know strangers was a big part of my successful Coachella.

* Rage.  I'm not into this, but I can see why some people with more energy (and better drugs) do this.  Think about it - you're in the desert, you're away from civilization in this makeshift community full of people who are just interested in feeling good and having fun.  So get after it - RAGE!  Dance, drink, party, have sex (wear a condom) and then do it again.  

* Don't rage.  The beauty of Coachella is that everyone experiences it differently.  There are no two identical Coachellas, and there will never be an experience like this ever again in your life.  The people who surround you, the accidents of nature, the serendipitous way of life all comes together to create a perfectly unique and timeless experience for you.  Enjoy it, let it happen, and let the moments flow through you like water.  Lay down and enjoy the music.  Let it enfold you.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,1366839020.0,,,True,t3_1d0hif,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1d0hif/fun_things_to_do_at_coachella/,

Being their first show in a couple years, tandem with being the first show on their ""Road to Coachella"" tour, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought maybe some new songs, and some old, and keep it short.

Instead, they played the whole new album, all the songs from ""Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix"", and more. 
It was incredible. Everyone loved it.
I myself enjoyed the new songs the most.

I think Golden Voice took a risk with giving Phoenix the headline position, but last night they proved they're worthy.

1359352765.0,39,self.Coachella,17ey8f,Unique Coachella Advice (Repost),54,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/17ey8f/unique_coachella_advice_repost/,"This is a re-post, but I feel it will be help a lot of first-timers who may not have seen this the first time I posted it:

I've been attending Coachella since 04 and I have some tips for newcomers that I don't believe have been brought up in other tip threads. These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche, but sometimes it's necessary....

-When entering the parking lot, disregard where the parking monkeys tell you to go and park as close to the LOT entrance as possible. You will be thanking yourself when you don't have to wait 3 hours to get out of the lot at the end of the night. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike to the fest and lock it up on the fence near the entrance. This saves tons of time getting in and out and is not too excruciating of a workout depending on how far your hotel is from the polo fields.

-Starting a couple years ago, the main stage got a new configuration. Previously, the best place to stand was on the left side, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it. The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left. When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

-Arrive early Friday and Saturday, even if there aren’t bands you want to see til the evening. If you arrive anytime after noon, expect a long wait to get into the parking lots.  I've found Sunday to be a little more chill getting in as people are generally pretty burned out by the 3rd day.

-If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, chips, etc) stock up as much as possible, especially if you have a backpack with you. One year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

-For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio, go to Don Jose’s Taco Shop. I swear this place’s carne asada burrito beats most places I’ve been to in San Diego and LA.

-Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection, one of the biggest I've seen.

-Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.  I know this sounds shady, but if you don't do it, someone else will and the bottles still get recycled in the end.

-If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and grass, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

-If you have a short attention span, band conflicts shouldn't be much of a issue for you. There's nothing wrong with seeing half-sets which allow you to pretty much see anyone you want. Think of Coachella as a sampler concert. If you want to see a full-set, go see them when they come to your town.

-If you're going to drink, get your wristband EARLY, or you will wait in long lines.

-SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Biffy Clyro.

-I know I'll get flamed for this, but the Sahara Tent is a hassle. Stay away from it unless there is a DJ you REALLY want to see. It gets very crowded and sweaty and dancing becomes a chore and not enjoyable unless you're on drugs. It's also the furthest tent away from the main stage, so you will be doing lots of walking if you plan on frequenting the Sahara often.

-Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap and overpriced. Spicy Pie is all hype, no matter what you hear.  It's a $7 slice of thin crust with pepp/jalapenos.  You're better off getting a gut-busting burrito in Indio before the show each day, which should tide you over all day and then do In-N-Out down the street from the venue after the show.

-Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands. For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear. I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

-This will make me sound like a TOTAL tool, but if you're willing to do this, bring in a small footstool in your backpack that will make you SLIGHTLY taller when watching bands. Last year, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.

-WATCH OUT FOR COPS ALONG HWY 111 AFTER THE SHOW! One year I got a $300 cell phone ticket. And so you don't give them a hassle, the cops lie to you and tell you that ""in Riverside County, a cell phone ticket is only $40"" only to be surprised by the monetary rape you find in the mail a few weeks later. He was also going to write me up for not using my turn signal but I was able to plead that he just write me up for the cell phone so that it doesn't go on my record.

-Finally, for Indio's hottest club, try ""BLLAHAHHAHHGHHAHHGHHH""....they've got everything....midgets, circus dogs, 90-year old jizz moppers and a fat guy in the corner named Jimbob who will draw a caricature of you that looks nothing like you.

* bring A LOT of water and a good water bottle. You wont be able to bring the full bottles of water into the grounds but you will need them for breakfast (its the hottest when you wake up IMO) and anytime you are not in the festival
* bring a small bag. it will make everything better. 
* sunblock. sunblock. sunblock
* **bring something to cover your face**, whether it be a bandana or a scarf, dust is easily kicked up and the winds dont help either. this one is essential especially if you have weak lungs or asthma
* bring the amount of money you think you are going to spend and a little extra. never know if you are going to need it.
* you dont have to get into the festival as soon as the gates open in the morning, rest and eat up, you are going to need it for later.
* for the bands you want to see, go to the stages when the band before is still playing, if you REALLY want to see them, go 2 bands before
* i recommend wearing sandals or some light colored shoes. i had brought some brown slip-ons and my feet were still on fire during the day
* if its anything like last year, everyone will be your friend so dont be afraid to talk to your camp neighbors
* bring a sweater for the night time, it gets pretty chilly
* the best time to charge your phone is very early in the morning, it gets pretty crowded by 10am and there's usually always a line in the festival to charge it there

UPDATE:
here is a more organized list of essentials to carry at all times:

* small bag
* sunglasses or hat
* sunblock
* toilet paper
* water bottle
* your list of bands on the set list for that day
* Bandana or light scarf

Here's my don't miss list and some misc notes...,36,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1cfuaa/just_made_it_back_home_heres_my_dont_miss_list/,"Simian Mobile Disco, Paul Kalkbrenner, The Faint, C2C, Alt-j, Dog Blood, Grimes, Tame Impala,  Major Lazer (get there early people were spilling out pretty far), Airborne Toxic Event, Vampire Weekend. 

TNGHT had sound issues (I think) but otherwise they'd probably be on this list too cuz they're awesome. 

Andreilien in the DoLab was amazing.

I wasted the Sigur Ros show like an idiot because of the Daft Punk rumors during the Phoenix set. Yeah yeah I know. We all knew. But for some reason nobody believed it even when Phoenix was over we were all standing there for a few minutes AFTER the wall home music turned on thinking ""here it come, any moment now"". Anyways I will always regret missing Sigur Ros I'm sure it was amazing.

If you haven't already noticed Unicorn Kid is not at Coachella. This was a huge let down and I didn't notice until we were already there.

The last 10 minutes of Bassnectar were kick ass! The first part of the set was a little disappointing. 

Moby's set is very ""house"". Great set just not what I was expecting.

I spent the entire weekend trying to get into the Yuma Tent and never made it. If there is anyone you want to see get there really early. Seriously the lines were always a mess, especially for Jaime XX!

If you're staying ""walking distance"" from the festival bring really comfortable shoes. We were super close to the festival (probably less than 3/4 mile line of sight from the Ferris wheel at Indian Palms County Club) and the way they route you makes for a little more than a 2 mile walk. So yeah not so bad coming in but we were walking for a solid hour and then some every night to get home. Of course if you have VIP tickets you can ignore this your walk was pretty direct.

I hear I missed by not seeing Birdy Nam Nam.

The Spanish Paella was surprisingly good. The Fried chicken in the food court next to the pizza place (can't remember the name but it was Asian style) was killer!

If you like electronic stuff make sure to walk (or better yet dance) through the DoLab any chance you get. It was always worth the extra steps.

If you're taking a taxi or getting dropped off, you basically walk a mile or so through the campsite. They allow beer in the camping area so they don't take it from you at the first checkpoint. So yeah, bring some nice cold refreshments and a coozie for the walk into the festival to get your buzz going early.

Beer is $7 for what appears to be 12oz, $9 for what appears to be 16oz. Liquor is $11 for a measured shot and that includes a mixer but red bull costs $3 extra.

Sidewalk's End is a great perch for the outdoor stage if both that and the main stage are not going at once.

Bring a bandanna for the dust. You may not need it but you'll wish you had it if the winds pick up. Also Coachella's merch tent was blessed with a windy/chilly night where thousands (including myself) went to throw $50 towards an ugly/oversized sweatshirt. That's all that was left by the time I got there.

Oh, and if you plan on proposing to your lady while at Coachella, the top of the Ferris wheel worked out pretty well.

It's like a compass, but instead of pointing north it points directly to your destination, showing you its distance and direction.  

We designed Falcon with Coachella in mind: use it to get to stages, tents, charging stations, bathrooms, camp grounds, parking, food, and more. Those places and more are pre-loaded into the app, so just download it and you'll be good to go at the festival! 

We just released it on the app store, and since Coachella is right around the corner we wanted you guys to be among the first people to try it out.  We appreciate any and all feedback!

For more info and to download it, [check it out on the app store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon/id506151543?mt=8).

Hope you like it!

1356543516.0,31,self.Coachella,15h44n,Notes on the SS Coachella,33,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/15h44n/notes_on_the_ss_coachella/,"Thought I'd start a thread on the boat to get some commentary from the other folks who were present.  My notes:

* The boat is very much Indio on the high seas, complete with a too-perfectly-green grass lawn and a white tent.  In the second GV panel, Paul T noted that they weren't sure they wanted to do the cruise until they found this ship, and he is right that it really did infer the same sense of wonderment present every April in the desert.

* Having been on both cruises, the first cruise was vastly underpopulated compared to the second.  I was told they did some radio giveaways for the second leg in Miami to get people on the boat and it showed -- a bunch of grandma-and-great-grandma families showed up.  Also, I was told a full 30% of the paid bookings on the second leg were Mexican nationals.  Weird.

* The crowd was mostly behaved.  On the first leg, a brazilian man was confined to his room and then kicked off the boat in Nassau for climbing off his balcony into another persons room.  On the second leg, cops came out onto the high seas to evict a passenger who had been observed dropping his bag of weed on deck.

* The food is ample, available, and mostly fine.  Your two no-fee choices consist of banquet food (the dining room at dinner time) or cafeteria food (the 24-hour oceanview cafe.)  There are some pretty good restaurants on board -- Tuscan Grille, QSine, and Lawn Club were all delicious, but a 40$ cover charge to get in is way too pricey for the quality of the food.  I did not pay to go on the cruise so I didn't mind paying to eat, but if I had paid I would be pretty pissed at being charged even more.

* Shore excursion pricing in Bahamas was a rip-off (125$ for a day trip to the Atlantis resort?) but very reasonable in Jamaica (110$ for an all-day river tubing and falls-climbing extravaganza complete with boat ride and lunch.)

* The 325 of us who did both cruises (GV employees, friends of GV, bands, band crew, and some regular passengers who took the last-minute offer to pay 250$ to stay for the next cruise) ended up having to wait two hours on the dock in Fort Lauderdale for all of the passengers too drunk to get out of bed to be evicted from the ship.  I sat next to Father John Misty's guitarist.  We booed them as they fled.

* Grimes did not know how to play bingo on the first leg.  I did manage to win a boombox from her on the second leg, and her shows on the second leg were pretty bad -- the competing theories for this were withdrawl or seasickness.

* The shows in the main theater were never full enough.  I think that's because the boats are purposefully designed to have so much space for so few people that even when fully loaded nobody is in the same place at the same time.  It did give the Pulp, Hot Chip, and Girl Talk shows on both legs a very intimate feeling though.

* The idea of being on a boat with the artists for the duration of your trip and running into them and congratulating them on their sets really inferred a great sense of togetherness.  At his last set, FJM said what those of us who had been on the boat were feeling perfectly: ""I was born on this boat 31 years ago.  Grimes and James Murphy were my parents.  They bathed me in Purell (ubiquitous throughout the ship).  I got my first job at Quasar (nightclub on the ship) at age 15.  Which was strange because of the ever-present army of subservients ready to placate my every desire no matter how trivial.""

* Very few people paid to be on this ship.  I think though that if they do this next year (I did hear whisperings about that beyond what was said at the GV panel), very few people will be on the ship for free.  Coachella did not sell out the first four or so years and I'm sure after seeing all the pictures they won't have trouble selling out next year.  I don't expect to get the chance to go again.

It inspired me to try and get in good shape before Coachella. Every year I end up flaking out. Since February is the shortest month of the year and a 29 day commitment sounds slightly more appealing than a 30-31 day commitment, I decided to go for it starting today.

I will be doing a simple calorie monitoring routine, coupled with running 3 times a week and some rock climbing thrown in where I can. Even when I was active in sports, running has always been my weakest activity. I'm going to start transitioning to a raw diet this week, supplemented by protein powder. I will also be doing mini-fasts leading into my run days (no eating after 6-7pm the night before, nothing but water until noon the next day.

Is anyone else doing anything similar, or does anyone have a good routine to share? Just looking for some motivation and solidarity to stick to this haha. I live close enough to both a Phil's BBQ and an In N Out that I can smell them from my apartment when the breeze shifts.

IF they do charge you more, then they have to reimburse you THREE TIMES the amount they overcharged you. (CA Civil Code 1863 if you want to look it up.)

Last year my friends and I booked a room online for about $300 a night. When we got there I noticed that the sign on the door said that the maximum nightly rate for the room was only $154 dollars. (Dollars values in this story are approximate, I really can't remember.) When we went to check out, I explained to the receptionist that we were charged more than the maximum nightly rate, and that according to CA Civil code the hotel was required to reimburse us three times the amount. I was very polite and specific! The receptionist tried to hush me so the other guests waiting in line would not hear. I don't like being hushed, so I turned around and started explaining it to the other guests. Later that week I received a phone call from the general manager and he agreed to send me a check.

Most importantly. Understand how to stake down your stuff. Basically you want something with an angle back towards your shade.

Here's my shitty diagram if it helps at all http://i.imgur.com/90qJviZ.png

I found a wristband on Craigslist and we agreed on $200. They seem like awesome people. Throughout the conversations I talk to a few different people from their party (phones dying, bad service, etc) 


when I finally get to Indio, one of the guys calls me and says it would be really cool if I bring a canopy. Feeling like helping the guy out, I pass up seeing alt-j and go to Walmart to get a canopy. Find one for $100, pop it in the car and go.

on friday night, I give them the canopy to use at their campsite on 155th (I'm on 138th - 2 lots away). In conversations, I confirm that they only want to borrow it an return it, instead of reimbursing the $100 + tax that I paid.

On Sunday morning, I actually go hang out with them and stuff. They're really nice and generous.

On Sunday night, I text one of the guys about the canopy - no response. No problem I'll get them in the morning.

Around 6-7 am Monday morning, I try them a couple more times as I'm packing my stuff and getting ready to leave. No response. Confused, I go over to their campsite at around 9-10. They bounced.

They still won't answer their phones or text. I'm not sure what to do. I'm really bummed not only because I lost $100, but because they legitimately seemed like honest folk...

Now, I have their phone numbers, and one of their names. I do know exactly where they were camping, but that's about it. How should I approach this?

1364315884.0,21,self.Coachella,1b1s9w,Be A Good Neighbor At Coachella,38,17,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1b1s9w/be_a_good_neighbor_at_coachella/,"Ho there, Coachuggalos! In advance of next month's glorious pilgrimage to Indio (it will be my ninth), I thought I would issue a proclamation of some kindly reminders. Share these with your fellow fest goers! Take them to heart! 

#1 - BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR (all other reminders are some version of this)

#2 - SHOWER EVERY MORNING - This is not about YOUR comfort, it is about the comfort of everyone else who will be around you. It's not whether or not YOU care that you smell, it's that everyone else cares that you smell. Do your part for collective hygiene and sanitation.

#3 - SMOKE POLITELY - Seriously. Blow your smoke directionally directly upward, especially if you are in a tent and in close-quarters next to other people. Be aware of where your smoke may be drifting. And don't go dancing with your cigarette in hand, floating through the air, because there are eyeballs nearby.

#4 - DON'T OVER-CROWD - If you want to be up-close for your favorite band, you owe it to everyone else to get there a set or two early and make your way up when there are large crowd exits. The people in front of you are in front of you because... wait for it... they got there first! 

Don't be a greedy pig and spoil the show for someone else, someone who took time out of their day to get a good spot in advance.

#5 - DON'T GET SUPER-CLOSE UNLESS YOU WANNA DANCE - Save the closest standing spots for the people who want to romp around. (Obviously, this doesn't apply for a whispy-quiet indie folk act.)

#6 - OBEY NOISE CURFEWS - Be a good camper, and turn off your eurotrash whatever-wave noise pollution at 1:30a. (But better yet... turn it off before you have to, maybe at 12:30a, when your neighbors might be getting back from the headliner and want to sleep.) There is a Silent Dance Party, where you wear your headphones and can burn-off your high, every night in the campgrounds from 1:30am - 3:30am.

#7 - LEAVE THE TOILETS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITION - Don't poo on the seat, please pee in the side-urinal, and wipe-off any mess you leave. Treat that toilet like your mother is the next one to use it.

#8 - DON'T LINE-JUMP IN ANY LINE - There is plenty of time for everyone to get into the fest and to get their food. Plan ahead. The people ahead of you planned ahead, so respect that, and wait your turn. 

#9 - DON'T THROW TRASH INTO CROWDS - What were you, born in a barn? I see this all the time. It's a total dick move.

#10 - DON'T LEAR AT THE WOMENFOLK! - They are not dressed that way for you. Coachella is not a Male Gaze Free-For All. Don't be a creep.

#11 - KEEP AN EYE OUT - If you see someone who looks in a bad way, either near overdose or dehydration... if you see someone about to get violent... if you see someone pick-pocketing backbacks... help. Share some water or call security. Be A Good Neighbor.

Just remember... IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. There are tens of thousands of people who also want to enjoy Coachella. It's not about how YOU want to live and how YOU want to behave and when YOU get what you want. We're all getting sunstroke together, people.

It's About Your Neighbors. The fest is great because of tens of thousands of people sharing art and music harmoniously. Don't be the discordant mouthbreather who spoils it for others.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,False,,,True,t3_1b1s9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1b1s9w/be_a_good_neighbor_at_coachella/,

1326482061.0,25,self.Coachella,ofsbj,UNIQUE Coachella Advice,34,9,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/ofsbj/unique_coachella_advice/,"I've been attending Coachella since 04 and I have some tips for newcomers that I don't believe have been brought up in other tip threads. These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche, but sometimes it's necessary....

1. When entering the parking lot, disregard where the parking monkeys tell you to go and park as close to the LOT entrance as possible. You will be thanking yourself when you don't have to wait 3 hours to get out of the lot at the end of the night.

2. Starting last year, the main stage got a new configuration.  Previously, the best place to stand was on the left side, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it.  The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left.  When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

3. Arrive early every day, even if there aren’t bands you want to see til the evening. If you arrive anytime after noon, expect a long wait to get into the parking lots.

4. If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, chips, etc) stock up as much as possible, especially if you have a backpack with you. Last year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

5. I know this will be controversial, but don’t camp if you value sleep and want to be able to re-energize in between days.

6. For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio, go to Don Jose’s Taco Shop. I swear this place’s carne asada burrito beats most places I’ve been to in San Diego and LA.

7. Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection, one of the biggest I've seen.

8. Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.

9. If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and grass, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

10. If you have a short attention span, band conflicts shouldn't be much of a issue for you. There's nothing wrong with seeing half-sets which allow you to pretty much see anyone you want. Think of Coachella as a sampler concert. If you want to see a full-set, go see them when they come to your town.

11. If you're going to drink, get your wristband EARLY, or you will wait in long lines.

12. SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Neon Indian.

13. I know I'll get flamed for this, but the Sahara Tent is a hassle. Stay away from it unless there is a DJ you REALLY want to see. It gets very crowded and sweaty and dancing becomes a chore and not enjoyable unless you're on drugs. It's also the furthest tent away from the main stage, so you will be doing lots of walking if you plan on frequenting the Sahara often.

14. Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap. If you want to play it really safe and make sure you don't feel ripped off, just get pizza slices. It's really hard to mess that up and it's pretty consistent.

15.  If at all possible, bike to the venue from wherever you are staying.  You can chain the bike to a fence near the entrance and you won't have to wait 2 hours to leave the parking lot.

16.  Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands.  For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear.  I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

17. Finally, and this will make me sound like a TOTAL tool, but if you're willing to do this, bring in a small footstool in your backpack that will make you SLIGHTLY taller when watching bands.  Last year, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,True,,,True,t3_ofsbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/ofsbj/unique_coachella_advice/,

The bands, the vibe, and the overall atmosphere were unparalleled by any other festival / concert I've been to. My main complaint, though, was that for a 30-something dude, I couldn't help but feel like I stood out like a sore thumb. My two friends who I went with are also 30+, and we camped the first 2 nights and received the cold shoulder from our neighbors, I think due to our age. So I guess my question is, how can a 30+ dude have a better time in a sea of 18-25 year olds? I am not a creep, I'm just there because I love the music and the atmosphere. I'm debating not going this year because I feel like I'm ""too old."" What do you think, Reddit? Is there room for 30-somethings at Coachella or should we just stay home and work on our needlepoint and talk about how awesome the 90's were?

Any advice that will help people have a better weekend is fair game.

I thought of a few for now, but I'll keep editing this post to build the list up. I'll add any tips in the comments to this post.



**Camping**

* Buy what you think will be enough cases of water bottles, and then buy two more.

* Get something that you can see from a distance to identify your campground. Flags are cool for this. This will help you avoid extra misery when you drag whats left of yourself back to camp every night (or morning).

* Glass bottles and hard liquor will get thrown out. Water bottles = storage.

* Budget extra money for buying ice. (Unless you enjoy your beer as hot as your tea)

* Bring something to provide shade.

* It will be pushing 100 degrees by 8am every day. The nights are a gamble. They can either be freezing or warm.

* Bring a power strip with you. When you're running around trying to find an outlet to charge your phone, you will be everyone's hero and you won't have to wait in line.

* Bring variation in food. (tothebatcave)

* Smokers. Bring extra Cigs as you will run out sooner than you think and a pack at the GS is about 10 bucks. Though there are shuttles to the market throughout the day. (tothebatcave)

* Baby wipes. (tothebatcave)

* Dry Ice instead, bags of ice at the general store are pricey and a few pieces will keep your food and beer cold throughout the weekend. (tothebatcave)



**Coachella**

* If you want to be up front in the Sahara, go around the back and enter through the right side.

* Find the free shit. There was a tent handing out free packs of 5 gum last year.

* If you want to be up front for a certain performer, you're going to need to be there at least 1 performance in advance.

* Go to the Do Lab. Doesn't matter who's playing. Just go.

* If you're 21+, grab a bite to eat in the beer gardens. The lines are shorter.

* Talk to strangers.

* Leave space open in your schedule to explore artists and the other attractions.

* Take breaks or you will be exhausted by the time the headliner comes on.

* Do yourself a favor and get a frozen lemonade. (tothebatcave)

* There is a ""secret"" indoor bathroom by the left side of Sahara that never has lines. (kenmixtape)

* Non-Californians, eat our Mexican food. (willworkforpants)

I arrived at 8:30 on Thursday morning and was 5 rows from the entrance (aka. Super effin close).  The shitty part was waiting 30 minutes for the gate to open.  20 minutes for them to figure their shit out and then we waited for our friends which lasted another 45 minutes getting us finally there by approximately 10:00 and our spot was perfection.  I would advise against trying to be first in line because you have two probable scenarios 
1) you will find yourself being a main pathway for lazy assholes that want to cut through tents to get to their site
2) you will find yourself right next to a main path which will most likely contain portapoties and heavy foot traffic.  

If you really want to ensure a good spot, I would highly reccomend getting there around 10 on Thursday. After security go to the waiting area and send a passenger as a scout to see where they are currently lining cars up and have him call you on when is a good time to get back in line to ensure you aren't too close to a main artery and the portapoties.  Added bonus you can time yourself between a group of cars you wouldnt mind being neighbors with instead of the 4 12"" subwoofer thumping lifted F-450. 

Car Entrance Security:
Basically the procedure is as follows...   They will ask you to take everything out of your car and make you pop your hood. They will search consoles, gloveboxes, door compartments, etc.  they will then do a quick search through all of your bags as good as the security person you get wants to be (either very through or absolutely laxidasical)   

Basically don't be an idiot and you should be okay (ie. don't hotbox your car while waiting in line).  If you can keep it in your pants and not smoke on the drive you are ensuring a greater probability for ease of passage. 

- don't bring in handles of alcohol. Put it in water bottles.  They won't check if they are sealed. 
- they will make you throw knives away (even food prepping knives and camping leathermans) so either hide them well or don't bring them in
- minimal amount of effort is needed to hide anything. Any kind of creativity and you will be fine.  Just use the nooks and crannies of your car, not your suitcase.  They will check your suitcases and all bags.  
- they will make you pop your hood so that is not a good spot.  

If you need crafty ideas pm me and I'll tell you what to do for success.  


Godspeed and happy coachella!!!!

""This year there will be a new tent at Coachella called Yuma. It is basically to address the lost art of the DJ which has been eclipsed by this overblown EDM shows. They are trying to present DJs in more of a pure form. So it is going to have a wooden dance floor and be air-conditioned. It’s going to get away from the big LED screens and present DJs closer to the audience. You will be able to see mixing. It will feel more like a nightclub.""

A while back Jason Bentley from KCRW was quoted as saying there will be a new disco themed tent with hard wood floors and air conditioning. The name of that stage, as he confirmed on his Saturday night radio show, is called the Yuma Stage. Should be groovy.

That means bring plastic pieces or papers for your smoking needs. We had a plastic bong and they let us keep it.

* New Town &amp; Countries have middle-seat stash spots that are copious and never checked. 

* Also, being nice to security is the best way to do it. We kept our AC on blast and offered dudes water and chocolates. Didn't even check our trunk.

* You can take camelbacks in full of water through the festival gates. When they you must empty it, agree to it and walk towards the trash can, wait for them to start searching the next person, and walk on through the gates. Worked every time for me. Including my canteen.

* The smoothie guys will give you ice for free for inside the festival gates, i usually gave the guy a dollar every other time or something.

* Ziplock bag all your shit. Dust sucks.

* You can easily sneak drugs in inside your wallet. Mine was never checked. Same with phones.

* The best toilets are the ones between stage 1 &amp; 2.

This will be my second time attending Coachella. The first time around i felt like it was sensory overload, too much good stuff at once. Thinking about it now, I would have love to have met more people and made more friends. I am having the idea of meeting up with other redditors who might be wanting to share a laugh, beer, or even a toke lol. 

I don't want to try to organize anything concrete since I'm not really expecting much and I'll probably will be wallowing in the mind for most of my time there. I figure we could create like a groupme group so we can mass text redditors who want to meet up at a certain place or the like. I'm just brainstorming here, nothing may come of it but I figure I'd try. Ideas welcome.

edit: looks like the mods are creating an official meet up(yay!), but i still created a groupme group, I'm hoping we can use it to communicate for spontaneous meets,ill have downtime anytime after the venue closes at night in camping and ill try to use this to see who is up at the time.

Edit 2: It seems groupme wont let you add yourself to the group, a member already in it has too, so i guess if you want to join, msg me your email address(you can change this to your phone # later on to receive sms msgs) and ill add you. hopefully this isn't a big hassle and can get a decent group to find other redditors! :)",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,True,,,True,t3_gf43a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/gf43a/redditors_at_coachella/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/scjl9/coachella_hits_and_misses/c4d1uv6

Both of these people were downvoted because they didn't like Radiohead's show. What is wrong with not liking something? They didn't say ""Radiohead is for hipster fags"", but rather stated that they have/had no desire to see Radiohead. A show is extremely subjective and downvoting someone because they are ""wrong"" for choosing Kaskade over Radiohead is just rude.

Disclaimer: I saw Kaskade over Radiohead. I don't regret it.

EDIT: 

Apparently people disagree with my comment:

No, they don't. The point is that people should be able to share their opinions without being told they are wrong.

EDIT: can someone please explain what is wrong with this?

1332869545.0,17,self.Coachella,rg455,Unique Coachella Advice (Repost),26,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/rg455/unique_coachella_advice_repost/,"This is a re-post, but I feel it will be help a lot of first-timers who may not have seen this the first time I posted it:

I've been attending Coachella since 04 and I have some tips for newcomers that I don't believe have been brought up in other tip threads. These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche, but sometimes it's necessary....

-When entering the parking lot, disregard where the parking monkeys tell you to go and park as close to the LOT entrance as possible. You will be thanking yourself when you don't have to wait 3 hours to get out of the lot at the end of the night. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike to the fest and lock it up on the fence near the entrance. This saves tons of time getting in and out and is not too excruciating of a workout depending on how far your hotel is from the polo fields.

-Starting last year, the main stage got a new configuration. Previously, the best place to stand was on the left side, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it. The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left. When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

-Arrive early every day, even if there aren’t bands you want to see til the evening. If you arrive anytime after noon, expect a long wait to get into the parking lots.

-If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, chips, etc) stock up as much as possible, especially if you have a backpack with you. Last year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

-I know this will be controversial, but don’t camp if you value sleep and want to be able to re-energize in between days. I guess what I'm saying is, if you're like me and you mainly come for the music and not so much the social experience, avoid camping.

-For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio, go to Don Jose’s Taco Shop. I swear this place’s carne asada burrito beats most places I’ve been to in San Diego and LA.

-Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection, one of the biggest I've seen.

-Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.

-If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, dust, pollen and grass, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

-If you have a short attention span, band conflicts shouldn't be much of a issue for you. There's nothing wrong with seeing half-sets which allow you to pretty much see anyone you want. Think of Coachella as a sampler concert. If you want to see a full-set, go see them when they come to your town.

-If you're going to drink, get your wristband EARLY, or you will wait in long lines.

-SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Neon Indian.

-I know I'll get flamed for this, but the Sahara Tent is a hassle. Stay away from it unless there is a DJ you REALLY want to see. It gets very crowded and sweaty and dancing becomes a chore and not enjoyable unless you're on drugs. It's also the furthest tent away from the main stage, so you will be doing lots of walking if you plan on frequenting the Sahara often.

-Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap. If you want to play it really safe and make sure you don't feel ripped off, just get pizza slices. It's really hard to mess that up and it's pretty consistent.

-Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands. For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear. I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

-This will make me sound like a TOTAL tool, but if you're willing to do this, bring in a small footstool in your backpack that will make you SLIGHTLY taller when watching bands. Last year, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.

-WATCH OUT FOR COPS ALONG HWY 111 AFTER THE SHOW!  Last year I got a $300 ticket for talking on my cell phone while driving.  And so you don't give them a hassle, the cops lie to you and tell you that ""in Riverside County, a cell phone ticket is only $40"" only to be surprised by the monetary rape you find in the mail a few weeks later.  He was also going to write me up for not using my turn signal but I was able to plead that he just write me up for the cell phone so that it doesn't go on my record.

-Finally, for Indio's hottest club, try ""BLLAHAHHAHHGHHAHHGHHH""....they've got everything....midgets, circus dogs, 90-year old jizz moppers and a fat guy in the corner named Jimbob who will draw a caricature of you that looks nothing like you.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,True,,,True,t3_rg455,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/rg455/unique_coachella_advice_repost/,

I used to live in Texas so I know how to dress for the heat, but duh I also want to look cute. Also heels are so out, I'm pretty sure nobody gives a shit and I don't want to break my neck as I drink my way through the festival. So I was thinking things that are low maintenaince i.e. wrinkling not a problem. Things I've thought of:

* Sundresses
* Shorts
* Tanks
* Halter tops
* Sandals for dayzzzz
* Hats?

Then I know the temperature change ain't nothing to fuck with so what do you bring in with you so you don't freeze but also something that's not too bulky? I hate lugging stuff around.

Any other fashion staples you bring? Gimme yo stylin tips.

We don't really know anything about it though, other than that we really loved the line-up! We've been to big festivals like Roskilde in Denmark, but we have no idea what to expect in California :)

We're wondering about some stuff, like

* Where should we stay? We thought camping was included, but it looks like you have to pay extra for it. Are there any options we should know about?
 We really want to meet lots of cool people ! :)

* How many people are attending (we have no idea if it's 10k or 100k!), and is it far away from a town? 

* What's the mood like there?

* Are everyone smoking weed on the camp site or is there some kind of strict policy on that? 

* Any pro tips from experienced Coachella-goers?

Also, if anyone wanna meet up with us that would be awesome!

I have a pretty small camelbak/backpak combo that I brought into the festival everyday. Since I came in via the shuttles (additional bag search), I guess you could say I made it through 6 checkpoints with it. I just zipped the bladder and hose inside the pocket that rests against your back, which is pretty inconspicuous. At the checkpoint, I happily unzipped all the pockets except for this one, and nobody seemed to notice. Personally I don't know how successful I would have been if it had been full, but I've read that people have been successful with this in the past. If you were planning on filling it with water, just wait til you're inside, it's really no hassle filling it up.

As for the water stations, I was expecting no water pressure and massive waits, since that is usually the norm at festivals. Much to my surprise, the water pressure is great and I waited between zero and 15 seconds each day. I think the key is selecting the correct water station. This won't mean much to first timers until you get there, but the best water station IMO is where the two long rows of food stands meet in the Terrace. There just wasn't anyone there, even in the middle of the day. I would walk from there towards the Mojave tent, and at the edge of the terrace there is another water station that was always mobbed with people. I made a habit of informing some of them that a 30 second walk would take them to another station and save them 10 minutes of waiting, but I'm not sure if they believed me.

I think if you can get over the fact that it's on your back all day, a water bladder is a terrific way to stay hydrated. You drink more water just because it's there, and because of that you're going to feel a lot better. You can share it with your friends too. Week 1 wasn't really hot this year, but last year at Bonnaroo all my friends who didn't drink water felt terrible in the heat but I was able to tolerate it much better with 100 fluid ounces on my back. Not to mention, it's pretty great not having to hold a water bottle. As for the taste of polyurethane in the water, it's tolerable as long as you change the water out every 4 hrs or so.

Best of luck to everybody! You're going to have yourself an amazing weekend!",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,False,,,True,t3_sgymn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/sgymn/my_week_1_experience_with_a_camelbak_and_water/,

 I have done the work for you for @coachellaupdate, a script that watches the changes made to the lineup page, and tweets them as they happen. You could follow @coachellaupdate if you really want to, but for the non twitter users like myself, simply plug in the following rss feed into your favorite aggregator: http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/19951442.rss

For any weekend 2ers I highly recommend doing the following: watch opening of Wolfgang gartner, then run over and catch ALL of purity ring.  Then go back to Sahara and watching Bassnectar. I was completely sober for him and he just tore my insides apart   

SATURDAY (spoilers - can't figure out how to do a spoiler tag from alien blu)
PHOENIX WAS UNBELIEVABLE.  I was a little confused on why these guys were headlining when I first saw the lineup, but now I completely understand. Those guys know how out on a fucking show, and they sounded amazing live.  For those wondering - NO Daft Punk was not there and will not be there.  I was pretty disappointed when I heard people complaining about Phoenix because daft punk didn't show up. These guys apparently have been wanting to headline coachella for a while and they did an amazing fucking job.  They do have a special guest (I won't say who) but you will never in a million years guess and you will never in two millions years think these two will work but trust me, it does. Phoenix was definitely my favorite headliner


SUNDAY (minor spoilers)
As expected RHCP fucking killed it. For anyone expecting something crazy like the Tupac hologram, don't just sit back and enjoy the amazingness that is RHCP. These guys have been doing this for a while so they definitely know how to entertain a crowd. I was a little worried that would play a majority of new stuff (which I'm less of a fan of) but they played all of the classics. 

My favorite acts (in no order )
- Phoenix
- Of monsters and men 
- pretty lights

Other notable artists
- purity ring 
- vampire weekend
- WU tang
- Adrian lux
- I heard amazing things about Alt-J
- heard amazing things about Hardwell
- Moby

Please feel free discuss. I know I wrote a ton lol, but I had to to get it out.

2. You can charge your cell phone at numerous different tents inside the festival. Please do not run your car for hours a day in order to charge your phone using the car charger. My neighbors last year did this and pumped a bunch of exhaust into our campsite all morning. Not cool. Then their battery went dead and they wanted us to give them a jumpstart, which we did because we are nice. But seriously. Don't run your battery dead like a moron.

-Phoenix

Caught their set in 2010 and it was phenomenal. They know how to entertain a crowd.

-Tame Impala

Their most recent album was one of my favorites from last year and I can't wait to see it live. Really hoping they extend out a lot of songs and change up some things. I love it when the live versions are noticeably different.

-Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Never was a big fan until recently. Always knew them for 'Zero' and 'maps', and wasn't too stoked. I've been listening to Fever To Tell for a bit now and it's fantastic. Super grungy, and a lot heavier than I would have thought after hearing their singles. I feel like their show will be super energetic.

-Sigur Ros

Really hoping for a night time outdoor set on this one. If you haven't listened to them yet, definitely check them out. 

-Beach House

Saw them back in October and they were great. Bloom and Teen Dream are some of my favorite albums and their live sets are just as good.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,False,,,True,t3_17thu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/17thu5/list_your_top_5_most_anticipated_acts/,

Like many other festival goers, I plan on sneaking some goodies into the festival. However, I also plan on getting there on Thursday, and my understanding is that they're pretty serious with security early in the day on Thursday and they get lazier as the day progresses. How thorough are they with their searches on Thursday morning? Can I expect the inconvenience of all my bags taken out and looked through? Will they search in *every* nook and crannie in my car?

What're the benefits of getting there early in the day? Benefits of getting there later in the day?

I'm in a group of about 5 cars, and we want to camp in adjacent spots. Is that manageable? Would it be better to arrive earlier in the day or later in the day if I want to do that?

I have one final question. A couple of my buddies are barely underage, but they'd kill to camp with us. How would one go about sneaking them into the campgrounds? How do they regulate that sort if thing?

A few of us (6 people, all around 25 yrs old) are planning on attending Coachella weekend 1 this year, flying down from Calgary. We are planning on renting a place for a week (arrive April 10, leave April 17) since we've heard it gets way too hot camping. Hopefully some veterans can help us answer a few questions:

1. Is weekend 1 typically better? Bigger demand?
2. How is the shuttle from Palm Springs? We are thinking of getting a place there because it will be a lot cheaper. Specifically, the place we are thinking is around Sunrise Marketplace Shopping Center on East Vista Chino and North Sunrise Way. Are there long lineups? How long does it take to get the festival from Palm Springs based on your past experience? Hopefully not as bad as the EDC Vegas shuttles...
3. What are some things to do around the Desert area besides the festival? We'll have a few days before and after. Thinking of some golf and checking out Joshua Tree Park so far.
4. Any other tips/suggestions for first timers?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: We've camped at Shambhala (festival in BC, Canada) the past 4 years and it's an unreal experience, so I understand where you're all coming from suggesting camping. That said, we are pretty set on renting a house because a) we'll be here for a few days before and after the festival and will need a place anyway, and b) it's a huge pain to bring all our camping gear down with us on the plane, and c) a couple of my friends are pussies and won't be able to handle it :P

Anyways, thanks for all the responses so far. I think we'll try to look for a place in Indio, Indian Wells, La Quinta or Palm Desert before settling on Palm Springs. We don't have our tickets yet either, but I'll make sure everyone is online at the time they go on sale so we that we can hopefully snag some. Not planning on booking the house until we have tickets (just in case we have to switch to weekend 2).",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,1357533935.0,,,True,t3_162l2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/162l2v/coachella_virgins_coming_from_canada_have_some/,

Dr. Dre and Snoop's most classic work came off of the album The Chronic.  If you know about the Chronic, it was basically a huge diss record to Eazy-E.  Some of their best songs (fuck wit dre day, bitches aint shit) were Eazy-E disses.  Seeing as how Eazy is dead, do you think they would still perform those songs?

First off, cell phone reception is GOD AWFUL. Don't be surprised if it takes 30 minutes to send a text message. Meeting up in the middle of the park can be incredibly difficult, and meeting at particular show is damn near impossible. 

SOLUTION ---- THE TOTEM!

What is a totem, you ask? A totem is a small, individualized item that one can hold up in the air so that others can see where you are. 

It's not quite as simple as you'd think though. There are several very important things you should keep in mind.

1. No flags or banners of any kind will be allowed into Coachella. This kinda sucks, cuz I think a bunch of flags look badass, but its never fun to be the person stuck behind the crazy old lady waving hers everywhere (happened to me at ACL. fuck that bitch). This brings up my second point.

2. Don't be a douche. Pick something that isn't going to block the people behind you. 

3. Be creative. I've seen all sorts of good stuff; a lightup penguin, flamingos, balloons, DOMO, etc... A good totem can serve as an additional attraction to festival goers if it's done right. 

4. Be original. Do something that is unique to you. I'll be throwing up my lightup Manu Ginobili bobblehead, complete with the bald spot and big nose, as it will be playoff time and I'll have to represent my Spurs!

5. Put lights on it, and make sure you're totem is totally visible in darkness, or it'll be useless at nightime. 

As soon as I make mine, I'll be posting pics, but I'd like to see what you guys can muster up.

**tl;dr** let's help each other figure out which sets they'll wanna catch based on categorization of music and/or relating bands to other more popular bands.

[Here's a link to a google spreadsheet I'm building upon reddit's input.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgjEE3ujyJI3dFdHX0otVWFDV0RNWlNDSlI2bDJNM0E)

*******************************

A fellow Coachella goer and I were having a discussion about how it'd be helpful to have the lineup pre-divided into categories to help people figure out which new bands they'll enjoy seeing.  I've thrown together a few huge playlists in spotify and have been trying to listen through them, but I feel bad throwing out bands after just a track or two.

To make the point of this a little more clear...

Let's say I knew nothing about Radiohead (**hypothetically**).  I throw together a playlist including a few tracks from each band at Coachella and I land on 3 songs off of King of Limbs.  This is definitely *not* representative of what Radiohead has to offer, and it's most likely not entirely what I'll be hearing at the festival.  You could imagine scenarios like this playing out to dissuade people from seeing performances they actually would want to see, **and** to persuade people into seeing artists they don't really want to see.

The best solution is for everyone to listen to every artist's entire discography and judge for themselves whether to show up to a set... but most of us are human and have jobs/school and whatnot.  So, reddit, it falls on us to help each other out.  Can we design a post/system for people to figure out what they'll enjoy?

Also, if we do this... let's not be unhelpful like this post at [swangfungus](http://www.swanfungus.com/2012/01/in-which-i-review-the-entire-coachella-2012-lineup-part-2.html)...

&gt; Black Lips – Stupid band for stupid people. VICE Recordings never puts out anything worthwhile. Except maybe DFA1979 but even they only had two good songs. Am I supposed to be impressed how they make out on stage with each other or pee in one another’s mouths? Write a good song. Then I’ll pay attention.

How is that supposed to help someone who's into garage rock and has never heard of the Black Lips?  Or, how's it suppose to help someone who's really into [urolagnia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolagnia) but doesn't like garage rock?
