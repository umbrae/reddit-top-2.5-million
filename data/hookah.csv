This place has a much friendlier vibe to it, and everyone was interested in getting newcomers started or talking about trivial things... and this sub was far FAR more diverse and creative. Hookah Bar scketches, Military members and their hauls their girlfriend got them, doodles they made, funny hookah bar signs, and yeah, memes (though, those I can personally live without).

It captured the social experience of smoking pretty well. 

Now, it's nothing more than ""guys I hate le starbuzz, tangeirs is so good"" or ""lel das no hookah das an ecigg phaggit"" and downvotes for every damn thread, regardless of content.  

For a while now, we've had this... vocal minority scaring off newcomers and imposing their opinions and preferences as fact, and anyone who smokes or thinks otherwise is just a scrub. 

Some people need to step down off their high horses and take a major chill pill. Not everything is an assault to you. Not everyone is an absolute imbecile. Not every hookah is a Chineese POS. 

Hell, the mods saw this shit earlier and made the downvote button ""doesn't contribute to discussion"". Yet an unpopular opinion is downvoted to all hell, for no other reason than he prefers a clay Egyptian bowl or on occasion a particular flavor of Starbuzz. 

Yes, phunnel bowls are better. Yeah, Starbuzz is not a very good brand. But you don't need to act like they're smoking coke laced meth or killed a puppy. 

The vocal minority of psuedo elite intelligencia need to take a back seat, and the social, kind, intelligent folks who seem to lurk a bit more need to speak up.

And maybe a bit more mod interaction. I know they're busy, but I don't think a post or two would hurt. In fact,  it would help. 


Something's gotta change. 

Because this sub is quickly becoming less and less fun to browse.

Its a self post, I don't get any karma for this. Just help spread the word.*

###[Here is the link to the survey.](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5SCKGGX)

It only has 10 simple multiple choice questions. Depending on the results of these questions I'll see if we are big enough to make it a whole subreddit wise event or to keep it simple and whatnot. I will use the number of people who filled out the survey to see how many people are actually interested in it. In my last [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/veavi/hey_rhookah_its_your_friendly_mod_jaxspider_with/) only 20 or so people replied. Out of 4000 if only 20 people want to do it, than Its not worth the effort in making it a subreddit wise program.

So please, fill it out so I can make an informed decision.

Thanks once again.

Jax

Earlier today, we had the [PSA Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/y92zs/psa_you_need_a_cam_to_chat_about_hookahs/) stating that people are yelled at an harassed for not having a webcam on TinyChat. Why? Whoever is doing it really needs to step off their high horse. That shit don't fly. It's immature and rude. 

I got a message earlier stating:
&gt;I thought I'd try to post to the hookah subreddit since I'm just getting into hookah, thought they were a nice community, guess not....

And that upsets me dearly. I want new people here. Yes, some of us are experienced, but instead of being an ass and making them feel unwelcomed, we need to help them and encourage them to ask questions and post relevant material here. We're here to help, give reviews and tips, etc. 

Personally, I'm tired of getting complaint messages left and right. I'm not even a mod. If you have an issue, bring it up with the mods. I'm here to help, but again, I'm not a mod. My account here has only been active for a month...

I'm not pointing out anyone and I won't name names, but it frustrates me that our newest members feel unworthy here. We are all here for the same purpose. Leave your personal issues behind, and talk about hookah. Please is all I ask.

I'm sure that the reality is I am just very very unlucky.

 Anyway, I have some recently fucked up spots in my carpet that I'll need to be repairing in the next couple of days. Would you guys be interested in a step by step picture or even video tutorial on how to fix burn spots in carpet?

Also, the best way to fix a carpet is by avoiding the burn. Please please please get a cheap rug or even two and put them in your smoking area!!

Edit: okay so there's definitely some interest!!!! I have wednesday off of work so I'll make a video and post it!
Until then I'll tell you guys about my fixed burns.
So, last apartment I was in was the worst. Some people down below mentioned taking tiny bits of carpet hairs from other places and hot glueing them down. This works for shallow burns. I had several that burnt to the carpet pad. So, I scored youtube and google for a fix. I kind of combined them into the method I used. First I found some carpet. I got really lucky and there was a extra overhang of carpet in the hotwater heater closet i could very easily cut off without anyone noticing. Basically i cut the burn out of the damaged carpet as well as a little buff room around the sides and used the new carpet to create the same shape. Then i popped it in the hole and a glued her down. It's a quick easy fix that looks great. However, you want to make sure the grain is running the same way or it will stick out. I'll go into this more in the video on wednesday.

Some of you mentioned linoleum there is no hope. I have renters insurance and I was suprisingly enough covered for the damages i had to my kitchen floor.

So the new place I'm in I got really lucky. We have a big old dump thing in our complex and i was walking by it and i saw carpet pad sticking out of it. I think to myself if there be carpet pad there must be carpet!!!!! I was correct. So, if you get burns and you live in an apartment find out where maintenance and contracters dump shit and check it regularly :D

Additionally if you have carpet with really dense short hair you're gonna have a bad time. The fluffier the carpet the better.",,False,self,t5_2qkma,1362961569.0,,,True,t3_19yw2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/19yw2t/i_burn_carpets_a_lot_and_ive_gotten_really_good/,

Everybody, behave and stop bickering. This is about inspiring more people to get into ~~fitness~~ [hookah]. I've never understood people who argue constantly about who is wrong and who is right in ~~fitness~~ [hookah], because the fact is, there are many ""right"" answers, especially for people just starting out.

Do you think ~~Sergio Oliva~~ [Eric from Tangiers] and ~~I~~ [Hookah John] did the same thing? No. In fact, you could walk into ~~Gold's~~ [a hookah bar] and watch the 5 best guys and see 5 completely different ~~routines~~ setups. And you know what? We didn't argue.

Do me a favor. Try to focus more on expanding the ~~fitness~~ [hookah] community as a whole than protecting your little corner of it.

[This post](http://redd.it/1i3tkj) from /u/Vopogon is spot on. There have been posts coming up like this every couple months now and it seems a lot of the community agrees with them.

If the majority of the community feels like this is not a friendly environment it means one of two things to me:

* Either, the community members are not participating enough to make it a better environment
* Or they are part of the problem.

We have banned a few people, one user was banned a couple hours before that post was made, but that is not how we will fix the problems. It is very easy for a banned user to create another account.

We fix the problems by having good discussion drown out the circle-jerks and the rude responses. We fix them by down-voting comments that don't contribute and reporting comments that violate the rules...

What I am getting at here and what I have been saying in different ways for a while now: 

**We become more active, have better quality, and get rid of the trolls by participating.**

I don't care if you smoked your first hookah yesterday, or if you've done it 80 years, you are welcome to and highly encouraged to throw in your two cents to any questions, or discussions. Do not let other members of the community deter you from participating, there are very very few absolutely wrong answers in hookah.

TLDR: Want a better community? Participate in it and treat each other the way you want to be treated and the few assholes will be buried by good discussion.",Meta,False,self,t5_2qkma,1373641506.0,meta,,True,t3_1i5lue,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1i5lue/an_edited_note_from_our_friend_arnold/,moderator

A few friends and I are starting our own hookah company. We have been long time smokers, and have noticed the diminishing quality of Egyptian hookahs once the companies become more popular.

We have developed a few prototypes, and are looking to gauge the interest in the marketplace for a quality American made hookah that would cost less than $150 retail.

As graduating college students, we are investing a lot of our personal time and money into this project and would love to hear your opinions and stories about your hookah purchasing experiences, satisfactions, and dissatisfaction.

We understand that this won't be an easy undertaking as the market is saturated with KM's, MYA's, and etc. But we purchase quite a few hookahs personally as collectors, while we love the handmade quality of many of our Hookahs, a lot of them have been going down hill very fast from bad welds, leaks, things suck in our stems, poor purge valves, and etc. We just don't understand why its so hard to make a quality Hookah at a great cost anymore.

Our current concept and the prototypes we have been working on are based on this: CNC precision machine top and bottom sections of the stem, beautiful wood for the main portion of the stem, with a copper down pipe. For us to make this economical, while providing a great value to our customers we would need to manufacture 1,000 stems for the initial run.

Our main questions follow: How often do you guys purchase hookahs, would you be interested in an American made hookah, and what are you looking for in terms of color schemes, quality, etc. We greatly appreciate your opinion on this! Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input! I have not replied to everyone, but have read through all of the comments. All of your feedback is helping fuel the fire to help us take this to the next step, and I will be sharing all of the suggestions with the design team tomorrow. The next update, I'll be sure to add pictures of our prototypes (maybe a video?), right now they're rough but our latest design is going on the machine by next week! I will personally keep you guys updated as we hit bigger milestones.

Until further notice from any of the other mods I am making a few immediate changes because, to be frank, I am really tired of the 2 vocal minorities here... I thought we would be capable of using those arrows that made reddit famous to dictate what was appropriate here. I guess that is no longer enough as at least two undefined groups have popped up here and it has created issues:

Group 1: Long time hookah smokers who seem to believe they have the answer for most everything, but have no interest in sharing those answers tactfully

Group 2: Casual, or new hookah smokers that have common questions, or use products that group 1 isn't fond of.

Group 2 asks a question which usually receives a handful of quality helpful answers and one or two threads that are rude, or troll-y. Most of the time the rude stuff gets down-voted (as it should), but some of group 2 seems to have a hard time realizing that we are on the internet and think the mods here should play nanny...

**So we will**

Hence forth (until another mod chimes in, or I am removed as a mod) the following rules will be active:

- Disagreeing is OK, but product bashing without polite explanation and/or name calling or put downs will result in comment removal
- Meme posts and to some degree meme comments will result in removal
- Any drug reference will result in comment/post removal
- Racist/sexist/discriminatory language will result in BAN
- Circlejerk garbage will result in comment/post removal (there is a sub for that)
- **if you have enough comments/posts removed in a short period of time you will be banned** Consider comment removal your warning.

We will add more as we see fit. I will not be policing every thread, but when I am around I will look for reports and do some browsing and remove at that time. This will not have immediate results. You will still see some things that might hurt your feelings, but in a couple of months people will decide to shape up or move on. 

Have fun &amp; be safe :)

Edit: For those of you that have egged-on, up-voted, participated in, got circlejerk-y, or passively allowed the trolling it is because of you that these rules are in place.

I'm currently a senior in college, studying electrical engineering, and I've decided to put my degree to work and design an electric hookah bowl. Basically, it will plug into the wall and use electrical power instead of coals to heat the shisha. I looked for similar products online, and I've only been able to find one other electric bowl, and it has been getting really terrible reviews across the board, so I'm gonna try to do better.

A few of the features I'm working on:

* Power to the bowl will be controlled by a temperature sensor, so it won't overheat the shisha.
* There will be a system to detect when someone is taking a pull so it will quickly reach the flash point of the shisha, and then it will quickly cool down again afterward.
* At this point, I will try to make everything as automatic as possible, but in the future I might also add a manual temperature control.

I'm still in the preliminary design stages, so I don't have any sort of prototype, but at the rate I've been working, this thing should be ready to use in a couple months. If anyone has any suggestions for it, I would greatly appreciate it.

Also, this is just a personal project for now, but a friend suggested that if it turns out well, I should make more of them and sell them. Would anyone be interested in buying something like this?",,False,self,t5_2qkma,False,,,True,t3_1axm2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1axm2m/designing_an_electric_bowl/,

I wanted to combine the intense flavor compounds of pipe tobacco with the smooth, non burning sensation of the hookah. 

I chose a mild pipe tobacco that was the ""go to"" for all my local smoking buddies called [Quail Run](http://www.mccranies.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_55&amp;products_id=244&amp;zenid=a5a5803d2615d5ac5fce94693e9dfac7), and a smoky more bold tobacco called [Afterhours](http://www.mccranies.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_55&amp;products_id=269&amp;zenid=a5a5803d2615d5ac5fce94693e9dfac7). 

The thing with every other guide I found out there called for boiling the tobacco. The problem with that is, all the flavors and blends will get diluted. So, I finally chose [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10IHdBWEG_zV6azn1LERHdp10VdJZcd3EAFH518R1iao/edit?hl=en_GB) how to guide.

I went through the whole thing, added a little more honey at the end to get the consistency down, and added a little liquid raspberry flavoring for sweetness. It will smell how it tastes, isn't necessarily true with liquid flavoring. Make sure you don't add too much flavoring because it will taste will be too overpowering. I let it sit in the back of my fridge for a week and decided to smoke it tonight. 

Finally the taste write up! 

The taste was everything the pipe had, with the smoothness of the hookah. The Afterhours was completely smokey and sweet, and the Quail Run was sweet through (just like the tobacco itself) and through with a hint of hickory at the end. The raspberry taste really put it off with the touch of sweetness, and the clouds were absolutely perfect. The buzz was way too much for some, but perfect for someone that doesn't chief every second.

1375831065.0,62,self.hookah,1juggr,Beginners guide to E-Cigs/E-Hookah,81,19,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1juggr/beginners_guide_to_ecigsehookah/,"I've noticed that not many people in /r/hookah know much about electronic cigarettes. I thought I'd write up a big thread comparing the two. I'd just like to start this off by saying if you're interested in using/buying ecigs you should definitely head over to /r/electronic_cigarette for more information. 

Here's what I hear being asked most: How does the vapor compare to hookah smoke in terms of flavor and quantity?

Well to start off, hookahs and ecigs are really quite similar as far as vapor/smoke production goes. In a hookah the coals heat up the shisha and vaporize it, turning it into smoke. In an ecig theres a heating mechanism that heats up a liquid with either PG or VG (propylene glycol or vegetable glycerine) to vaporize and create a vapor. 

Vapor production depends on your device. Right now I'm using a k100 mech mod, with an Aga-T2 RBA or an Evod clearomizer tank. Ive bored out an airhole in my RBA (rebuildable atomizer) for more airflow. Doubled my vapor production. I'm also using a very technical device. What about the kind of ecig the average new guy is going to buy? Well I always keep an Ego batter with a clearomizer as a backup device and thats pretty much universally the recommended ecig setup for new people. (at the end of this thread I'll give links to where you can get a good (and cheap) setup that performs well) An Ego with a clearomizer tank or cartomizer is going to put out medium to high amounts of vapor as compared to a hookah. Its pretty much a fixed amount every time (depending on how long you draw). So unlike hookah you're not going to get that one really good bowl with a really good coal that just produces massive clouds. I would say an Ego/clearo is going to give out enough vapor that even somebody who's been smoking hookah for years and knows how to get huge clouds is going to be completely satisfied. Most people use something like that for at least a year before they become unsatisfied with battery length/lack of customization and things like that. 

Well what about taste? Hookah produces a more earthy/tobacco flavor. If you get some lemon-lime shisha it still has that shisha taste. E-cigs are *straight* flavor. Some devices produce clearer flavors than others, but there's nothing but the flavor in the liquid. Some of the best flavors are tobacco flavors, especially flavors that are tobacco AND fruit mixes. Those are going to be more of what hookah is like, but keep in mind that even those are going to taste more like a tobacco pipe than a hookah. 

[edit] I'd like to add in here that ecig vapor has something that hookah smokers arent going to be familiar with. Throat hit. Good throat hit is something ecig users strive to achieve. You know that back of the throat feeling when you leave a coal in the same spot too long and it burns? Its essentially that, but instead of a burning feeling it feels good. For this reason, most people who try ecigs think its too harsh. Even if you smoke cigarettes, ecigs have a heavier hit and take getting used to. 0% nicotine juices dont have that, but I'll get into that later when I recommend devices. 

**Getting into E-Cigs/E-hookah** 

For the sake of explanation I'm going to assume that you, the reader, smoke hookah and *not* cigarettes. E-Cigs are a very good method for quitting or replacing cigarettes, but thats not what I'm using this section of the thread to teach you to do. If this has sparked your interest, feel free to start a thread in /r/electronic_cigarette and ask questions there. 

Here's my recommended setup for those interested in using ecigs as hookahs. Keep in mind that you should absolutely shop around. Usually vendors are not associated with manufacturers. You can get deals on equipment by simply finding a site with a lower price on the same model. I buy all my equipment from [VaporBeast](www.vaporbeast.com) but feel free to just google the device name and shop around. 

Newb/Low-Level:

[Ego Battery](http://www.vaporbeast.com/eGo-Battery-900-mAh-p/32-0061-001.htm) - Small, simple to use, no menus just hold a button to vape, inexpensive

[Evod](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Kanger_EVOD_eGO_Bottom_Coil_Clearomizer_p/krev.htm) - fits ego nicely, no wicking problems so you never get a dry hit (similar to a rough draw on a hookah) 

Medium Setup (I've used ecigs/ehookah before and I like it but I want something better than most) 

[iTaste MVP](http://www.vaporbeast.com/Innokin-iTaste-MVP-p/36-0090-000.htm) - Variable Voltage, super easy VV, no menus to navigate, sturdy and reliable, really good battery life, usb port can be used to charge phones/ipods

[Boge Cartomizers](http://www.vaporbeast.com/Boge-Cartomizer-Low-Resistance-2-0-ohm-Stainless-p/62-0123-054.htm), [Carto punch](http://www.vaporbeast.com/Knockout-Cartomizer-Punch-p/17-0048-003.htm), [Texas Tuff tank](http://www.vapedudes.com/Texas-Tuff-Tanks_c_44.html) - Cartomizers are what you've seen on those gas station ecigs. The thing that looks like a cigarette filter. Its just a heating element wrapped in a cotton like substance that holds juice. Poke a couple holes in the side, put something that holds liquid on the outside of the tank, and you wont have to fill/replace your cartomizer. 


**Juice**

So if you smoke hookah but dont ever smoke cigarettes, you're looking for a completely smooth hit. For this you want 0mg Nicotine juice. However, throat hit is (to me at least) the best part of vaping. If you end up trying ecigs, but have your roots in hookah, get most of your juice in 0nic and get at least one bottle of 6mg or whatever the lowest above 0 the site has. Just keep in mind throat hit can be harsh if you directly inhale the vapor the way you do with hookah. Hookah goes in this and comes out thick, but vapor goes in thick as well. I recommend mouth inhaling and then inhaling the vapor from your mouth. If that ^makes ^any ^^sense

Buy all your juice from www.mtbakervapor.com. Trust me. They have excellent customer support, low prices, and amazing juices. 

But what to buy? Well first off you might be tempted to buy a bunch of fruit flavors or sweet flavors. Imagine the only liquid you were allowed to drink for a month was kool-aid. It might be some [awesome kool-aid](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ecto-cooler-e-juice-baker-vapor/) but you're going to burn yourself out when want something like a soda or a coffee. My all time favorite flavor is the Mtn Dew flavor from MBV (just checked, cant find it on the site), but after a while I have to throw in something tobacco-y or I get burnt out. 

Grab some fruit flavors in your favorite fruit, I recommend at least one beverage flavors because those translate into vapor flavor really well, but I insist you try a tobacco flavor. When I first started e-cigs I strayed away from tobacco flavors because I didnt like the taste of cigarettes, but vaping mint flavors was like chewing gum. Just flavor, no gross tobacco. Thats NOT what tobacco flavors in ecigs are like. A cheap tobacco flavor I tried changed the way I vape forever and got me hooked. I didnt realize it would be so delicious. Its hard to describe until you've tried it, but its almost like coke as compared to orange soda. [555](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/555-e-juice-baker-vapor/), [RY4](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ry4-e-juice-baker-vapor/), or standard [Tobacco](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/american-tobacco-e-juice-baker-vapor/) are all amazing flavors.

www.vapedudes.com is another great site, while they are a little pricey they will send you one free sample, so make sure to try something from them. 

**Feel free to ask me any questions, I spend a lot of time on reddit and will get back to you pretty quick. Also watch the video I posted below as it does a way better job of explaining almost exactly what I'm explaining**

If you're even the slightest bit interested, check out [Grimm Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOlR3INHzU) on youtube. As far as videos that arent complicated, he's absolutely the best there is. Its also really fun to watch him talk about all the crazy mods he buys and makes videos on.

Here's some tips.,76,18,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1c0gyr/burning_taste_ruining_your_hookahshisha/,"I often hear hookah smokers complaining that their shisha start to 'burn' too quickly and it ruins the taste/experience

For that I recommend 4 things: (some of this might be obvious for most of you, I'm just trying to help those who need the info)

1) By far the most important advice: Do NOT pack the bowl too tight, make sure your 'sprinkle' the shisha into the bowl, it needs to breathe, leave it fluffy and free.

2) Do not fill the bowl all the way to the top. Leave a thin layer so the foil (or the Lotus) does NOT come in direct contact with your shisha flavor. It can touch a bit, but not much. If foil (or lotus) sits directly on the shisha you will get the burning taste.

3) Don't KILL the hookah. Sometimes when I see a group of guys smoking a hookah, their goal is to get biggest cloud output over and over non stop... if there is 4-5 of you guys, and you keep taking huge hits back to back, the shisha bowl will get WAY too hot (especially with 3 coals) and it will start to burn.

4) Blow into the hose every few minutes, not too hard or the water will rise, but just enough to empty the smoke and to cool the bowl a bit.

I'm sure there are other things that I'm forgetting, but those 3 points should make the biggest difference.

1330024577.0,58,self.hookah,q2von,Community PSA - Do not use cans (aluminum or tin) as a windscreen or cover for your coals. ,64,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/q2von/community_psa_do_not_use_cans_aluminum_or_tin_as/,"[Discussion BearsAreDangerous and I had about this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/q0pjg/thinking_of_using_this_triple_size_rockstar_to/c3ttwl0)

I highly suggest not doing this. Soda pop and Tin cans are lined with a spray on plastic called BPA. This plastic will leach and is toxic when heat is applied. On energy drinks like Rockstar, Monster, etc etc this lining is extremely thick because energy drinks are extremely acidic and have been known to eat wood and metal of semi-trailers so the cans need even more layers of protection. If you look into these cans, especially Rockstar, you will notice a bronze or gold tinge to the can's insides, this is the spray on BPA plastic lining. 

Source about BPA: http://www.saferstates.com/2009/03/bpa-in-soda-cans.html

BPA wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A

So please for all that is holy, do not manufacture or make any kind of windscreen or cover out any kind of can that is meant to store something. You have no idea what is used to line the can and in serious cases you can die from the toxicity due to the leaching from heat. 

If you can not afford a typical windscreen simply use tin foil. [Something simple like this works wonders](http://i.imgur.com/al1c8h.jpg). I use 5 layers of tin foil and poke 5 holes in the top with a pencil for airflow. Feel free to experiment and fine tune to your liking. 

**I mean no ill will towards anyone about this, but I feel this knowledge should be spread. So please please please share this when the topic comes up and upvote this post (I get no karma) so it can be seen by everyone.**

Smoking Hookah Tobacco itself isn't healthy and we don't want to add a toxic plastic to our chosen poison. 

**You could be saving someones life.**

Thank you also to BearsAreDangerous for really making me type this all up even though you inadvertently had no idea. 

TL;DR - Soda Cans and Tin Cans are lined with a plastic called BPA, so are many other things. These lining can be toxic if heat is applied. Don't use anything beyond tinfoil or an actual windscreen.

First, I'd like to quickly reintroduce myself. I was a mod here a while back and because I, incorrectly, thought I could get off of reddit for a while I stepped down. The rest of the mods graciously let me return! Yay! So... er, Hi.

##Wiki now available!
Over my time as a mod here, and on reddit in general, I have noticed it is not uncommon for users to request a thread, or some information be added to the sidebar. While, I feel that has served us well, it can very quickly become cluttered with old threads and old information. On top of that the subscribers had to rely on the mods to get around to it. To remedy this we have started to set up [our very own wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/wiki/) and added a handful of active members as approved contributors. To begin, our goal is to move, update, and expand upon a lot of the sidebar information into the wiki. I started by moving our [vendors list](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/wiki/vendors/). 

Until we get a little more structure going we are going to stick with approved contributors only. As things progress we will loosen those restrictions and allow contributions based upon karma and account age. If you feel you would really like to contribute to the wiki at this time please message the mods.

###I want to add to this a little more and touch a little bit on /u/tangiers [post from last week](http://redd.it/1bxtoh).

With this wiki we mods expect that it will be used for factual information presentation. This will not be a place for brand opinions, reviews, etc.

Re: the wiki and the sub - **Hookah is an extremely subjective pastime and there are very few *wrong* ways to do it.** 

People will often ask questions that have been asked before. People will buy products you think are terrible, or gimmicky. People will enjoy brands that you don't like. If you are not capable of tactfully sharing your opinions and disagreements without down-voting, you should try another [sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookahcirclejerk). We have all been new to hookah at some point. Some of us have made more missteps than others, but at the end of the day, this is a community to share in the enjoyment of hookah and to lend a hand. This is not a place to treat people poorly because they are learning, or they have a preference that isn't the same as yours.

Thanks!

EDIT: I can't spell and need to move wiki/venders to wiki/vendors sorry!

A long time ago, [u/pebbles1992](http://www.reddit.com/user/pebbles1992/) and me traded with [u/HondaFireblade](http://www.reddit.com/user/HondaFireblade). 

I sent him 250g tangiers and a hose tip and pebbles sent him like 600g of shisha. He said he shipped it out 2 weeks ago. But he hasn't replied to the messages and none of us have recived any shisha yet.

As a broke college student, that shisha was the only shisha I had and he was gonna send me 300g fumari for it. Now I have been stuck with no shisha for 2 weeks and cant buy more till I get paid (which I wont as my internship is unpaid.)

Try free carpet samples from the hardware store!,66,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1hr1v6/psa_burnt_a_hole_in_your_carpet_and_have_to_move/,"I've been noticing people having issues with burning holes in their carpets with coals or kalouds and I just wanted to offer a tiny bit of advice I picked up courtesy of one of my friends. 

A few months ago my friend was smoking hookah and for one reason or another the coal fell off and burnt a hole in their carpet straight through to the wood. It was pretty bad, she was always getting questions about whether she was trying to install a pole in that spot or something so clearly the landlord would have noticed on their way out. Luckily she realized that the local hardware store will actually give away free carpet samples that were only a few square inches so she went off and picked up a few that might match the carpet, brought them back, cut out a little filler spot and just glued it into the burnt area.

The landlord was none the wiser and they kept their security deposit!

Just thought I'd share with you guys in case you're stressing about carpet holes and whatnot. Hope it helps!

**TL;DR** Hardware stores sometimes give out free carpet samples. Cut 'em up and glue 'em in where you dropped your coal/lotus/brimstone.",,False,self,t5_2qkma,False,,,True,t3_1hr1v6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1hr1v6/psa_burnt_a_hole_in_your_carpet_and_have_to_move/,

I want to thank you all for supporting hookah culture here and helping everyone out who needs it, especially our close Canadian neighbors, as well as other countries. They kinda get the short end of the stick, but everyone has answered mostly everyone's questions about shipping, pricing, etc. So thank you.

I like what I'm seeing here and I hope to continue to see it. 

So far, this week alone we have seen,

* ~~12~~ 13! new hookah purchases (KM's, Elmas, Egyptian, Regal, Mya!)
* Lots of shisha and coals! (Yay Tangiers!)
* New hoses
* Homemade hookahs (Tron and Pinnacle)

Regarding shisha, I love everyone's suggestions and recommendations for people have been so clingy to one brand or two (like me) and becoming expanded to other great brands such as Nakhla, Starbuzz, Fumari and Tangiers. You've helped with packing, coals, smoking, and overall had a generally good attitude about it. Keep it up!

2 other things!

To those who have just got their hookah, [come smoke with us!](http://www.tinychat.com/reddit_hookah) I try to be on everyday and smoke with others like crippie_boy, electroathena, jojo9913, gnuworldorder and others. I would love to see your new hookahs in action!

Also, to those wanting to buy in the future, please look at the [Hookah Discount Codes](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/w2o7e/hookah_vendor_discount_codes/) thread I created a while back. Check it out to lower the price of your next couple hookah purchases!

They brought a mini hookah.. it looked very cheap and the shisha wasn't very flavorful. They used quick start coals and kept forgetting to plug the second hose when someone else took a drag.

All of those bad points are just a background hum to the loud roar of fun we had as we all sat around smoking and talking.  It was after that night that I found /r hookah and started my readings.

I just wanted to say thank you because after reading and reading and reading. Going to a few local hookah lounges, and smelling dozens of flavors I just made my first purchase from hookah-shisha.

This reddit allowed me to make an informed decision (as well as use a discount code), buy with confidence, and feel confident that I made a great choice.

I thought I'd risk it and give you all the update. It's been a long time coming (mostly because I've been busy) but here's the results:

1. On April 10 I ordered 2 KM Hookahs and 30 KM Hoses from their site. The hookahs were valued at $46.99 and $63.99, and all hoses were valued at $0. Shipping was a flat rate of $100 to Canada.
2. I received confirmation of the order on the same day, with request for payment via bank transfer. After a few e-mails back and forth with the owner, Mohamed Fayed, it was decided that Western Union would be the easiest form of payment.
3. A few minutes after agreeing to send payment via Western Union, I received another e-mail saying that the shipping rate of $100 was not a flat rate, but was in fact a ""per hookah"" rate, so the shipping for my order would be $200. At this point I cancelled the order for the cheaper hookah, and said I would stick to the $46.99 hookah and the 30 hoses, with a total being $163.99.
4. I sent the payment on April 11. On April 12, Mohamed acknowledged that he received the payment, and the hookah would be shipping on the following Tuesday, April 16.
5. On April 18, I followed up to see if it had shipped. I did not receive a response until May 1, on which Mohamed apologized for the delay and said he would have a tracking number for me in a few hours. This was the last I heard from him.
6. Towards the end of May (exact date not available) I received a package in the mail from Egypt. It was the hookah, a genuine KM as ordered, but with only a single hose (the other 30 hoses left out). Regretfully I don't have pictures right now, but can probably update later. Also, the hookah did not come with any grommets.

TL;DR: They did not ship the ""$0"" hoses, the $100 ""flat rate"" shipping is in fact a per-hookah charge. Communication is sketchy, but in the end they did at least deliver on the hookah (short of grommets). For the end price, better off sticking to local vendors.",,False,self,t5_2qkma,False,,,True,t3_1glj2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1glj2e/followup_hookahhosescom/,

[Order 1](http://i.imgur.com/PuiJhAN.jpg)

Now, there was an issue with my credit card being frozen due to buying a lot of steam games, so it never processed the order. I sent them an email saying to process the order since I talked to my bank, they sent an email asking what the invoice number was. Nothing happened for 5-6 days so I made a new almost identical order.
[Order 2](http://i.imgur.com/gevbYjS.jpg)

I used my friends card to pay because he owed me some money. I figure okay all is well the shipment is on the way now.

But then, over a week after I sent the original email about my first order, 5star decided to charge me for my first order without warning.
[Bank statement](http://i.imgur.com/H2gAVEP.jpg)

Okay this sort of mess up is understandable. They did go to that convention and maybe they were backed up enough to take almost 2 weeks to do a re-charge. I noticed on the website my order had been invoiced but not shipped. 

On 7/24/13, I called them to tell them that I had already reordered and didn't need my original reorder and that I wanted that one stopped.
[Order 1 ""Refunded""](http://i.imgur.com/FsSvDyC.jpg)

[Call to 5star](http://i.imgur.com/mHW2w0w.jpg)

They asked me for my invoice number, he said it was refunded, and then promptly hung-up. Okay a little testy of him but I guess if you just thought you lost a 400$ order, alright.

It took one day to go from pending to nothing on my credit card statement.

Everything should be fine at this point. My second order is shipping, and just a few days away, my original order was refunded and I can just sit back and wait.

Unfortunately, that's not how 5star works I'm starting to figure out.
[Returning shipment to sender????](http://i.imgur.com/EN8pORq.jpg)

They decided to stop the shipment on my second order, the one that was paid for, and already a day or two into shipping.

That second order had a different invoice number and was a slightly different order, why would they stop shipment on that? Well, maybe for whatever stupid reason they refunded both orders.

I called them up again to ask why they stopped shipment on my second order and he talked about how my original order didn't go through (the one from 7/14) and then hung up immediately again. This guy does not like staying on the phone apparently.
[second call to 5star](http://i.imgur.com/HkaAItS.jpg)

Except heres the kicker: Notice the bank statement from earlier?
[Bank statement](http://i.imgur.com/H2gAVEP.jpg)

They charged me for the first order, 2 days after they said they refunded it! Also my friends card, the one that paid for the second order has also still been charged and hasn't been refunded. So they stopped the second order and didn't refund it either.

We've talked to our banks and we can't do chargebacks for another couple of weeks they said. So here I am, over a half of a month from my original order. No hookahs, 800$ out of my pocket that could have been spent on actually getting a hookah from a non shitty company, writing this dire warning to you to stop using their website.

Also, I've deleted the emails because I didn't think it'd come to this, but I've sent them a message already telling them this along with my previous phonecalls, and all I've received back was a ""?"".",,False,self,t5_2qkma,1375474447.0,,blueflair,True,t3_1jl3a4,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1jl3a4/warning_story_how_5starhookah_took_800_of_my/,

I'll have it done before the end of July, if it fuckin sucks, I'll still post it. But it will be done. Until then, I will just use FOIL AND COAL!

What would your guys opinion be of a monthly fee subscription service that shipped you shisha/coals and trials once a month. The cost would be tiered starting at 20$ per month ~~up to maybe 100$ (given how much supply you want delivered)~~ *or two/three flexible payment options*.

Also, maybe every 3 months (quarterly) I send a new hose, and once a year you receive a ""free"" new hookah as part of the service. Fun holiday-themed packages (maybe a small ugly xmas sweater for your hookah base!?), and more.

Would you be interested in it? If so, what amount of supply of coals/shish would be worth it at what price points? This isn't to replace your current hookah purchasing, it's to add a cool little box shipped once a month to your doorstep of as many free trials I can persuade companies to give you.

I'd also like to mention... if there was interest here. Although it is a small community subreddit, I would build its initial beta/prototype/pricing, everything, hand-in-hand with you guys and what you want.

Edit: Pricing.

So I work at a hookah bar and tonight this guy came in who was very insistent upon only smoking American shisha. So I went over a few flavors we had with him and he decided he wanted straight fantasia Cuban Mojito. So when I went inside (I was working out on our patio) to make his bowl I mentioned it to my coworkers. It turned out that this guy had sent back at least four different bowls the last time he was there because he didn't like fruity flavors and only smoked American made shisha, so naturally, there aren't many options for this guy. The reason he only smokes American shisha is because he in convinced that any shisha made outside the U.S. is purposefully grown in radioactive soil as a part of some big conspiracy to mass produce and distribute poisonous shisha to the rest of the world. One of my managers had sat down with him and tried to explain why that was ridiculous, but he was thoroughly convinced of this and disgusted by anything un-American in the tobacco world. 

When I brought his bowl out to him he sent it back claiming that is ""wasn't fruity enough"". After we established that he didn't want fruit... Frustrated and angry that he wasted yet another good bowl made with expensive shisha we decided to say fuck it and made him a fruity bowl with our Al Fahker shisha. When I brought it out to him he liked it and kept smoking it. When he asked me what it was I made up a name... Starbuzz Lubricant, ""The Lube"" for short, as a parady of American Shisha names (Queen of Sex, X on the Beach, 4play, etc).  

He thought it was great. So that's what we're going to make him again every time he comes in.

I used mild pipe tobacco, boiled it for 5 minutes to make it smoke smoother. Dried it out on the table.

I read to use glycerin, honey, and molasses. Most recipes called for glycerin and the local store didn't have any, so I went to the handmade soap shop in town. I told the woman who owned it what I was up to and she was in total support. She sold me some glycerin and some natural extracts for flavor for cheap. 

My best recipe so far has been one drop of coconut ginger extract, 1 tsp glycerin, 1/2 teaspoon honey, and enough tobacco to pack a normal hookah bowl. It burns smoothly and tastes fantastic. 

I'm working on boiling down apples in apple cider with honey, molasses,  and cinnamon until it becomes a syrup. Hopefully it turns out nice.",,False,self,t5_2qkma,False,,,True,t3_luh1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/luh1t/started_making_my_own_shisha_today/,

1344932160.0,43,self.hookah,y6zh5,I bought fake Coco Naras from my local smoke shop... now I'm banned from coming back.,44,1,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/y6zh5/i_bought_fake_coco_naras_from_my_local_smoke_shop/,"I'm running low on my box of Coco Ultimates, so I biked down yesterday to a local smoke shop I found on Yelp. It looked like a nice store, and their employee was nice. I looked through their collection of Fusion shisha and while checking out, I noticed a selection of coals behind the counter, so I promptly asked to purchase some Coco Naras. I came home, excited to try Red Rhino and my Coco Naras, but for some reason, my coals weren't staying lit for any longer than five minutes. When I tried to blow off ash, my coal would break in half, showing that the insides weren't burning at all. Upset, I used the rest of my Coco Ultimates, and it worked perfectly.  
I went back to the store a few hours later to ask the employee for a refund after I examined a picture on Coco Nara's website showing the difference between a real and fake box of coals. He told me he hasn't been working there long, and to come back the next day to talk to the owner to sort things out.  
I'm a guy who liked to be 100% sure of something before making accusations. I came back home, took some photos of the box and e-mailed them to Coco Nara's customer service. I received an e-mail this morning telling me that the coals that I have bought were in deed a counterfeit, and that they haven't had an 84-coal box production in over three years. I printed that e-mail out and went back to the smoke shop.  
I noticed a woman working, and asked if she was the owner, and she was. I told her my situation, and she told me that she would call her husband. A few minutes later, she walks up to me with her phone in hand and asks me to talk to her husband. I explained my situation in a calmly manner, and when I mentioned that I conversed with Coco Nara and they identified that the product was a fake, he then became very hostile. He shouted things like:  
&gt;""How can they be fake when I buy directly from the company?""  
&gt; ""Please tell me how I have them if they haven't been around for three years?!""  
&gt;""There's fucking people like you who come in here thinking they know everything, but don't even know how to use a fucking hookah.""  
&gt;""I sell this product at four other of my smoke shops and there's been nothing wrong with them.""  
&gt; ""Curse word, curse word, curse word, blah blah blah.""  
&gt;""I want you to take your money back, and I never want to see your fucking face in my shop again.""  
 
The entire time, I remained calmly as possible, telling him I verified his product with Coco Nara, and that they requested the name and location of his shop to do some investigating. I wasn't planning on snitching on his smoke shop until he decided to act hostile to me and ban me from his store. I honestly just wanted to return the new box (minus 3 coals) and get my money back.  
I handed the phone back to the woman, and she gave me back my money and told me her husband told her to tell me they want me to never come back to their store.  
The store was located in a crap neighborhood, and I just wanted to visit a new place, but now, I probably won't ever buy from that store, and I'll do my best to tell my peers not to either.  
**TLDR; Bought fake Coco Naras from a smoke shop, tried to return it, got into a verbal argument, got my money back, and also got banned from coming back.**  
I'm just curious to see if there were better ways to come about this, and if I had other options I could have taken.

I ordered a 32 inch KM Red Pear (http://www.hookahjohn.com/KM-32-inch-Red-Pear-2089R.htm), which was $89. Nothing too fancy, but a good first hookah in my opinion. Not 10 minutes after placing my order, I received a call from John telling me that the last Red Pear had broken. I'm not a picky person, so this really wasn't a big deal for me, and John then let me choose a new hookah from the same selection without charging me any extra. I ended up choosing the 34 inch KM Black Pear (http://www.hookahjohn.com/KM-32-inch-HJ-Custom-KM-Black-Pear-Hookah-2089BZ.htm). John was very friendly and helpful after I told him that I'm somewhat new to hookah and explained the details of each hookah to me to help me pick out a new one.

So if anyone else is new to hookah and is looking for a good vendor, I have to agree with what I've heard from others here and recommend HookahJohn.

I wanna lead this off by saying, I have been anti-Starbuzz for a while for a few different reasons (though I never downvote or give people shit for smoking it, you should always smoke what you enjoy,) but after reading this my thoughts do differ a bit!

Courtesy of RHF:

(context: On a thread about the new Starbuzz E-hose, /u/hookahjohn is called out on not enjoying vaping and just promoting Starbuzz because he's a vendor.)

""Not sure what you mean, let me clarify.

 Of course I'm a vendor and I like hookah. I have been smoking hookah for many years before dreaming of getting into this business.
 I would bet that I smoke more hookah than anyone in the industry other than Eric of Tangiers.


 About vaping, I have tried it. I have been testing and making flavors. It's just not exciting to me. That's actually why it has been taking so long to release my juice......you get the point.
 I have an assistant who, and not to be rude or discredit anyone here, that could school most of you on vaping. He has been schooling me on it, and when I take him to distributors he has been schooling them as well.
 With that said, I still don't have the love for vaping.


 About the ehose, I am super impressed with it. And for those who think it's overpriced, you are entitled to that but how do you know what they cost to make, distribute, and run the business side of it? I think they are pricey, but for getting a comparable vape it's not much more, especially with it's output.


 Now I know they like to bash Starbuzz over at HP, and they have posted some of the stupidest reasoning I have ever heard. Business ethics? What the fuck do they know about their business ethics, practices or anything else about their business?
 What? What they have heard from other members that post blindly? What they read regarding court cases? Those records aren't detailed. What rumors they heard about them and any law agencies? Seriously what do they know? Do these people know what it takes to create a business of such magnitude?


 I will tell you what I know about Starbuzz, and this goes way back. I will keep it brief as possible.


 They came out with a new style of shisha when your only options were AF, Nakhla, and some other brands you don't hear about nor would you smoke anymore. 


 They came out with unique flavors and mixes that were never available before.


 They started to get copied left and right, and even counterfeited, which is still going on today. (anyone in their right mind and a lawyer would do what is in their legal power to stop the copiers from gaining any momentum. Just think about how many lawsuits your smartphone manufacturer has been involved in)


 They continue to bring new flavors to the market all the time.


 They continue to bring new products to the market, such as their Phoneix and Unicus, which are like Chinese hookahs, only have been improved with better materials and specs like a wider downstem.
 This week they launched the Starbuzz E-hose, and again, for hookah smokers this is a new innovation.


 They employ hundreds of US workers, and purchase tons of materials in the US to produce their product. (that right there means alot to me)


 What have the other brands done for the hookah industry and the US economy?



 I had a conversation with Eric of Tangiers once about how impressed I was with his operation. In addition to putting out a fine product Eric pays rent to an American landlord, to produce tobacco in the US. He has around 10 employees, maybe more. He buys tons of material to make this a reality, materials from American companies. It's amazing how much this one guy spends, not makes, in our economy.



 You should think the same about Starbuzz.


 Now about the e-hose, if you want it, it's available, if not, no hard feelings. I won't have one in my hand where ever I go, but I will/do own one now.
