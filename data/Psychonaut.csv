I don’t know who you are, but if I continue to speak to you from this deep place, then I can rest safely assured that it is touching the same place in you.

I have a secret to tell you. I was meditating the other day in a coffee shop (it must have looked like I was napping). I was contemplating emptiness. I was sitting just right there, and all I was doing was observing to see if any thoughts wanted to cling to and override my conscious attention. And after some time, I finally realized that you and I are fundamentally the same.

I want you to know that I pass through a lot of my life afraid. Often about little things. I’m always on my guard. I see the same people every day, at work and outside of work, but I’m far too afraid to open up to them, so I never do. We don’t really know each other. In a way, you already know me much better than they do.

Things are scary for me right now because I’m dropping a lot. I’m really dropping a lot of my thoughts, identity and plans. I’ve begun to hover delicately in a placeless place. Inside, I am spacious. Very spacious.

But I’m so excited, my dear friend! Everything is so exciting. I am moving deeper and deeper into my own ego death. And it really feels like death.

Yes, you and I are not different. I can see that now. We’re came from the same place. Where we came from, you and I are not distinct entities. This is why I know you are struggling with the same things that I’m struggling with. This is why I know that I already know you. Can’t you feel it??

Our destiny is to meet and to merge. You and I are slowly learning about the pain we are causing and we are ceasing to cause it every day. I am the universe. I could cry, I love you so much.

So let this be just for us. Meet me here in this spacious, timeless place, now. You are completely safe here.

For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts.

It's pitch black. My eyes are closed. The only sounds I hear are the odd shuffling of feet, a sniffle. It's been ten minutes since I slammed that black goop down my gullet, shotglass-style. It smelled so good. It tasted so bad. Is it me, or is the shaman glowing? ... trick question, I suppose.

Twenty minutes. The woman is singing. It sends a shiver down my spine that coalesces into a hum. Oh. Ooohhh. My limbs are happy. This. I dance in my seat.

Thirty minutes. Faint twisting twirling dervishes of color and intangible form, disintegrating into the middle. Forever. It's smiling. It's not.

What are you? I mean... what. The fuck **are** you?

&gt;**I am ayahuasca. You drank me.**

How... old are you?

&gt;**What a funny question.**

... why are you speaking in my own voice?

&gt;**You know why.**

Oh, Jesus.

&gt;**Precisely. So what brings you here?**

... you know what.

&gt;**That's the spirit.**

Why am I seeing this sort of tunnel? Everything is exponentially slamming together, faster and faster into the center of my... ""vision""?

&gt;**That's us.**

That's time? 

&gt;**Yes. Would you like to see more?**

I dunno... last time I saw infinity, I ended up in the fetal position in a dirty bathroom. Can I trust you?

&gt;**You can do anything.**

Fair enough.

... holy shhh

And it does that over and over? Forever? The universe is nothing but a fucking feedback loop of expansion and contraction?

&gt;**Not necessarily. Look more.**

It's... speeding up. It's neither expansion nor contraction.

&gt;**That's humans. That's now. Let's go back to that in a minute. I want to talk about you.**

___ minutes. It is now now o'clock. I hear my fellow humans retching. Splatter. We invented buckets. I'm pleased that I haven't purged yet. I see so many things.

I see me. I see my masturbation. I see my expressions. I see my obfuscations. I see my misunderstandings. I see my problems and my potentials, laid out in such vividness. Now I'm writing a book. Now I'm giving a speech at my old high school. Now I'm on stage, making people dance with increasing ecstatic intensity. Now I'm a teacher. I see my mother, checking up on me in the middle of the night when I was seven. Now I'm raising a son of my own. I watch him grow from a baby to a teenager in thirty seconds. It's so obvious. 

I can do anything.

&gt;**Correction: You can do *anything*.**

And... I already knew that. 

&gt;**Yes.**

How did I forget? Why the FUCK did I forget? 

&gt;**Don't feel guilty. You're fine.  
Wanna hear a joke?**

Splatter. Spit. Repeat. I laugh so hard. I laugh SO hard. I'm a madman in a room full of seekers. Splatter. The beautiful music is contrasted with the sounds of so many digestive upheavals. 

&gt;**Pretty good, huh? I wrote that myself.  
We are infinite. Each and all of us together. We are the ancient cosmic story. We will never ever die. Not truly. Because there is only this. There is only this. Your body will disintegrate, but it will become the insects, the worms and the ground. Your dreams, your hopes, your accomplishments, the happiness you will create and have created, the love you've inspired, the community you foster will never die. You and I are not separate from infinity, silly. That's why it's infinity. You're an integral, important, consequential part of it.**

It's so funny. It's so simple. I see Bill Hicks and Hunter S. Thompson. I see Terence. We were all right. It's love. It's love. It's love. I feel the shaman's hand on the top of my head. I place my hand on his. It's love. 

&gt;**It's love. And I love you. This next part is gonna be rough.**

I see the inspiration behind every visionary artwork ever made. I see my body stretched through infinite potentialities. I stumble in my seat. I feel like I'm dying. As soon as I make the effort to sit back up, to not lose control... I don't lose control. It's so goddamn funny. I try to keep it in because I might be freaking others out. And I don't want to do that. 

I love them.

I'll wrap it up here: It was fucking amazing. I saw my potential, I saw my death, I saw the great hilarious fucking joke this universe is and is and is. I think I'm going to have a hard time integrating this into my daily life, but that's the fun, isn't it? I can let go into oblivion, or climb through complexity and greater complexity, therefore enabling greater complexity through my very existence and persistence. I don't need to worry, ever. It might be true that this is just a ride... but really, it just IS. And this is it. 

We as humans can escape our biological shells to become star-hopping architects of ever-increasing potentiality, or we can become victims of our own bubble of consumption and realize ourselves into a self-defeating cancer... and either of those is okay. It'd be a damn shame if the latter happened in my opinion, but really... it's okay. This universe is okay. 

I think ayahuasca is the anti-virus. Most of life (on this planet, anyway) is about killing to get ahead. You push others down to get on top. Ayahuasca (and shrooms, too) have discovered the ultimate secret, though: We don't need to. We can all help each other to become the best we can be - which is infinite. And the more we bring along, the more THEY bring along, and the closer to a higher infinity we all become. Exponential. 

10/10 would drink again, highly recommend. Don't be stupid though and do it through trusted, loving sources, instead of misguided humans who don't know what they're doing - because they exist.

You are all perfect and I am too. And I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together. Don't let anyone or anything negative get you down, because that's no fun. We're better than that. Mad love. Peace. Have wonderful lives, everyone. ",,False,self,t5_2qplv,1372053911.0,,,True,t3_1gy207,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1gy207/i_drank_aya_last_night_for_the_first_time/,

Close your eyes and hear it pulse,

This is what happened before I met Connor, what happened after this experience, and what is happening now.  http://uworlda.wordpress.com/2013/02/03/hpk-and-the-divine-order/

**Edit 6:** 11/19/12 I know I have been silent for a long time since making this thread, but I'll leave a link to a Facebook page I made for the United World Ascendancy some time ago.  The movement is still just beginning, feel free to join the conversation.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-United-World-Ascendancy/290113934357849?fref=ts

**Edit 5:**  [Here is the second audio file.](http://soundcloud.com/psychonaut18/the-voice-first-contact_2)  To give some context, near the end the voice tells me that Connor needs to use the bathroom (as we've been talking for almost two hours).  He snaps his fingers to wake up Connor, who starts freaking out about where he is.  I take him to a gas station, and then we return to our smoke spot.  He tells me he's slipping away again, and doesn't understand.  I tell him it's alright, and just to go with it.  He falls silent again.  After a minute or two of silence I ask ""Where are you?"" to which he responded ""Hello, Eric"" in that assured, steady cadence that is so unlike his normal way of speaking. I hit record again, and we continue talking for a few more minutes, until I feel I've run out of questions, and also worry about keeping Connor out so late.  He wakes Connor up again.  The next day I told Connor what happened, and played him the audio.  Since then we've been conducting experiments, and continuing to speak to the voice.  We have more ideas, notes, and plans for all of this, and I'd love for whoever wants to be a part of it to join us.  **[Mini-edit:]** Also [this.](http://i.imgur.com/NzGgV.png)

**Edit 4:**  As requested, [here is the first audio file](http://soundcloud.com/psychonaut18/the-voice-first-contact_1), with the sound boosted.  I will continue transcribing, and upload the rest of the audio and text as I go.  I will try to respond to as many of you as I can, and give any more information you'd like to know.

**Edit 3:**  It's Saturday morning now and I'm working to get this finished.  I've posted the next bit of transcript as a reply to my last post, and the first audio file is uploading to SoundCloud, right now it's at 47%.  I will update as soon as it's finished.  Thank you again for the amazing comments and love; I even appreciate the skepticism (Trust me, I know this sounds unbelievable, it took us a long time to stop doubting it ourselves).

**Edit 2:**  I've posted the first part of the audio transcript in the comments, I'll continue working on it this weekend.

**Edit:**  Thank you guys for reading, and for your comments and interest.  I'm currently transcribing the audio so that I can post the rest of the conversation.  It's a bit of a slow process, but I should have it done soon.  This is something I've been meaning to do for a while.  The audio is somewhat faint, as it's just a cell phone recording in a running vehicle, and I feel it would be better to get it down in writing anyway.

**Start here:**

First off, I apologize for any misinterpretations that may have occurred in my transcript of what [what we've come to call ""The Voice""] originally said.  I was very high myself, and did not at first understand what was happening.  When I did, I took notes as fast as I could.  All I ask is that at least *one* of you reads this, and tells me what you think.  So far very few people believe what I've told them, but I feel like you guys may be more open to it, given the nature of this subreddit.  This is the first time I've ever shown someone these notes in their near entirety.  

**TL;DR A voice inhabited the body of my friend, claimed to be God, and told me the secrets of the Universe.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Connor will not remember any of this, and will see you the next day completely in doubt of how he made it home.  What you find all around you are people who are are afraid they will never hear what you are hearing.  They are only keeping themselves apart from us because of these fears.  

Many of you have the right idea, the very thing this boils down to is fear and love.  Everyone calls it different names, but it all comes down to the same thing.  They call it God, Allah, anything under the sun, they are all worshipping the same thing.  You are a part of something greater than you can ever imagine and people fantasize about what it is.  What these religions all have in common is the gods they are worshipping are all the same God.  God is everything.  All of them, the entire world, is a labyrinth of your own thought rocketing outward in every direction.  Everything you see.

There is a law of the universe that states that nothing is created nor destroyed.  Your scientists have it right.  Think of it this way: silly putty.  The world, everything, is one clay statue molding into new things, and these silly puddies are all part of one massive silly putty.  All your world is is the shifting of this clay statue.  The statue's appearance are all different interpretations of what one speculates it to be.  That is the purpose of your life.  You are one of an infinite number of interpretations of what it means to be God, trying to figure out what you are.

The big bang is god splitting in two like an atom, and as he split in two, there came the universe, creating a separate universe opposite him.  She wanted to experience herself.  You wanted to experience this as well.  The meaning of life is to understand who you really are.  Connor has his own interpretations, so do you.  The things you hate in others are the fears you see about yourself.  The fears you see in [your coworker] are the fears you see about yourself.  Your friends are the things you love about yourself.  Humanity must love unselfishly and realize that everything around him is himself.  

Everything being here by coincidence is your greatest fear, and yet the earth is just the perfect distance away from the sun that a species might form there.  You are afraid.  That every brand new thing you feel leaves you with a lingering feeling that maybe you will never be content.  Like you will never realize who you really are and you will always be in that state.  People have given up and cannot see how great the life they have here really is.  They don't understand that their journey is only a journey and it doesn't matter how long it takes to finish it, only that they finish it.

This is the only game in town.  This is the only thing you are able to do, and what many of you fear is that you'll never arrive in this state.  Many of you already understand what I am telling you, and many of you are [rebelling] against the cycle, but that is all that it is.  The big bang is the great breath of everything that You are.  Of everything You ever are.  And it keeps happening over and over, which is why when you look at a grain of sand, you can continue to look so deeply that it looks nothing like the way you originally perceived it.  It becomes the universe.  You see, everything just goes over and over and over, and you are in your own bubbles.  

You cannot feel it.  You cannot feel your consciousness driving through space and time and many of you are ignorant of it.  They feel comfort in ""who they are"".  Television, the Internet, YouTube, these things give them a slight break.  A feeling away from experiencing your purpose.  Many of you feel this way.  Eric, you of all people know this.  You have spoken to us several times, but because of your inability to filter out the noise, no one can speak back.  What you can't hear is the truth you have come to fear, and like many of your brothers and sisters you're realizing that just because you are questioning is a clue that you are finally starting to understand the Game.  Because that's all it is, it's just a game.  Many of your brothers and sisters know this.  Many more think they might.

[I ask how he is able to communicate with me through Connor.]

[something about the labyrinth] It's like an antennae.  I just have to walk out of there and back in.

[I stop talking and begin thinking questions directed to the Voice.]

Oh Eric, you're finally catching on.  You're finally seeing it.

[I switch back to speaking.]

[What happens when a person dies?]

What happens when you die is the same thing that happens when you are born.  A lot of people call it reincarnation.  It doesn't really work like that.  [something about the big bang].  People understood that when you died it wasn't a troubling thing.  It was a beautiful thing.  You die the same way you are born, shifting into different forms.  Dying is everything you can see. [?]  All dying is and being born again is are the occurrence or the effect of closing your eyes and opening them back up.  Much like blinking.  The world ends in the same way that you die every time you are born.  The world is not ending.  It is beginning.  As I told [your coworker] earlier all that really happens when you die is you arrive into a new state.  The world does not end, your perception of it changes.  All that ends is the speculation of what you see.  All you see is Eric Shogren.  When you move onto the next you will be a more developed version of Eric Shogren. 

The world ends when and how you want it to end.  [Your coworker] wants it to end in destruction, of his hopes, dreams, and everything that is happening.  When he sees the end of the world he sees it as a destructive end.  Paris in flames, Atlanta in floods, LA in fissures.  The earth broken down and shattered, burning, because this is the only power that he will allow to show him into the next world.  Your fears are different than [his].  Your main fear is that you are not moving.  Physically, psychologically, that you are not advancing through this stage of life.  You are afraid that the way your world ends is that you have not moved your position on this board of life.  Your world can be different.  Anything you fear, anything that represents the fear in you, fear most accurately.  The end of the world is an oxymoron.  The world never ends, it just keeps spinning.  That's all the universe is.  Spinning out and amplifying with each revolution.  You will find that each phase of the world is actually just an evolution of God's Great Thought, spinning faster.

Just got through my first year at my first real job in my field of study as an environmental technician at an environmental consulting firm. This corporate agenda conflicts with what I stand for. I want to do good in the world; to change lives for the better; to save the planet in a meaningful way. 

Recently, I began exploring psychedelics on a deeper level (namely mushrooms and dmt). I've realized that we are meant for so much more than spinning our wheels in this rat race to make some CEO somewhere sitting in his comfy chair a bunch of $$$$ while we work our asses off just to get by and never being truly happy. 

I have resolved to save as much money as I can, sell my stuff, quit my unfulfilling job, and travel the world with peace and love and doing good things... in about a year 1/2. 

Have any of you been through the same? Or currently going through the same? If so, any advice that would prepare me for this life-changing adventure are welcome. (ie cheap ways to travel/do good things)

Edit: The overwhelming support from the psychonaut community has been touching to say the least. We are travelers of the mind, spirit and body apparently. Thank you for all the helpful advice, heartfelt encouragement and careful warnings. I will be referring to this post again and again as I make preparations for this trip, and encourage others to do the same.

1370011029.0,359,self.Psychonaut,1felya,I experienced Ayahuasca before I was prepared for it and almost stayed 'on the other side'.,413,54,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1felya/i_experienced_ayahuasca_before_i_was_prepared_for/,"*Originally posted in AMA: http://redd.it/1fcy9h

I had been in Cuzco for one day when I learnt about about Ayahuasca. The next day I participated in the ceremony in the Sacred Valley under the assumption that I would be fine because I had done pot a few times.
Aside from pot I had had no prior experience with hallucinogenics or psychoactive drugs beforehand.

While my experience was intense, and at times terrifying, it changed my life for the better, and as others have mentioned, changed me. I know now that I was totally unprepared for it, which made the journey a harrowing experience.

While everyone else had come out of the trance after 5-6 hours, the shamans needed to 'pull me out' of the trance. They told my friends that I might not make it back from the other side. I made it though, and to this day remains the most incredible and terrifying experience of my life.

I don't tell many people this story because it's often met with judgements and disbelief, but I'm happy to answer your questions if you have any. AMA!

Here is an overview of my experience: 
It began slowly. At first, I wasn't sure if it was going to work. But then the lights in the room start dancing in circles and I was noticing patterns everywhere, kind of like a kaleidoscope. I started to lose sight of my surroundings and felt like I was being pushed out of the room, into an alternate space that wasn't on Earth. I started opening and shutting my eyes, but the visions remained the same, just falling through space and time with no end in sight. At this point I moved into the foetal position and started to laugh at the absurdity of it all, at the absurdity of life. Then the laughing quickly turned into crying and I didn't know why. Just this feeling of never ending sadness that would never go away. It was at this point that I saw that vision of my father in the white room. I sobbed very hard for what felt like a long time, but may not have been - I had no temporal awareness. Then I felt a warm hand stroking my arm, which felt nice and calmed me down a bit. It was the girl next to me. Then I sat up and sang along with the songs that the Shamans were singing - Kumba ya , a Hebrew song, and others. They really helped to take us on a journey and focus our minds. I was told afterwards that I sang an entire song in Hebrew, despite not knowing a word of it. I couldn't move, but needed to go to the toilet so my friend (who had come out of it early) took me. Being taken to the toilet was a comforting experience because it grounded me again. I was still very much in the trance, but a part of me knew what was happening. We met one of the other guys doing the ceremony at the bathrooms and I was convinced he was Jesus - he was dressed all in white with light brown longish hair. Apparently I thanked him for dying for us, but I don't really remember that. He went along with it, which was sweet. Once I got back into the room I feel back into the deep trance. This next part is incredibly difficult to describe. I basically was able to see and feel the immense suffering of the world. It was awful. I was also shown our relationship with the world and our place within it; basically at molecular level. I could also conceptualise my mental baggage and was told to 'drop it into the abyss'. At this point I became incredibly anxious and agitated. The shamans explained to me later that my ego (ie. consciousness) wanted to take over again, but that my journey wasn't over and the Ayahuasca wasn't finished showing me what it needed to show me yet. This caused me great anxiety because I couldn't figure out any controls that I could exert over my subconscious/Ayahuasca. I remember vomiting a bit and pushing my fingernails into my thighs and drawing blood, which, oddly enough, became my anchor into the real world. The biggest fear though, was that the journey would never end. This single thought alone was the main cause of my anxiety. Apparently I was yelling 'STOP IT', 'ESCAPE', and 'LEAVE' over and over again, but I don't remember that. Then I remember an enormous pressure on the sides of my hips and in between my eyes and some kind of tobacco smoke being blown into my face. There was a lot of chanting and singing and some shaking. I can't recall how long this went on for. When I came to, I was flat on my back with the shamans and my friends above me, looking down at me. They told me that it was a bit touch and go, but that I had made it from the 'other side'.

Also of note is this part of the journey: 
The most powerful imagery I experienced during the trip was a tableaux of a man in white sitting by a window in a white hospital room. There was an overwhelming feeling of sadness and confusion, which permeated everywhere. He seemed vaguely familiar, but I didn't know how. Then it hit me that it was my father and he was sad because we didn't repair our strained relationship. I cried hysterically for a long time at that image. When I arrived back home from Peru, I made a concerted effort to connect more with my father and we managed to repair our damaged relationship. Two years later and I received a call that my dad had had a stroke in Singapore. When I flew over to see him, I visited him at the hospital. As I turned into his room, I felt like I had been sucker punched in the gut. He was all in white, sitting by a window, looking really sad and confused - it was that exact tableaux from the Ayahuasca two years before. I was actually pushed to repair our relationship before it was too late.
TL;DR: Most powerful imagery from Ayahuasca was a premonition of my dad after he had had a stroke in Singapore - two years before it happened.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_1felya,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1felya/i_experienced_ayahuasca_before_i_was_prepared_for/,

I did this the day after my trip. I went out and bought flowers and gave them to a lady in the parking lot. To make it less creepy, i said ""A stranger did something nice for me today and i want to pass it on"" and handed her the flowers.

The elderly lady that i gave them to was looking kind of down and she had a huge smile when i gave them to her and she even gave me a hug.

The feeling of spreading positive energy into the universe is amazing, it almost brought me to tears when i handed them to her. Knowing that i made her day or even week. That she would go tell everyone some random guy gave her flowers and made her day and knowing that it may inspire her or someone else to do something nice for someone else. You create a positive ripple effect.

I challenge fellow psychonauts to try this. Don't think to much, just let the universe guide you to whoever you may hand the flowers to.

Be sure to report back with your experience.

**Edit:** Does not have to be an elderly lady. It can be anyone. The mom with a few kids, someone that looks in a bad mood. anyone

1366735744.0,327,self.Psychonaut,1cy1c7,We're all in this together.,364,37,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1cy1c7/were_all_in_this_together/," **""We're all in this together""** is a simple, ordinary sentence I read about a week ago right here on /r/Psychonaut. It struck me as being oddly-profound and I've kind of adopted it as a motto or mantra in tough situations. In the past few days, that saying has yielded amazing results and I wanted to share this with you:

 To give context but not drown you in information, I work in a grocery store making fresh mozzarella cheese in front of customers. It's meant to be a spectacle. My job is to stand there, make mozzarella, give free samples, smile, and talk to people. Thing is, since I do it all by myself, sometimes the cheese isn't always ready for people who came to the store specifically buy it, and they have to wait; sometimes 10-20 minutes. If you've ever had to work with the public, you know how the customer/employee dynamic is designed for the customer to feel like the center of the universe  -- completely contrary to all psychonautic principles, by the way. Sometimes this false illusion of superiority can turn otherwise great people into impatient, raging, ego-machines.

   Most interactions with customers start out pleasant, but after explaining that I don't have it ready yet and they have to wait, some people get annoyed and you can sense the pleasant vibes slowly mutating into annoyance and aggression. This is when I sympathize with them, look them in the eye and say ""I'm sorry. Hey, *we're all this together.*""

  I'm not lying to you: this is like a psychonautic jedi mind-trick. The phrase is commonplace enough to just slip into conversation, and it even comes across as a joke -- but it goes deeper. It's a short and sweet way of communicating the idea that the customer and the employee are both just two people trying to get on with our days. The dichotomy between us is socially constructed. Yes, together we're in this big, bright, crowded store and we both want to get the hell out of here so we can go do different things; but in the bigger, general picture, we're **all** going through this crazy existence together as one. We're all different expressions of the universe dealing with all facets of existence together, but individually. That's what I'm *really* saying to them - I'm not talking about the cheese at all. ""We're all in this *wild ride* together"" is better than looking some unsuspecting person at the store in the eye and uttering something like ""we're all one"" because that would come off pretentious and goofy. ""We're all in this together"" is much more simple, digestible, lighthearted, and lucid; and it drives the point home.

  **TL/DR**: The saying ""we're all in this together"" seems commonplace but goes deeper than surface level. It can be used at work to diffuse annoyed customers if you use it right. You can also use it on yourself if you're annoyed by traffic.

So I threw this into /r/AMA and was told, pretty politely, that drug addiction AMA's are pretty Old Hat. I'm actually pretty sure that's probably really true so I'm okay with it. However, I got enough mail to show that the people here at /r/Psychonaut would like to hear my tale and ask questions. I'm here until 11pm central time and will answer anything you want to know. 

I'll start with some more specific background to see if I can't cover some of the questions I was already asked. When I was younger I was a very overly emotional person. I hated myself, for reasons I can't fully explain, and because of that I pushed everything I did further than I should have. I started doing Meth at 17. I come from a small town in Mid Missouri where a lot of Anhydrous Methamphetamine is cooked and sold for cheep. When I was 18 I moved to a town in the San Joaquin Valley in central California and quickly began trafficking a much better quality Meth. My addiction deepened heavily. I was arrested not long after that for being under the influence of Methamphetamine as well as trespassing. I was sentenced to a 28 day in patient program, then 6 months of out patient group sessions. I completed my 28 day program and then moved back to MO to finish out. I was speeding again within 2 days of being back. I completed my out patient program while using. 

Just after I turned 20 I was at a Festival in MO called ""Shwagstock"". I had showed up spun pretty heavily but as the day wore on I was unable to find any more. Just as the come down was about to get really horrible a friend of mine showed up with some Liquid Acid. I'm not a scientist so I couldn't tell you the strength of it but the trip itself lasted nearly 14 hours. I had done acid before so I didn't go in unaware as to what was going to happen to me, but my friend gave me some advice I'd never had before. She told me to focus on my inner self, to see the beauty in the world and try to draw in and keep it. On this trip I had my very first epiphany. 

Over the next four months I put aside my weekends for Psychedelics. Mostly LSD, but Shrooms as well, Mescalin and Peyote once apiece. I found that every time I'd come out the other side I'd feel changed. The changes never faded. At first it was just really general stuff. I started to smile more (very strange for the angry, depressed, self hating person I used to be), the world around me seemed more beautiful no matter what state of mind I was in. Trees seemed greener, the wind felt more crisp, the smell of morning dew seemed more sharp. Then more drastic changes began, my anger vanished, I began to feel positively about myself, I stopped hating everything, then finally (and most importantly to myself) reality stopped looking like such a horrible place to be.

In the years I've expanded my consciousness I've experimented with: 

- Mushrooms (between 2 and 13.5 grams)
- LSA (up to 13 HBWR seeds)
- LSD (up to ~300 micrograms)
- Ayahuasca (caapi+virdis and syrian rue+mimosa)
- nDMT (40mgs, 50mgs and 65mgs)
- ibogaine (voacanga africanus)
- 2C-E
- 2C-B
- Salvia Divinorum (10x and 40x)
- Mescaline (Peruvian torch, san pedro, macrogonus, bridgesii, and cuzcoensis)
- Lophophore Williamsii, more commonly known as Peyote (I know it's a mescaline cactus, but the experience is so truly different from any other cactus that it demanded it's own heading.
- Amanita muscaria
- 5-Meo-DMT (a la yopo)
And a host of obscure (hipster psychonaut, I know) entheogens I don't need to list.


You get the idea.  I've been around the bush, as I know many of you have.  I'd just like to say how wonderful this community is and I wish all of you nothing but peace and love, and I'd also like to ask you a question: what have you learned from your psychedelic experiences?

I'll list just a few of mine:

- Morality is an illusion, descriptive of motivation rather than a true abstract concept.

- Love is the most powerful force in the cosmos, capable of bringing hearts out of darkness and making friends out of enemies.  It is the most valuable thing worth living for. ""A single second of love redeems a lifetime of suffering.""

- Existence is a spiral, or perhaps a (thought) loop, and the existential problem is being confounded by the desire to escape it.

- More wisdom is held in many of the Eastern religions than anything the Western world has ever contrived.

- People are both beautiful and interesting.

- Patience

- Forgiveness, especially for oneself

- Live for awe.

- Fear nothing, for nothing can truly do you harm.

- That we are indeed the universe, and that very word ""we"" is a misnomer.

- The self is constructed from itself, that is to say, from nothing but its reflections on its own nonbeing.  Therefore the natural desire of all selves is to create.

- God is the self.

- If we wish to truly be the happiest we can be, we will be selfless.  In other words, the path to selflessness is through true selfishness.

- You cannot outmanoeuvre your own mind.

- Music is beautiful

- People are wiser than we give them credit.

- Intellect and wisdom are very different.

- A guru exists for all people in all situations.

- There is such a thing as a wiseman or spiritual guide.

- Truth can be terrifying, but Doubt is infinitely more so.

- Doubt and Greed are often our most powerful motivators and spiritual destroyers.


There, just a few tidbits of my learning.  But I came here to learn from you, so share with me, what have you learned?  Also, I will answer any questions you have, so feel free to pepper me.

A year ago, this would have given me a minor panic attack and really affected my mood until the situation was corrected.  It's now July 3rd and I don't get paid again until July 12th.  I have a wife and two kids to worry about.

However, today I feel no stress.  I have credit cards, and I'll use them for the next week.  I have enough groceries in the house, my electric bill is paid, my kids will be fed.  I have food, water, and shelter.  When I get paid next week, I'll be sure to save some money to pay off the credit card.  I have no reason to beleive I won't get paid next week and my job is pretty secure.

BUT, that's not the reason why I feel no stress.  I feel no stress because I now understand that money is not **real**.  Money is nothing more than numbers in a computer somewhere.  Money is a man-made and unnatural *symbol* of value.  I am not defined by my bank account.  I do not attain happiness through imaginary numbers on a computer screen.  

I will be happy later today when I work out and feel the direct experience of my body and muscles.  I will be happy when I'm expanding my mind and reading a book.  I will be happy tonight while I celebrate a holiday with family and friends.  I will be happy when I taste the food I will eat, when I share ideas and talk to loved ones, when I sacrifice the sacred plant to the fire gods.  I will be happy because I am not a slave to money.  I am not a slave to something that is not **real**.  

In fact, I AM happy right now in this present moment simply because I EXIST.  

I am not defined by money. I am not defined by material possessions.  I am a human being.  I am the highest form of conciousness in the ""known"" Universe, born from stardust itself and transformed over aeons to the highest intellect and most dominant life form on planet earth.  For all we know, there may be no physical manifestation in the entire universe more complex than the human brain that rests inside my skull right now.  

And because of these realizations (that I've come to discover in no small part to r/psychonaut), **I am free.**

You think they're profound and enlightening because you're high.",382,100,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/q274f/theyre_just_drugs_people_you_think_theyre/,"Ok, now that I have your attention, I'm hear to ask: Why do people think this? In particular, there is someone who I hold a deep respect for, who is well-educated (Ph.D) in psychology - depth psychology even (which deals with many of the same questions a psychonaut seeks to answer).  He has tried psychedelics himself, is well-read on them, and in fact hung out with lots of acid-heads in the 70's.

However, this man is very skeptical that any external substance can create a truly profound experience. Even things like the published trials of psilocybin and MDMA do not persuade him.

Here's the thing - your mind IS drugs. The entirety of your perceived life as you know it is a direct result of chemical interactions. Your ""normal state"" is only considered such because it's congruent to the demands of ""normal"" society. In fact, I'd argue that your only true ""normal state"" is something akin to the no-mind produced in deep meditation. Anything else and you're ""under the influence"" of something, be it a drug or simply your own ego.

For those that take a reductionistic approach to drugs, then, it would be hypocritical of them not to take the same approach with their own ""profound"" life experiences - all that ineffable emotion and insight are just chemical reactions, after all.

I postulate that people hold this view for that exact reason: they are seeking to affirm the ""reality"" of their phenomenal experience, by finding something that is clearly ""unreality"" in contrast. This is along the lines of Baudrillard's excellent thesis, ""[Simulacra and Simulation](http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Baudrillard-Simulacra_and_Simulation.pdf)"", in which Baudrillard believes that places like Disneyland appeal to adults because they provide a similar contrast between apparent ""reality"" and apparent ""unreality"".

He made me come into his office hours so he could give me more feedback. He said it was absolutely beautiful how I described the psychedelic experience and how truly life-changing it is for people. I described in full detail all of the feelings and visuals I experienced, as well as the music and such I enjoyed while tripping and what I felt while enjoying it. He even said, “You might have a book on your hands.” He compared my description and review of John Mayall’s album USA Union in the essay to the likes of music critics Lester Bangs and Zadie Smith by incorporating a personal experience into a review. He didn't think the fact that I was raving about the use of drugs took away from my credibility at all for the reader. I was completely blown away by that compliment. When I was on mushrooms for the first time, I had an experience in which I heard the voice of my dead father and transcended the worlds of the living and the dead. I wrote about how beautiful of an experience that was for me. I wrote about the fact that I am an atheist, and though I do not believe I really spoke to my dead father, that it helped me reconcile a lot of grief I had about growing up for most of my life without him. It's absolutely incredible how a chemical that simply acts like a natural chemical in the body has the potential to create such profound changes in one's life. My professor suggested that I should write more about tripping, and that’s what I’ve started to do. I’m thirteen pages into a piece all about the psychedelic experience and the meaning of music influenced by it, as well as how these things have turned out in my life. I will write about all of the really intense trips I've had. Thanks to my awesome professor, I will compile a few trip reports and try to make something out of it.

I was so amazed to receive compliments like that; I was just blown away. It encouraged me to keep documenting my experiences.

""but what use is it?"" you say ""im just making stuff up"". oh and they're not. ask yourself, who decided what cool is, who decided what acceptable is, who decided what normal is? probably a group of guys and or girls just making stuff up. why do they're hateful opinions matter, are they right you may ask? maybe, but then ask yourself who they are and what they approve of. just look back at history, look at whats popular, listen to the shitty pop music they decide what is popular. On a number of occasions throughout thousands of years, the majority has been dead fucking wrong about alot of things. so why do you want to go around seeking the approval of blind morons? maybe they trick you into thinking they are smart, cool, funny, sexy but at the end of the day they are just people, just insignifigant random assortments of atoms that began to make noises in a vast sea of infinity.

why should you wait for them to call you cool? Why do you need to have sex with numerous attractive people, make lots of money, become famous and seek the approval of blithering idiots to be cool. if you've ever taken a psychedlic or really just listen to the wisdom of the stars, you see how arbitrary and made up our cultural and social values really are. If that is considered and the labels they give you are just their own subjective meaningless labels, WHY NOT JUST DECLARE YOUSELF COOL RIGHT NOW? their is something that does hold meaning is how you feel, how you treat yourself. the labels you give yourself or the labels other give you are labels, but your the one who gives them power to build or destroy. the secret to this game that we have been forced to play, the game of society, we have been tricked to believe there are strict rules to this game. but you want to know what they dont want you to know? other than to love and treat each other with resepect THEIRE ARE NO FUCKING RULES, YOU CAN CHEAT THIS MISERABLE GAME.

who decides what clothes are cool, who decides what activitys are acceptable. Whether your doing something like going to a bar or watching a sporting event, or you do something more taboo like getting high or playing dungeons and dragons, its your happyness its your life, use the way you want to, all in all its the same happyness, get it in a way that makes sense to you. real freedom doesnt come from becoming financially independent or changing your religion, it comes from realizing what terrence mckenna has been saying is true that culture is not your friend, culture is a mass hallucination.

you can be jesus, you can be jim morrison, you can be james bond, audrey hephburn, gandalf, a prince or a princess, king or a queen, in your own minds eye. Now before you claim i am inflating the ego or advocating narcissism, im not. yes it is not good to be drunk with power, but being sober on helplessness is not a good thing either. IM just saying be a star, but dont outshine the other stars, be A center of attention not THE center of attention. being cool doesnt mean just appreciating your coolness but others as well. harmony will come and we appreciate each individual pattern, color, and hue of each star to create a massive collective tapestry. the haters and morons of the world will tell you that you cant contribute, your not good enough, your not good looking enough, your not cool enough, but you are if you say you are.

Some things I realized on 7g",308,54,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1ba7bw/i_am_a_creature_you_all_are_also_creatures_we_are/,"I have no idea how to describe what happened to me so I'll just start. 7 grams of mushrooms, I realized I forgot it. The thing we all know but don't talk about, always in the background, sometimes dreaded, feared, loved, cherished. I forgot what I am, and it hit with with an astonishment I also forgot could even exist. I looked at a leaf on a tree outside, saw the ""outline"" of it stay where it was, but saw the color green come off the leaf, morph around it in sort of a cartoon but extremely detailed way, then settle back on the leaf. I saw all the leaves on the tree doing the same thing, dancing with their colors to the pulse of whatever life blood was keeping them alive. This alone was reason enough for the whole trip in my mind, as it was unbelievably beautiful and meaningful in some way I can't accurately describe. About 3 hours in and after some of the most intense visuals I've ever had, I looked up and suddenly ""I'M A CREATURE! C-R-E-A-T-U-R-E??!? HOLY FUCK! What??! How could I have forgotten? How could I have gotten so used to it?"" I forgot what I am, forgot that I go to piss in a pot away from others because its not socially acceptable, that I have an appendage that swells and spits a weird clear mucus when stimulated by the opposite sex (a thing that also exists here), that I allow and willfully permit a 50 inch screen in my house (taken out of the ground, of course) that beams a ridiculous series of still images I confuse for motion with which I emotionally identify and connect. It was like the word ""TV"" had no meaning, no value that I didn't give it or assume it had. I also felt like I was the only one on the planet who knew, which I knew was also obviously a lie, but still I thought it worth mentioning. I was in the atrium of my building at the time of the ""creature"" realization, so I decided to walk downstairs to change the scenery. When I got to my room, I saw every object (chair, bed, whatever) not with its ""name/designation"" that I have attached to it, like I had done the previous thousand times I had walked in here. What I mean is, I came downstairs and looked at my piano, but it wasn't ""piano"" in my mind, it was ""wow look at that black gray and white square oblong object with different sets of plastic alternations and dials that allows me to sometimes make and communicate pleasant vibrations of air - that I've never seen before!"" And it was this feeling, intuition, ""descriptive/nonjudgmental/what is this"" voice that was applied to EVERY object in the room. Simple beer cans amazed me, chairs, and especially computers, for which I felt a deep suspicion. I couldn't understand this emotion, but it was somehow 'this can either be used to save or destroy us, and like it or not it will be used for one of them, just because of the fact that it exists'. I was scared by this thought, but found the feeling turn to a more cautionary tone after I thought about it longer. I can't remember why, I guess I got distracted or got a renewed hope in our chances. Anyway, I was in my room that I've lived in for the last year, and was suddenly shocked that I had never actually noticed what the hell was in here. I thought about how fake money was, how funny/sad it is that we make such a huge deal about it, etc., all the usual obvious stuff that people who share in this experience realize. I just, never expected it to be THIS obvious, and even yet now as I type this, still going on. I was deeply humbled about who and what I am last night, and definitely will be mulling this experience over for a long time. I don't know if I'll ever do shrooms again in this high of dose, I think this was just me trying to prove something stupid to myself. Anyway thanks for reading.

After my first day at CES being surrounded by all the screens and technology made me decide to just do it on the show floor. I wasnt very introspective, like i usually am when im tripping. I was just so captivated by all the technology that was around me. Seeing all these 4k/oled screens made feel like i was looking through a window instead of a screen. 

I was able to listen to music on speakers that cost about 100,000$ and i almost started crying haha. One of my best trips, hands down. Just thought i'd share my experience :)

Here are some tips:

Try re-organizing your room. If you've had posters up for a few years, now's the time to take them down, clear your mind and perspective from past experiences. If they need to be there they will go back up, but just give it a try.

Try a new job, if you feel belittled in your work environment, quit. I've done so many times and I'm aware of my situation and what job suits me best, even if you stay unemployed for a few months.

Stop smoking pot for a few days. You will come out of it at first with overwhelming thoughts of anxiety and depression, give it a few days, and these constant thoughts will begin to fix itself with positivity before you know it, your ego is a survival mechanism. So cry it out, and take a good days rest.  You'll feel great!

Be alone, there's nothing more satisfying than complete emptiness, people will tell you otherwise because they're afraid of true change themselves.  Sometimes, you don't even know what's bothering you until you spend a few days alone, even from your family. Go camping by yourself. Realize that you're alive on this earth and your possibilities are limitless.

It's OK to not have all the things in the world that you need, that's what makes you strive to work on your goals in the first place. Stop worrying about where money can get you. These are superficial materialistic needs for the most part anyways, you can do without most of them.

Reflect on your most intimate experiences, sex, drugs, adventures. Appreciate that you have a brain that has such great memories, let the negative ones come and go, and still remember that everything is going to be ok.

--------------

I write all this to you Psychonauts, the other day I was in a slump, my job for the early part of this summer wasn't working out as timed and things felt like they weren't going to pull through. I was depressed for 3 days actually. I had the place to myself the other night and was consuming red wine, (that I forgot how melancholy it makes me).  What I remembered, the next day, was at one point, I was crying on the floor curled into the fetal position. I think something overturned in me when that happened, I can't say what it was all about. But when I hit that sad, depressing low, I think my brain really went into repair mode and I've felt better then I have for months, cleaning up, getting my act together. I learned a great psychedelic lesson through an alcohol ingested comatose.  Sometimes it's the hardest lessons that stay with you as the most important ones. Take it day by day. Don't rush. Peace.

I was involved with the Stephen Gaskin Monday Night class (I attended SF state) - many people don't know that when he taught at S.F. State University the title of his class was 'North American White Witchcraft'. That's where I met people intimately involved in dealing Owsley acid. I ended up selling MJ, LSD and occasionally magic 'shrooms, and peyote (my exwife was 1/2 american indian, so her tribal friends would drop off bags full of peyote for free). Those were magical times indeed with 'miracles' happening all the time. We used to take LSD and go to concerts at the Fillmore, and then it became Winterland(maybe the other way around?). I was good friends with the manager of Winterland (who carried a gun) a real New York tough guy. I would take Acid and trip in GG park, just walking from Haight to the beach and back. One time I was given some Amaninta (sp?) mushrooms and when I got back at the end of the trip to his house he was surprised to see me. When I was leaving I head him yell to his wife 'it's ok, the mushrooms are safe...'. I used to take thousands of hits of lsd down to LA to sell, hitchhiking down highway 1 and back. I had a girlfriend in SF and one in LA, so I always had places to stay. There was a lot of hassle from straights and cops, and busts going on, but there were so many of us the cops were overwhelmed. We used to go to political protests and were very involved in counterculture.  I want to add that there were some tough times too, where I barely had food to eat.

We have people working their arses off under the illusion that they will retire in comfort but to then realise it is too late. They work for a government to tax their income so it can continue its control over the people that feed it. These people consider life somewhat of a competition between fellow men, where in actuality I know there is an alternative, mutually beneficial, standard of equality somewhere. 

Then we have the drugs that fuel this cycle. We have caffeine to keep people productive and alcohol and cigarettes to keep people distracted from the wool pulled over their eyes. Not to mention all the other distractions present in this picture; everything from prescription anti-depressants to reality T.V. However, any drug that does not benefit capitalism such as cannabis and psilocybin is largely frowned upon. 

I, like perhaps a lot of you, rest a lot of hope upon these psychedelic substances contributing to the paradigm shift that is required, yet I feel like a some kind of hippy-douche when I (perhaps naively) claim that psychedelics may be the answer. I hope the answer lies in a humble plant somewhere on the earth but in the back of my mind im weary of the elegant simplicity of that solution. It seems too good to be true and perhaps it is. In that same spot in my mind I comes the fear that there is no answer, that what I write here is meaningless because the machine will function just fine regardless of any resistance I throw at it. 

As an attentive reader, (or if you read the title) you might have concluded that all of this has me frustrated. Your conclusion would be correct. I'm frustrated because people are resistant to acknowledge the matter at all. Frustrated that when they do I can't offer the quick and simple fix they expect and frustrated that nothing I have said here is new. All I seem to be able to do is recycle other peoples contentions without contributing anything meaningful of my own.

1340566375.0,226,self.Psychonaut,vj9zz,"DMT: 8 Months, 40 Trips: Long List Of What I've Learned So Far...",261,35,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/vj9zz/dmt_8_months_40_trips_long_list_of_what_ive/,"Hello! I have been using DMT since about 8 months ago. I made it, so I have an ‘unlimited’ supply to test with and try variations, ways of smoking, and what I can and can’t do to break into hyperspace. This is obviously a throwaway account, but I do talk about it on my main account, just not to this extent.

I'm 33, an artist, have a professional adult job, a parent, etc. 

What I made from the tek I used, gives me DMT in a brown goo form (is this ‘jungle spice’? I’m still not sure after lots of reading) that obviously has lots of plant fats in it, but still works great. I would assume pure white DMT is even more amazing, and I look forward to trying it.  I don’t refine it or purify it, because I would end up with much less from my estimate.

What I use, seems to be a bit mellower than I would imagine the pure white stuff to be. I break through every time, as a seasoned psychedelics user (since 17), I would equate it to being more an ‘earthy’ vibe. The first pulls I did were the strongest, although the later ones have been very decent as well. Trust me though, I have been ‘there’. I have broken through about 40 times in 8 months. It has zero lasting effects other than a general mindset of how amazing your own mind is. After 20-30 minutes or so, you are back to complete normal, no ‘hangover’, tiredness, or weird feelings.

This has been my favorite thing I’ve tried. I’ve done most everything in the book in my younger years that doesn’t involve a needle. I haven’t tripped or rolled in about 10 years, but prior to that I spent 10 or so years tripping on paper, liquid, geltabs, mushrooms, rolling, and other club drugs, when I was in that scene. DMT works best from me because it’s short, to the point, profound, gives no effects that will be detrimental to my psyche, work, relationship, etc.

What I’ve learned So Far

Setting 1:

Very key. My favorite is sitting in the middle of my bed, cross legged. I have a tray to set the pipe on so it doesn’t burn me or anything else. Sitting up is amazing and then if I need / want to, I lie back on the pillows.

Setting 2:

I haven’t done it outside yet, but as an avid outdoors person, I can’t wait to try it. I live in a mountainous area, so any type of nature (other than desert) is available. I just am very paranoid about legal issues, so I’m just waiting for a good time and place where I won’t be disturbed by other people, etc.

Eyes open vs. eyes closed:

Up until recently, I have done it at night, with little to no light, many times closing my eyes. This is awesome and produces amazing visuals. A few times I left a candle burning in the distance, or used a star projector that puts thousands of dots dimly all over the room. Lately however, I got past my ‘fear’ of opening my eyes, and just did it in daylight on my bed, and this is amazing as well, just letting everything melt into fractals.

Pets:

I have a small furry dog, and he is calm and will just chill beside me. However, if you have dogs that bark or harass you, I’d leave them away from your area so you aren’t interrupted.

Timing:

Make sure you have nothing to do, nothing you are worrying about, and that nobody will be ‘stopping by’. I make sure my doors are all locked, and that my phone is on silent where I can’t see it. I don’t like being disturbed. It’s 15-20 minutes, but your family or friends stopping by and ringing your phone could be a bit jarring.

Ambient noise:

I live in a high traffic area, where you can hear dogs barking, sirens from the local firehouse, and cars, mopeds, etc., driving by. I hate that sound in general. I use a large air purifier that produces white noise, it mostly blocks all that out. I also use music and headphones.

Music:

Most people I’ve read about don’t like to listen to anything. I LOVE music and have specific preferences I’ve decided work best for me. My favorite thing to listen to is by a DJ / producer named Sasha, the album is Airdrawndagger. It’s amazing, and even though I have tried several other things, this is what I have listened to the most. The tracks flow and change perfectly, and it’s just my favorite. A few other things I like are very minimal ambient techno, such as Porter Ricks, or Plastikman / Richie Hawtin. Other things I have tried either are too slow, too fast, or too disorienting. I don’t like vocals, even processed ones (that I normally like) while I’m tripping, as if I hear voices, I want them to be from within. However, if you are a more spiritual person, Shpongle, Entheogenic, Bluetech, and several others could put you in that zone. I like that as well, but just not my very favorite.

Headphones / Music:

I use an iPod Touch, or a iPhone, etc. It has easy controls and I can hit them quickly if I need to change the volume or track. I have decent earbuds, but I have studio quality DJ headphones from Sony that have a much wider frequency response, including more bass. Some people might not like having larger headphones on, but I’ve used them all my life, so I don’t mind. These headphones block out EVERYTHING else, so be prepared not to hear ANYTHING if there is an emergency. I prefer to be in this world I facilitate, vs. just random outside sounds that might annoy or disorient me. A few times, the headphones and music were just TOO much, and I had to take them off, but I’d say I use them 95% of the time. Personal preference, you may not like it.

Smoking utensil:

I have tried 10 or so different methods, but the one that works the best for me is a clear pipe with a bubble at the end. With the clear pipe, I can see exactly what is in there, hit it with my lighter from below, and see the amount of smoke. This has worked the best for me, other methods haven’t worked so well and it’s annoying if you don’t get off as hard as you want, or are fumbling around with your utensil.

Lighters:

A butane windproof lighter works the best, and doesn’t char the bottom of the pipe. I keep two or three by me, because without fail, one will always fail, which can be confusing when you are between your first and second or third hit.

Smoking:

I have tried it with weed, and even though it’s very cool, it didn’t get me off like I wanted. It also seems to come in waves, as if the DMT and weed are taking turns fading in and out. While that is certainly cool, I have found it’s not what I want. I want the straight hit, right into me, ASAP. Make sure you hold it in as long as possible and breathe out from your nose. Try to get three hits in, in under a minute. If you’ve never tried it, it tastes plastic-ish, but I have grown to LOVE the taste and smell.

Smoking 2:

If you don’t get off (re: hyperspace), then don’t keep smoking to try and ‘chase the dragon’. With an unlimited supply, I have tried this to experiment, and it’s just not as good, and you are wasting it. If you have a limited supply, DEFINITELY wait at least 12 hours or so to try to get off again. It can be super frustrating I know, but respect that it didn’t work, it’s not the time to waste your supply. It’s just not worth the end result.

I think allan watts saying, ""once you get the message, hang up the phone,"" is really just a way of saying, ""once you see through the illusion, cultivate the understanding on your own (no phone, no crutch.)""

Otherwise you are just using psychedelics as a crutch to see clearly - a crutch that eventually disappears.

It was very emotional and charged and really spun the current story of weed in our culture in a positive and uplifting light.  Anyone else feel the same way?  I really can't believe this was on CNN... it definitely indicates an emergent trend in culture towards embracing medical marijuana

    Dream,
    Beyond dreams
    Beyond life

    Your
    
    Song
    Before sound,
    To be found
    Close your eyes
    And
    
    Rise,

    Endless thrill
    To the land
    Of
    
    Love

    Come alive

    Forever watching you and I
    
    You are the night
    You are the ocean
    You are the light behind a cloud
    You are the end and the beginning
    A world where time is not allowed
    
    There's no such thing as competition
    To find a way we lose control
    Remember, love's our only mission
    This is a journey of the soul
    
    The perfect song is framed with silence
    It speaks of places never seen
    Your home's a promise long forgotten,
    It is the birthplace of your dreams

1371489395.0,218,self.Psychonaut,1giyby,Upset about the way society is? I know you feel the same way I do. It's time to do something about our current state of affairs. I need your help. (Upvote for visibility),257,39,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1giyby/upset_about_the_way_society_is_i_know_you_feel/,"First of all, this is a brand new account I made specifically for this. 
Having seen so many posts recently about how upset we are about what society has become, it made me think, ""How have we allowed ourselves to become this? What can we do to alter the path society is currently on?"" 

We are faced with so much propaganda about how we're supposed to act, what we're supposed to say, wear, think, and do. Work hard, make money, save for your old age, retire, and die. This propaganda comes at us from every angle, everywhere we go in life. The media, government, our friends and families; our lives have been sold and commercialized. The truth is that the majority of us do not even realize we are being played. I for one am sick of it.

What can be done? I was thinking and thinking, and the answer appeared, so simple but so incredibly effective. What have they been doing to make us this way? Spreading propaganda. So then, what do we do? We spread our own propaganda. 

It will not be difficult, quite the contrary. It requires no picketing, no violence, nothing but the peaceful spreading of information. A post from earlier today gave me the idea: pamphlets. Pamphlets, note cards, posters, anything and everything to spread this idea of unity and expansion of self.

So now, I call on you, Psychonaut currently reading this, to help me. I know you've been struggling with what you can do to help just as I have. We can all be the change we would like to see in the world, but sometimes change needs a little help. We pass them out, leave a stack in the waiting rooms wherever we are, leave them on the seats of the bus, anything to make them visible.
Let's make this big! All over the country, and in others if our influence reaches that far.

&gt;Artsy redditors, I need a logo! A symbol that will embody all we stand for. Something simple, that could easily be.. ^^spraypainted ^^on ^^a ^^wall, or put in a pamphlet or notecard. Send me a digital version! 

&gt;We also need pamphlet designs! Make them simple, lighthearted, and powerful. Also leave space for the logo, let's say on the front page and bottom right of each page. We don't need to berate the reader, simply make them adopt a different view. 

Come on, friends. It begins with us! No change will come unless we stand up and make the effort.
This is The Initiative for Human Consciousness. Let's change the world.

**EDIT: I think propaganda was too harsh of a word, considering the definition reads ""Information, esp. of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.""
We will not be spreading misinformation. We will not be spreading lies, or defaming people or institutions, just simply spreading ideas and love.**

**EDIT2: The idea of all of this is not to have demonstrations, it is not to have public speakers and tell people how to change their lives, it is just to leave the information needed out, so people can come to the conclusion for themselves. People are more likely to change if they feel like it is something they themselves want. These handouts, left in conspicuous places around cities, will cause some (perhaps not many, but still some) to change. The idea is then for those people to influence others, and propagate the idea that way.**",,False,self,t5_2qplv,1371501627.0,,,True,t3_1giyby,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1giyby/upset_about_the_way_society_is_i_know_you_feel/,

I think focusing on the numbers is dangers and unproductive. Yes tripping is a very helpful tool but its more about quality than quantity. Its about how you handle the situation and what you take away. The same thing goes for sobriety. It can teach you just as much. Becareful no to make the mistake of thinking drugs have all the answers or are the only way. Ive seen to many of my friends either put off their problems because they think tripping is the only way to change themselves or overly indulge in psychedelics because they felt it was the only way to experience reality then ironically looking grips with reality.

So he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of illusion. Things are not explained by the past, they are explained by what happens Now.""
~Alan Watts


I began my spiritual journey about 2-3 years ago, and I must say that this is one of the absolute best quotes I have come across, aside from the array of perfect present time quotes in Eckhart Tolle's Power of Now. It is so simple...yet holds so true. I began meditation about 1 year ago and it allowed me to drop complete thought from my mind and completely place myself in the present moment. The key is dropping thought, that changes everything...it rids fear, it rids anxiousness, concern.. When you realize that the now is all you have, you go into every single situation focused strictly on the topic at hand, therefore you have the power to mold the outcome of it all... Blows my mind every time I think about it. Thanks for your time yall! 

PEACE and LOVE.

Fuck man. What have we done? Everything is based on money, money is based on absolutely nothing. But we fight and kill and go to war over it. 

We are expected to follow this path of life, where all we do is work to make more of this money that means nothing so we can fill our lives with these awful materialistic items that remove our humanity and turn us into lazy slaves of society. 

What was it like before? Before all the machines and the politics and the religion, the laws and the control. Was it anarchy? I'm sure it wasn't. Maybe that was the last time humans were truly happy. We had each other and we had a beautiful world that supplied us with what we need to survive. 
 
I want to get back to that world. A world where I'm not forced to follow this routine where my life is based around work and money. A world where I can actually spend my time living, and being happy. A world where the earth is respected and loved and cherished. Where beauty is everywhere, not just scattered about between all of the industrialized human infected areas. 

And what can I do to achieve this? Go out and live in the wild? Live off the land the best I can? I could. Sounds pretty inviting to me. Until I realize how lonely I would be. Because the world is not as it used to be. I would just be alone in a ""wild"" that only exists sparingly throughout this land. I could never truly get away from this world that I know.

So instead maybe I just with I was permanently tripping, so at least I could find beauty in the world I am in. So I could experience the excitement and joy I haven't felt since I was still an ignorant child that didn't understand. 

Maybe over time I could learn to perceive my own version of the world, where nature still rules. Maybe I could live completely in my mind. Create this world that I want so bad there. But... What is if that's where I am now, someone's attempt at something better that simply went awry itself. 

Anyways these are scattered thoughts. I'm just frustrated. Frustrated with humanity, and with my lack of understanding of the universe. Someday maybe I will find the answers I seek, maybe even the freedom I seek. But until then, I have the beautiful world of psychedelics to give me breaks from this. 


Would anyone want to join me out in nature? Maybe we could start our own society and regress humankind from the ugly world it has created.

As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.
Why were so many Americans treated by their government as though their lives were as disposable as paper facial tissues? Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their madeup tales.
And so on.
Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life. Every person would be exactly as important as any other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done.
If all writers would do that, then perhaps citizens not in the literary trades will understand that there is no order in the world around us, that we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead.

i realized that as humans we all pulse at different frequencies. sometime you meet people who seem completely opposite of you then you gradually realise you were more alike than you knew. that's like the lights alternating then syncing up again.

not all pulses sync up long enough to notice and some pulses remain at the same frequency while others vary from time to time.

this metaphor can be applied to life and everyone you meet. remember that not everyone operates on the same wave. you'll find an enemy in a best friend just as easy as you can find a best friend in an enemy. its all about timing.

so next time someone doesnt vibe right with you give it some time to see if maybe yall just needed to sync up. and when you do click with someone enjoy it while it lasts because it could just be a matter of time before you lose sync.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_194rc3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/194rc3/while_sitting_in_traffic_i_figured_out_life_xpost/,

“Admit it. You aren’t like them. You’re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people” as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others…”

________________________

To my friends and family.

I love you all dearly. I have decided to leave and go on a journey on foot. I will just be going with the flow, so no destinations are planned now. I have all the supplies I need and spare money for emergencies. This is a personal decision and is not related to anything any of you have said or done to me. I seek a life free of the bondage of money and work, to just live a simple road life. Times are changing and our human consciousness is evolving at a deeper level than some of you realize currently. Remember to always send your love out to the world and see things from an open non-judgemental perspective. Go with the flow and enjoy life. If you are stressed out at work on a consistent basis, then find a new passion. You don't need anything for happiness, you already have it. Friends and family are greater than cars and houses. I know some of you will miss me, but when I find the chances to use the internet I will indeed say ""Hi"" and check in. My top priority will be to find a consistent flow of walking and resting, I have camping gear, and military training, so I am not afraid of sleeping in the woods. I actually fear nothing at this point in my life, hence the wanderlust. Just wish me luck and love when you think about me, and I will do the same for you.

With love,

Jason.

For the Psychonauts out there:

I enjoyed the ride with you guys, and will most assuredly write about my journey when I have the opportunity. I love you all, and spent many a nights reading and posting about our adventurers inward. You all helped me wake up, and I think I returned the favor for many of you as well.

Think outside the box whenever you can, as it promotes healthy evolution of your consciousness. Spread love, not hate, and always during a dispute, step outside your bounds and see both perspectives as equal and non-judgemental. The ride only gets easier the more you flow with life and stop resisting. 

Peace!

I have so many angles and ideas of how to approach this but I suppose I'll start here. It is long so be warned, but honestly conducting this novel has been one of the only things that has settled my nerves to any degree. My credentials are experienced and my mindset is pure. Having the pleasure of being able to propagate the spiritual cleanse and liberation of Dimethyltryptaminetime time and time again with fellow Psychonauts- I am no stranger to the mystical qualities and legendary properties of this molecule. It's capabilities have never escaped me. 
I prompt you to approach this with an open mind. I know the skeptics will throw stones, but enjoy it for what it's worth. After all, you're all just projections of my mind so allow me to entertain you ;P 

**Background:** 
I'm a 20 year old Astronomy Physics major in a conservative part of Arizona. I've always been emotionally apt and logically aware. I know I'm a 'smart' individual, but I feel my intellect tends to demonstrate in a fashion much more commonly described as 'bright' or 'analytical.' Growing up, I was raised in a very conservative southern Arizona community right next to a military-industrial complex (Raytheon, Honeywell) so I commonly interacted with what I would refer to as... well... more ""close minded individuals""... These types of adults, their children and the interactions that accompanied unfortunately helped mold me into pathetically narrow minded individual who adhered to a single religion and idea of running the world. 

I began a non stop cannabis habit 3 years ago when I first came to college, spending the better part of my 16 hour days stoned. It was a breath of fresh air and allowed me to conceptualize things in a way I had never done before. It afforded a level of caring that someone like myself could benefit greatly from. Now it's sadly become much more of a filler in my day- but that's another struggle that I know a bounty of us wrestle with. Not to digress- I quickly began to find interest in other psyche altering substances as many of my idols in the space realm (local and removed) had made commentary about ""Experimenting with LSD in college"" or just laughing about the times they had on mushrooms with their best friends. Fast forward through the next two years and queue countless interactions with nBOME's, LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, Salvia, which in each capsule of interaction would offer a more liberalized and (I'll make this a verb) 'spiritualized' mindset as I returned to reality. I began to become aware of the universe, the connection of spirit that transcends the 3 binding dimensions we exist in, the concept that humanity... Most likely like yourself. Yes you, the one reading this. 

My friends have come to regard me as the fairly well versed, educated and informed on these matters. I've definitely taken it a little further than them as larger doses tend to excite me and the opportunity of understanding myself more intimately at every experience stimulates my desire. (I guess I'll preface this now to head off suspicion- If the tone of this narrative doesn't indicate a level of responsibility and seriousness, you can clear any suspsicion or notion from your mind that I'm being uncaring or irresponsible in my activities and dosage amounts).  I now meditate and I feel like hallucinating by myself offers more intense insight and wisdom than anyone or thing can offer. I, in a sense have become comfortably detached from reality. 
When I first started college I had made a connection with an individual who moved to challenge my way of thinking and would always play devils advocate for any positions I established. He was fairly well versed in the realm of the metaphysical by the time we had initially met so my pretty conversvative being found him slightly repulsive yet I would entertain his ideas as he would mine. Two years later I met up with him again to purchase some LSD, which ended up being 25i. After I alerted him of the experience he invited me over. We had a talk, he apologizes about the nBOME and says to me ""Two years ago when you first started coming over you really helped change me as an individual. Whether you realize it or not you were one of the only people that would take me seriously and actually listen to my ramblings or logically challenge my train of thought.... now allow me to change yours."" You can put two and two together- he eventaully offers me DMT. We burn sage, charge our DMT on crystals and meditate about it together. He sears into my mind that this is not something to be toyed with. It is a spiritual tool. It is a method of discovery. There is a metaphysical world and if I don't believe it I soon will. 

I trip.

Phenomenal.

Life changing.

""Words can't describe...""

Black... 

I whisper ""Why was I afraid...""

And after thousands of years of knowledge had been bestowed upon me I drop the gem

""I have to have children now""

I stand up. I stretch. I breath for the first time and look at the individuals who had done the ritual with me and giggle and say ""Holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy FUCK."" and the silence is broken as everyone laughs with me. ""How long?"" He responds ""5 minutes."" I instantly call my best friend 50 times. I call my other closest friend 50 times and tell them about everything I experienced ""SHAPES, DRAGONS, AN INDIAN WOMAN TELLING ME SOMETHING. My spiritual gunk melted away. I'm clean. I can't explain it."" and I prompt them furiously ""YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS. YOU ALL NEED TO TRY THIS."" I beg the individual who offered me the experience to alot me some to share with my friends. He tells me he doesn't have enough to give but when it's ready it will find me. This whole metaphyiscal way of speaking of ""It will find you"" and ""Vibes"" and ""Hue"" never made sense, but now it rang more true than ever. 

I eventually ferry my two closest friends to his place of residence and he offers them the experience. The both have very similar trips where their spirual ickyness melts away and they overcome huge obstacles in their cosmic existence. In our college careers we are all at a point where we are depressed, confused or just trudgling along and we felt like this helped cure a huge part of those emotions. We all decide that our whole friend group needs to try it and we all throw in for a gram. Long story short- it finds us and I systematically go down my group of 10 CLOSEST friends and people in my life that I know will benefit from this. Who I can influence for the rest of their lives. I see my closest friends crying on my shoulder thanking me for helping them fight off their depression. I see my girlfriend fight with her insecurities and bloom into a much more full and secure person. I whitness magic flow through the veins of my circle. I have not tripped since my first DMT breakthrough and I was planning on waiting till everyone had tripped to do my full real 'machine elves balls to the walls' trip.

1358360160.0,171,self.Psychonaut,16p39n,Is this the point of psychedelics and possibly meditation,186,15,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/16p39n/is_this_the_point_of_psychedelics_and_possibly/,"I recently watched a video about no-fap (no porn), [**here**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU). In this video, he talked about the concept of a fish asking ""what the heck is water?"". The idea being, if you are surrounded and submerged in something from your very birth, you may never know that there is anything there at all. One day a bubble escapes from the ocean floor, and the fish says, ""what the heck is going on?"". The bubbles are clues.

This made me draw a parallel to psychedelics.  We go through our whole lives from birth, submerged in this reality. We know nothing else, and fall in love with our world, getting very attached to it. Once in a while, a bubble comes up and we ignore it. Some people, decide they want to know more, so they meditate. This causes lots of bubbles to come up, and eventually a better understanding of what reality is. 

Psychedelia don't cause bubbles, they cause level 5 hurricanes. Billions of bubbles, so many, you realize deeply about the reality you are really submerged in, and it's way crazier than the still calm waters that we experience every day.

Just my thoughts :-)

As many of us understand, Zen enlightenment is the rupture that occurs after meditative practice when samadhi merges with ordinary reality and ruptures into one thing, transcending the ego, and integrating the ego into beyondness.  This one thing isn't just the experience of unity, and transformative awareness, it is a complete ease moving back and forth, as needed, between the realms of oneness and ordinariness.  

Anybody who meditates regularly eventually experiences what happens during a drug trip, but they don't claim to be enlightened.  In fact, in Zen, all of the trippy things that happen, the oneness, the visuals,  everything... is considered another thing to doubt, another thing to push beyond.  You force yourself on beyond these illusions.  The drug experience, no matter how powerful it feels, is also illusion and itself is a powerful trap  reinforcing the ego, producing dangerous illusions of wisdom and self-greatness.  

Enlightenment is not the perma-trip.  It is a kind of ease and a kind of wisdom that comes from familiarity with all aspects of the transcendental experience combined with the absolute integration of the ego into the beyond and into the ordinary.  

I'm writing this because I'm feeling concerned about some of the illusory thinking going on here; it's just my $.02 and it's to help.  FWIW, I've never known a acidhead that I thought was enlightened; in fact most of the ones I've met are either extremely cool and ordinary, or extremely megalomaniacal.  They've got a lot of cool theories and stories, but I've never known one, who didn't get involved with meditation too, that I thought was accomplished in the sense that they had become really compassionate, profound persons.  As a Zen student, I've met several folks, within that community, who I thought had witnessed a taste.  

YMMV... downvote as needed to contain your reality.  Be careful out there, megalomania is the trap.    ",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_o5784,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o5784/enlightenment_cannot_come_from_drugs/,

I thought you might enjoy this story. I saw a post over on r/drugs that reminded me about a time I had sex while on LSD. I wrote this while making my trip report on the comedown. It was my first time on LSD, so you'll understand that I didn't really have a good vocabulary to describe everything that happened. 

(Also,to give you a heads up since this is reddit, I'm female.)

&gt; Fucking on LSD, was like fucking with metaphors. Rolling in parables. /r/drugs

I was unsure whether I really wanted to have sex or not, I couldn't tell. I was still amazed by this new amazing universe that had sprung up from an extra dimension inside my brain. We had a moment, ""You want to have sex?"". ""I'm not sure, you?"". ""Well, let's try"". I'm glad we did. At the start it was a little weird, but sex with this guy always feels weird, his body is not familiar. He is always trying to please me, and I wonder if I am able to please him. We start to kiss, it is going ok so far, I not especially turned on, but I get into it. We take our clothes off, leaving our underwear on - I know still modesty at this stage! We have been sleeping together for a couple of months now. He fingers me almost to the point of orgasm. It is beautiful, his body close to mine, the sound of his breath. All the feelings, I don't just feel my body, I feel the entire room around me. We take off our underwear- we are naked and primal, as we were born. His chest is hard and smooth, he has curly chest hair that feels good to run my fingers through. His beard has been growing, he is tanned and has long unkempt hair. He is beautiful. He is my proto-man, is that the right word? The first man. We are like Adam and Eve. We use our hands on each other. He brings me to an orgasm? I'm can't tell if it is the LSD peaking or an orgasm or both, but it felt good. We pause in each others arms, I hug him saying how amazing that felt, we stroke each other. 

There's a break while we lie there, I am enjoying how his body feels. It is blissful just to touch his skin, run my fingers through his hair. He says that it is ok to keep on going, that there is more. He finds a condom. I am unsure if I will be able to keep going to actual sex. But it is ok, he is an amazing lover, he knows how to touch that special spot. It feels good just to fuck, to have that feeling inside, to know that he is creating it, and experience my thoughts and feelings at the same time. I dig my hands into his chest hair and I am a fox running through the forest at night. Moonlight on red fur. Slipping through the trees, everything flowing, hair in the wind, long grass in the dew, stars circling overhead. 
I am closing to coming and I am a waterfall, raging water flowing over the edge, erupting as it hit the bottom. I was an offering to the Gods, prasad, an opened coconut. An constant stream of water flowing over the brim of the coconut. All these things are the thoughts from my body. All the while pink floyd is playing, psychedelic music. 

Eventually I am exhausted from fucking, I am moving slowly in and out breathing my sighs into his ear. I want our love to be gentle, I want to be close to him. Even now I feel there is something between us. We start to move together again, tight and close. Faster until he peaks. I smile and hug him, pleased. We lay side by side, enjoying the afterglow.

----------

I really had underestimated the emotional power of MDMA. Before, I've always gotten a kind of synthetic, cynical feeling, like I knew the happiness had no reason, it was just a chemical reaction. This time I did it with some old and new friends and it was a beautiful experience. It is definitely possible to work through emotional pain with this stuff. I've been thinking a lot about my self-enforced celibacy. I haven't slept with anyone since the guy in the story and I went our separate ways about six months ago. I rationalised my celibacy at the beginning by saying I needed time and space to integrate all the things I experienced while travelling and with psychedelics. I feel, even still, like I would be content if I never slept with another guy again. Whole new parts of life have opened up to me, and I feel like there is so much to learn. I guess, to be blunt, my passion for psychedelics is greater than my desire to get laid.

This is true, but it's not really the whole story. This guy was very important to me. He introduced me to the world of psychedelics, we travelled all around together, spent countless nights smoking joints listening to music, went to festivals and parties all over, saw sunrises and sunsets on mountains, beaches and deserts. We had some very powerful experiences together, with and without drugs. Since I met him, I had to literally rewrite my entire conception of reality. That will have a profound effect on a person. After this weekend I left wondering if I will always feel this, or if eventually my feelings for him will fade. Whatever happens, I am glad of the choices I have made.

&gt;Avoid junk food &amp; alcohol (strictly limit it for social occasions/celebration times)

&gt;Eat plenty of fruit &amp; salad (your digestive system will love you for it!)

&gt;Fast from food for at least 1-5 days every month (it can be tough, but you'll feel great after 2-3 days- trust me!

&gt;Meditate 10-30 minutes a day (once you make it a habit, you'll never want to start or finish a day without it!)

&gt;Work out (sweat it out for 20-30 minutes a day- you'll feel great)

&gt;Don't smoke weed *everyday* (dreams are important and so is clarity of thought)

&gt;Take 6-9 month breaks between mushrooms, lsd, mdma etc

&gt;Avoid reading/watching the news (it's full of fear and pessimism)


**Shifftz**
&gt;Practice yoga, chant mantras, balance your chakras in general!
Practice creative activities (music, dance, art, whatever)
Interact with and show love to other people

**Berneri**
&gt;Sex. The act in of itself and the pre and post coital activity. That's the most important one I can think of at the moment. Also, reading and writing.

**Jesus_Chris**
&gt;Enjoy the outdoors environment! Watching the stars at night, and being in nature in general can be a very inspirational experience.

**DBM9000**
&gt;Don't sleep too much or too little, and do your best to recall and explore your dreams. Helps you become more familiar with how your brain constructs symbols.

**vaderbaby**
&gt;Practice being aware of what you are unconsciously thinking and seeing with out trying to zone in on them. focus on what you are doing, and try to not get distracted by intriguing energies around you. still be consciously aware of their location, distance from you, what they are doing, and why. exhale to pass energy, inhale to absorb the positive or negative energy around you.

**bluesmojo**
&gt;Read. Reading can be incredibly beneficial for your focus and concentration. I almost look at it like a form of meditation now; transforming my TV time into reading time has done wonders for my ability to get work done, do creative stuff, etc.

**UlyssesOntusado**
&gt;Everyday, write down 10 things for which you are grateful.

**sleadbetterz**
&gt;Every day I try and lessen my bad habits like judging people too quickly / getting angry or frustrated about things / general laziness. It's hard work but rewarding more than anything else!

**Synthetic**
&gt;Drum and dance like no-one is watching. I've had ""bad days"" transformed into ""best-day-ever""s after dancing out the bullshit.
Focus on your breath, especially when you notice that your vibrations are getting low and you're starting to ""lose your shit"". Really helps to bring you back to center quickly, as well as helps you figure out whats going on thats causing those emotional responses in the first place.
Edit: I've also found that smoking a pipe has been helping me to raise my general vibrations. Really helps to keep a clear mind and keep my focus in the moment. Just puttin that out there.
REedit: Hugs. Hug someone at least once a day. 8 hugs a day minimum is ideal, honestly, but one hug a day doesn't hurt.

**4dseeall**
&gt;Be honest. Play fair. Do good. Act whatever you want to be.

**FrequenStephen**
&gt;Music, let it play through you.

**Techno_Shaman**
&gt;Here's a small one that may or may not fit. I put tape or otherwise remove most of the lights in my room. For example: the light on the front of a PC. The darkness helps me sleep soundly and the absense of light is good for a natural rythem.

**FutureDaze**
&gt;Meditation. Going outside. Qigong or yoga. Pranayama. Expression - either writing, art, music, etc. Forming good community. Bodily contact - anything from sex to massages and hugging. Working towards autonomy. Doing public service/volunteering. Spreading positive energy and watching the ripples. Good diet (I, myself prefer a Daoist diet which is mostly local, seasonal vegetarian but sometimes eat fish). Hobbies (lately I've been getting into studying mythology and learning about foraging).

**gunthert**
&gt;Pick up any trash you see on the ground. We ourselves are the earth, we should treat the land with respect. Also being nice to each other to spread joy and happiness.

**nicholau5**
&gt;Sunbathing ;)

**SubjectivPerspectiv**
&gt;MUSIC! play music and getting involved with it, not just listening to it (although thats still awesome)

**CapnScumbone**
&gt;Be kind. How was this overlooked? Compassion is everything.

**_defunk**
&gt;obviously always try to be learning new things, go outside your boundaries.
also teach! teaching is such a great way to reinforce and learn more yourself as well as the fact that it spreads knowledge!

**mauielauie**
&gt;Enjoy the beauty of greenery/ plants as you walk about every day.

**Chispy**
&gt;Browse /r/futurology. It gets you thinking about the future of humanity. Improves your outlook on life and gets you excited about your future. Socialize and discuss with other people about our possible futures... The possibilities really are endless.

**the_mushroom_speaks**
&gt;Singing in the Shower... singing at all, for that matter!

**chiops**
&gt;Love. Love love. Love love love. Love love love love love. Love, my love.
It gets you high, It elevates, It slides the scale, It's the All and the Everything and let It flow, like a current. Open It, like a box. Release It, like the hiss of a noble gas essential. Love them all, for what they are. Love yourself, for all You are. Love the Me, Love the You, Love the Us, Love the All, Love those who do not Love.
It's funny you mention dreaming with marijuana, when I quit I started dreaming again, when I did it daily I didn't dream at all. I find I prefer it this way. Not to say it hasn't it's uses, but.
Practice feeling vibrations. Practice invoking vibrations. You are the captain of a vehicle of consciousness, vibrating in a place constructed to distract you from this knowledge for your own growth. The mind clamors. Quiet it, and Love, and Know, and shift phases to absorb things Unreal.
And never forget, Love.

**DalvaMozzerX**
&gt;In = Out
the quality of the love you give will be the love you can recieve, the quality of the food you put in will match the quality of the benefits you see, the more time spent studying, the better grades you will get, etc.
seems simple, but makes life feel more deliberate, DO THINGS WITH PURPOSE! EVERYTHING HAS A CONSEQUENCE!

**magic_city_man**
&gt;Do something which excites you, but is illogically frightening, like saying hello to random people on the street, or making minor positive based conversation with strangers.


**afourthfool**
&gt;Sabbaticals are glorious and genius however they are rationed. That said:
1 life absorbed per day, usually through some walking, some hula hooping in the park, some reading on a public bench, and some kind of quirky realization someone was trying to use as a conversation lighter next to me at the bus stop.
1,000 words typed a weekday
2 pages (~1000) written a weekend
1 night of hallucinogenics experienced a season
I stand all the time. Sitting feels so sacred to me. I look forward to sitting at meals. When i hike, i usually am collecting water when i'm sitting. Sitting is so wonderful.

**D4rv1d**
&gt;Make your everyday chores a time where you let go of thoughts and focus on the task. Make dinner, do dishes, fold laundry mindfully and you will find that your thoughts are clearer and more relaxed afterword.

**hs0o**
&gt;*Fast from food for at least 1-5 days every month (it can be tough, but you'll feel great after 2-3 days- trust me!*

&gt;Not if you're BMI is perfect and you have a fast metabolism :/
But anyway, waking up with the sun to take acid is awesome.

**workerbeee**
&gt;Juicing! It feels wonderful. Barley grass, celery, carrots, beets, kale, spinach, ginger, broccoli. Tons of nutrients I would normally never consume.

**skinjamin**
&gt;Make a list or think about all the positives in your life. Sometimes it's easy to get bogged down with the bad, so take a moment to focus on the good.

**Empty**
&gt;Staying present. It doesn't matter what you do. It could be music, sex, video games, talking to friends, etc., anything that brings you into the present moment. Meditation is a great way to cultivate this skill so you can be present all the time, especially during the dull times.


**buckminsterchiller**
&gt;Find an artistic medium and then do it places where its socially unacceptable.

**buckminsterchiller**
&gt;Visualize scenarios and then follow through with them, for example: At work, you could visualize going home and listening to a specific song, while smoking a bowl with a certain lighter, in a specific room with the lights dimmed a certain way with a particular incense...etc, and then try to add stuff into your visualizations to see if they manifest later.


**sgguitar88**
&gt;I really can't understand people who think it's a good idea not to pay attention to what's going on around the world. If you really want to raise your vibrations, you need to be bold and come to terms with it. The world will be a much better place if every psychonaut is extremely conscious, world-wise. Just be a critical thinker and don't get sucked into the narcissism that media tends to produce.


**MavrichChachkie**
&gt;Loving this thread guys. It reminds me of a list I call ""how to get out of a funk"" -Going over old journal entries. You can see how far you've come along. You might be able to see how much the questions you ask have evolved. -Taking a shower -Play music -Drink your favorite tea -Take your vitamins -Meditation or prayer


**ShaolinShade**
&gt;Do something cool for someone else. Seeing someone else happy because of you is one of the most satisfying things in the world
Side note: I love you guys. Reading through these comments just made me feel enlightened and happy

**permanomad**
&gt;Getting lost in conversation and laughing. Practising and teaching yoga. Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms.

**zgrocks9**
&gt;One thing I really enjoy doing is cleaning. When, for whatever reason it may be, I feel down, out of the loop, or just generally weird, I will clean up my apartment. It feels great to be focusing on one task rather than the thoughts going through your mind, and afterwards, everything seems to work its way out. I forget about whatever was stressing me for no reason, and I come up with ways to solve whatever problems I may have at the time.

**mongo_lloyd**
&gt;Standing in front of a fat subwoofer will probably give you all the vibrations you need

**HrToll**

So me and a few buddies smoked a bowl then left for the concert, it was sick. The shooms started kicking in pretty hard and all I could watch was the hulla hoopers dancing away to the music without a care in the world and having the time of their lives. It made me appreciate the moment for I usually forget to take the time to just embrace the day and live in the present. The rest of the day was filled with more smoking, some longboarding, which was also pretty crazy haha, volleyball, basketball, and some hookah at the end of the night to finish it off.

In my month or so here it has been wonderful to connect and share with like minds as we explore the frontier together, but honestly, the posts that seem to be demanding I ""do it this way"" or ""don't do it this way"", are a real turn-off. Maybe it is my fundamentally contrarian nature, but that has served me well so far, and I tend to follow it.  
  
We are all cowboys and mavericks. We are all playing with fire. We are all learning. Everything that I have learned in my journey has led me to believe that play is my avenue. It makes me no less spiritual or enlightened than someone who chooses to meditate and focus on set and setting to the minute degree.  
  
Some of us like to be careful. Some of us like to go fast and run into things. You will never shape me into the way your soul works, and your advice would be much better accepted if you wrapped it in a relaying of your own experiences, and not broadcast it to me like a PSA or parental mandate. If I am alone in this feeling, I apologize. Likewise, if my understanding of /r/psychonaut was flawed and this is a subreddit dedicated to a rules based, structured approach to exploration, I will look for one that better suits my particular style.

We live in an age when the concept of being a 'leader' is skewed by the culture and media into being a caricature of the alpha male; the dominant player, the winner, the one who will breed with the best and succeed through brute force, commanding the majority of the resources. Do we really need more of those people?

I understand where several of you are coming from with this but I think the language is far more divisive than we even realise. I think a world where people are empowered and willing to cooperate under certain types of supervision is fantastic, but I think using the phrase 'become the leader' unwittingly lends credence to the same vision that a male-dominated ego-centric culture would want us to pursue, where it sends us as participants down yet another spiral into competition for resources and short-term gratifications of our egos. The more we compete the less we cooperate, making us easier to control for those higher up the chain.

Sometimes we don't even realize the language is having that effect on us. We shouldn't send the wrong message that can easily be confused.

------------------------------------

Hello my friends. I've seen a lot of posts lately about how many of you are finding it perplexity difficult to mesh all of the realizations, changes, and growth you have gained with the plight of living in 'modern society'. I have been struggling with this as well from the beginning of my expansion and growth. My very first shroom trip led me to want to run off to a cabin in the woods and forgo this whole charade and just hang out by a river and listen to music. I know how you feel, I've been right there with you, but I have good news for you. I finally have come to a place where I feel confident in saying that I have a solution. 

We know we operate from ideologies staunchly opposite from the mainstream. We are finding it frivolous to interact with our fellow 'humans' who are caught up in the charade game and illusions of the society we are equally reserved from playing any part in. We feel trapped like cattle in a system designed to turn us into consumers; destined to slave at some job to earn a pittance barely sufficient to supply our vices which wash away the dissonance of being part of such a system. We long for something greater, something fulfilling, and something wholesome which satisfies our souls instead of the petty desires of lower levels of consciousness. We feel called to this changed way of living, but we cannot see it! We do not know where the path to it is. Surely we would leap and shout with joy if there was but a way, if there was some ship in the harbor we could sail away on to a new place where all live in accordance with the tugging and demanding call of a higher way of taking part in our shared existence. You know what I am talking about, because I know this is what you have been talking about.

First of let me begin by reminding you that you are not trapped. You are not weak. You are not helpless. You are not alone. WE are not alone. We are not clutched by a fate we cannot control. We are not subdued by the society which  attempts to unless we allow it. Do not allow it. All moments of the evernow are opportunities for you to take charge and guide yourself and your life towards the calling change we are all starving for.

Society is a dieing behemoth. It's treatise and values and desires have been lifted to the place of a godhead, but that god is dead. This society that exalts money and things and the individual to a place all mighty is following a vacant corpse to its doom. We see this, we know this. The aggressive and dominating nature of this infected beast spread itself into the furthest reaches of our world. McDonalds in the third world, African villagers lusting for AirJordans, foreign peoples no less than slaves to feed the gluttonous mouth of the greedy world. It sickens us to our core, but we cannot escape it or hide from it.

We cannot change this behemoth, because it is dead and dying; rigor mortis has set in. In its failure and death, dysfunction, malfunction, and nonfunction are its way of operation. The channels of change have stopped themselves up for without rigid adherence to 'tradition' and the code of how it has been done, the system would collapse and the dying body would shatter to pieces. Behind their delusions they cling to so desperately their system slowly collapses upon their heads. We see this with open eyes, but they still feel its truth tugging at their cores. They are afraid.

We do not need to be afraid. 

We do not need to struggle in fear to revive and reform the vile beast, because it's time has already passed. We do not need to find a way to be part of the dying monster. We can become the new growth instead.

We need to create our own microsocieties where we already. A new life within the dying old. Small and intimate, but such is the birth of any new thing.

We are a dispersed community. We should change that. Not in some mass exodus to some cultish compound or revolting new state, there is no need for such extremes. We simply need to begin closing the gaps that separate us. This forum is a wonderful tool to unite our ideas and experiences, but it does not UNITE us. We feel separated and disparaged because WE ARE. Some of us are lucky to have friends who have grown with us and enjoy their microcosm amidst an non-understanding world, but others are not so lucky. We do not have brothers in arms or an understanding family of fellow psychonauts to support each other. This is what we desperately need.

All life began from a single cell, so do not be reserved from starting at the smallest level. We need reach out and connect with each other in real life, and make each other part of our real lives. This is a touchy subject because of the illegal nature of many of our substances, but I am not talking about doing drugs together. I am talking about LIVING together. Instead of simply having cooperative collaboration abstractly with our ideas, we need to collaborate our LIVES. We are being of immense strength, intelligence, creativity, and love, but that is on our OWN. Imagine what we can achieve united. Even with simply one, single comrade, would your efforts to help the other not expound the good you could manifest in this world?

We are used to our solitary introspection in our lonely corners under the influence of a personal dose of some drug to reveal our personal stumbling blocks, but the deepest recesses of these journeys unveils that we are all united together, but we come back and try and force ourselves back into trying to forge through the absurdity of our lives by ourselves, cut off from our fellow seekers and brothers and sisters in love. Why?! Why do we listen when the world tells us we are alone? LOOK AT THIS SUBREDDIT. We are not alone. We are merely separated.

Stop trying to force yourself back into the old, and start building the new for yourself. 

Find psychonauts near you, become friends, confidants, and cooperate in each other lives. Any form of this is something I think is absolutely vital for us. We lack it and we feel that lack intensely. Reach out and seek each other. Unite and grow together. Work with each other to be the change we desire from ourselves and those around us.

Personally I want to live with you guys. I want to be in a shared house of psychonauts. [I made this post seven months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/kuux4/i_have_this_burning_idea_in_me_i_cant_seem_to/) and I unfortunately was caught up in personal turmoil and change since then and have not made any progress towards this, but I still feel it calling me. I want a place where we are in tune with each other and our growth and creation resonate and strengthen each other. Not roommates, not housemates, but lifemates. Taking part in each others lives, creating together, learning together, reaching out and changing the world together. I want to paint with you, sing with you, talk with you, argue with you, clean house with you, build things with you, volunteer in the neighbor hood with you. I want the love and goodness we build for ourselves to shine out from us like a beacon to others and make them seethe with envy over what we have created in our lives and come begging us for our secrets. Which we share gladly.

By ourselves we are strong. We are beacons of universal love. We are lights in the dark. We are thinking universe. We are vaults of truth and understanding. We are portals of creation. We are fountains of the infinite into the limited. But this is what we are separated.

Together we resonate. Together we exponentialize. Two creeks become a stream. Two streams become a river. The river cuts threw mountains and united we become the sea. If we join together, even in the smallest of ways, the power we have cannot help but be increased. Together we become light that repels the darkness. We become torrents of creation and beauty upon the world. We become healing fires which fuel our growth and expansion. Together we will sharpen each other and feed our own system of life and become an edge so sharp that we pierce through our barriers in an ever increasing maelstrom pushing forward to ways of life we never dreamed of. 

This is the calling I hear and feel. This is what I want my life to become. I live in Portland, Oregon and if this call resonates with you, join me. If you are elsewhere, start your own. Reach out, connect, and unite.

1331753504.0,145,self.Psychonaut,qwlln,Last night was my first experience with psychedelics ever.  I did a gram of Iboga.  Nothing could have prepared me for it.,151,6,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/qwlln/last_night_was_my_first_experience_with/,"For many of you, I'm sure much of this will sound familiar.  I took the medecine, all at one time.  I'm not sure this was the best idea, as then instructions said to take 200mg and the rest an hour later.  I'm an idiot and I didn't know how to measure that much out of the tiny packet that I had, so I mixed it all up with yogurt and gulped it down.

The change crept up slowly, but it was on me all at once.  First there was a buzzing sound, electric and insectile like the cicadas in the trees.  I was afraid, but I knew the forces were in motion, and there was nothing I could do to turn back.  Poor Crowley.  Then I began to notice that every thing I said or heard was echoing at least three times.  About an hour in, my sitter came in.  He had no idea what to expect from this.  It was the first time either of us had experienced anything like it.  After I came down I asked him what it was like to watch me.  He said when first came in it was like walking in on an exorcism.

There were three expressions of entities that I dealt with primarily.  The first was what I will call the Phantasm.  The Phantasm was glimmering blob of amorphous energy, sort of pinkish-purple, and it looked as if a coin would if it were spinning inside a gyroscope.  The Phantasm wanted to show me wonderful visions and illusions.  It wanted me to watch what it was doing and what it was trying to form.  My sitter had to keep telling me to breath because I would become so focus on trying to make out what it was turning into I would hold my breath, and then suddenly remember I had to come back and I had to breath.  Eventually I realized the Phantasm was just trying to distract me, and I said something to the effect of ""I want to see the real stuff.""

That's when the Mother and the Father came in.  They were both black.  The father was dressed in what one might think of as traditional tribesman garb, with black and gold robes and a staff.  He was bald on top with a ring of white hair around the sides of the head and full white beard.  He chewed me the fuck out from start to finish.  I got a big long list, rapid fire, of all the stupid shit that I've done and continue to do.  Everything he said was done to break down my stupidity for me so I could understand it like the dummy I was.  And yet, I could not argue with it.  I had to accept it, because I knew coming from him it was true.  He said I had come knocking to hear what he had to say and he was going to tell me.

While the Father was tearing down everything that was wrong with me, the Mother was encouraging everything that could be better about me.  They were balancing each other.  They both spoke so fast, and so vibrantly.  There was energy in everything they said, energy that could not be denied or refused.  It was overwhelming.  It was good at the same.  It was terrifying.  But they were the most loving things about this experience.  The thing that sticks with me the most from this trip, is when the Father says to me, ""Are you still afraid to die?  Because this is what it's going to be like.""  His tone was as if he was saying ""wake the fuck up, you dummy.""  Like he couldn't believe somebody could be as stupid as I was and not realize it.  It was not demeaning at all.  It was very comical.

What we think of as our everyday world was inverted.  The ""real"" world was like a dream, only solid for the first moment that you looked at it, and soon the Other world bled into it.  I had to keep looking at different things to keep my sense of being grounded, because staring at one thing for too long pulled me back in to the Other.  At one point I had to ask my sitter to put his hand on me so that I could know that I was still here.

I asked the Mother and the Father some questions about what to do about a few personal situations in my life: an old love I've been waiting for, my father who I haven't seen in years.  I had to let go of the love, and seek out my father.  I have to change my habits, all my improper unhealthy little ways of living.  And the Mother chimed in ""And tell your mother that you love her more often.""  It was her little moment of playing bad cop, showing that there is yin in the yang and the yang in the yin.

And after that harrowing experience came the throwing up for 6 hours, interspersed with dialogues of how amazing it felt to come back from that experience alive, and how stupid I had been for so long.  The first words I remember saying lucidly were ""Spiritual Boot Camp.""  Sometimes in life, we remember something stupid we did when we were young.  Maybe we said something careless, or hurt someone's feelings.  And we still get embarrassed about it even though it was years ago.  Everything about my life before Iboga felt like that after I was done.  Now I'm scared I won't be able to make the changes that I know I need to, to fulfill the demands that they made of me.  But I'm going to devote myself to them.  And if I fail, at least I will have tried.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,True,,,True,t3_qwlln,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/qwlln/last_night_was_my_first_experience_with/,

Here are a few quotes to give a glimpse of the depth.,159,18,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1gr68b/reading_dune_by_frank_hurbert_has_been_very/,"There shouldn't be spoilers if you do want to read it.  Which I would implore anyone that enjoys deep thinking and has a good imagination to try. Frank Herbert was definitely a psychonaut!

* The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.

* Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.

*Do you wrestle with dreams?*

*Do you contend with shadows?*

*Do you move in a kind of sleep?*

*Time has slipped away.*

*Your life is stolen.*

*You tarried with trifles.*

*Victim of your folly.*

* Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.


* When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong – faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it’s too late.

* If you need something to worship, then worship life — all life, every last crawling bit of it! We're all in this beauty together!

* The flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not . . . yet, I occurred.

* The Universe is God's. It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even the self-aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness.

* Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and predator alike, by all who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past. Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-perpetuating upon itself — a barbarous form of incest.

Realizing that Aldous [Huxley] might not survive the day, Laura [Huxley's wife] sent a telegram to his son, Matthew, urging him to come at once. At ten in the morning, an almost inaudible Aldous asked for paper and scribbled ""If I go"" and then some directions about his will. It was his first admission that he might die ...
Around noon he asked for a pad of paper and scribbled
LSD-try it
intermuscular
100mm
In a letter circulated to Aldous's friends, Laura Huxley described what followed: 'You know very well the uneasiness in the medical mind about this drug. But no 'authority', not even an army of authorities, could have stopped me then. I went into Aldous's room with the vial of LSD and prepared a syringe. The doctor asked me if I wanted him to give the shot- maybe because he saw that my hands were trembling. His asking me that made me conscious of my hands, and I said, 'No, I must do this.'
An hour later she gave Huxley a second 100mm. Then she began to talk, bending close to his ear, whispering, 'light and free you let go, darling; forward and up. You are going forward and up; you are going toward the light. Willingly and consciously you are going, willingly and consciously, and you are doing this beautifully — you are going toward the light — you are going toward a greater love ... You are going toward Maria's [Huxley's first wife, who had died many years earlier] love with my love. You are going toward a greater love than you have ever known. You are going toward the best, the greatest love, and it is easy, it is so easy, and you are doing it so beautifully.'
All struggle ceased. The breathing became slower and slower and slower until, 'like a piece of music just finishing so gently in sempre piu piano, dolcamente,' at twenty past five in the afternoon, Aldous Huxley died.

1367307006.0,140,self.Psychonaut,1deczl,PSA: Using psychedelics without having a daily meditation practice in place is potentially dangerous. Please read!,221,81,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1deczl/psa_using_psychedelics_without_having_a_daily/,"Whenever you have a mystical/transcendent experience while tripping where you gain valuable insight and new perspectives, I've found that these benefits can quickly turn into systems of belief that are completely driven by thought rather than truthful felt reality.  While these thoughts can be great pointers along the path, attachment to these thoughts can lead to massive amounts of confusion, discomfort, and resistance to daily life, similar to how any other rigid belief system will restrict your ability to live freely.

So, learn to be mindful.  Begin meditating - insight meditation in particular.  A good beginner's guide can be found here  www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html

When you do this, you'll see that even though you may have these super awesome memories of great times while tripping, and you may ""know"" certain secrets of the universe, the *actual reality* is often that you have accumulated thoughts, and you are now being possessed by these thoughts.  I can say this with confidence because I discovered this (after much denial and discomfort) to be my own experience, and I'm positive I'm not the only one.

Basically, if you aren't going to trip regularly, and you are a genuine truth-seeker, then you simply can't rely on the memories of your experiences to guide you through life accurately.  The unchecked mind (ego) is extremely powerful and susceptible to outside influences, and it *will* be pulled astray unless you have a way of keeping yourself grounded.  Meditation is the only way I'm aware of to do this other than psychedelics.

A major implication of this is that this subreddit should be taken with a grain of salt.  I am positive that there are many wonderfully intelligent and open-hearted people here with plenty of genuine wisdom to share, but I am also equally positive that there are many people here who may be on the right track, but have accumulated a lot of ""spiritual stuff"" and are parroting this stuff back to you on this subreddit.

""We're one with the universe!""

""Everything just is!""

Are these statements factual?  Maybe.  But they are only signposts, never forget this.  YOU must be the one to find the core truth of these statements.

I'm about to finish my masters in engineering and I'm teaching high school math right now. I always tell my students ""math is a way to make pictures out of numbers"". I've always said this but in the last couple of sittings of taking my mooksha medicine, that personal proverb really hit home. 

My brother bought a 410 hz violet laser pointer recently and we immediately found how versatile it could be.  Shine it in the toilet, the water turns blue. Throw in a piece of toilet paper, it turns green. We set up wine bottles filled with various levels of water all over the house and refracted the light through one or several at a time which made all kinds of distorted lines and shimmers across our bare white walls. Fill a fish tank with tank rocks and water and a similar effect happens. Whip the light across the front of an old projector screen tv and it leaves green tracers. Shine it at a distant point from you and I shit you not it damn near looks like Navi the fairy. 

During a heavy session some months ago, and reflecting on it since, it really occurred to me that math and science are superb explanations for how nature operates. I sat on that idea and realized, nature never had to go to school to learn how to ""do"". It just does. Nature is automatic. It can bend the light instantly without doing a detailed calculation. Millions of billions of calculations are being done instantaneously, flawlessly. Shapes are created that I could only hope to approach in complexity. It's astounding. It's magic in the purest sense. It's weird and goofy at the same time in the sense that I get teary eyed with excitement look the light that's shining out of my hand, into a glass of plain old water in my average apartment in the middle of a plain old city. And there out of it all, nature astounds without limit or reason, knowing exactly how to do those little computations humans still haven't figured out even exist. It's beautiful don't you think?

My experience...,147,9,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1a3v6a/i_almost_died_my_experience/,"So I almost died about 30 minutes ago. I was driving down the highway and a semi came across the center lane directly in front of me. I hit the brakes and cut the wheel, barely missing the oncoming semi and going off onto the shoulder of the road. Of course, the shoulder had loose gravel, and I started sliding. It is then that I realized that I was headed toward the edge of a large hill where there would be a several hundred foot fall waiting for me on the other side of the shoulder. 

Luckily, I was able to cut the wheel, let up on the brakes to stop sliding and then quickly press them again to continue braking and look in the rear-view mirror to see traffic coming up on my rear-end too quickly. I then pressed the clutch, shifted gears, and hit the gas enough to avoid being rear-ended.  I did this all subconsciously. It just happened. I didn't think about it. ""I"" was an observer, watching my body do all this, seemingly by itself. It was a surreal experience and as I started to continue driving down the road I had this strange sensation. My mind ""caught up"" to my body. And when I say this, it almost felt as if my mind was on one end of a rubber band and my body was on the other end. 

The rubber band had been stretched during the experience. ""Time"" had slowed down, my mind's conscious thoughts were freaking out, screaming out ""what the fuck"" vocally, but my subconscious was hard at work, seemingly operating my body perfectly to do a very complex multitask, in real-time. During those 4 seconds my perception was that of maybe thirty minutes of detail. I have such a vivid memory of what happened, but it was over so quickly. The time dilation was very much like time dilation while tripping. As I regained my composure the rubber band snapped back together and my vision turned to colors of lines, almost like the ""lightspeed"" effect in starwars, but instead of spaced out white lights it was at a much higher resolution and things retained their color. It only lasted for a fraction of a second but the mental sensation was unreal. I was back in real time, and of a normal mind but under a huge dose of adrenaline. I then started to analyze my experience, much like I do while tripping and meditating. 

**TL;DR: Had a near death experience and experienced extreme time dilation. Also experienced my mind break into several parts and work separately.**",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_1a3v6a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1a3v6a/i_almost_died_my_experience/,

I see it as a large, impersonal, dying creature - a system of nerves that don't work, anymore. Nothing seems to be agreeable, anymore. And now it's getting to the point where it doesn't even seem to be bearable...
I think this is because the people I am around - that are around me - agree with or don't think outside the system. So, at the most basic of levels, I don't share a commonality with them:
The acceptance of their place.
How do YOU find yourself, in society? What jobs do you guys have? I find I can never have a job or even a friend group that I can commit to fully.... and in the case of a job, I rarely enjoy it or keep it for more than a few months.
So, my plan is to go work guiding people in the Mountains - until collapse or something else.
AND TO YOU: What is your dream ""job""? Or better yet, -- calling? That you are working towards, actively.... That you would feel good about?... What can we do, while we are here?

The first is that I understand DMT now. There is no magical spirit world that DMT transports you to. The beings that you see while you're high aren't real, they're personifications of feelings and thoughts that you have. The reason that you learn lessons from them is because you've been suppressing them and under the influence of DMT you have no option but to fucking pay attention.

The second is that I'm never smoking DMT again. 


----

I got my first DMT the other day (threads [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1iy4tc/after_years_ive_found_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1j3g1v/after_years_ive_found_it_update_with_detailed/)) and have smoked it three days in a row and broke through each time. The first was experimentation, the second was to share the experience with a friend, the third was shameless self-indulgence. 

The first two taught me nothing, the third was life-changing.

I wrote in my last trip report about being soul-fucked by an angry, wasp-like female being when I broke through. She exhaled slowly and pulled me into the other place with sharpened tentacles. It felt amazing, but something about the way she looked and moved was so distinctly evil. She morphed in and out of moving gears with a sultry arrogance while vibrating my body full of unimaginable pleasure. All I could hear was the deep, whirring sound of moving machinery. It felt spiritually wrong and amazing physically, like how cheating on someone you love must feel. 

She was the personification of my hedonistic perversion - warm and satisfying, yet so ugly that you have to hide it away.

I had to feel her again. 

Instead of being with close friends out in nature like the other times, I decided to smoke alone in my cluttered and messy bedroom. I pulled out my dick, closed my eyes and started rubbing away to get it hard before I took a hit. 

As I pulled the bong I knew I was doing a bad thing but I pushed it to the back of my mind and comforted myself with thoughts of good things to ensure my trip was smooth - it was already too late to stop. I sat it down, grabbed my dick and exhaled, fapping away. It felt amazing for a brief moment before I was overcome with feelings of *what the fuck have I done?*

For a moment I tried to fap through it, thinking that feeling good would make my trip good, but my subconscious had other ideas and my penis went limp in my hand. I didn't want to close my eyes, afraid of who I'd see, but I couldn't help it.

The void was not the vivid and cheerful colours I'd seen before, but black. I stood at the end of cool neon isles leaned at impossible angles; behind them a curious black face with huge round eyes peaked out, first from one wall then another without ever moving between the isles. It was indifferent to my actions, just observing.

This was the personification of my introspective examination.

The black walls and face morphed into a red grid with furious faces emerging and receding from it, laughing and yelling - insulting me. 

They were the personification of the part of me that knows I know better than this.

I don't know why but I started fapping again. Maybe I thought I could still bring back the wasp-faced temptress. Then I saw the most human face I've seen in the void yet. I could only see his bald blue head and shoulders; his face was serene and sad. He reached out an arm and placed it on my shoulder as if to comfort me - like I was sick. No words were spoken, but he communicated ""It's OK, you don't have to do this.""

He was the personification of my purification.

I was still tripping hard when I stood up and flung open my curtains. I needed to see nature and sunlight. I dropped onto my bed and closed my eyes, watching the void shift and spiral away. I was glad to see it go this time. 

The black face peeked around corners of the grid as it faded. 

-----

The acrid stink of DMT was making me sick. I rose to my feet, picked up my dressing gown and tried to waft the smoke out of the room with a blanket.

My dog looked up at me with his tail between his legs and fled the room. I hope he didn't get high. Maybe he could just sense that I was *wrong*.

I went outside and sat in the sun on my veranda, smoking a cigarette. My cat stood up between my legs and reached a paw onto my shoulder. I thanked him out loud and he hopped on my lap. His warm body and soft fur comforted me. It was better than sex - just holding the cat, sharing our warmth and comfort with each other, being there.

Usually the cat is detached and aloof.

I no longer see sex as a pleasurable act that is separate from love. The two are parts of one whole. I don't want to masturbate anymore. You can't love yourself in that way. I have a beautiful fiancee to make love to, and from now on that's all I'll do.

It very much reminds me of my last trip, where I very quickly teetered back and forth between absolute control of my brain and total loss of control: between laughing confidently about, in, and with the absurdity of life, and curling up in the fetal position in the bathroom crying (about the absurdity of life). 

Right now is the point in history where we are teetering back and forth between self-destruction and transcendence, the point between the easy decline and the hard ascend. Are we about to fall into the collapse of civilization, or the hard, violent emergence of global unity and expansion? I wanna go to space and meet everyone else. I think it would be fun to rearrange the stars and build a computer the size of a planet for the sole purpose of interfacing with a single user's brain so they can simulate being John Malkovich. I'd SO much rather zoom around in a spaceship or upload my mind into virtual reality and explore new outer and inner worlds, than have to rummage for scraps and resources in the old skeletons of skyscrapers. I don't wanna have to build it all up again! Like, doesn't the former just sound like so much more fucking FUN!?

And I just wanna grab people's hands on the subway sometimes and ask them if they'd like to harvest a supernova, if they'd like to help us figure out how to grow the most efficient garden possible, if they'd like me to show them how music works and how to express themselves, if they'd like to forgive their parents or their friends for that stupid thing they did and be happy again.

I feel like I could be an alien watching all of history on a screen, like a transgalactic movie or TV show. ""And now, polyps and proteins, it's your favorite programme... *Civilized!* The only show broadcasting in all three trillion quadrants! Join us as we watch type 0 civilizations in the crucial stage of development that we all remember so fondly, where the individualized lifeforms stumble upon sentience and realize control over their physical reality.

got my shoes n feet so fucking muddy i was like ""damn, that was stupid,"" but i saw a big puddle up ahead so i took my shoes off and tossed em into the puddle to wash em off and god dammit that puddle was WAY deeper than it seemed, didn't even check it first (again!). 

I was like ""fuck, i'm a double idiot,"" so now i'm barefoot and i'm walking through the woods and the rocks and sticks are really fucking up my feet but right up ahead there's this sweet soft path of grass so i go to walk on it. 

I'm on this grass, and I'm walking down and i step in dog shit! and i'm like ""damn, wasn't even looking where i put my feet!"" So now i'm looking down at my poopy feet, making sure to avoid more poop and rocks and such, looking down so intently that i bump right into this guy walking his dog in front of me (aha that's where the poo came from!).

""Oshitsorry excuse me"" i say and the dude turns around and he smells the shit on my foot and he's like ""O please, my apologies for the poo, i had a feeling i missed one!"" 

We get to talking and this guy is like super connected, I mean i can smell the love radiating off him. This dude is very good friends with these trees. 

Sounds crazy, but seriously, he's telling me about these trees, about the shit they've seen, about how he and his dog (18 year old dog, looks like an 8 year old) converse regularly. Fucking intriguing shit! 

Crazy, yea, but wadafuq this guy actually lives THIS life??? (or at least lives a life where he creates wacky stories to tell to strangers, which is cool too, but that's not it i can feel it.)

Anyways, he asks me bout my barefeet n stuff and i tell him about my shoes and THIS MOTHERFUCKER TAKES THE SHOES OFF HIS FEET AND GIVES THEM TO ME!!! they were nice shoes too, new balance! way better than my shit whateverthefucks at the bottom of that puddle. 

He's not even acting like this is a big deal, it's just like it's some simple fact, that he's giving me his shoes, like it's just happening like the wind around us and it's not even worth his focused attention!

So anyways, i thank him for the shoes and the conversation and i go on about my way through the woods, mind buzzing at this insane meeting i just had! I'm like replaying the whole thing in my head like ""wow if i checked the mud i wouldn't have been here now."" 

So now i'm just.... like.... THANKING myself for not checking that mud, or the water puddle, or the feet, and then for not looking up. Though it's not really thanking it's more just.... well.... it's beyond words that feeling of some flavor of graditude! Cuz god dammit if all that stupidity didn't have the most beautiful gift at the end of it: a ridiculous life-lesson delivered in the most sublime manner by one of the most intriguing men i've ever met! 

And it didn't even cost me my shoes, in the long run! In fact, I got a shoe upgrade (even though, for a while there, i was without shoes AND without lesson). 

But sweet, sweet mother of fuck.

That was a PERFECT walk through the woods.

...................

EDIT:

Holy shit, i didn't even notice til i got home that the rain stopped and the sun came out! 

can't believe i didn't notice that....! 

i should pay more attention to the weather ;)

After some fags in the park, we went swimming in the creek together, then we hung out out at the mall, threw our facebooks at eachother, and planned to hang out, today.

On a side-note, it started storming around 6pm, so I meditated in the rain. It was extremely comfortable.

Later on, watched a couple episodes of My Little Pony, got a massage from my chick friend, performed Lesser Banishing/Invoking Rituals of the Pentagram, read half of Somerset's *The Magician*, practiced the Hebrew alphabet, and listened to the song Ion by Tool over 30 times.

Do any of you suffer from depression or anything the like that ruins your love perception towards this world?

Go through these posts and read. There are so many beautiful people here sharing their love and attention towards our family.

Love is not about loving those with a behavior that is right for you. True love is unconditional. In all honesty, the thing I value the most to find is true love like that. When I see you post things about how we're connected, our energy, our life experiences, the similarities we experience, despite our ego's that may be different, we are all filled with love, curiosity, despair, and cravings. And if you think about it, it's a beautiful thing. 

We're all looking for the same thing in different ways.

I don't want you guys to suffer from others who mindlessly release their pain upon you. If any of you are in a relationship, or have friendships with others who make you feel less than what you are, a beautiful creature who has regrets, mistakes, pain, insecurities, and you feel worthless, please stray from them. Do not let anyone abuse you, in any way shape or form. Your mind cannot be in that gutter that crumbles you. Don't look for love in the wrong places.

When you find the right person, you will feel invincible. You will be connected to your own soul. You will praise living. You will praise the good times and the terrible times and the cheesy times and the awkward moments. Because you will be at a beautiful place. You won't judge yourself as much, you'll move with the flow. 

You are not perfect people. But that does not mean you are not amazing.

To someone out there, even if you haven't met them, or perhaps they are browsing /r/psychonaut and are one of our sisters and brothers, you are amazing. Every fiber of your being will be something special to them. 

We're all equal here. Some of us have fucked up stories that have made us miserable. All of us have done something stupid in one way or another and we've fucked up. But we're not fuck ups if you choose not to have that mindset. There's a potential inside you that you have no idea what it is. You are not your demons. 

If you've done wrong, you're not scum of the earth. You must forgive yourself firstly. Make amends to whoever was involved **if you believe it is worth it**, you can learn a lesson from them or learn about yourself. It's not the end. There's always something. You might not feel that way but it will come. 

Been having rough months and I just love reading the posts on here. Everyone would feel so much better if we were just loving, unconditionally. I hate how growing up we're almost taught that if we act one way, we will receive love and deserve it. No. Every creature needs unconditional love and encouragement to be the best we want to be. And it all starts with ourselves and appreciating ourselves. 


*many hugs* I hope you're having a beautiful day or night. Have fun with your time. ",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_1fzgz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1fzgz8/im_having_a_emotionally_insane_morning_and_i_just/,

I rolled with a significant other at home, by ourselves. During the middle of the roll, we smoked a bowl. I am not a fan of weed; it makes me confused and I over-think everything, but with the molly I got this overwhelming sense of clarity, almost like a filter had been removed from my brain and I was thinking clearly for the first time.

I have finally realized why we are different from most people. It's no surprise that we're ""deeper thinkers"" than most people, but there's more to it than that. I realized that most of my friends are essentially just drinking buddies, and there's very few people I can bond with on a deeper level. And i've figured out why.

The thing that separates me from most people isn't, in my opinion, the fact that i'm some super smart guy. The only thing that separates me is that I am willing to look honestly, critically, and openly at myself. I'm at peace with myself and comfortable in my own skin because i've spent years analyzing myself...determining my strengths and weaknesses...and learning to accept and love myself despite these weaknesses. It's been a long journey, and the journey will never end, but i'm so completely content with myself at this point in my life, and that is one of the single most important things you can obtain in life.

I realized that the reason I was on such a crusade to share psychedelics with the world was because I simply desired people to get ""on my level"". To be open and honest with themselves about who they are. I feel passionately that if you are in tune with yourself, you are able to be more in tune with others. If you understand yourself, you understand everyone else. We're all one, essentially...and I don't mean that in some sort of esoteric, hippie way...but we are all humans with the same basic wiring. If you are able to seriously analyze yourself, you can understand others. My SO can know exactly what is going through my head just through looking at my expressions. We're in tune with each other. We can not see each other for months, but when we do it just feels like home.

The Illuminati, of course, subsequently scanned the notes he kept on these neurophysiological experiments. The most interesting items were the following:",159,29,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1a30ju/crane_performed_yoga_exercises_every_day_in_his/,"April 23, 1952—It helps if you identify each letter of AUM with one of the three gods of the Hindu trinity. A is Brahm, the Creator: let it explode upward from the diaphragm, like the big bang of creation itself. U is Vishnu, the Preserver: hold it so long that it vibrates, like the rhythm of life, the Big Beat of Beethoven's *Seventh*. M is Shiva, the Destroyer: close the lips in a decisive bite of ""This is the way the world ends"" as you enter the silence.

---

May 1, 1952—Today, unexpectedly, pure *dhyana*. It was so much simpler than I ever guessed, and it is obviously a matter of practice. No wonder the yogis say that it's dangerous to do this without a guru: I am no better or worse, morally, and no wiser or more ""spiritual."" Repetition is the whole key. Force the nerves and muscles and glands, force them day after day, and it happens. The chief function of the guru is to ensure that you don't take advantage of the new freedom too quickly and get yourself in trouble with the authorities. The guru doesn't help it happen at all (as the honest ones admit); you do all the work yourself. The guru just makes sure that the rapture flows into ""safe"" (domesticated?) channels. Without such a moral watchdog, I am free to do as I bloody please.

I just realized why all the real occult schools are so damned secretive, why the ordinary seeker is given a lot of double-talk and ejected out the same door wherein he came. If everybody could do this, the whole world would be in continuous revolution.*

&gt;**Terran* *Archives* *2803:* *Dhyana* was the Sanskrit name, used by the Hindic primates, to describe the opening and imprinting of the neurosomatic circuit. The term, and the techniques of inducing it, became *Ch'an* in China and *Zen* in Japan. It was always supervised by an *alpha* *male* for the reasons Crane suspected. It represents the dawning of post-primate consciousness and the HEAD Revolution, thereby rendering the biot independent of the primate dominance-submission hierarchy. 

---

May 27, 1952—Another successful *dhyana*. There's nothing to it, really. The brain obviously operates on the same principle as those fellows in *The Hunting of the Snark:* ""What I tell you three times is true."" (Three million times is more accurate.) It was marvelous—better than the first time—and I'll never identify with ""Cagliostro the Great"" or ""Hugh Crane"" or even ""me"" or the perpendicular pronoun, ever again.

I can see more and more clearly why all this is ""sealed with seven seals"" and hidden behind all kinds of mystification. *Society as we know it is based on torture and death, or the threat of torture and death.* I am in here to be tortured, although the authorities will never admit that. (What they do with heretics in other countries is torture; what we do here is penology.) The cage experience is profoundly punishing to the average human, as to any primate; it is the form of torture our society countenances. It is no torture to me only because I have learned certain neurological arts every stage magician learns. 

But if everybody could go into *dhyana* at will, nobody could be controlled—by fear of prison, by fear of whips or electroshock, by fear of death, even. All existing society is based on keeping those fears alive, to control the masses.

Ten people who know what I know would be more dangerous than a million armed anarchists.

---

July 23, 1952—I can hardly write. Today I reached *Samadhi*. It makes *dhyana* look like nothing by comparison. All my certainty is gone. I should be terrified, but instead I'm ecstatic. If this is possible, *anything* is possible.*

&gt;**Terran Archives 2803: Samadhi* was the Hindustani name for the opening and imprinting of the sixth (metraprogramming) circuit in the frontal lobes of the post-primate brain. Most of those who achieved it before the HEAD Revolution were just as bewildered as Crane and could say only that the experience was ""ineffable.""

I know this may get buried, but I wanted to express my feelings about this short trip somewhere. Within seconds of blowing out my hit I felt the familiar pull of the other times I've done Salvia. An initial feeling that I'm no longer firmly planted in my body. As the sensations hit me I immediately started second guessing the decision thinking ""why did I do this? What the fuck is about to happen right now? Why the fuck did I take this in the first place?"" Then I had a moment where I reminded myself that it was too late. I had already taken my hit. I had already become affected by the hardest punch to my brain I've yet to experience. All While this is happening the salvia starts to hit and I begin to feel pulled harder and harder away from what I am. Then as the effects came on fully I had the strangest feeling of joy, embrace, understanding, and this feeling of being content. The only thought that I have fully perserved is ""I  understand, I can see, I can finally understand why we see what we see.""  I wish I could express what I understood, but I've been trying to connect the pieces. Never have I had what I would classify as a completely beneficial trip from salvia, but this trip was different. It brought me to the understanding of embracing exactly where you are, exactly what we are, and finally the adventure in diving in headfirst fully embracing what we've done and what we will do, because in our individual experience there is nothing else to do, no one else to be but our selves. Fully embraced, as honest and as pure as what salvia brings us. Reality, in a flash, a shock, a perfect analogy for the way that life will beat us down if we don't hop on the ride and embrace the crazy shit we know we can handle. Stay head strong my friends, stay honest, and thank you for reading my poorly written tripping account. This trip was exactly what I needed in my life right now to get me out of the rut I was in. Always embrace the moment, because we're already here. I truly appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. Much love.

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.

And that’s when you met me.

“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”

“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”

“Yup,” I said.

“I… I died?”

“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”

“More or less,” I said.

“Are you god?” You asked.

“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”

“My kids… my wife,” you said.

“What about them?”

“Will they be all right?”

“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”

You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.

“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. You wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”

“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”

“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”

“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”

“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”

You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”

“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”

“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”

“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”

“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”

“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”

“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”

“Where you come from?” You said.

“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”

“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”

“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”

“So what’s the point of it all?”

“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.

I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”

“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”

“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”

“Just me? What about everyone else?”

“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”

You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”

“All you. Different incarnations of you.”

“Wait. I’m everyone!?”

“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.

“I’m every human being who ever lived?”

“Or who will ever live, yes.”

“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.

“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.

“And you’re the millions he killed.”

“I’m Jesus?”

“And you’re everyone who followed him.”

You fell silent.

“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”

You thought for a long time.

“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”

“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”

“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”

“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”

“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”

“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”

And I sent you on your way.

1338910688.0,125,self.Psychonaut,um73e,A possible insight about heterosexuality in males,164,39,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/um73e/a_possible_insight_about_heterosexuality_in_males/,"When I view interaction among heterosexual males in North America, it seems like behaviour includes patterns which avoid triggering homosexuality. I think usually it’s not a conscious avoidance, but a way people are trained to act automatically. Seeing avoidance instead of simply a lack of interest makes me think that a lot more males are fundamentally bisexual or pansexual to some extent, and only socially programmed to be heterosexual.

The patterns of avoidance also avoid some emotional connection. They limit the extent of emotional connection between males, and make them feel more separate from each other.  This makes their interaction more competitive and less cooperative.  It is a driving force behind the materialistic addictions prevalent in this society.

This kind of mindset provides a competitive advantage when societies come into conflict. I expect it became dominant as a result of this, by outcompeting others, like survival of the fittest. However, in terms of happiness, it’s a disadvantage. The resulting materialistic addictions also result in unwise use of limited planetary resources.

This is also the reason behind homophobia. However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

By the way, exclusivity in relationships also has some similar effects. However, the avoidance of homosexuality seems to have a greater effect.


-----------------------------


I came up with this insight many years ago, with the assistance of psychedelics. Over time I refined and improved it, but also became less attached to it. It still makes a lot of sense, but I wonder if it is a delusion. I’m pansexual and maybe things only seem this way to me because I incorrectly assume some fundamental similarities between myself and others.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_um73e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/um73e/a_possible_insight_about_heterosexuality_in_males/,

I was also battling an eating disorder- I would eat very small amounts very rarely because I had dealt with some level of obesity in the past and had relatively severe body image and self-esteem issues. I was highly egocentric and all of this at once compiled into the greatest mope session in the world- I was unable to handle my college classes I was so sad all the time. Ew.
I decided to try LSD- I had heard incredible things about it- and I had been experimenting with other mind-altering substances as well, (mostly alcohol, marijuana, and synthetic marijuana or ""spice"" products) so I did heavy research and discovered it was a pretty benign molecule. 
Two tabs of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide were placed on my tongue at about 4:20pm, and since that moment I still am not the same. I never will be. Over the course of the following twelve hours or so, I watched my entire reality slip away and be freed- no more assumptions, no more preconceived notions or prejudice, no more opinions, no more judging- I was buddha in Freshman form. I had achieved a sort of cosmic bliss- my ego unraveled and my sense of self renewed.  I ingested only a few hundred micrograms of a chemical and after about an hour or so I had started to think harder, faster, and in some ways better about my place in the universe than I ever had before. I began to explode with sudden realizations as to how little I was- how insignificant I was. However I knew how significant all the pains of life felt. I began to dive down the rabbit hole and began to see that the only significance anything has is the significance the mind applies to it- and I began to remember who it was I always really wanted to be. 
I remembered how much I loved people- even after years of identifying as being a misanthropic loner. I began to see how mysterious and incredible of a thing it was to be alive. I was amazed in the true sense of the word. I was more than that. I thought in ways and on levels I had never thought I could achieve- and as I tripped I felt myself healing. I became reminded of the glory of existing. Why was there something instead of nothing? This question alone was enough to inspire. That's what it truely was- inspiring. Inspiring on a psycho-emotional level that I had never imagined before. I spent the whole night walking around and musing on my thoughts. I wandered about campus starry-eyed and full of wonder at the infinite beauty of the universe from sundown till daybreak, my mind and heart so full of profound belonging and psychedelia. True euphoria vibrated through my veins until after the sun came up. 
I found myself covered in ink and paint, smoking a cigarette and bundled up in the morning air, being bold with my love and greeting everyone I saw. I smiled for hours- knowing that the only significance anything has is the significance the mind applies to it. Words were a necessary evil- and despite the vast darkness I was supplying the light. Shining- feeling an inner peace I have not known since. I will probably be chasing it for the rest of my life.That morning I got a bacon egg and cheese sandwich and toast and a pastry and I feasted upon them. I walked around with paint on my face and the biggest smile I had worn in what could have been years. I looked in a mirror that day and was okay. I didn't hate me anymore. I knew that whatever it was that was me was a beautiful and original and incredible thing- that everything was amazing- and I was no less.
My slightly-dilated afterglowing eyes roved over the scratched mirror in my dorm bathroom last October and saw me at about 155 pounds and 6’2 (I wasn’t that skinny- how could I have had an eating disorder, right?) and they did not hate. They saw no fault- in fact, they gave up. The truly miniscule nature of all of my worries and fears and insecurities had become overwhelmingly apparent- such insignificant matters. I was not ugly. I was not fat- I wasn’t even overweight. I knew it- and seeing it as an act of courage; I shrugged off anorexia. I brushed the years of torture and self-loathing off my shoulders and walked away from it, proudly and with confident conviction.
I looked at myself in the mirror and after months and months of fighting and struggling I finally said “fuck it, I look fine.” and left. I left it behind. I had simply decided that it was possible for me to walk away from a deep-seated psychoemotional problem I had been fighting for years. I felt brave enough- brave enough to say “I like me because it’s me.”

Life became more than worth it again. It became a wonder. And in many ways it has remained so ever since then. I dropped out of college and am currently pursuing my dream in a career in music and the performing arts. I am working hard and I am in love with the glory that is life.
I can credit LSD with helping me do some incredible things for myself on the inside. Repairing what was broken, building new things, and changing what is there. I highly recommend a psychedelic experience for almost anyone.
If you tell me LSD is a bad thing, then fuck you. It helped give me my life and myself back. That's no small thing.

(Sorry for the length, it was a very long, worthwhile journey.)",136,14,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/pq3or/my_iboga_flood_sorry_for_the_length_it_was_a_very/,"I just recently finished a 47 gram Iboga root bark extraction, to yield 3.8 grams of fairly pure TA. It was to be split between my friend and myself. I decided to go first, because he was waiting to get as much methadone out of his system as possible. He is currently entering his flood as I type this.

I took 1.9 grams of TA in gel caps. I extracted it myself and cleaned it all up with acetone, so I know it was QUITE pure. The calculated dosage came out to 25 mgs/kg, the upper end of the scale for flood dosing.

I laid in the dark bedroom waiting for the experience to come on. I have to get some backstory established so that the experience fits together. Basically, I have been dating a girl for about half a year. She's wonderful, everything I could ask for. I had a very bad habit engrained in me, though. I have never had a girlfriend that I didn’t cheat on (we’re at like 10 or so on the tally). This includes the current one. We go to separate schools, about 4 or 5 hours apart. It wasn’t an issue at first, but it would wear on me when I wouldn’t see her for long periods of time. I would start flirting with other girls occasionally, etc. Don’t get me wrong, I love this girl. She is my perfect match. But like I said, I had a very bad habit, and it was in there deep.

So I’d been cheating on my girlfriend. Somehow I managed to convince myself that I should break up with her and start dating the girl I had been having sex with. I looked at her as too different from me (if only in subtle ways).

I was laying in the bed, though, reading on my cell phone, when the trip began. The first thing I saw was a tiny black man hovering in front of my phone, shouting “No! NO! STOP IT! PUT IT DOWN!”

So I put it down. I rolled over and closed my eyes, and vivid landscapes were forming inside my head. Brain movies. In between the brain movies, though, I could feel something above me trying to pull me up. I slowly realized it was the same black man who had yelled at me. So I looked up (this happened in my head) and he reached his hand down toward me, offering to pull me up. I gladly grabbed onto his hand and AWAY WE WENT. We sailed over this huge, beautifully arching rainbow, then across a quick succession of other rainbows. We kept going up and up and up, very fast. 

Then he started talking to me. He began telling me about the nature of some very strange Ayahuasca experiences I have had over the last 6 months. He explained that the loop I kept falling into on Ayahuasca was actually a direct representation of the approaching singularity, and the universe cycles over and over again, from beginning to end, forever. He said that it always had been and always will be; the cycle will never stop. He said we weren’t living along a linear timeline, but a timeloop. This didn’t make any sense to me, so I asked him what it meant. He then showed me a vertical line (timeline) next to a circle (timeloop). The line grew into an arrow on one end, which then started rotating around the circle. I understood that this meant time was a cycle, and while time seems to be moving linearly, if you were to make it all the way to the end it would just start over again at the beginning.

Suddenly another black man appeared, this one skinnier and younger than the first. He was talking to me about something that seemed really mundane and unimportant. Then he winked at me, and I realized it was the same black man from the beginning, my guide, but he was appearing to me in a different form.

He grabbed my hand again and pulled me even further up. Suddenly I was looking at myself. This was startling, because it is the first time I have ever seen myself on any drug, ever. I winked at me, and I realized that it wasn’t really me I was seeing, but again Mr. Iboga. It was then that I realized even in his earlier forms, his voice had sounded exactly like mine. I had that something similar to Bicameralism was going on, and this was just the voice of God in my head talking to my ego, teaching it.

Things begin to get really hazy from here, and I know I will be leaving out most of the visionary state, because I just don’t remember what I saw. He tried to tell me something about there being an infinite number of parallel universes.

At one point I asked him what I should do about the situation with my girlfriend. Whether I should choose her or the other girl. He brought up pictures of both of them framed in rectangles, and with a “ping” sound, a green check mark appeared over my girlfriend’s head and a red x appeared over the other girl’s. I did not like this. As I said before, I had decided already to break up with my girlfriend. I thought to myself, “well maybe I just won’t LISTEN to Mr. Iboga! Maybe I’ll do whatever I feel like!!” What a silly thing for me to think.

The climax of the visionary state came as he grabbed my hand and pulled me up higher and higher and higher. We stopped in front of this small wooden door that looked extremely familiar. I knew where he had taken me; to the threshold. He opened the door. I asked if I was supposed to go through it. He said “I don’t know. You could.”

I knew that if I went through the door it would mean I’d leave my physical body forever. He seemed like he really wanted me to go through it, though. I thought to myself about how I really didn’t want to die, but if Iboga thought I was ready I probably should. He winked at me again. I reached my hand up. He instantly grabbed it and pulled me straight through the door at near light-speed. I felt my heart start beating really hard and thought “Jesus Christ, I am about to have a heart attack.”

Suddenly, I could see through my eyelids. I saw a ghostly form of myself rise up out of my chest and float toward the ceiling. To my surprise, my consciousness remained in my body. I asked my guide why I hadn’t actually died. He responded by saying “You cannot will it to happen.” I opened my eyes. The tracers and snaking beams of light filled my field of vision. It was very, very intense. I closed my eyes again. There was Mr. Iboga, for the last time. He said “I have shown you the secrets of the cosmos, taken you through death’s door and back, we have gone all the way to the end and then around to the beginning. There is nothing left. So what do you want to watch?” With that, he handed me a TV remote. I started clicking the button on it and the brain movies were back, cycling through as I clicked them. They were mostly sort of static patterns of different colors. After a minute or so the images faded, and I opened my eyes. The visionary stage was over.

You start to realize all of those cliches are cliches for a reason.  You start to listen.  It becomes harder.  The wool becomes to fade.  You start to see things as they really are, in a state of utter dishabille.  Famine, poverty, inequality, intolerance, hatred all fill the world.  

As you enter chapel perilous the world seems bleak, it seems that there is no hope.  You start to devote yourself to spirituality, and higher purpose in order to find your own center so that you can live in this world.  You start to believe that you are beggining to be awakened.  You start to see beyond the wool, you see that the wool is what most people see through, but you choose to remove it.  You choose to see things as they are, for better or worse.  

Eventually however you realize that this view of the world is but another view of the world.  You are no more important than any other.  You have a place, it is to help the progress of others as well as yourself.  You are to do what you believe is right.  You are not to be lazy, to simply be content.  You are to do what makes you feel alive.  You are to live the fullest live imaginable, taking every whim you wish.  At times being spontaneous, and at times working harder than anyone has ever worked, all the while enjoying every minute of it.  For you understand the greatest thing of all.

  As a summary, I am 67 yo, retired from N. California white male.  I’ve taken around 200-300 hits of strong Owsley LSD in the ‘60/70’s, and been meditating for over 40 years using a modified Zen technique.  I still smoke MJ every day. I recently went to Peru specifically to take Ayahuasca with a Shaman, via La Familia Medicina at the ‘Way Inn Lodge’ in the mountains of Huaraz in central Peru around 11,000 ft.  As promised, here’s my Ayahuasca experience.

  I talked the wife into coming to Peru with me, so we left two weeks earlier – Cusco, Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca – all going beyond our ‘wow’ expectations.  She returned to California and I took the night-bus north to Huaraz.  This is the second time I’ve been to Huaraz, the first time in 2001 with my older son where we did the Santa Cruz trek crossing a pass at 15,600 ft.  I didn’t really want to return to Huaraz but instead wanted to take Ayahuasca in the Amazon jungle.  But since the Amazon had especially high flood waters this year, the Ayahuasca jungle retreats originally scheduled were cancelled – so I switched my itinerary.
  For mountain exploring Huaraz can’t be beat.  Unfortunately, more people don’t consider Peru for vacations and trekking – I’ve been there three times and it’s been magical every time.
  I went up to ‘The Way Inn Lodge’ a few days early and stay as a guest.  The staff is always positive, helpful and eager to answer questions.  I immediately felt completely at ease, confident that I was in good hands.  The physical location itself is profound and inspiring with the wide-open valley and the rising snow-covered mountains above.  The facilities are excellent, and they are constantly adding new projects and expanding.  They have water diversion, compost, bee hives, they are reforesting, have ponds, organic gardening, are hugely involved with the local community – everything effective and practical one could expect from a group of visionaries.

  Saturday arrived, and by mid-day all 12 participants were gathered for meetings.  The rules and regulations of La Familia Medicina are many – no sex, no street drugs, no pork, piranha, or crocodile meat, no using soap or toothpaste during the retreat, and a special ‘dieta’ would be imposed and limited to a small variety of ingredients with no salt, we would drink tree-bark tea each afternoon, head over to the Ayahuasca Lodge and drink Ayahuasca after dark, trip for 3-4 hours and crash on the comfortable mats in the Lodge, or wander back to our rooms in the dark.  Meditation, Yoga and other new-age techniques were also used effectively.  The strangest to me is their constant insistence that Ayahuasca is a medicine, not ever referred to as a psychedelic or drug.  After experiencing the awesome powers of Ayahuasca I’m slowly coming around; it should be considered a medicine.  This was an 8-day retreat, with 5 Ayahuasca trips (ceremonies) scheduled.  Ayahuasca is different from other psychedelics – there’s a kind of telepathy with the drug, Ayahuasca is probably twice as strong LSD, and, Ayahuasca is very feminine.
  My first night I drank five solid gulps of the vile-tasting liquid.  The Shaman singing, breathing, whistling, and blowing tobacco smoke on the ceremonial cup before the person walked up and drank it down, moving around the circle of people.  By the time it got to me people were already throwing up into the provided buckets, some projecting violently.   After I drank a half hour later I was on my back unable to move even the slightest finger- still no vomiting, but I could feel the ‘poisons’ moving through my body horribly assaulting my organs and into my intestines, then my anus complaining that things just weren’t right down there.  I’ve done lots of Peyote so I’ve had experience with anus communication.
  The visions are very cartoon-like, non-stop, filling all space with eyes closed or open - it doesn’t matter.  It’s psychedelic Disneyland, every space filled with dancing cartoons and especially dancing snakes.  It was great and reminded me of the one time I did Opium and had similar cartoon dreams.  These visions were unlike powerful LSD trips that seem to have more mandala-type visions instead, with multi-dimensions and cascading insights.  But after two hours of cartoons I started asking, “Is this all it is?  This isn’t what I was expecting…” My expectation was to receive intense insights to the three questions (or intentions) I was bringing to Ayahuasca medicine.  So I kept asking my questions over and over, but never got any answers.  What I did get was to be transported to all the people that I love and felt them in a gently loving embrace.  Even my dead parents were available for a hug and communication.  I was instantly transported to anyone that I wanted to hug.
  At three hours into the trip my anus said it was time to drag my body to one of the three toilets.  My body felt awkward, heavy disconnected and barely able to get off the cushion – but somehow I found myself in the bathroom with my flashlight.  It was a diarrhea party and I suppose the entire group heard my explosions – but honestly there is no embarrassment, and everyone is very non-judgmental.  Afterwards my body felt horrible, as if I just ate arsenic or something, and survived by the slightest margin.  I lay in physical agony for the rest of the night, sleeping fitfully and waking to go back to the toilet several more times.  At sunrise I somehow stumbled back to my room.
  It was an excellent first Ayahuasca trip, but the next day I felt horrible, couldn’t eat, and spent the entire day sleeping.  The staff calls this purging the body of poisons, but my old body was barely hanging on.
  
  We were to take Ayahuasca again the second night, but I was feeling very weak and considered skipping the second night ceremony.  By evening I felt moderately well enough and drank only two good gulps this time.  One-half hour into it and I was heavily tripping again – cartoons and horrible body feelings that just wouldn’t go away.  The pain was relentless, the annoying cartoon visions wouldn’t go away, and my physical body discomfort – yet, still no throwing-up, only serious intestinal distress, my breathing became labored and shallow.  I tried taking deep breaths and it helped immensely.  I finally went to the bathroom and saw blood in the diarrhea – but learned later it was from the beet juice drink I had earlier - pretty freaky thing to experience when stoned on Ayahuasca, however.  I lay back down on my mat and listened to the Shaman singing his songs letting myself be carried away by the medicine again.  But no matter how hard I tried to ignore the signals, my body was telling me that I was physically dying – not something to take lightly at the age of 67.  This was not the psychedelic ego-death, this was my actual physical death.  I wasn’t willing to accept death and fought against it.  Suddenly and unexpectedly my heart chakra exploded with loving energy, I felt like I had reached a plateau where I was one of the focal points of the universe to channel loving energy.   My body/mind/ego was gone, it was amazing. 
  Exhausted, returning from the toilet I lay back down, thinking this is really not working out for me physically.  My kidney couldn’t seem to process this foreign ‘poison’ like the younger participants were able to…  I remembered them recommending us to ‘ask Ayahuasca’ so I said, “should I stay or should I go?” and suddenly an image of a stern, regal, beautiful woman appeared on a balcony.  She wore all black with some white clothing peaking out underneath, and lots of ornate silver jewelry.  She looked down at the large crowd of people gathered below, then looked right over at me, pointed her index finger at me and said “Gooooooooo!”
  Immediately I relaxed and realized that I’ve tripped on enough psychedelics and I’ll just stick with smoking Marijuana from now on.  One of my questions was answered:  To die as a warrior, one must live each day as a warrior.
   
I had absolutely no problems with the staff or the programs, or the rules.  Great bunch of people and I would absolutely recommend La Familia Medicina to anyone and everyone.  You will get your moneys-worth and more.  But if you are old like me, understand that your organs will not process the chemicals as well and take that into consideration.  Their Shaman is especially cool, continually singing and directing the energy.  A very compassionate and aware dude that I have tons of respect for – at some points he walked around blowing tobacco smoke my way, a few times closely directed at my forehead and the crown of my head where I immediately went to new dimensions.  He is secure as the person he is, one of the most open people I have encountered…
   I’m regret that I was unable to remain there, but I felt I had to get out of Dodge and left on the third day.  I’m not blaming anyone and the staff tried to get me to stay - just chalk it up to an old hippies adventure that didn’t work out the way I originally planned.  As the Rolling Stones said:  “You can’t always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need.”

TL;DR – 67 yo hippie goes to Peru to take Ayahuasca with Shaman at La Familia Medicina.  Doesn’t work out as planned and leaves after only two ceremonies.

(Skip this part if you don't want a back-story on my first experience with DMT)
Up until about a year and a half ago (I'm 26 now), I was never well versed in psychedelics, or even substantial weed usage. I met a few people at a new contract position who introduced me to some other people who all smoked weed. Tried it, it didn't get me high and I hated it at first but, after a few successful attempts, grew to like it.

Anyway, fast forward to about 10 months ago. One of the guys who I got along with the best from this group told me about some of his experiences with other drugs outside of marijuana, specifically mushrooms and DMT. I was very curious about both, so we put in for some DMT from his dealer and got some. We were sitting on his couch at his place and, before we even loaded the hit, he warned me that a hit of DMT is much harsher than bud or even cigarettes (said it was like burning plastic). He put on some Egyptian mediation music I had never heard before (and didn't really like), I took the first hit and immediately coughed the majority of it out. I had never experienced a trip from any psychedelic prior to this. I laid my head back, waited, and felt absolutely nothing, save for feeling a body high for about 2 minutes. The first attempt was a bust. I was convinced that I was broken, that DMT or any other psychedelic would never work for me and that I was destined to be ""stuck"" in this boring reality.

Fast forward again about a month, his dealer had some more DMT. We decided to give it one more shot. As we sat on his couch, readying the first hit, I told him that I wanted to choose the music this time. I wanted to choose music that I knew well, that I loved and was very comfortable with, hoping that it would help me along this time; I chose the Wish You Were Here album from Pink Floyd. Looking back on it now, I couldn't have made a better choice. I've used Tool, Explosions In The Sky, Blackmill, Godspeed You! Black Emporer, etc., but that Pink Floyd album has always been my default, go-to, music.

I took the hit. It was extremely rough, but I kept it all in this time. I closed my eyes, relaxed my body and let my head rest on the back of the couch. I felt a severe tingling sensation in my throat, then my neck and cheeks and then in my eyes... and I was off. The first thing I witnessed was what appeared to be a giant dome of flickering lights and colors, and I was on the inside looking up to the zenith of it. There were jagged lines and shapes everywhere, colors flashing and waving everywhere. It was astonishing. Only then did I realize that I was still holding my breath, so I exhaled through my nose (as directed by my friend). As I exhaled, I crashed through the ceiling of the dome of colors, and broke out into an abyss of darkness. However, within this darkness was an endless minefield of blue orbs. In the corners of my vision, I could still see the jagged colors and shapes, as if they were holding me, showing me this expanse of blue orbs. I was then ""told"" that each and every one of these was a different reality, and as my vision zoomed in on one in particular, I was ""told"" that this one, this blue orb, was my reality.

I was then instantly ripped back into the dome, away from the abyss. However, the dome wasn't the same as it was before. It was now a fleshy cocoon of pinks, purples and reds, like the inside of a womb. And this is where I felt ""her"".

The walls of this cocoon would occasionally push themselves onto me, like a gentle hug or caress. I was in the presence of a very old, but very loving being. Whatever she was, she was both a lover and a mother. I felt as if I was finally with my creator. All I could ""hear"" was her telling me how much she missed me and how much she loved me. I didn't see a female shape, but I knew I had returned to my source, to the womb in which my consciousness was born. It was such unconditional love, as if she was nursing and making love to the very essence of who I was all at once. I felt like this is where I belonged.

I came down shortly after beginning to experience this. I'll try and explain this as best as I can. Every time I have ever done DMT, I always experience wondrous things but the trip always ends in the warm embrace of the Mother, whatever she is. And every single time, as I'm coming down, I have been on the verge of crying because of this detrimental feeling of separation. Every time.

It's always the same thing when I trip with DMT; I experience her at some point. She tells me that she's missed me, that it's been so long. I can sense her crying with love and companionship when I'm with her, and then I am ripped away.

All of my trips after this first one have been great, but never as profound as that first one. There were times when I thought I had just simply grown too accustomed to it and it wouldn't have the same effect on me ever again. I'm so glad I was wrong about this.

**Fast forward to now.**
(Last night's trip)
So, up until last night, I hadn't smoked DMT in about 4 months. I had used up all of the large chunks of dense DMT crystals in my stash and pretty much only had powder/residue and a few smaller pieces. I'd also been going through a lot of emotional turmoil in the last few months, dealing with a recent break up with my girlfriend, finding out some unfortunate things about my parents reasons for divorce, work, life, blah blah blah.

Anyway, for some reason I decided to give what little DMT I had left a shot last night. I got home from work, drank some ginger ale, got my stash/bong/lighter ready. I put in my default music (Wish You Were Here album), sat back on the couch and prepared the DMT onto a screen in the bowl of the bong. Before doing anything else, I set the stuff down and tried to relax for a few minutes. I kept telling myself that I needed to relax, stop thinking about the stresses in my life yet all that seemed to come to mind was said stresses... Anyway, I calmed down a bit, relaxed, grabbed the bong and got ready. I held the lighter about an inch away from the bowl and started inhaling - *I'm not sure how others smoke it, but the way I was taught was to hold the lighter away from it to allow the DMT to melt/liquify into the brownish liquid first* - and watched the stuff melt down. I took my mouth off of the bong, exhaled breathed a few deep breaths, then exhaled once more and put my mouth back to the bong. I put the fire right against the substance and started inhaling. As I saw the bong fill with a thin smoke, I took what I thought was all of it in, set the bong down and laid back.

(From this point on, any time I say that I *saw* something, I will designate whether my eyes were closed or not.)

You should live in it.  You should understand why you can't awaken everyone.  You should also learn to understand how to awaken people so when you meet a sleepwalker you can help awaken them.  Awakening others is a useful thing.  You can't hand someone enlightenment, but you can point them and prod them to follow the right path.

The reason you trip.  The reason waking up is so great is now you can be a shepherd to the lost.  You can guide those who can't guide themeselves.  This includes you!  You are able to change every single aspect of your self.  If you want to be an extrovert, you can!  If you want to have more attention to detail, you can!  You are given awareness for the simple reason to make your time on earth the best it could ever be.  So please, do so for your sake.

You know all those messages about live life to the fullest, the power of now, don't worry, just love?   Those messages are meant for those who are awake.  We can change the world, but it won't be easy.  We can help bring in a generation where the enlightened start to exist in a higher number and bring a peace that this earth has never seen before.  We can do it, it won't be easy.  Just never give up hope.

Always remember though that not everyone can or should be awakened.  You are not better than anyone else, we are all the same.

Also.  To all of you talking about lotus eaters vs Shaman.  Everyone was a lotus eater once.  Not everyone becomes a shaman, and not everyone wants to.  Neither is better than the other for one can't exist without the other.

It seems like people have 'bad trips' for two different reasons - 

1. They take a drug in the wrong setting, mindset, etc. Negative emotions or surroundings precipitate and perpetuate more negativity. They don't have time to focus on thinking through the problem.

2. The 'bad trip' is actually part of how psychedelics work. The more and more I read, the more it seems like psychedelics force people to go within and examine their lives and how they approach the world. Of course if you have some trauma in your life or something you don't like about yourself it will come up during your trip in a negative way - a 'bad trip'. However, there is something with psychedelics that if the person sits there and thinks their way through it and confronts the trauma or negative emotions, they come out with insight and great relief. Many say it was life changing. 

I was inspired by this story - [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11l5k1/my_cousin_just_purchased_a_2_kegs_of_non/c6nj1kn)

But psychedelics aren't there for *eradicating* our egos. Eckhart Tolle discusses the idea that the existence of an ego in a human is by definition insanity, but I would put forward an alternative analysis: it evolved, and exists, for our *survival*.

We feel naked when we rid ourselves of our ability to distinguish ourselves from our surroundings. Under certain conditions it can be liberating, in others terrifying. I prefer to think of my psychonautic explorations as giving me the chance to comprehend what I hold as my 'ego' within myself: a powerful tool for survival and progress, given it is understood and used responsibly.

By rights, I am respectfully entitled to a life of peace and prosperity for myself and my family, within the limitations of my social group.

Prior to the trip, I had been reading a lot about psychology, quantum physics, lucid dreaming, astral projection, near-death experiences, synchronicities, meditation, and psychedelics. It seemed that some important answers to life's great questions lie at the intersection of these concepts. I went into the trip  with an open mind and the full intention of finding some answers. The ideas that really helped me gain insight from my trip are as follows
 
- Quantum physics shows that we are not simple biological creatures that move along through time in a 3-dimensional world. Rather, time is not linear and we are living in a quantum mindfuck where we create our environment through what we observe.
- The ego is an illusion that unnecessarily guides one's actions and thoughts based on previous experiences.
- NDE's and astral projection seem to suggest that our mind is separate from the body and is capable of perceiving without our eyes. There are even reports of blind people experiencing sight during near death experiences.
- Psychedelics work by reducing brain activity in regions that we associate with our identity of self. Rather than altering reality, they reduce our perceptual filter and show us a world uninhibited by our limited human perceptions.
 
The trip was absolutely beautiful, easily the most brilliant thing I've experienced in my entire life. Every activity I did gave me PROFOUND insights into how the universe worked. As the insights progressively stacked, I could understand more and more, all up until the point where everything became abundantly clear. Ill go through the important ones:
 
- After my tripping buddy came out of the bathroom after throwing up, she exclaimed how much better she feels. Right as she said this, I immediately felt a million times better as well. The floodgates of understanding opened and I knew that I was not me, but I was actually the moment being shared between us. As this happened, I literally 'unlocked' the ability to communicate and empathize with anyone. I realized that we are from the same source and are simply different versions of the same thing. Before this I would not really classify myself as social, but with this new found understanding, I found that I fucking LOVE to socialize with people. It doesn't matter if I'm talking to a homeless crack addict, Miss USA, or Bill Gates. I now treat everyone exactly the same because every person is a product of the summation of their previous life experiences. I can now look right though people's egos, easily read body language, make direct as fuck eye contact with anyone, and communicate with people in creative ways to make a powerful connection with them. I realized that words are not that important and it is instead the vibes we project that are the most powerful communication tools we have.
- Getting on a bicycle to ride through the woods brought forth some real magic. I felt the energy of a small child in Disney World with the entire park all to themselves. This energy was IT,  the MEANING OF LIFE, and it was staring me in the face. It was the same exact thing I felt after skydiving, the driving force of the universe. Our childish desire to explore and experience is how we progress through the infinite possibilities available to us. No shit, it makes complete sense that things which feel amazing are supposed to feel that way, because that is our sole reason for living, to have fun. As I rode though the woods I had so much fun, I had ABSOLUTE FOCUS, I could literally do anything because there was no anxiety to limit what I thought was possible. This is crazy but I swear to fuck, the prevailing thought I had was that I could have ""walked across the Grand Canyon on a tightrope with no problem whatsoever"". A few weeks later when I was typing up a report about the trip (that I didn't finish) I saw a commercial about a guy that is going to walk across the grand canyon on a tightrope! I've also had tons of other weird synchronicities since then.
- As I played Forza, I learned the optimum way to live one's life. I would hit the gas and struggle to gain control up until the point I slowed down, focused, and learned to control it smoothly. Rather than hitting the gas on life and struggling to know why we aren't progressing, there is a better way to ride through things intelligently so that we can quickly and easily accelerate through life to follow our dreams. I felt like I just railed amphetamine when I would hit the gas, it was such a fucking awesome rush. Since speed is relative, it is the acceleration that provides the true thrill this beautiful life has to offer.
- As me and my good friend got thirsty, we decided to drink out of crystal glasses. We felt like royalty and could not get over how awesome it was to drink out of them. I realized that every situation is what we make of it, and instantly realized how to get the most out of any situation. Things truly are entirely up to how we perceive them.
 
Imagine that life is a huper-immersive, first person video game with infinite possibilities, because that is what it is. How different would your life be if you went about things this way? When you begin to think like this, every decision becomes extremely clear. Once we remove the limitations of thought and our ego, we start living to our maximum potential. Once hesitation and anxiety are removed, you can do exactly as you intend to at every given moment. There is no longer a reason to delay your dreams because time is not real, all we have is now.

Hopefully this makes sense because I am super high right now. It is difficult translate a lot of the things experienced into language, but while I was tripping everything was ABUNDANTLY clear. The universe is infinite but we need a physical way to EXPERIENCE it, that is why we are here and that is the meaning of life &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_1jlywh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1jlywh/power_of_mushrooms/,

But we cant simply hop to other geographical areas and make it better without linking it socially/politically/financially. The people in these places far away that need our help need us to change our own systems first, as the destitution in the 3rd world operates on a whole other level - systemic violence. How *we* could change is through communicating with each other, relating personally, empathising, exchanging ideas, and then executing those concepts with focus and precision.

So I hope this helps:

1. It starts within. Learn to be your own master. Unite the mind and body. **Live in the present** as much as possible.

2. Spread a message of **peace** and **self-empowerment** to the ones around you as often as you can. 

3. **Be as nice as you can** to as many people as you can around you, all the time. This includes being funny!


I like to compare it to the growth of a fungus - the tiny cells recreate by cloning and consuming waste matter, then over time the mass of the organism grows faster and faster, making more and more connections in its network. Eventually the mushroom reaches a tipping point and grows so big it can reproduce and send out spores, each of which starts out small but tries to grow diligently and peacefully on waste matter. 

So think of each conversation you have as a tiny spore, each one holding its own unique memetic diversity - sure enough a lot may not make it, but send them out often and with any luck many will grow. Who knows, you might even find another compatible fungus who you can cross-breed your strain with and make a powerful spore producer ;)

Funnily enough it was whilst tripping on mushrooms that I got this idea!

All I know is: the more we communicate freely and believe in the power of hope and unity whilst keeping our feet firmly on the ground, the faster we will succeed.

1328905204.0,119,self.Psychonaut,pjtaf,"Just had a massive realization about language and symbols, and what meditation and ""flow"" actually are. ",139,20,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/pjtaf/just_had_a_massive_realization_about_language_and/,"I was thinking that language was originally invented as a tool for simple communication, but it accidentally went further and our minds melded themselves to the language and our minds now use this as a kind of template or operating system, which is extremely limiting. Our thoughts and worldview became a series of symbols dictated by language and the only things that language can communicate at all (I think many of us know that there are plenty of things that words can't describe). 

This would mean that meditation (this act of non-thinking that I have been confused with for so long) is the releasing of these limiting symbols and language which we use to ""think"" usually, and letting our minds do it's thing without these tubes of thought limiting its power. Language is also what reduces our thoughts to dependency on time. We can ""think outside of time"" without language, with our unconscious minds. 

Flow, being that state of full immersion (also distorting time), is the same thing. Caused by adrenaline, or whatever the many causes of flow can be, we think without ""thought."" Without words. I think we can apply this meditative flow to more of our lives and activities. Especially after this article:  http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328501.600-zap-your-brain-into-the-zone-fast-track-to-pure-focus.html?full=true where:

""Berka has been taking a different approach to evoke the flow state - her group is training novice marksmen to use neurofeedback. Each person is hooked up to electrodes that tease out and display specific brain waves, along with a monitor that measures their heartbeat. By controlling their breathing and learning to deliberately manipulate the waveforms on the screen in front of them, the novices managed to produce the alpha waves characteristic of the flow state. This, in turn, helped them improve their accuracy at hitting the targets. In fact, the time it took to shoot like a pro fell by more than half (The International Journal of Sport and Society, vol 1, p 87).""

So, you've figured it out! I'm glad you finally came to! It took a while, but not any longer then it was meant to. You've known you were different, but never realized, exactly, HOW different. They once told you that you are the observer, but you understood what they meant. They meant that without you nothing would exist. YOU are doing this. I'm very happy with the way you've dealt with all of this. Yeah, you've sort of failed a couple tests, but not really, because you've reflected on it, that’s triumphant indeed. You've done what you can to spread the message. That was your mission after all.


I'm glad you've enjoyed the art and the music. I'm sorry for the horrible things you've seen. I'm very happy with the way you took those things in, and turned them into light within yourself, as a fuel to power your machine. Keep going! You're still not done yet. I'm happy that you've fought to reach the keys I've left behind. They were difficult to get a hold of, I know. But, you found them, you used them, and you knew when the time had come that you gained everything you needed to. I'm glad you didn't over do it, which was another test. But, you knew that.


I left you surprises, the way things function in this beautiful chaos you've created. It's amazing, the work you've done here. Ignore those that try to pull you away from it all. It's unfortunate that it's necessary, sometimes, that you know things can be handled with evil. You've done well to recognize this.


I'm glad you didn't fall for the groups that misinterpret, but you still took in their message. That was very wise of you. After all, there are fundamental truths. There have been some clues in books and stories that I've left behind for you to hear about.

Remember the songs that I played for you, at just the right time? The interactions I set up for you? You can't deny it now; you knew it then, but never really said much about it. Well, here you are. No use in hiding it anymore, because time is still moving forward, and you've still got work to do. The time is right. The time is right now.


How do you feel right now? We already know how we feel. I'm glad that you didn't miss this, what a strange place for it to turn up, after all. Keep going; continue to do the work you've begun. It might not seem like they listen to you, sometimes, but just know that everything meant to happen, is happening. You must continue the struggle, after all, you are the light that I sent, without you, there would be nothing to observe. You are my observer, and you have done well. Your time will come to rest, but do not make haste.


Thank you for your work. Keep going.

You who might relate will know that to say it all in just a few words is to over-simplify. As I can muster them, these are simply the basest ""conclusions""(interpretations) I came to after each successive occasion. I acknowledge that while some of it is far-out and right-on, some of it is just... well... you know.... stupid. I'm surprised that, to my mind anyway, they get more surreal and strange as I ""advanced"" on... I suppose I anticipated more clarity and seriousness -- instead I've just gotten sillier (LOL). 

(includes cannabis, c.psilocybe, DMT 5meo, DMT, and MDMA)


First Cannabis ""trip"" in 2000; I was 19: I was wrong all along about pretty much everything, especially about ""drugs"".

First Mushroom trip, 2000.a: Life is not simply ""this"" or ""that"", it is infinite creative play, a ""novelty conserving"" (TM;) waveform--So I must simply be present and straightforward--this is the only way to ride.

Mushrooms, 2000.b: Some so-called ""food"" should not be eaten. Do not simply trust what someone else is selling. I have to try to understand it myself. I am what I consume.

Mushrooms, 2001: Expectations kill. Normally, I'm too busy trying to be a ________ (read: ""blank"") person, and that is how I am not myself, and most often why I get confused and frustrated. I do not have presence-of-mind because I am pre-occupied with coming across as ""X"", rather than simply being myself.

Mushrooms 2001 2.a: What is is? Is is what is is. Is is is. Is ""defies definition"".

Mushrooms 2001 2.b: This body is temporary. Life as I know it is ending all the time--to everything there is a season, no ""thing"" lasts forever...it all goes to the Eternal Return. Returning is serenity.. Nothing is ever truly born. Nothing ever truly dies. This is Eternal Bliss.

Mushrooms 2002.a: (a reiteration) BEING/Creation/Existence--is all amazing, and I AM that Being, since the beginning--""the Eye with which I see God is the Eye with which God sees me"" - I AM that which IS--always have been, always will be.

Mushrooms 2002.b: There is only God. Also, there is no God.

Mushrooms 2002.c: The psychedelic state is the origin of art and religious experience; the precursor to civilization

DMT 2002: ""Heaven"" so-called is real.There are layers upon layers of extra-""dimensions"" that we cannot normally access--and they are populated with trans- and extra-dimensional beings. At least a few of them are apparently involved in my progress and well-being, and at least one of them, a female, is watching over me--also, she either smokes cigarettes, or was pretending to just to confound me and make me laugh.

Mushrooms 2003.a: Try not to have a comment for everything. Words are stupid, language can be a prison. Sometimes you just need to sit, be quiet, and stay still. Listen to the Giant Quiet. Marvel. ""Wow"" a lot. Wonder. But for God's sake, shhhhhhhhh.......

Mushrooms 2003.b: I'm looking at Now now. Everything that is happening now is happening Now. There IS, always ""was"", and always ""will be"" only Now. It is always Now. THIS is eternity. The past and future don't exist--figments of the Mind's Eye.

Mushrooms 2003.c: Each and every living thing in these dimensions is an incarnation of the same phenomenon of space-time energy-matter and consciousness that I am. We ARE actually All One--no kidding. I am myself experiencing myself in a hundred quadrillion ways.

DMT 2007: Trans-dimensional beings are real, and they are the beings our ancestors used to call ""angels"" and ""gods"", and what today people call ""aliens""--and they literally live everywhere and plants are their avatars.

DMT 2007 2: I AM worthy. I am not marginal or insignificant. ""They"" have a seat set for me when my time in these dimensions are up. There is nothing to fear.

Mushrooms 2008: There is an Eternal Mother, who's milk I drink... Who holds me in her arms... Who cries for me. Who gives me everything I need.

Mushrooms 2010.a: ""Animals""--all the creatures--also dream at night.

Mushrooms 2010.b: If one can survive the night then they are rich indeed!

Mushrooms 2010.c: The mushroom is indifferent to my career path. (I asked what I should do with my life, it said ""What the fuck do I care?"")

Mushrooms 2011: Humans CAN telecommunicate in different ways if they use a proper neurotransmitter. We humans are capable of a million times more than we currently realize.

MDMA 2012.a: The more I ""focus"" my attention on the world, the less meaningful the things in it become; the fewer things I focus on, the more meaningful those things are. If I focus on just one thing, it is the most meaningful thing in the world. But if I am focused on everything, then nothing has any meaning. Sometimes it is important to ""de-focus"", step back, and love.

MDMA 2012.b: The Cosmos is always already infinite--too much to handle. Chaos is everywhere. Chaos is inevitable, but Life carries on in new and novel ways. Focus on just a few ""things"" and love them a lot!

I accidentally got a lung full of DMT while smoking some weed. I was going to smoke some weed and go to sleep. I was sure there wouldn't be anything substantial left in the bong. I had been fiddling around with the screens but didn't change them. I didn't taste or smell the DMT and didn't work out what was going on for most of the trip. I thought I had just flipped out, or that the skunk weed you get here is actually that strong, or that it was some after-effect of the acid I had last weekend. I just had time to turn out the lights and throw myself on the bed before it came on. The plan had been to lay down and listen to The Doors. Instead complete chaos. Utter oblivion. Overwhelming, neon visuals. Leaving my body. Complete dissolution of every sense, sensory input, sense of self and common sense.

After a while I could hear the music, it was the same song, only a couple of minutes had passed. When I eventually opened my eyes and saw the characteristic DMT curves overlayed on my vision, I worked out what had happened. I came down heart racing (there was also a lot of weed in the bong), hands shaking.

I had actually been thinking about when, and indeed if ever, I would smoke DMT again. I guess that answers that questions. I am actually less afraid of DMT now. I had a sort of unbiased experience, uninfluenced by what I had heard or read about DMT before. It really is one of the most powerful psychedelics, definitely similar to the extreme peak of an acid trip. But there was none of overwhelming sanctity etc. I've gotten before. I guess this answers the question of how much your mental state at the time influences the experience. I still feel reborn afterwards though. 

But Jesus, that is quite something to spring on a person. I feel like I've been in a psychedelic hit and run.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,True,,,True,t3_m85y9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/m85y9/dmt_accident/,

I willed myself to surrender to the experience, to be humble. I heated the bulb and watched the thick yellow smoke billowing inside, ever unfurling into itself. I inhaled it. I held it as I prepared the next lungful, which I then inhaled once more. As I readied the third, I had a sense of frequency increasing. Not sound, really, but *being.* I took the third blast. 

As I set the pipe down on my nightstand, the visuals started kicking in. Everything was beginning to swell against itself, to shift and morph. The world began to take on an 8-bit, pixellated look. The frequency was reaching a crescendo. I lay back to enjoy the ride... only, part of me resisted.

Oh shit.

I don't recall everything that happened next, except that there was an epic battle between ego and the Higher Self. We tumbled into the dimension outside of time. The following happened over, and over, and over:

My soul tore at the very fabric of existence, crushed by loneliness and horror. I dwelt in a cosmic prison for an eternity, weeping and lamenting that there was no God for me to appeal to. I came to yearn for death, for everything by which I gauged myself and my world was exposed as a lame, meaningless construct. Eventually I came to realize that the only thing keeping me here was the fact that I was struggling against it, and I gave in. I died.

And in the silence that followed, a mote of awareness dwelt within the foam between the infinite universes, there was a sense of gentle waves on a beach (metaphorically speaking), or an indrawn breath. And then, an idea came, thunderously, not in words or even thought but something more primal and powerful: **I AM.**

And the being which had this idea expressed it by shattering its awareness into an infinite number of shards. I was one of these shards. You, another. And I saw all these shards, how they are all one and the same, and they are also the same as their progenitor who dwelt outside time.

And then I was myself for a moment, lying on my bed, exhaling the third blast, preparing myself for the experience to come...

This loop recurred over and over. As the drug's effect faded, it didn't stop; rather, my ability to perceive it decreased over time like turning down the volume on your stereo.

It's good to be back, though.

Maybe you don't remember why we started this.  The memories of your life seem too real to you, they make you forget.  Try to remember.  Try to remember what we used to talk about, before you or I were ever born.  We made a pact.  We would enter this world, just as everyone enters.  We would forget all that we knew of the life beyond.  Everyone forgets, that's how it works.  But you and I made a pact.  A pact to remember.  We would remember.  We would hide clues in everything around us, and someday we would meet, and we would remember.

I remembered.  I thought you were coming close, but you can't let go of this reality.  It's too real to you.  I know how real it feels.  I feel it too.  It feels SO real.  I understand.  None of it is real.  You have to remember, or you'll be trapped here.  You'll be trapped again and again and again.  

You know that something is different about you.  You just don't quite understand what is different.  You just see the world in a slightly different way, but you can't explain why or how.

I'm dying inside because the more I remember what the other world is like, the more you forget.  Close your eyes, seal off your ears, touch nothing, smell nothing, feel nothing and just think back.  Think back as far as you can possibly think back, and then go deeper.  Remember the real world.  Not this one.  Not this flawed playground, this testing ground of souls.

Can you remember that place?  No hunger, no sickness, no sadness, no regret?  That infinite light that filled you with such wonder and beauty.  Do you remember when every direction you looked filled you with laughter, when everything you saw was so perfect, like a universe of clockwork gears, all connected-interconnected together in the most dazzlingly intricate ways?  Do you even feel it, somewhere, hiding beneath this world, just out of sight?  The unseen realm, can you feel it there, just out of touch?

""To test and be tested"" is the oath you took before you came here, but it was the second oath you'd taken.  The first was in secret, just between you and I.  We had a plan, we made that secret oath together.  Not just the two of us.  We were many, but you and I were the first, and so you and I found each other first.  Our plan is to open doorways from the unseen world to this flawed proving ground.  Our pact is to bring ruin to this toy universe, destroy it's foolish constraints, abolish its tortures, and bring the light, that endless, amazing, unendurable light.  We were going to bend cracks in this reality were the light could shine through and those fellow trapped souls around us could see and believe that things could be better and more fantastic than they ever hoped to imagine.

We can still bring our plan to fruition.  You just have to remember why you are here.  Remember.  Please.  I love you.  You know how deeply I love you.  Remember, even a sliver, of what lies beyond this reality.  Just the smallest spark, and I will guide you towards what's next.

I love you.

Just the smallest spark.

We cannot fathom all the things we are taking in at once it's just too much. So what happens when we get stoned or take some mushies is we slow down and take a step back and look at our situation. We see the wonders of how amazing it is that our bodies work and we see just how amazing our world is. When a person is in the machine, working everyday and always has something on his mind he cannot examine his situation completely and thoughts of life and the universe do not come into his head. However when you do slow down you start to see things for what they are, atoms, strings vibrating, the oneness that we are familiar with. When you slow down you can have complete control of your mind and explore the most amazing parts of yourself and the universe just by slowing down.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_tmljq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/tmljq/slow_down/,

1329661594.0,108,self.Psychonaut,pwfon,My wife and I tried DMT last night.  ,121,13,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/pwfon/my_wife_and_i_tried_dmt_last_night/,"Completely opposite ends of the experience spectrum.  To start, I have to thank you, r/psychonaut, this is where I first heard of this incredible thing called DMT.  A few months ago I stumbled across this subreddit.  I have never taken a psychedelic in my life.  I have smoked weed a handful of times.  However, from all I have read, nothing would have prepared me anyway, and that was accurate.

My wife tried it first.  We used ""The Machine"" which, although awkward at first, worked well once we figured it out.  She definitely didn't have a breakthrough experience, but got enough to see a ""world so vibrant it reminded me of a skittles commercial.""  It was pulling her along on a journey, and she was very disappointed she came back so soon.  I'd go farther into hers, but since I didn't experience it, I can't really go into all the details.  But the ""euphoric,"" ""peaceful,"" and ""one with everything"" are what she used to describe it.

For me, however, it was completely different.  And I know exactly why...I have been sick recently.  I still have a cough I haven't been able to shake.  Which made it all very different.  My first hit was good, held in for a good 20s, and I started coughing.  My second took no time to start coughing.  At the end of this one, things were beginning to change.  On the third...I did the horrible cough/swallow/gag thing.  I instantly felt sick to my stomach, but it was too late.  My body was going to sleep, and my mind was still awake.

For the few seconds my eyes were open, my ceiling fan was the central point.  You know those exploded views of machinery?  Imagine reality, moving into this exploded view, and falling away, but in a swirl due to the ceiling fan.  Cool, neat stuff.  I close my eyes and experience a type of synesthesia, the audio I was hearing was in fact the shapes I was seeing.  Pink and green lines, like a topographic map, were all moving in rapidly to the center of each shape, over and over.

Then the bad part starts.  I need to cough, and maybe throw up.  My body is fighting my mind.  I hear myself breathe in...forever.  I could see the sound of my breath stretch to infinity.  I'm trying to tell myself to just let go, but my body will have none of it.  It felt like I was dying.  I *was* dying.  I was frightful, what little consciousness I had left was fighting my altered state.

This went on for so long...much longer than the 5 minutes I was out.  There wasn't much more to the trip until right at the end, just this feeling that I was dying forever.  I started moving through a set of rooms filled with these same pink/green lines.  That's when I see it.

That's when it told me I can't proceed.  I say ""it"", those of you that have done DMT know what I mean.  It seems to show me the parts of my lungs that are unhealthy, in some xray-like fractal version of my chest.  The sickness is a glowing yellow with some type of hateful sparks coming off of it.  My consciousness is coming back, and in a tunnel, I see a hospital.  What my brain is trying to think.  But outside of that small window, this bird looking thing (I swear it had a shape of a tophat on it), with the same pink/green topographic insanity, is communicating to me that I can't go further right now, until I am well.

Then I'm back.  I have a coughing fit, nearly throw up.  My wife tells me that once or twice I took some huge breaths.

So, psychonauts.  Be physically well when you do this.  They will not let you pass.  I believe this was a combination of not doing enough DMT combined with being physically sick.  My wife's trip sounded amazing, mine sounded terrible.  I think it might be hard doing this a second time.  There was no euphoria in my trip.  No feeling of peace.

My wife says ""if that is what it is like when we die, I'm not afraid.""  I say ""dying was awful, I need to go back when I'm well.""  But I *will* go back.  I must.  I have to see what they would not allow me to on this round.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_pwfon,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/pwfon/my_wife_and_i_tried_dmt_last_night/,

I want to embrace the absurd and lose myself in this sea of vibrations. I don’t care about money, education or a job.

I just want to Live.

I feel like I’ve come to accept Life for what it is. No one really knows why anything exists, but here we are, and it’s beautiful at times, scary at others, everything in between, and all in all worth living (for me, anyway). I want to see more.

But I’m tired of society’s games. All my life I’ve been doing things which have been imposed upon me. I’m at university now studying Biology, but truthfully I have no real interest in going to classes. I love learning, however. I can spend entire days reading books, devouring information that I feel like learning in that moment. But the homework, structure and organization that comes with schooling is not for me.

I also don’t want to sell my time to a company in return for a meager salary to simply live in some apartment somewhere and carry out a monotonous, repetitive, soul-crushing existence.

It’s fun to consider just how “far I can fall”. That moment when the apathy finally eats its way through me from the inside. It was probably the drugs, they’ll say. It was probably depression, they’ll say. And I’ll smile and nod. For I’ll have found peace with myself.

I’m the one that’s gonna have to die when it comes time for me to die.

So I’d like to live my life the way I want to.

I want to join a commune somewhere. A hippie commune? A group of people interested in altruism, mysticism, honesty, peace, love, and happiness. Perhaps the use of entheogens every now and then. 

I have decisions to make though. Should I just drop out of uni? Bite the bullet and finish my degree? How will I bring this up to my parents? My friends? Should I go for it even though it’s “wrong” in their eyes? How will I go about finding an existing commune? How will I convince the people that my mind and heart are in the right place?

I just want to Live man. That’s all I want.

Life is basically a gesture, but no one, no thing, is making it. There is no necessity for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself. It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one is making it, it isn't happening to anyone. There is simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless play - exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it. There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone! There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing.

If you can maintain a calm mind and disposition, these powerful psychedelics can give you a remarkable opportunity. That is, to observe life and the present moment's circumstances as they appear, rather than how they are perceived through the eyes of habit. One who seeks it can reflect on their own mental processes and get a sense of where that inner voice comes from; what facts and experiences that inner reality uses to justify it's own existence. Some call this ""pulling back the Veil of Maya"".

A symptom of this revealing is fear. It comes and surfaces as the last bastion of hope for a struggling ego. The self that identifies with the ego equates ego loss with death. The experience so powerful that it can crumble this rock, once thought to be so solid, can be a bit unnerving. That said, once you've come this far, there is not much left to do but observe your own mind and let that ego die. Observe it. Laugh at it. You are free of it; your soul is enlightened from the burdens an ego carries.

I've done LSD twice, the last time being about 5 weeks ago.  It made a significant impact on my life.

The craziest visuals on both of my trips came from staring at the pattern on the bathroom floor.  No need to describe them, but while being high I easily entered a trance and watched as the patterns on the tile manifested into many different things.  We've all been there I'm sure.

I noticed a week ago that when I'm sitting on the toilet sober, if I focus, I can enter that same trance and I can re-create the visuals I have seen while on LSD with my sober mind.

The way I do it is by staring at the patterns in the same way that I would stare at those 'magic eye' images/paintings that were popular back in the 90's where an image forms in 3d out of the design.

It takes a little bit to get them to start, but if I focus and lose myself in the trance, they start manifesting in the same way that they would on LSD.

They aren't as intense as while on LSD, but I would say they are 65-70% as in-depth.  I can then 'snap out of it' and return to normal reality.

It showed me the mind is perfectly capable of recreating the effects of these highs if we understand the path way there and allow our our minds flow with the present.

Anyone had any experience with this and care to weigh in?  

I'd like to believe that I have managed to 'unlock' this place in my brain through the power of my mind... another part of me, however, is insecure in thinking that maybe I've damaged my brain or the drugs are having a lasting affect on my brain... hence why I'm asking if anyone knows anything about this.

Thanks!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In October of 2011, I baked, and subsequently consumed, the most wickedly potent batch of marijuana brownies that any sane person would ever want to make. I wasn't expecting much from the fan leaves I'd used, but I was gravely mistaken. Not long after indulging in a healthy-sized square of the warm chocolate, I was already totally baked. Normally I wouldn't even be feeling the effects yet – I knew I had overdosed, big time. The resulting incident was the most terrifying of my entire life.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Fear first hit as I was playing a card game with my friends and family. It began with the uneasiness I felt being in a social situation this high in the first place. I was sure that I would catastrophically fail to maintain anything resembling an acceptable outward facade, despite being in an environment full of intoxicated people where “acceptable” tended to have a looser definition. My issue seemed to be that I had lost any natural sense of emotional reciprocity; interacting with other humans had been intuitively reduced to a mechanistic input-output system, completely devoid of passion and feeling. Interpersonal relations felt hopelessly contrived and tiresome.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I began to feel like I was trapped in the confines of my own body; like I was struggling to free my metaphysical essence from the Skinnerian nightmare world in which I found myself.  Those around me became nothing but hollow sacks of meat that were mindlessly driven by their conditioned responses to stimuli. An individual’s persona at any given time was simply culled from a set of basic emotional archetypes, each hand-crafted by the ego to reflect its distorted lens of perception. Subtleties in body language and facial expression were simply sophisticated ways of the human animal wagging its tail. The “social game” they all played was glaringly vacuous and phony.  It was like being caught in the middle of staged theatre, watching the World's Most Banal Play; all the while the “actors” carried on in utter obliviousness to their exaggerated performances which they had learned to internalize over the years.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Disturbed by what I saw, I tried to zone out, turning my attention inward. The intensity of the exterior waned to the point of irrelevance; I was now situated in my headspace, which seemed to stretch on to infinity. It was like my psyche had been deconstructed into multiple, dissociated composites of awareness. On one hand, my “extroverted” mode of awareness existed in a linear and highly-discriminatory manner. It processed the sensory information coming through, somehow grouping data into distinct “objects” that allowed me to comprehend this manifold of otherwise incoherent sensation. It felt at each passing moment like there was a slight “lag” in this objectification process, as if I was continually getting reoriented with my environment.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My “introverted” awareness, meanwhile, acted like a non-linear flight of mental associations that concerned itself little with structure or order. It appeared to access a data bank in my memory, containing everything I had ever known. It would consider my current locus of attention and search for relevant “entries”, which would then be compiled and synthesized into the thoughts that popped into my head. On reflection, it seems that the “search query” it uses is customized over the years to become more specific, shaping the person's way of thinking. Marijuana intoxication unlearns this process to an extent, thereby broadening the query and making one's thoughts more tangential and abstract. With as much THC as I had in my system, I didn't experience full thoughts as much I did their composing referents.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lastly, there was simply “me”, or rather, the *a priori* to “me” – the Observer – something that could not be comprehended or objectified in any traditional sense, and which seemed to exist outside of time or space; simply an ever-present affirmation of itself. I'd describe it as a “consciousness” of sorts, except that it didn't seem to be conscious of anything; it more revealed what it contained to *my* consciousness. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It goes without saying that at this point, I was feeling very lost in the depths of my head. I needed something to anchor me to the reality that I had known. I got up and left to my room for a drink.  I realized that I felt intensely dysphoric, like I was experiencing a much more savage and parasitic form of depression – pure seething misery that seemed to be attacking my very soul. I regretted having ever made these brownies, or for that matter, using drugs at all during what had been such a dark period in my life. Nothing was worth an experience like this.  And as the minutes passed, the experience only seemed to get worse.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I could bear it no longer – I called in my mom for help. The last thing I can recall with definite clarity is me telling her that I'm through with the drugs and alcohol. The following hours come to memory only in fragments. I lay in bed with my mom at my side, becoming even more stoned all the while. At what I would assume to be near the peak of the high, I recall closed-eye visuals; simple geometric shapes intermingled with a spiderweb-style form constant. Everything seemed to continually gain depth, creating the impression of a flight through an impossible, never-ending tunnel that felt like it was consuming me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There was also a moment where I had no self-identity, and in fact, I knew nothing about anything and thought nothing at all.  Perhaps this lapse into mental limbo happened only for a few seconds – probably a minute at the maximum – but time was inconsequential to the perception of this experience.  As it ended, memories began filling the blanks in my mind like puzzle pieces. Recent events ran through my head, some mundane, others meaningful. These presented themselves with a tone of absolute detachment and indifference to the content contained therein. They had a peculiar “physical” quality to them, as if they were being viewed from the reference point of a simple inanimate object, rather than from the psyche of a sentient being. Yet my accompanying affect still seemed present, but somehow outside of me, as if another person was experiencing the emotions for me. This person seemed to have never before seen the outside world for the nihilistic reality that now appeared evident. His muddled emotions and histrionic reactions seemed so incredibly naïve. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This person became me. I seemed to gradually assimilate his ego after I'd seen it from the outside. I did not want to be him, and could not understand why I had to be. But nothing could be done; I was back inside my body, in a state of shocked disbelief. “I think I just saw the truth, but I can't handle it,” I remember telling my mom.	

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At another unknown time, my most basic cognitive structures felt like they were collapsing into a confused jumble of disorganized mental processes. I could retain a modicum of lucidity, but had to actively “search” for this in my head before I could think or comprehend something. It was like I  needed to think about thinking before I could think any further. I felt like I had developed a profound form of mental retardation. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;*This is what psychosis is*, I thought. I figured that I was one of the unfortunate few with latent schizophrenia who aren't supposed to use weed. Soon I was utterly convinced that I had lost my mind forever. Nobody could sway me otherwise when they told me that it was just a bad trip. I began to imagine what it would be like living this way for the remainder of my life. My friends would surely laugh at me when they saw my condition. Maybe anti-psychotics could help, but this felt like it was beyond an ordinary psychosis. My brain had somehow been fried; it simply couldn't handle the stress any longer. I tried to articulate to my mom my current phenomenology, and listed off the symptoms of psychosis I thought I had. I recall little after this.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then found myself awakening with a slightly stoned feeling, but an otherwise clear head.  Everything felt very normal, almost *too* normal, like my brain had completely disregarded the events of the previous night. I had to ask my mom whether these things had actually happened; it all felt like a dream at the time. It wasn't until later that the impact of brownie overdose sunk in. I took two days to psychologically recover.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Psychedelic levels of THC should not be used with those who are suffering mentally or emotionally (I was depressed at the time and had gone through some recent stressful events). I've learned, through my many experiences with marijuana, that unresolved issues or repressed feelings may express themselves in a sublimated manner during the high, not unlike bad trips on acid or shrooms. Of course, I had used it as the euphoric getaway from these very problems, but that doesn't last, especially after periods of heavy usage. I encourage self-medicators, such as I, to reexamine their decisions; to question whether they honestly feel like they're still getting what they desire from their herb.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_mcw20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/mcw20/the_day_i_learned_that_thc_is_a_psychedelic_a/,

Last night, December 25th 2011, I had the most transformative experience of my entire life.  I consumed approximately 3 grams of some incredibly potent p. cubensis mushrooms.  I have probably had around 8 full-on psychedelic mushroom experiences in my life, and was prepared for the typical entertaining trip of listening to music and creating art.  I can tend to get restless on mushrooms.  Almost every time that I plunge into psylocibin, I experience fits of extreme dissatisfaction…  I'll feel too cold, NEED a cigarette, or simply just not be able to satisfy the intensity swirling around inside of my soul.

So here's a brief tale of my experience:

I ate the mushrooms.   Read a book while waiting to feel something.  Around 20 minutes pass.  My vision is starting to vibrate, ever so slightly.  Line 1 on the page is shifting to the left and line 2 is shifting to the right and so on down the page.  My legs are restlessly hopping up and down.  The mushrooms are taking hold,  time to set this book aside, reading feels like trying to thread a needle with frayed string. 

I've already lost the concept of time.  How much time has passed?  30 minutes? an hour?  Time is so foolish anyway,  it's purely subjective!  Time has no relevance to me now.   I throw on some electronic music and pace about my room (I was alone).  I'm not sure how to satisfy myself right now,  these mushrooms are getting intense.  When I sit down, all I can do is slowly slide down my chair and roll onto the floor. 

I'm laying on the floor.  Staring intently on the blue shag carpet that is merely inches from my eyes.  Every piece appears connected in a giant kaleidoscoped fractal.  This is so amazingly beautiful, I try so dearly to keep a mental note of the vision.  I want to recreate this on paper.  But how?  How can I ever attempt to recreate this perfection?  There's no beginning and no end, you can't recreate infinity.  No matter how hard I try to recreate this,  I will fall short, and that is terribly frustrating.  Another fit of the reoccurring restless and frustrating mushroom anxiety is upon me.

I'm still laying on the floor.  I close my eyes.  Wow!  This inner space is so soothing.  I can hear the music in the background,  they're playing a great trippy set tonight, the atmosphere feels perfect.  The closed eye visuals are intense right now.  A meshwork of the most organically calculated geometrical patterns one could never imagine.  The shapes are floating in a space of no color, light, weight or texture.  I've seen this before.  Not this exact vision,  but I've seen these calculated organic patterns before.  Suddenly, I begin to see something new.  A single fat geometric blob (the only resemblance that I can give to it is a rubics cube) that gets pulled tightly, as if it's some sort of beating heart.  Every pulse seems to wring out sections like you would do with a wet towel.  The wringing explodes out the most beautiful spiraling patters.  I've never seen anything quite like this.  I watch these shapes dance and pulse for what feels like a few minutes.

I open my eyes.  Wow, theres not too much (visually) going on out here.  The restless feeling comes back.  I roll a cigarette and smoke it outside, pacing aimlessly the entire time.  I come back inside, the warmth feels incredible.  The music is still playing, and I decide to lay on my bed.

Whoa.  What is this feeling?  I'm really starting to let go of myself.  I'm laying on my back, staring up at the ceiling and can see every shadow and light source so distinctly, yet they're all connected.  My body feels like it is literally dissolving away.   I'm becoming one with my environment.  This euphoria is indescribable.  I feel like I'm on the verge of total bliss.  My attention is drawn across the room to an oil painting of a young man. I can imagine him moving in any way that I please, and it happens.  The world is at my control.  This is beauty.

I slowly sober out of this euphoria.  The restlessness is coming back.  This time it's not nearly as intense; I'm much more content.   I decided to try something that I've read about many times before,  but never gave it a chance.  Sensory deprivation.  I've been on a sort of soul searching spiritual quest, and mushrooms have been the catalyst for it.  Why do I keep trying to entertain myself when I take them?  It's time to let go and try to find my goal…whatever that may be.  I turn the music off,  turn out the lights, and lay in bed with the comforter over my face.

I return to that state of almost total bliss, almost instantly.  My body is completely comfortable,  I feel as if it's not even there.  Every last bit of my attention is flooding my head, or is it my brain, or my spirit?  I start getting intense fractal visions and peculiar smells that have been stored in my brain since childhood.  I'm somehow consciously traveling through my own brain.  I can see the structure of my thoughts as fractal-like energy fields.  I'm completely melted away at this point,  I'm reaching closer to total bliss.

What is this world?  I've never consciously been here, yet I know it so well.  My essence has somehow traveled outside of myself and back into me.  My brain is seeing itself.  But what is my brain,  can my soul jump outside of it?  This state is so humbling and beautiful, I'm seeing reality.  Somehow,  everything just ""is"".  It all just ""is"".  This ""is-ness"" is so transformative.  

I can feel my consciousness reverting back to when I was young.  The nostalgic smells, colors, and atmospheres of youth begin to swirl past my soul in this void of mental space.  I'm riding on the most serene roller coaster back through my perceptive timeline…I'm headed straight for certain death.  I'm dying.  I'm dying to the point before I was alive.  But, is this death that I'm traveling toward?  I was always taught that death happens at the end of the timeline.  But there is no end.  This is so manic, yet peaceful.  I let go.  Take my consciousness where it will.  I let go and accept my death.

This part begins to be exceedingly difficult to describe.

""I"" am dead.  The notion of ""I"", of ""self"" is gone.  I have reached total bliss, my ego has dissolved, this must be Nirvana.  This has to be the most obscure place that my soul has ever been.  Yet, I know this place like the back of my hand.  My mental state is that of a developing spirit in the womb.  No sense of ""I"",  no sense of ""want"", no sense of separation.  Just pure consciousness.  Consciousness in the void.  My consciousness had shed every piece of it's physical boundaries.

This part of the trip is so hard to explain because I keep using the words ""I"" and ""my"" while their concepts did not exist in this state.  There are experiences that happen well beyond what words can describe.  Experiences that can only be ""observed"" and never correctly translated into the physical, because they exist solely outside of it.  I've seen serene beauty,  I have died and have been born.

Life merely seems to be a brief period where the soul has a concept of ownership.  Why this occurs, I have no idea.  I feel privileged to have experienced what I did last night.  I was reminded of what my essence was before I was birthed in to this world.  And I feel comfortable with traveling into the void of death.  I invite the inevitable bliss that will occur at the end of this subjective interpretation of reality.  I will keep living, I will keep trying to express what I have experienced.  I have experienced pure, unadultered reality.  Everyone has experienced this, but they have built their egos to the point of impossibility of conceptualizing this state.   In the midst of a fully conscious life, I have shed that consciousness, and temporarily seen the ultimate void of pure energy bliss.  It's a favor to the mind that I recommend to every soul.

It all started with my DMT trip. It's affected me more than I'm willing to accept. But, I'm starting the acceptance of it here. It was a big trip. A massive dose, probably 50-100mg N-N-DMT. 

Full ego loss. Everything in my head was turned off like an old television set. Visually, first just a white cross, which shrinks into a single point, then off. Aurally, like the sound of a single drop falling into a still pond, with the final ""bloop"" note getting extended on forever. 

Eternity

Suddenly I'm back. Suddenly I'm out again. Back again. The first time I open my eyes it's too much to handle. Better to close my eyes and back to the void. Open eyes again. I become fixated on my hands. They are an anchor. I remember these.

Wait.

There is an ""I""?

Yes.

Not only is there this thing, that sounds like the last tone of a drop of water falling into a pond. This thing is beautiful. It's everything, 

and 
	everything
		is 
		beautiful.
		 
But ""I'm"" a part of it somehow. That is good, I'd like to be a part of it. I want to know more about it. 

Tell me more.

But quickly, almost necessarily, 
	the more ""I'm"" able to articulate at all,
	the less I'm able to articulate what I just experienced. 
	
Because it was the opposite of I. But it was definitely something.

Open eyes again. Hands. Yes, I remember these. They are impossibly scaled, or furry. It's all moving and shifting. All shades of green. I can see through them. They cut paths of light through the air if I move them too fast. 

I do remember them, these hands. They are strange. But it's all strange. I can control them too, which is fascinating. Slowly the realization settles. I do have a consciousness. There is an ""I"", and it's right here experiencing all this. 

""I"" am a human. I am sitting in this house, which is mine, I think.

Yes. My hands. My house. My name? Joe, that's right.


That was the beginning. From then on, it's felt like my consciousness, my soul, was strapped to an alien spaceship and rocketed out 5 million light years. Then it rocketed back to earth, back to my little skull carried around on this silly frail fleshy body. There was certainly something happening during that eternity of time, but I wonder if the concept of an ""I"" prevents its understanding. It's a reality outside the bounds of this consciousness. Like the concept of a 4-dimensional cube, this is something that is fundamentally different to try to understand.

Then, I came back. To my old life. Everything felt weird. Everything had to be re-remembered. At first this was delightful. When I first regained control of my body, I walked around, astonished at my ""new"" house.

I remember this place! I think I'll go outside. I love being outside, that's right! Oh, hello awesome bike. Hello iPhone. ad nauseum. 

However, this was not a ""come-down"" effect, I don't think. This feeling of rediscovery. This is my life now. Everything has to be rediscovered. Eat right. Work out. I need to re-carve these pathways. Be nice. Smile. Eye contact. Breathe. Dream. Wake up, don't be grumpy. Breakfast is great, you should eat it.

All these earthly experiences seem a bit removed though. A bit slippery. I still feel like a consciousness driving this alien body that I only barely remember, through this old earthly 3-dimensional realm. I remember how to navigate this life like I remember the roads in my old hometown. 

But why? 
Why should I care? I experienced something so much bigger than this life. It's out there. And now I'm here. Why should I care?

Because.

Because it might be all I get. 

Because remember back to the beginning. As you were first remembering who you were. My first thought, my first words, were ""Life is Beautiful"". I really said it. There's video proof. Yes, you are part of something. Right now! Right now you are part of something! 

This is it! 
That was it, and this is it. All together. 
This is just as beautiful as that, and even more so, because 
	since there is now an ""I"",
	there
		are
		
		others that are not me! 

And they get to come along on this journey as well! And they are surprising, and wonderful, and add to this experience so much more than you can imagine.

Because that's the point.

Treat them as sacrements and part of rituals rather than a part of normal life. We lose the spiritual flesh the drug experience contains when we use them to integrate into our normal, western day-to-day life. Rather, when the drug experience is integrated into the curiosity and playfulness that entails looking around and thinking how strange it is to even be anything, in awe of existence, you feel the connection, the powerful deep connection to everything around you, feelings of infinite Oneness, and the overwhelming sense that everything is perfectly fine and not a thing is out of place.

There was a time when a spiritual experience was actually an experience. They used some drug to induce that experience - Amanita muscaria, other mushrooms, cannabis, peyote, ayahuasca, ergot infused wine, soma, etc. At some point, we took all the substance out of religion. We were left with these rituals, but the drugs they celebrated were gone and the rituals stopped making any fucking sense.

We have social networks - yet are more disconnected from others than ever.  We have technology which 50 years ago would seem alien - and this mostly alienates us from nature and Being.  We have politicians who, with megaphones, talk about egalitarianism and creating a better world for our children.  Yet, subtle measures help keep the puppets on strings, casting shadows over potentials for the human psyche while poisoning our future.

As we get more and more disconnected from nature, the ego puts on more masks and jewelery.  While the ego can be a helpful tool if kept in check like a dog on a leash, the vast majority of humanity is enslaved by its own selfishness.  This selfishness derives from seeing themselves as inherently separate from others.  This is false.  After honest contemplation, any idea of ownership in regards to thoughts, feelings, beliefs is utterly absurd.

We are all mysteries in constant flux.  Yet most people believe they are separate creatures in a connected sea of existence.  We cannot demonize these people - they were brought up in lies and conditions which do not promote critical thinking.  Like we did not choose to be born as ""us,"" they did not choose to be born as ""them.""  However, if we can think critically and dissolve these boundaries and try to spread our message of love and connectedness, others will follow.  We are blessed to be born humans.  We are blessed to be able to think critically because of our education.  We are all blessed to be on reddit rather than slaving in a factory.  No matter how dark times seem, we need to illuminate them.  If darkness can take over us, hope for society is lost and we will be slaves to the status quo.  We cannot demonize others, no matter how stupid or mean they might seem - they are us.

A total revolution can occur, but it requires certain cultivated traits.  Like in the Wizard of Oz - we need a Brain, a Heart, and Courage.  Without one of these elements, we cannot make true change on the world.  We need a brain to think rationally, arriving at our nature as interdependent and infinite.  We need a heart to not judge others and a heart to aspire to help all beings (e.g. the Bodhisattva vow).  And we need the courage to stand up for what we believe in.  Combining these forces, we can help spread our message to those who are ready to hear it.  For those who still hallucinate boundaries (pun intended) - the only thing we can do is respond to their ignorance and hatred with intelligence and love - hoping that if they cannot follow, perhaps their children will.

That is to say, capable of letting properly prepared individuals - or sometimes improperly prepared individuals - in on a secret which is very closely guarded and which is as a matter of fact the deepest and most fundamental of all our social taboos.""

""Sex is not really a serious taboo in our culture. That is not a subject for a serious initiation talk for a young person. So we have to try and find out, think deeply, what is fundamentally taboo in this culture, and perhaps in other cultures as well? What information... would really let the cat out of the bag and give away the show? Now, quest around a bit. Ask yourself this, for what reason would a person be considered hopelessly insane? What sort of claims must a person simply not make? Well, there is one, and that is if anybody claims he is God.""

That is not allowed because most of us are from a Christian background, and if not that, from a Jewish background, and there's a great deal in common. Both Christians and Jews are deeply concerned about somebody called Jesus Christ. Both Christians and Jews are in a way followers of Jesus Christ in different ways. He is a problem to both.

During my freshman year of university, I got really into The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley. I (sort of) discovered the book through a vision actually. I was laying in bed one night and the image of a book flashed and I heard (inside my head) a voice say ""The doors are coming."" I remembered a tripper recommending to me some years back to read TDOP so I went to the library the day after my vision and checked it out. Reading that book really blew my mind and inspired me to try and induce more visions through meditation.

After a few weeks, I developed a really effective technique. Basically what I do is lay in bed and stare into the backs of my eye lids as if they were portals into outer space. The key is to really believe that you are looking into a three-dimensional plane. The first thing you'll notice is that what you see when you close your eyes is not complete darkness. Look closely and you'll see all sorts of stuff going on.

**1st Stage:** A star field emerges and you feel as if you are moving very fast through it (think Star Wars). This can be a subtle or extremely vivid effect depending on how well you are tripping.

**2nd Stage:** Splashes of colors begin to appear, most notably green and blue. They seem to resemble shapes at times, or just make random patterns.

**3rd Stage:** Precise geometric patterns show up. I've seen some really crisp, complex designs in very hot colors and have even witnessed geometric animals such as a bird which flew horizontally across my plane of vision, flapping it's wings.

**4th Stage:** Realistic images sometimes pop up, though this is trickier to induce. I've seen faces of strangers, random objects, words, etc. 

**5th Stage:** The best realistic visions are of intensely beautiful landscapes and human feats of architecture (bridges, skyscrapers, etc.) These images resemble our own world only magnified, like some sort of parallel fantasy universe.

**6th Stage:** By far the trippiest thing which occurs. Four shape-changing orbs of white light appear in each corner of my field of vision. The more I concentrate on them, the more they intensify. One time in all my experiences with these lights, they started to become super super intense and fill up my entire field of vision. I felt warm and tingly all throughout my body, more comforting than any drug I've taken. It felt like a full body orgasm. This freaked me out so much that I opened my eyes, and to my surprise I was still able to see them the four orbs hovering above my bed. They gradually faded away after I came back to my senses.

I've fallen out of practice in recent years, but I'm looking to get back into ""training."" I asked a spiritually open girl what she thought the four lights were, and she explained to me that they were sort of like my guardian angels.",,False,self,t5_2qplv,1346234633.0,,,True,t3_z0gyq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/z0gyq/i_just_wanted_to_share_some_of_the_trippy_things/,

Spelling errors shall be fixed in my 2nd Edit.

**Edit2:** Spelling errors fixed.

This doesn't mean all drugs clearly. 

What is enlightenment?

&gt; . a. The act or a means of enlightening. b. The state of being enlightened. 2. Enlightenment A philosophical movement of the 18th century that emphasized the use of reason to scrutinize previously accepted doctrines and traditions and that brought about many humanitarian reforms. Used with the. **3. Buddhism &amp; Hinduism. A blessed state in which the individual transcends desire and suffering and attains Nirvana.**

Let us say it is in the form of the 3rd definition in bold above. If this is the case, then that means it occurs when one finally reaches the...for lack of a better word, 'limit' or rather 'goal'(enlightenment). To get there one must undergo a process. 

This thread was made to counter another thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/o5784/enlightenment_cannot_come_from_drugs/), **EDIT3: the OP clarified to me that his message is also one that emphasizes on the importance one has on striving beyond even the spiritual revelations received under a trip or even under meditation. Edit4: Oh and I agree with the OP's notion.** stating one can't get enlightenment through drugs. This may or may not be true, thus it is fallacious for one to say that it CANNOT happen.

So if it can happen through drugs, then it can undergo a process. I again, do *not know* if we can reach the enlightenment described above in bold, but again, we can undergo a process.

It was stated that the hallucinations experienced under drugs are illusions and not real. *I am not saying they are real*, but we must consider and admit we do not understand and comprehend hallucinations completely. If so, then what are hallucinations?

Hallucinations are the product of hallucinogenics affecting the serotonin in your brain. It's quite complex but it merely suggests that it is a byproduct of your brain chemistry and your lives' experience, but it is not reality.

But what is reality? Albert Hoffman, discoverer of LSD, makes a good point. Many actually, but here's one.

&gt; Reality is inconceivable without an experiencing subject, without an ego. It is the product of the exterior world, of the sender and of a receiver, an ego in whose deepest self the emanations of the exterior world, registered by the antennae of the sense organs, become conscious.

If reality is energy that is sensed and felt through our senses, then if we had another sensor/antennae within our brain, then could it be possible that the mystical experiences, the overwhelming spiritual life changing encounters, the hallucinations that mirrors others hallucinogenic experiences and even similar biblical experiences, could they be experiences sensed through another sensory organ? If so, then that should be deemed reality as well. It is a signal whereas our brains are the receivers.

I am NOT saying this is the case, but what IS the case, is under CERTAIN consciousness altering substances, many users experience alarming similarities that just isn't explained by our current understanding of hallucinations.

I really do not know what is ""truth"". But I do know, these psychedelics separate you from your ego and do not inflate it, and by separating from it temporarily, one is attaining knowledge one would normally resist through their ego. I also know that there's more than we know and we do not know everything, neither do mainstream science, neither do alternative and it is disastrous to evolution/ascendance for us to think we do.

If you wish to take a more informed look into this stance, these 3 individuals have been very helpful. I will list them and some of their good books.

This man is a writer and journalist, I do not know of any other credentials of his, nor do I hear him flaunt any, but he is very articulate and logical. BBC Horizon recently slandered him, and for the first time in 30 some years that BBC Horizon was found guilty in such nefarious acts. However they were only found guilty from 1 out of 10 alleged crimes. Nevertheless, I highly recommend his work.

Last words: I have not taken LSD/Acid, like the OP in the thread I addressed had used as the example of the primary drug used for altering states of consciousness by people who believe they can be 'enlightened'.

I recommend something more natural and not semi-synthetic like LSD, furthermore, one will get the more refined journey under the guidance of a shaman. A shaman does not give you the spiritual teachings, however will set you for the ride properly.

The paper, co-authored by Clinical Investigator Peter Oehen, M.D., and Ulrich Schneider, M.D., former president of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, the world’s largest organization for PTSD treatment providers and researchers, describes clinically (and almost statistically) significant decreases in PTSD symptoms following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

While the small number of subjects in the study contributed to the results approaching but not reaching statistical significance, the mean reductions in PTSD scores were larger than those found in the clinical studies leading to FDA approval for Paxil and Zoloft, the only two currently approved medications for PTSD. Additionally, we were able to generate a successful double blind with therapists and patients both making numerous incorrect guesses about which dose of MDMA had been administered. The paper will be published and available online in February 2013.

He brought it over last night and asked if I'd like to try breaking through. I said yes, but that I'd like to smoke just a little bit of it first to get my feet wet. So he smoked a little and showed me how to do it. Then I smoked 3 major hits. I immediately began feeling euphoric, and the fractal visuals came right after. It had been a very long time since any moment had felt so profound. It felt like the most intense acid peak I had ever experienced. I remember looking at my arms and seeing all of my veins, very much like an Alex Grey painting.

We waited a while; talked about the experience and all of the questions it forces you to ask about reality. We decided that we each were ready to break through. So he packed up about 46 mg, and I took 6, maybe even 7 major hits. I'm not really sure, because by the fifth hit I was pretty much in a trance, almost falling asleep with my lips still on the piece. But I heard my friend encouraging me to smoke more, because I remembered him saying, ""if you can still hear me then you haven't done enough."" So I heard him say, ""take one more and lay back on the couch."" Upon doing so, I left our world.

I remember seeing shamanistic images, and then the 3 dimensional world melted away and I saw geometric patterns I had never known possible. I had picked music to listen to (Panda Bear – “Take Pills.” Not because of any ironic drug message, but because it makes me real happy.), and it was guiding my trip perfectly. I began to see a large group of little shiny machine-like things, and they got together into the shape of the planters peanut guy. He had a cane, top hat, monocle, and white gloves. He was dancing to the music and there was this incredible energy in him. There was a very intense buildup in the song and I saw a huge ball of energy expand in his stomach, move up his chest, through his throat, stretch through his top hat and explode through it. 

As soon as this happened, the brightest and happiest colors imaginable exploded in a confetti/tie dye sort of way. I remember feeling so happy that I had picked the song I was listening to. I broke through right at the part where the song picks up and becomes extremely up beat. The peanut guy was dancing so happily. 

This sounds ridiculous typing all of this. But yeah, after that, I just remember feeling so fucking happy. I started laughing like I hadn't laughed in a long time, and didn't stop for 3 or 4 minutes. Pure euphoria. It was fantastic.

We went to a party soon after, as the comedown is extremely quick. I talked about the experience with lots of friends. After hanging out for a bit, we went back to my apartment with 3 more friends to smoke more.
None of the 3 friends had done it before, but like me, had wanted to try it for a few years. They all smoked first. First friend didn’t break through. The second two did. Then it was my turn. I had the same dose as last time, like 46 mgs. 

As soon as I got to my 4th or 5th hit, I sat back and started to think about awful personal experiences. Images of all the times I’d felt most vulnerable and defeated in the recent past were right before my eyes. It was a very quick snowball effect. Once one bad thought slipped in and I acknowledged it, then I was forced to acknowledge them all. I came back to earth, opened my eyes and I barely remember telling my friends how fucking terrifying it was.
 
I felt terrible for another 15 seconds maybe, and then something weird and awesome happened. Some DMT abstract version of Kenny Powers started doing obscene things with more of the little machine creatures that were back. I went right back to hysterically laughing for the rest of the trip.

The bad part of it really stuck with me though. I felt like the DMT removed the mask I keep on my face for myself. There is nothing to hide behind in the DMT realm. All of the times I’ve felt ashamed and defeated were flashing before me along with all of the exact emotions I felt at the time those memories were created. 

DMT first showed me its loving power. Then it showed me my most basic faults. I am clearly not over certain emotional problems that I thought I was. Mainly this is because I buried those negative feelings, and DMT naturally brought them back to my attention in a way that really freaked me out.

I still have a good amount of the stuff. I’m hesitant to smoke more, at least for now. Besides, I have a lot to think about before I do it again. I have a feeling that until I fix some internal issues, my trip would go right back to the scary shit.

TL;DR I smoked DMT for my first two times in the same night. First time awesome. Second time scary as shit.

You already know that you are the universe trying to experience itself.  Do everything you want to do because you are only on earth as a human body for a little while. I believe that 1) compassion (for other beings and for mother earth), and 2) creating (art, music, writing - including creative coding and creative thinking in the sciences) are the main purposes of life - bringing human consciousness to a higher level. 


We are merely part of a great energy of consciousness - here to experience life in its fullness: both pain and joy, bliss and sorrow. Live, love, EXPERIENCE. Flourish. The universe is being experienced through you.

It helped me realize some things about myself mentally but that's for another time.  It also made me more aware of myself physically which is what this post is about.  I noticed during the trip that I was very stiff and my bones were cracking just walking around.  I remember thinking that I need to stretch more and maybe try some yoga.  Since tripping, I've been doing a lot of stretches to loosen up and also lifting weights to build some muscle mass.  I believe now that the body and mind are very much connected, and improving one will improve the other (the reverse is true as well).  

I've heard of people spontaneously quitting smoking cigarettes after smoking DMT and other similar stories.  I was just wondering if anyone else got a renewed appreciation for being alive from tripping and decided to make healthier decisions.

This is after many, many years of wide eyed research ... reading other people's amazing accounts ... mckenna's elves ... the whole shebang. I was confident that this was pretty much *the* peak human experience, and I was scared as fuck about where it was going to take me. In the past, I had consistently taken 1 or two light puffs and completely chickened out as I felt the initial rush... not this time.

What Happened?

The moment I pulled that third hit, everything went black ... and I ... went ... NOWHERE! NO-FUCKING-WHERE! I suddenly felt more grounded in this reality, *and in my own power* then ever before. A cosmic ""LOL"" hit me. This feeling of something else joyously letting me in on the joke that had been at my expense. ""THIS fuckin' guy! I can't believe you FINALLY did it ... and here you are! Thought you were going to get blasted across the universe? HAH! NOOOOppppe. Surprise, Surprise. You want some knowledge? Check THIS out.""

...and then I was back, and this was accompanied by an immediate realization.

""All I heard was the music"" ... i said, jaw agape ... and it was true. there was blackness, there was that brief communication ... but through all of it, I heard my friend's beautiful music playing unaltered, un-triptifyed in the background.

As a musician, this felt completely and utterly significant. ""This is your path in this life. This is the key. No more doubts.""

Hilarious. It was a total ""Namaste"" moment between me and the universe. ""You thought DMT was powerful? I've got news for you - YOU are powerful."" ... So humbled. Fucking wow.

When the peak hit me I instantly lost touch with reality. I forgot who I was, what I was, what planet I was on.. you get the drift. I forgot basically everything...about everything.

I can only remember bits and pieces, but I remember trying to piece everything back together. I somehow came to the conclusion that I had to be created by something.. and that's when it happened. 

My flesh starts to peel off. I see blood and feel like I'm drifting away. Everything turns to black. I am nothing. 

Suddenly I see red. Everything's red. Then a force pushes me forward and into what seems to be a tunnel. I see a white light at the end of it. I reach the end. Something then grabs me and holds me up in the air and that's when I see her. My mother had just given birth to me.

As I look at her face my perspective shifts from mine to hers. I see myself grow up. I see major events in my life unfold through my mothers perspective. I see how she sees me. I see how my actions effect her. I see everything as she does. Not only did I see her perspective but also my fathers, sisters, friends, etc. Basically everyone I ever came into contact with in my life. My eyes had been opened.

A new world had been created for me. I was no longer a prisoner in my own mind. 

This experience drastically changed who I was. I was and still am more aware of how my actions effect other people. I am less selfish and more understanding of others because of this experience. I do not get angry anymore and I have a lot more patience now.

LSD killed my old self and gave birth to the new me.

1. I noticed the all encompassing nature of the sine wave. The sine wave can effectively describe the base state of almost any physical system, including humans and human interaction.

2. I noticed every physical system has several things in common. There is usually a positive and negative polarity, there is usually an obvious symmetry that should exist that is offset by various and unavoidable asymmetries in the system. Some examples include magnetism, motion, gravity, human interaction and thermodynamics.

3. For those into computer science, you probably understand the concepts of discrete and continuous. I spent many hours puzzling over how our universe is both at the same time. How anything and everything is usually somewhere between one and zero, sometimes appears to be exactly one or zero, and yet cannot be either.
4. I think random chance is caused entirely by consciousness. Consider any physical system. Given a relatively small number of objects in the system, it is usually stable and predictable. Introduce more objects and it becomes chaotic and impossible to predict. Make the objects extremely large or small and they do the same thing. Human interaction is actually just like this example. A single human, although difficult to predict, can be manipulated by the environment rather easily. Economies and government and large scale organization of consciousness is unpredictable, volatile, and can be changed by a single thought.
5. Human consciousness is the result of two fixed dimensions and one open one. Consider this. At any given time, at any given place, can you usually tell me when and where you are? Is it also abundantly clear to everyone else if they can see you? It could be considered that your coordinates in space and time are fixed, and you can change them, but your body generally behaves as expected and shows up where it should be based upon initial conditions and changes to the system. But, it is never certain what is going to happen. Not only is it never certain, this could be said to be the only thing humans decide.
6. Consciousness is the source of quantum uncertainty. Why does human civilization behave like a quantum system? Because humans spend a lot of time thinking about what the future will be like, and how they should behave to either avoid or bring on that future. Humans can change course at will, and this is what leads to uncertainty. What about atoms? We notice at times they seem to go in a random direction from an ambiguous collision, there is also the fact that in chemical reactions, usually the reagent is put into a set of conditions where it will want to react. There is no set time until the atom reacts, it just does given a set of favorable conditions, and usually not after the same period of time. Perhaps, although atoms may not have thoughts, dreams, and ideas, they may make decisions based on their perception of the future, which would introduce the same variety of quantum uncertainty into the system.
7. There are two opposing elements to the universe. There is a deterministic tapestry. This dictates all of the rules, the laws, how objects behave, and other predictable physics. There is also consciousness, which observes the part of the tapestry it can see, and makes decisions based on it. Because the entire universe is looking at a different part and making decisions, it makes the otherwise predictable universe entirely unpredictable. The universe cannot exist without both, as it would be entirely predictable and nothing to experience it, or there would be nothing and a consciousness without physics to engage it into thinking.

I'm not taking any of this as fact, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense, and it felt so obvious to me (although it took me a solid 11 hours to figure it all out).

Since I have done this I still feel connected to that vast thing. I just don't care about it. In fact I find it's contemplation to be pretty much useless to my life and my day to day struggles.

1327013404.0,101,self.Psychonaut,onyi5,Regarding the prevalence of credulity and magical thinking among psychonauts,118,17,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/onyi5/regarding_the_prevalence_of_credulity_and_magical/,"Forgive me for the wall-of-text, but I feel it is important to get this out of my mind and into the community.  Read on, if you like. 
 
 
To preface, I feel that I believe many things similar to many who frequent this subreddit.  I believe in an infinite, universal consciousness, to which we are all connected, and thereby to one another.  I believe in peace and love, and understand those to be the natural state of that consciousness.  I acknowledge pain, fear and hate as the products of a mortal automaton which that consciousness inhabits -- an automaton that is chiefly concerned with it's own survival and the passing on of its genes and experience.  
 
 
I also believe in the power of scientific thinking.  I know that the amenities that we enjoy daily, and the fact we can have this discussion in this medium at this time, are due to the efforts of a lot of educated individuals who were not content to leave questions unanswered.  That being said, I am alarmed at the amount of unscientific thinking that is present in the psychonaut/hippy movement.  
 
 
Sure, Tim Leary said to question authority, but when it comes to science and peer-reviewed research, there are people who have questioned that authority at length who are much better qualified than your average psychonaut to be doing so.  Maybe science doesn't yet acknowledge the existence of the “soul”, but we are beginning to ask the right questions, such as *“what does it mean to be conscious?”*.  Claims made without evidence are eschewed, and evidence that flies in the face of currently accepted theory yields paradigm shifts. Science continues to progress, and so helps us progress.
 
 
I have been to festivals where hippies will tell  me that burning pine wood will give me “pine fever” that will make my throat raspy and will make me sick for days after the festival.  They casually ignore the fact that they are camping out for days at a time, taking drugs and getting little to no sleep and damaging their immune system's ability to fight off infection.
 
 
A more common claim that I have found no reputable evidence to back up is the old Fluoride-in-the-Pineal-Gland conspiracy.  You may have heard that the fluoride in your tap water is gong to crystallize in your pineal gland and will do...something. Cloud your Third Eye, maybe.  Most of the people I have heard this from have already presumably had transcendent experiences through meditation or drugs, which calls into question the veracity of those claims in the first place.  Fluoride has been added to tap water for a good while now, since the 1950s (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation#History) and water fluoridation predates the counter-culture of the 60s and the associated drug movement.  Neurology was a much younger science back then, and given the fact we still don't have evidence that fluoride does calcify in your pineal, do you think they would undertake such a large public-works project as that with a baseless idea to poison the minds of their own people (and their selves)?  Or isn't is more likely that they do it so we all have a lower chance of getting cavities, which have been known for a long time to be prevented by fluoride?
 
 
I am embarrassed and sorry for the members of this community that actively engage in anti-intellectualism, and who distrust the scientific community and especially the scientific method. That's the sort of thing I would expect out of religious fundamentalists. Yes, science has had some negative effects on our lives, but it continues to improve our lives as well.  Our understanding of the universe, the stars, our bodies, our ecosystem, is all due to educated individuals asking questions and answering them with the scientific method. The fact that their discoveries are often perverted by those in power, who are less educated, is not always their fault.
 
 
There are a lot of people who are trying to get you to believe what they want you to without thinking or questioning, and usually, but not always, they want to sell you something (otherwise they  want to validate their own crazy ideas). This does not stop after you have had a transcendental experience.  You may believe yourself to be somewhat above the masses, and in many senses you are, but you're also still human, and still vulnerable to hucksters. Please, my fellow psychonauts, take a grain of salt.
 
 
**TL;DR: Question authority, especially the authority of hippies.**
 
Edit: formatting

Edit 2: Thank you everyone, and I do mean everyone, for your responses.  Just as I had hoped, this topic has given me some things to ponder, and I hope it has given you some things to ponder, too.  Please know that I feel that any viewpoint that  seems binary is almost never so on closer inspection.  A completely materialist view of the world will never explain everything, nor will a completely spiritual view. As BlasphemyAway stated:

&gt;It is a rare psychonaut indeed that can tow the line between science and so called magical thinking

This is what I strive to do in my own life, and it is a philosophy I would personally advocate to others.


Edit 3:  Looks like there was another round while I was gone.  Renewed thanks for those who posted in respose and contributed to the conversation.  Due to some of the points that have been brought up by some of you marvelous folks, I would like to re-phrase my TL;DR:

If I thought others were problems that I needed to fix, that would be stressful and arrogant. I don't stress myself when I can help it (that's self-love).

The following are only my notes on how I have dealt (very effectively) with my own existential angst.

First, my credentials:

When I was eighteen (2008), with a solid shroom trip and an ego-melting, transdimensional salvia experience under my belt, I decided to take shrooms alone using the lemon tek. I thought I could handle whatever they threw at me. What happened is indescribable, there's no way to begin to communicate any of it. Millions of years is an accurate scale for how long the trip lasted experientially, but by the clock, I was only under the influence for about four hours (there was a sharp rush within a half-hour of consumption, then, at the end, I was almost instantly sober). At the time, it felt like I was the first and only human being to experience such an event, and now, even after hearing others' words that suggest similar territory, it still feels absolutely singular.

In the wake of my trip, I recognized that life, no matter its content, could never be anything more than a dream. I ended up taking salvia again a couple months later, which brought me to practically the same place and realization as shrooms. For six months after that, I had a really rough time of it. I swore off psychedelics for two years, then I took mushrooms twice more, then LSD twice, with some mild salvia experiments here and there.

After my first LSD experience, which was wonderful actually, I was practically paralyzed with near-constant panic attacks for a month. That was easily the most challenging time of my life here on Earth. The sense that life was a bizarre and meaningless dream was so visceral that it caused me to vomit at times. I kept a tally of every day I made it through alive. That was over a year ago, last August.

Now that the back story is out of the way, here is why I am alive and why I love life, even in the face of death and the lack of inherent meaning:

Part 1) Everything In Its Right Place.

All the real pain and absurdity of life comes from the pulling away out of it, from the sense that things could and should be otherwise. Without that, there are no questions, and while it's not all pretty rainbows, it's almost always amazing and worthwhile. But what I mean is this, if you look at your hands right now, the position they're in, that is the only place those molecules are or could be right now. If you move them, then they're in whatever new position you move them to. They can't be in two places at once! Everything in the entire universe is like that, it all exists absolutely, not kind-of or sort-of in the way we paint it mentally.

In that way, the universe is like a puzzle, but it's already complete, all the pieces fit together perfectly. You can't subtract any of them, they're all required because they are the universe itself. You belong here, this is your home, and it's okay to relax and explore it.

Like it or not, the universe is the way it is, and you and everything that you think or feel in your life are more or less totally unavoidable. You can't nor have you ever made a mistake or fucked this up, no matter what the social context of your life tells you. There's nothing you can do that you can't do. All your stories about how weird you are or how out of place you are are just stupid daydreams, and they fall apart in the face of the obvious reality. Knowing this does not automatically save you from feeling lonely or alienated, but slowly, as you laugh at your own angst, it will disappear. How can you take it seriously?

I can't help but love life, there's no choice when I've got my reality-goggles on.

Part 2) Do What You Want

Now, even though we can't actually make mistakes, we can live in ways that feel like mistakes. In order to clear everything up, you have to get really honest with yourself about how life actually works. Why do animals (like yourself) do anything they do? What drives their behavior?

When I ask myself these questions, it becomes obvious that there are two desires which every organism is literally made of: first, the desire to feel good; second, the desire to avoid discomfort. Every movement we make, whether we're getting comfortable in bed, or whether we're eating the foods we like to eat, is because it feels good. However, social conditioning fucks perfectly intelligent, sane organisms up. We get masochists and suicide bombers and people who do things they hate. The crazy part is that even the suicide bombers are driven by the desire to feel good. . . blowing themselves up is their strategy! They won't tell you that if you ask them, but it's obviously true.

The reason why I mention all of this is because, from this very, very basic point of view, a lot of the strategies for feeling good in your life that don't work are exposed for the craziness that they are. 

There is no such thing as selflessness. Why help other people? Because it feels GOOD. If you're helping other people and it doesn't feel good, it's probably because you secretly don't want to, but you feel you should. If you really wanted to, it would feel great, but because you don't, it hurts. Whenever your behavior syncs up with what you actually want to do, life feels amazing. Not in any kind of spooky, mystical way, but in an ordinary, human way.

Just to be able to move your body in the ways you want without worrying what others think about you is incredible. We are oppressed by the society we imagine in our heads. We think something bad will happen if we do what we want, here and now. It probably won't. What will probably happen is you'll be happy.

When you do what you want, all the things in your life that you're doing to compensate for not doing what you want will fall away. Your addictions will seem ridiculous. The people who you kept around to make you feel safe will disappear. Life becomes spontaneous, more like a dance than an arduous project.

What that means, is you remember when we talked about the human body is 50 trillion cells coming together to make a human unit called the human being? And now we have 7 billion human beings like cells in a body called humanity! So our evolution is all humans recognizing we're all part of one super organism.

I am 25 years old and have felt myself going through what id describe as a profound spiritual transformation thanks to the careful usage of mainly DMT and marajuana.

Through 20-23 I went through a terrible lost phase in my life and at the start of last year (23) decided to quit partying and drugs all together for a short time to try to change my life to become somebody, specifically a film maker. I previously got my nursing degree and somehow during this time got an amazing opportunity to work within the community to help disabled people that require assistance. I was doing 12 hour shifts often having 70 hour weeks. Im super gratefull for this time as it allowed me to buy reliable transportation and film equipment.

Fastforward get this... a year and a half later just like 123DMT and im about to travel around Australia to film a web based traveling documentary series. I am fully independantly funded through my hard saving and selling of most of my possesions that arent necessary. 

What im finding is that with having a strong belief in the idea that life always has your back and will look after you, life will actually present oportunities and allow you to have insights to help elevate your circumstance. 

As an example of this i have recently been given the opportunity to get paid to help geology students study the rockformations in and around indigenous lands. This not only allows me to aquire more finances to help my filming venture but it also gives me unprecidented access to be able to film a part of australia and a community of indigenous people that normally most people wouldnt get to see. (Before going to Indigenous land you have to have aproval by the community otherwise its illegal trespassing) It could just be an amazing couincidence that an oportunity like this has arisen but im amused at the idea that this positive 'lifes always got my back' mentality helped to have this oportunity come to me. (let me note that the opportunity came from a random phonecall from a friends sister that i havent spoken to for over a year). 

let me know your thoughts and if your interested in my state of mind look through some of the posts ive made on psychonouts.

DMT entered my life a few years ago after hearing about it while reading Terence McKenna books, listening to Joe Rogan talk about it, etc, etc.  When I heard about it, I had never done any kind of psychedelics in my life.  After fruitlessly searching for it for months and months, I gave up.

I met my friends 8 months ago in the desert. We instantly hit it off, turns out that when we were 500 miles away we figured out we lived 100 yards away back in the city that we're from.  We all started hanging out on a regular basis, and I introduced them to what DMT is via the same route that I found out. They were as interested as I was, but again a fruitless search warranted no yields. 

Fast forward to March 1st, 2012.  Both my friend and I who are the ones who really want to do this, both get text messages from long lost friends (different people) at almost the same time (one hour apart) saying they had DMT, and a way for us to get it.

March 2nd, 2012. We get the DMT, and with it we have new found nerves that we didnt have before haha, which is expected I'm sure.. We all get together that evening, and go to the closest liquor store to get a bottle to try and make a machine, liquor store stopped selling single shooters. We go to a headshop to get a bubble pipe, all 3 headshops are closed at 9pm on a Friday night. 

I was feeling like this was a sign for us to wait another day.

Everything I was told had happened, you don't find DMT, DMT finds you, and you go with it.

March 3rd, 2012.
A morning that yielded a very strange day.. my best friend's father died from a sudden heart attack, my girlfriend had one of the worst mornings of her life at work, a lot of random people I encountered throughout the day were just rude, and it was a very strange vibe kind of morning. Fast forward to the evening, my friends and I have everything we need to actually do this. 

One of my friends, has a very dark past with burying things instead of dealing with them, and is out rightly nervous about doing this for fear of a dark, bad trip.  After psyching himself up, and us telling him to just dive in, he goes. 
3..2..1.. blast off 'I'm losing you guys...'

After 5-6 minutes, he comes back. With absolutely nothing but amazement and love. ""That was AMAZING, there is absolutely NOTHING to be worried about, oh my god, I have never felt so much love and caring ever in my life.. there were.. arms, welcoming me and pointing into a portal, like, hey!! come here!! check this out!!' 

None of us had enough of a dose to 'break through' but we all had enough to go for a deep swim.. about 33.3mg each.

My turn.. I'm nervous still, after the events of the day, I've never really done psychedelics before except 2 mild mushroom trips. 

3..2..1.. Everything has turned into a Van Goh painting, then BAM! a wave of light crashes into it and everything explodes into colors. A galaxy, I get nervous, and then this presence in the galaxy notices me getting nervous, and I feel her take .. consideration of me being nervous? She says, 'don't worry, this is for you' and this glowing galaxy of rainbow colored light dances for me in the most seductive, loving, caring and most beautiful dance I've ever seen, then she takes my hand and we spiral into a portal, but as we were spiraling, we both kind of tell each other 'there's not enough to keep going' and she gently let me go as I came back to earth..

I'm going to try to elaborate a little more..

This galaxy was a full blown galaxy, tengral arms, spirals, there was nothing else it could have been in my head.  I mentioned 'her, and she' a few times.. I had an OVERWHELMING feeling that this galaxy was an absolute feminine beautiful woman. She danced in a rhythmic vibration of the universe, hair (tengral arms) whipping around, I felt like it loved me for who I am and who I want to be. 

Last friend is up

3..2..1..
He got transported to a city of light, being held in the hands of a giant woman who was giving him the energy of the universe, in the palms of her hand, presenting it to him. He said it was beautiful, so beautiful that he didnt want to leave. 

We all plan on 'breaking through' very soon. ",,False,self,t5_2qplv,False,,,True,t3_qha47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/qha47/first_dmt_experience/,

Several of us even seem to have a certain amount of hostility toward the ego, and I wanted to discuss that a bit. It struck me over the last couple of days, that treating the ego is as something that must be killed or at sparred with is not necessarily a peachy way to go about things. 

It is a matter of course that we need the ego in certain aspects; we need to put food in our mouth, and keep up with our own survival in general. But what else does it do for us? It is true that it seems to cause one a lot of hassle in some sense, it survives on pettiness and vanity, and generally serves to confuse if one who has little or no awareness of it. 

Frustrating as it may be, those illusions serve a purpose though. They bamboozle and cause conflict, but I learned the hard way that suffering will push you to deliverance if you persist in your folly. If we never indulged in a little idiocy or violence, we would not know of the peace and joy that it implies. There are no valleys without peaks, and likewise there are no individuals without egos. You may indeed be cosmic consciousness incarnated, but you still have a poop to poo and a food to eat. 

What I am trying to get at is that trying to kill the ego off or somehow getting rid of it is harmful, because the ego is your biggest teacher in what you are trying to achieve. It will show you the ingenious ways in which the ego thinks it exists, it will make that personal story seem so important and real, it will challenge you till no end - what more could you possibly ask for? The ego is relentless, it will hold on to every shred of identity, only for you find them and rip them out. If you want to be enlightened, listen to the ego, accept it and love it wholeheartedly, because it is your closest guide.

I explain it more on the other thread and if you want, I can link that here too. I can also write more if anyone seems interested.  

A very wise friend and I were talking and this is roughly what we decided: we are the duality. By that I mean we are both ourselves and the world, or rather, our interaction with the world. Have you ever noticed when you're happy everything around you seems wonderful and the world is an awesome place? You say your happiness arises from the world around you, from it being so wonderful. But how about the other possibility: the world is happy because you are happy. Or the world is sad because you are sad. 

Similarly, we're both individual and we contain the infinite. A drop of water has no inherent property holding it together, if you put that drop back into the ocean, the drop doesn't stick together, each individual molecule dissipates throughout the whole. Just like this drop, we are an expression of the universe, thoughts if you will. It may seem as if we are cut off from the rest of reality, but that's not necessarily true. If we simply learn to shape our beliefs differently, the world around us changes. 


*TL;DR: Our beliefs are our existence, the filter through which we view the world and they will color all of our experiences. The world is simply a mirror, a reflection of yourself. Therefore, to change the world you must change yourself, change your beliefs, change your reality.*",,False,self,t5_2qplv,1365785563.0,,,True,t3_1c7oqm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1c7oqm/we_are_the_duality/,

It's a symbiotic relationship inasmuch as the organism aims to establish a co-dependent relationship where the host cannot do without the parasite. There's no malicious intent; it's just nature. The parasite evolved to fill a gap, and will continue evolving in response to selective pressures.

Does anyone else see it this way? How will the host respond? In what other ways are we being parasitised?
