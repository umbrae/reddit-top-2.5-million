1353336672.0,3637,self.sex,13g9w5,Had my girl's eyes rolling around in her head. Confirmation of advice we see a lot. Thanks /r/sex!,5987,2350,641,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13g9w5/had_my_girls_eyes_rolling_around_in_her_head/,"So yesterday I decide to, in one day, try to use as many /r/sex tips I've read as possible. They worked phenomenally. I highly recommend trying at least some of these, because it results in fantastic sex for both of you.

First, I (27M) started by doing an all-day build up. My sister was having a family lunch, and on the hour and a half drive to her house, I started telling my girlfriend (23F) how attracted to her I was. ""You look beautiful today,"" ""There's so many things I want to do to you right now,"" ""I can't wait to rip your clothes off tonight,"" etc. I progressed like that, building up from simple compliments to explicit details of exactly what I wanted to do.

So we eat at my sister's, then have to leave because my girlfriend plays recreational volleyball and we have to get her back in time for her game. On the drive home, I don't talk as much anymore, I just had a hand on her the entire drive. Hand on leg, hand on head, subtle brushing of her boob, not so subtle dive between her legs. She had to change for volleyball, since we were going to be pushing the limit on how much time she had to get there. She changes in the car and had planned to be as discreet as possible. I told her I wanted her to do it slowly, so I could glance over and see her in different states of undress. She's normally pretty timid about stuff like that, as she doesn't want other people seeing her. Understandable, but I still made her go outside her comfort zone a bit. (She told me later it made her really hot).

I sit and watch her play volleyball. I give her my best ""I'm going to fuck you so hard"" eyes every time she looks at me. I could see her go flush every time.

We get home, she gets a shower and then eat. Then sit down on the couch. As we're watching some football, she starts kissing me, in all the places she knows I love (neck, ears, sucking on my fingers). I let her do it, I let her know how hot it's making me... and then I stop her. I sit there, watching more football. Eventually she starts again, and we make out a bit. And then I stop her. And then she does it again, we make out for a while longer... and then I stop her. She's frustrated now, so she just lays down on the couch. I lay behind her. Eventually, I start kissing her neck and nibbling on her ear. She's so turned on. I run my hands all over her body, everywhere I can. After a while of this, I put my hand down her pants. I start with playing with her, not inserting my fingers. I play with her clit for a while, and she's bucking and moaning. I was doing this from the front, but it started to get tiring at such a weird angle. So I move my hand behind her, and insert two fingers from the back. She goes *crazy* over this. Normally, to get her to come with my fingers, I have to stimulate her g-spot with the ""come-hither"" motion. Not this time. She's on the verge of coming after about 20 seconds. Right as she is about to... I pull my fingers out. She whimpers (the sexiest thing I've **ever** heard) and moans.

I stand her up and take her pants off. She takes mine off and starts jerking me off. As she's doing this, I reach around, get my finger wet with some of her juices, and press it against her butt. She's shy with it normally, and I have to kind of press against and then wait for her approval. As we're making out and I press against it, she shoves back against it. Basically begging for my finger in her ass. I comply. I start slow and shallow, building my way up to faster and deeper. She's incredibly turned on.

I tell her to lay down. She takes off her shirt as she's doing this, and I get on top of her and start playing with her boobs. Holding, grabbing, squeezing, kissing, licking, sucking. Then I prop myself up like I'm ready to insert. I get to the point of being ready to... and then stop. I go back to playing with her boobs. She whimpers but I can tell she's enjoying it. I repeat this process 3-4 times. Finally I put the condom on and am ready to insert.

Because I've been playing with her so long and my dick hasn't had any attention for about 10 minutes, it's not quite as hard. So I insert in her, and slowly push all the way in. She's loving it. I push in as far as I can and hold it there with as much pressure as possible. She is moaning, writhing, eyes rolling. Because of how hot this is, I get harder and harder (and subsequently bigger). Every second I get bigger, the crazier she goes. I held there for probably 2 minutes, as she's getting more and more pleasure out of it.

Eventually I start thrusting in and out slowly. She's enjoying it so much. She tells me she's getting ready to come... so I push all the way in and hold it there again. She's begging me to fuck her hard, but I just hold it. When I'm convinced she's back from the brink, I start the process again. Bring her to the brink, then hold it all the way in. I do this two more times till she's begging me to let her finish. I finally comply, and she came so hard (making me come, too).

She was unable to move for 5 minutes. I would ask her questions, and she'd mumble incoherent replies. She finally opens her eyes and just looks at me like I'm a god. I've never felt better in my life. When she's finally able to speak again, she says it's the best sex and best day she's ever had. She says that, when I first inserted and was growing bigger and bigger, she thought she was going to die from ecstasy.

/r/sex, thank you. Thank you for your tips and for allowing me to provide pleasure to the love of my life. I can't wait to keep getting better, and please her more and more. I hope I can help some people out, too, with this as a sort-of ""how-to"" guide.

The data was scraped from the [Internet Adult Film Database.](http://www.iafd.com)

I thought /r/sex might be interested in some of the results that relate directly to sex on film. Here's a selection of some of the most interesting:

- The average female porn star weighs 48 lbs less than the average American woman and the average male weighs 27 lbs less than the average man.

- The most common cup size for a porn star isn't double-D, D, or even C - it's 34B. The most common set of measurements is 34-24-34.

- Porn stars are more tattooed and pierced than the general population.

* **87% of female porn stars take a facial at least once in their careers, while 62% do anal, 53% interracial, 39% a double penetration, 31% swallow, 28% do a 'creampie', 16% squirt, 10% do a double pussy penetration, and 5% do a double anal penetration.**

- Porn stars have been making their anal debuts sooner over the last 30 years. In the '80s they waited about two years, now it's closer to six months.

- The most common female sex roles for women in porn film titles are: teen, MILF, wife (other people's), cheerleader, nurse...

- The most common first name for a female porn star is Nikki. For men it's David. The most common last name for both genders is the same:  Lee.

Here is the full article I've written about the results: [Deep Inside: A Study of 10,000 Porn Stars and Their Careers](http://jonmillward.com/blog/studies/deep-inside-a-study-of-10000-porn-stars/)

1365716818.0,2979,self.sex,1c5wdt,Will I get a yeast infection from having sex with uncooked pizza dough?,12059,9080,999,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1c5wdt/will_i_get_a_yeast_infection_from_having_sex_with/,"First off, I really hope that this is the right subreddit. 

Pretty simple. I was wondering if I could get a yeast infection from having sex with uncooked pizza dough. Should I wear a condom? These might seem like pretty stupid questions. I had a fairly sheltered childhood and I don't know much about sex. 

Just to clarify, I (m) have a perfectly normal sex life. I've been with my current partner (m) for about 2.5 years. I don't normally get sexual urges towards food or anything unusual. But I make pizza dough a lot and every single time I get turned on.

So, is this something I could do safely?

Edit 1: Just to clarify, I'm not insanely attracted to pizza dough or anything like that. These aren't uncontrollable urges. A lot of the intentionally funny comment are making me laugh hard. Also, if anyone is wondering, it appears that it's safe to have sex with pizza dough. 

Edit 1.5?: I appear to have a poor internet connection. So if I reply to the same person several times, that's why.

Edit 2: I'm starting to think I should have used a throwaway.

Edit 3: Woah. Reddit Gold. I really didn't expect that to come from a thread about me ""wanting to fuck pizza dough"". But thank you very much.

Also, because it seems to be safe, I am going to have sex with the dough. If anyone is interested, I'll do an AMA in [/r/CasualIAMA](/r/CasualIAMA) tomorrow around 3 pm CST, saying how it was and all that stuff. Thanks everyone for all your help!

&gt;My girlfriend has been hanging out with a childhood friend of hers lately. I have no problem with this, but recently she has been staying at his place until the evening and sometimes comes home pretty late.
Last week she stayed at his place for a movie and came home at midnight, I greeted her and she was acting normally but this changed when I started to seduce her hoping to have sex with her.
She told me that she was tired, not in the mood etc. but after a while of exchanging kisses she agreed to have sex with me. She tried to stop me from doing any foreplay but I insisted and started to give her oral sex.
This is where it gets weird: the smell and taste were pretty weird, in our 4 year relationship with at least 2 times of oral sex sessions per week I had never tasted or smelled that on her before. The taste was bitter and I could notice that she was uncomfortable as well, the smell was not her usual vagina smell, it smelled... Different... I stopped and had sex with her anyways.
Is this a sign that she had sex with the guy? What the hell should I do?
TL;DR After arriving from her friends house my girlfriend [28] had sex with me [25], I gave her oral sex and noticed she had a weird taste and smell to her vagina.
Edit: I'm going to confront her tomorrow. Just had a rough time right now and decided to drink something to calm my nerves. Might post a follow up tomorrow.

**Here's my update:**

While I was waiting for her to come back from his place today (again...) I decided to check her Facebook and Gmail, since I had this feeling that something was really happening. I found several messages on Facebook between both of them and several emails that were sent back and forth.

To sum it up, she was cheating on me. I found out that they had exchanged dozens of naked photos before she started to go to his place, I also found several Facebook messages that were pretty graphic and flirty. She was also planning in leaving me and moving together with him. 

I then confronted her with all the emails and messages, a fight ensured, lots of cursing and yelling. I asked her about that time that I mentioned in the other post and that I had noticed that something was off. She laughed and basically admitted of having sex with him before arriving home, but according to her with was with a condom, I don't believe in this because she takes the pill, so I'm going to get tested for STD's this week.

I was pretty disgusted and still am pretty shocked at all this, and gave her half hour to grab her shit and leave. According to a friend she is now living with him. 
It was as if she became a different person in a matter of weeks, I can't believe that this shit has happened with. 

She is now gone from my life, a 4 year relationship screwed. Been trying to raise my spirits and put my mind off the situation with a few friends. So, I want to thank everyone for the support and advice. I guess my instinct was right...

P.S. I know that someone linked my previous post to SRS and that those assholes are accusing me of rape. Screw them. I never raped anyone. 

**Edit: Thank you all for the kind words and support. I will take some weeks off the internet and Reddit to make up my mind and relax a bit/hang out with friends. Thank you for the Reddit Gold that was gifted to me. And I apologize if I can't answer all the private messages that are being sent, I'm pretty tired and I will try to get some sleep.

1333496725.0,2629,self.sex,rrzr6,I'm a mute girl who for the first time moaned during sex. Let me tell you about it. ,7325,4696,1284,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/rrzr6/im_a_mute_girl_who_for_the_first_time_moaned/,"Throwaway. I meant to do this yesterday, but I chickened out. 

I am a 26 year old female mute (selective mutism) with a boyfriend of 3 years who I have never spoken a word to. No sounds, nothing. Just silence. The only people I speak to are my brother and sister, but only if absolutely no one is around. I'm still on cloud nine about it because it was the first time anyone who is not related to me has ever heard my voice, and my bf is only the 3rd person on this planet that has heard my adult voice. 

Here are the nitty gritty details because I know that's what you want:

It was Sunday night, nothing special. We were sitting on the couch, sharing some ice cream, winding down from the day. I go to the sink to wash our dishes when he sneaks from behind me and embraces me. I instantly know what time it is (no words necessary). He kisses my cheek, my neck and strokes my hair all while holding me so close to himself. I can feel his heart racing in his chest against my back. All of sudden he turns me around and lifts me onto the counter. I am really taken aback by his forcefulness, but I like it. He rips off my jeans and starts kissing my belly which eventually leads to him giving me oral while I sit on the kitchen sink. God, it was good. He then lifts me off the sink, turns me around, bends me over and proceeds to bang the shit out of me from behind. He is so strong and forceful. I am hanging to the faucet and a cabinet door for dear life. He has one of my breast in one hand and his other hand between my legs while he's nibbling on my ear. It's so overwhelming (in a good way). I feel like I'm about to pull this cabinet door off the hinges, the room is spinning, and everything just feels amazing; I'm completely in heaven when it happens: I let out a moan. A completely visceral and unplanned moan. It scared me a little and him too apparently because he completely stopped moving and craned his neck over my shoulder. He had the most confused and shocked look on his face. He asks if I'm okay, and naturally I blush and nod and uncontrollably grin like an embarrassed teenager. We head to the couch to finish. Near the end as when approach our climax, it happened again. I moaned again, except this time there were many. He moaned and groaned along with me which so incredible because for the first time ever it was us two making noise together. I couldn't bring myself to look him in the face right afterwards, but when I did, I noticed he had tears in his eyes and rolling down his face, which led me to cry. It was a milestone I never thought I could achieve. 

For anyone reading, you should know that talking to people and letting people hear my voice is my biggest phobia. I'd be slightly more comfortable with a loaded gun in my face. With that said, I've been toying around with the idea of trying to talk to him. It probably won't be anytime soon, but who knows. I put his face as my background and have been practicing saying ""Good morning"". 

Edit: Wow!! I was actually secretly hoping that this would get buried. A lot of you guys are asking about mutism and my relationship, so here goes. I'm not trying to turn this into an AMA and I am pretty nervous about this, but I'll try. I am not a shy person, which is why I don't really mind sharing such an intimate part of my life. It's just a part of life. As a child, I was super anxious to the point where I would freeze up when people would approach me. My parents tried therapy, but just didn't work. They expected too much, too soon. The saving graces in my life are my brother and sister. They have never once treated differently. They would beat me up and make fun of me, but with love. They understood me and just accepted me and just let me live. My older sister use to, and still does, drive me around town and we talk and I get to air my grievances. High school SUCKED, but college was awesome (my brother went to the same school). I found a niche with the pre-med/psychology students who thought it was cool. Having outside friends who didn't care that I never talked really opened me up. I guess the best form of therapy I've ever had is living life with a few good people. College is where I met my boy. We had the same group of friends.  He's really patient. I mean REALLY patient. He wanted to go on a date (I don't know why), but I fought for months until one day I agreed (via text message). We write letters to each other every day. This is our medium for bringing up issues, complaints, arguments or to say anything we want. I leave Post-it notes everywhere and so does he. He talks by the way. I use gestures, nods, facial movements to converse with him and some of my closer friends. No sign language. We have to actively work on our relationship everyday, and there have been very tough moments. But he sticks around. Over the years, he has learned to not talk over me, but to at least give me a way to express myself if we're fighting or something. Again, he's VERY patient. 

 If you're wondering, what you're seeing is a person that has been fighting for 10 years to combat severe social anxiety. With his help and other's help, the anxiety has lessened over the years. Social media sites like Reddit and Facebook have helped as well. I'm pretty much just a silent socially awkward penguin. The last and greatest obstacle is letting my voice be heard. I can't explain it. I just feel so vulnerable. It scares the hell the out of me.

So first off, I'm going to start with what I consider to be general, ""gentle"" dominating, and then progress to things like ""rape""/light BDSM play. I also had some questions on how to do ""dirty talk"" so I'm gonna add in some suggestions/examples throughout the guide of things you can say (they will be in quotations).

So first things first, PLEASE, PLEASE discuss with your SO before you play, make sure you define your boundaries, and STICK TO THEM. It's always better for her to ask you to take things further later on, than for you to take things too far without her permission and ruin the experience and make her reluctant for her to want to try again! So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, she may not actually enjoy the reality of it once she experiences it so always play safe than be sorry!), and please be respectful of these boundaries. These kinds of activity require a great deal of trust from your SO, so please, please do not violate this trust.

Also, please constantly be aware of yourself and your partner during such sessions. If she appears to hesitate, looks anxious or uncomfortable in her behavior, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Ask her if anything is wrong, MAKE SURE NOTHING IS WRONG. If you have any doubt in your mind, just stop. If she uses the safeword, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Give her a second to relax and decompress. Talk to her about it, get her to communicate what went wrong. Please, please DO NOT continue, even if she says she is okay to get back into it. Just stop for the night. Cuddle instead. And please reassure and ENCOURAGE her to use the safeword.

Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT, this guide is not an guarantee crowd pleaser, it's from my personal experience, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. But this will vary from girl to girl.

Now let's get things started ;)

**""Gentle"" Dominating**

- Push her against the wall/bed/floor/table. Hold down her wrists (above her head, behind her back, by her sides). Lean your weight against her to create the feeling like you are dominating her body. Push your knee between her legs and roughly spread them wide. ""Spread wide for me, sweetheart.""

- Manhandle her. Put your hands all over her as if you can't get enough. Grab her breasts, squeeze her ass. Worship her. ""God I *love* this hot/tight ass of yours"". ""This hot/tight ass of yours is all mine tonight."" ""You have the hottest/tightest little body ever."" ""Your body was made to be fucked by me.""

- Kiss her like you need it to breathe. Grab her chin and pull her mouth to yours, plunge your tongue in her mouth.

- Run your fingers through her hair and pull gently. Tug her hair so that it forces her to look up at you, give her a sexy smirk, and kiss her roughly.

- Grind your hips against her, let her feel your arousal pressed against her. ""Can you feel how hard you make me?"" ""Fuck, you make me so hard."" ""I can't wait to shove this into that sweet pussy of yours."" ""God I need/want to be inside of you.""

**Getting more aggressive...**

- Light scratching: Use your fingernails and scratch along her back or lightly dig your nails into her ass.

- Spanking: Slap her ass. Mix it up, don't just spank her a billion times: spank, rub it with the palm of your hand, grip it with your hand, slap it, etc. ""I fucking love your tight little ass"". ""This beautiful ass is all mine...in fact I think I should leave a mark so you'll remember who it belongs to *slap*"".

- Biting: Bite her nipples, alternate with licking and swirling your tongue around the nipple.

- Orgasm Denial: ""Do you want to cum?"", force her to say yes, then ""I want to hear you beg for it."" She begs. ""Louder"". She begs some more. ""Good girl..."" Proceed to make her come. Or tease her some more... ""No I don't think I'll let you just yet...""

- Forced Orgasms: ""I want you to cum NOW."" ""Come for me, baby."" *Proceed to make her cum after you say these things.* After you've made her come, ""Have you had enough?...I don't think you have. I want you to come again for me."" ""I want to feel you soak my fingers/cock/tongue with your delicious juices"". ""I fucking love making you come, I think I want to do it again...""  *Make her cum again.*

- Have sex with clothes on. Ideal if she's wearing a dress/skirt - hike up her dress and fuck her like that. If she has pants, rip them off roughly. Move her panties aside (but don't take them off!) and screw her like that. ""Look how wet you're making your panties...what a dirty little slut you are.""

- Make her pleasure you. Force her on her knees and suck you off. ""Get on your knees now."" ""You're going to suck me until I'm satisfied."" ""Suck me with that talented little mouth of yours.""

**""Rape""/Light BDSM**
- So please, please tread carefully with this section, by ""rape"" I mean CONSENSUAL non-consent, if at any time she says the safe word, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Pay attention to her body language - if it appears like she is not enjoying something or starting to hesitate, STOP IMMEDIATELY, ask her if everything is okay, MAKE SURE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY OKAY. Again, please DO NOT continue if you have any doubts whatsoever. Constantly monitor her and your actions throughout this - remember your boundaries, STICK TO THEM. If you are interested in these activities, find resources and do your research, consult BDSM subreddits. Please, please play safe!! 

- Gagging: Gag her with a piece of cloth, my personal favorite is when my boyfriend fucks me with my panties on, then takes them off, and shoves them in my mouth. (Because your mouth will be gagged, you must have a ""safe gesture"" as a sign to stop if things get too much.)

- Bondage: Buy rope, tape, handcuffs, four-poster bed restraints, etc. OR improvise and substitute with a scarf or belt. Tie up her wrists behind her back (then force her to suck you off), tie her to the bed frame and tease her. Safety point: NEVER leave someone tied up alone in a room (if you need to leave to go to the bathroom or anything like that, make sure you can hear her if she calls out to you. NEVER LEAVE SOMEONE GAGGED AND TIED UP.).

- Degrade her. Call her a dirty little slut/whore/cunt/bitch. ""The only thing you're good for is to be fucked/satisfying me.""  Make her degrade herself ""What are you?"" ""What are you good for?"" ""You're my slutty little whore. Say it."" If she hesitates, punish her with a slap/spank. ""Not fast/quick enough. Let's try again. (Repeat the question/your demand)."" If you're satisfied, ""Good girl"" or ""That's better."" If not satisfied, punish her until she gets it right. Make her call you ""Sir"" or ""Master"". Punish her every time she forgets to refer to you as that.

- In contrast to degradation (as pointed out by you guys!): Praise her for satisfying you so well and being *your* ""good little girl/slave"". Tell her how pleased you are with her behavior and how good she's pleased you. Reward her.

Questions are very welcome!! Please also share your own comments that you've found fun in the bedroom!! Thanks for reading and hope you have lots of sexy times ;)

**After care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your partner after - make sure she/he is okay, ask what things they DID NOT like (as well as things they did like), make sure you did not overstep your boundaries. Hug, kiss, hold, cuddle her/him, tell them you love them, etc, etc.**

**Edit: Thanks so much for the amazing feedback and responses! Please keep them coming and share your experiences so we can all enjoy ;)**

**A great comment by signhereplease: Make her taste herself. After you finger her put your finger in her mouth, more fingers to add a bit of choking effect.**

**From LyssaBrisby who pointed out a GREAT perspective for those who are not into the whole degradation scene but who are still exploring their submissive side: Not all submission is to do with ""naughty/bad"" stereotypes; in fact I think there's a fully parallel stream that is ""noble submission,"" that is, submission as a vaunted and praised act. Every thing I do to submit is because I am a good wife, not a bad/dirty one.**

1374479674.0,2337,self.sex,1istng,I'm 34. Just found out I'm not actually a girl. AMA,3988,1651,755,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1istng/im_34_just_found_out_im_not_actually_a_girl_ama/,"I'm completely confused at the moment. The past 6 months has been a whirlwind of life shattering revelations, but I suppose I should start at the beginning. 

First off, I'm [fucked up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloacal_exstrophy). Being born like that.. well, the doctors sewed me back up as best they could. Dozens of surgeries later, I have no rectum (permanent colostomy, not even a hole down there) and no reproductive system - no vagina, and no clitoris. Growing up like that sucked hard, but I survived. Met a great guy that didn't mind me not having a vagina. I thought life would be ok. Got a good job, with insurance. It was finally time to look in to reconstructive surgery, just to get some semblance of normality. You can't begin to understand how difficult pleasing a guy is when you can't have sex, or anal sex, at all, ever. Not that sexy time is pleasurable for me, I lack the required equipment. It's completely for the other person's benefit. There is something cathartic about it tho, like I'm having fun at a party I wasn't invited to. But maybe it was now time to get some artificial equipment, yes? 

Turns out, fuck no. My doctors do an exam. Put a camera inside my bladder and have a look see at what's happening down there. After, they inform me that I don't have any of the spare tissue required for the process (they'd have to put these cup things on my thighs and stimulate some tissue growth and.. it's a gross and weird process) - and oh yeah, by the way, your blood work shows you're actually male. 

That... is a hell of a thing to discover at 34 years old. I cracked. Completely lost my mind for a while. I turned to my best friend, my rock.. my christian, anti-gay boyfriend. He had no interest in being with a male. That would make him gay apparently. Even if that male was gender assigned female at birth because the doctors had to pick one, and you can't make an artificial penis for an infant. They told my Mom as I left the hospital as an infant. She never ""found the right time"" to tell me. That was a bombshell. My mental state degraded a bit more after I lost my job - I couldn't stay on task, got very depressed.

I know I'm not the only fucked up person in the world. So what the hell am I supposed to do? I've been transgendered my whole life and never knew. Tho, I suppose it does explain a lot. Like why I never really was ""in love"" with a guy. Sure I said the words, but it was always just words.. I have had female friends that I was completely in love with, but I always rationalized it as ""best friend"" feelings that were probably normal. 

If anyone has questions, talking about it will probably help. Besides, where else are you gonna have the chance to ask a ""girl"" like me questions?  People like me are 1:400,000. And less than 1/3 of those cases were gender reassigned (according to Dr. Gearhart at Johns Hopkins). If I did my math right, that's less than 400 people like me in the United States. To use a phrase another of my doctors used, I'm ""rare as rocking horse shit"". 

I don't want to ramble. My illusion that I'll ever have a shred of normality in my life is shattered. I just want to know if anyone else has some sage advice on how a person like myself can move on from something like this. Am I destined to die alone, or is there more? How would I even meet people that wouldn't condemn me instantly for being what I am? 

EDIT: I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the support you have all shown. I've spent the last 6 hours reading and replying, crying and being cheered up. I don't feel as alone as I did, and I appreciate all of your comments. Right now I just feel like I need to go make some new lesbian friends somewhere and start over. Thank you again for your kindness.

EDIT OF AN EDIT (.... editception?) - 17 hours later and I'm still getting tons of messages and replies. I am doing my best to read all of them. Another common theme in my personal messages is how many of you see me as inspiration in facing your own problems.

I told her that I had noticed a big change in her libido and I liked it but I wanted to know why it changed. I told her about my weight loss theory and then went on to explain how I was insecure about my body till recently so maybe (as some of you suggested) her sex drive was just responding to that.

Then she just broke down...she cried and confessed that she had an affair for over a year. She only recently broke it off. Her increased libido wasn't a change, this was just the first time it had been directed at me. I let her explain for about 20 minutes until I just couldn't take it anymore. I stormed out of the house and I have not been back in a week. She has called me hundreds of times and has showed up at my office looking for me all this week. I don't want to talk to her yet.

So this is it. You've busted out all your trademark moves, you've just erupted into orgasmic bliss, and you're feeling like Antonio Banderas. Surely she came too! How could she not have with all that moaning and squirming? Well you never know though right? The gentlemanly thing to do would be to ask right?

 Sure it is, but asking her straight up whether she came or not, can be abrasive, and is far more likely to result in a lie, or a bruised ego for you if she didn't. This in turn could result in her going to bed unsatisfied, and being less enthusiastic for future sexy times. Also, sometimes somebody can want more than one orgasm OR be completely satisfied WITHOUT having an orgasm at all. And even if she says ""No, but it's really fine, I really had all I need"", you may still be feeling a little less like Antonio at that point!

So, why not just avoid the whole sticky (or possibly not sticky) situation, and ask the question that ACTUALLY matters? ""That was amazing hun! Did you want to keep fooling around?"" ;-) You still have  several working sex tools on your body, even if the General has been honorably discharged.

Seriously.",3481,1306,325,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1dqbnr/followed_the_instructions_in_the_nina_hartley/,"First off: **Thank you /r/sex**.

[Link to the video in question](http://www.spankwire.com/Nina-Hartley-Sunny-Lane/video222872/).

[Link to the previous thread on the issue](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1479mi/so_my_bf_watched_some_kind_of_video_on_how_to_eat/).

Okay, so backstory: is that my girlfriend and I have been together for five years, and I've always considered myself pretty good at ""the stuff"" (as Rachel would say on *Friends*).  I could always make my girlfriend orgasm quickly (under 5 minutes) with just my hands (insertion or no insertion) or tongue.  Compared to friends who said ""women have orgasms?"" or ""Oh yeah, my boyfriend has never been able to get me off"", I thought I was doing pretty good.

I've always been skeptical about videos that teach you how to become a dramatically better lover / sexual partner in a short 20-minute lesson, because they sound so much like one of those ""ONE CRAZY TRICK"" ads.  But after reading the thread linked above, I decided - why the fuck not.  So, during the halftime of the Bulls/Nets game, I put on the video and watched.

When she came home (she worked late), we started fooling around and I decided to try the techniques Hartley outlines - specifically two techniques:

1.  Pinching and wiggling the vulva
2.  Sucking pussy with a consistent pressure

HOLY FUCK, guys.

Seriously.

HOLY FUCK.

What went down:

* I laid next to her and just pinched her pussy - that's all.  Just pinched it and held it relatively tight.  If I recall correctly, Hartley says in the video that doing this works because you're not really holding still - there are still micromovements.  Whatever the reason, it fucking works.  Slowly - like over the course of 10 minutes or so (while making out) I started slow wiggling movements (still with a tight pinch).  I'll tell you - I can get my girlfriend off in under 3 minutes with my hands, but watching her with this slow build-up is 500x more satisfying.  She afterwards described it as 'tortuous pleasure'.

* I sucked on her pussy for about 15 minutes straight - just consistent suction.  I didn't have to really do much of anything - I let her grind up against me (like Hartley suggests in the video) so it wasn't tongue-numbing like oral sex can sometimes be.  It's the most she's ever enjoyed oral sex (as far as I can tell), and it's the least I've ever had to work to make it happen.  I used to use a combination of 

* I didn't use any internal finger stimulation, only because at this point she was begging me to fuck her.  Next time I will, but I knew she was super-close to orgasm and she prefers to come during PIV sex.

* She came within the first two thrusts of sex.  And it's one of the hardest (if not the hardest) she's ever come.  I'm talking like several minutes straight of intense orgasm with more minutes of twitching afterwards.

* She slept like a baby afterwards, literally curled up with her head on my lap.

Lessons learned:

* The pussy is way sturdier than I thought.  I kept increasing how hard I was grabbing her pussy (I have a strong grip from farmers walks and deadlifts) and I found that it was pretty much impossible to be grabbing too hard.  I guess I kind of knew that because we both enjoy fairly rough sex, but for some reason I was always much more gentle with manual stimulation.

* Consistent suction on the pussy is a godsend.  Greatest thing ever.

* You can get a woman off 10x better with 1/10th of the work you're putting in right now.  Seriously.  It's unbelievable how hard technique trumps effort.

* Treat the clit like a penis.  I'd heard it said before that the clit is a minature penis, but I'd never really internalized what that meant for stimulation until watching that video.  Thinking of the clit and penis as morphologically equivalent and really stopping to consider what that meant was a real eye-opener.

TLDR: **Another testimonial for the Nina Hartley / Sunny Lane video**.

In closing, I quote another user:

&gt; HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE!? I mean, I've received compliments on my hand techniques before, but I feel like I've been thinking I'm Michelangelo when I'm merely a third grader, bumbling with my canvas, sloppily and haphazardly tossing paint on it.

1369010914.0,2105,self.sex,1enxni,Something that every fucking person in the world should just know. This is getting ridiculous.,4730,2625,939,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1enxni/something_that_every_fucking_person_in_the_world/,"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that a female's anatomy changes drastically with every sexual experience she has. Where is this coming from?

I feel like every day someone asks why their girlfriend's pussy isn't as tight as their ex's- even though she's only had sex once in her life! Does this mean she lied? No! Jesus. NO. I mean, maybe- I don't know her sexual history, nor does it matter. But her anatomy is absolutely no indication of the amount of sex she's had. If her vagina seems ""loose,"" that's just how her vagina is. It's a vagina. It might need to fit a penis in it. Its tightness is determined by a combination of genetics, level of relaxation, arousal, and muscle tone. Having had multiple penises/dildos inside does not permanently stretch out a vagina. That's not how it works. 

And equally absurd are these labia myths. Some women have longer labia than others. That's literally all there is to it. It has no correlation with ""tightness"" *or* the amount of sex she's had. Why would that even make sense? I have long inner labia, and I have for as long as I remember- maybe more so since puberty. But why would having many penises inside my vagina permanently increase the length of my labia? Or darken them? What?

How did these myths ever become so prevalent? Not only is it ignorant, but it can be incredibly harmful. We all have enough to be self-conscious about- why add to that? I remember reading comments like the ones [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yw7pj/now_thats_what_i_call_meat_curtains_nsfw/), [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/10l5jd/i_guess_thats_why_theyre_called_meat_curtains_nsfw/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/hrfnn/my_favourite_view/), and nearly bursting into tears. *warning- these links contain some upsetting language you may wish to avoid*

There's a lot of both ignorance and slut shaming. It's absurd. It's really really not cool. It has the potential to make someone feel like shit. It's not anyone's fault for being uninformed, I'm just asking for everyone to be openminded about learning this stuff before making assumptions and to refrain from saying hurtful things. The internet is the internet, and obviously you're allowed to say whatever you want, and if you're a shitty person and like to make people feel bad, carry on- nothing I can do. And I'm not talking about voicing an opinion or having a preference. I'm talking about language designed to hurt people. Additionally, I think we should be able to talk/joke about whatever we want. It's sad that it's often so mean spirited, but there should not be any limits placed on what we're ""allowed to"" joke about. It's our job as individuals to learn what sort of stuff makes us feel bad and avoid it. I just wanted to provide some information and ask everyone to be a little thoughtful, particularly when someone is putting themselves in a vulnerable position, and too be a little sensitive to our potential insecurities.

Tightness, appearance, etc., have absolutely nothing to do with a woman's sexual history. You can't actually deduce anything. Plus, her history is her business, so it's even more ridiculous to discuss or preach these erroneous deductions. 

Same goes for male analogues- I just see less of it in my life so that's not my focus here. I'm sure it happens all the time with things like circumcision and penis size. That's also totally shitty. But we're all different- it's really that simple. Why can't we just enjoy our own and each others' bodies for what they are?  Hopefully we are becoming more and more enlightened thanks to places like this, and thank you to those of you who understand.


**TL;DR:**

**1. tightness, appearance, and sexual history are all pretty much independent of one another.**

**2. I don't know, just be nice I guess. Don't be mean to people. Why would you be mean to people?**


**Edit 1:** Come on guys, obviously shaming of any kind is wrong. I do not support any type of shaming. Shaming is bad. *Focusing on one particular issue in one particular post is not tacitly agreeing with every other injustice that occurs.* This happens to be r/sex, and I happen to see this particular issue a lot on reddit, and it happens to be something I've dealt with personally. That is why I posted about pussies. And obviously I'm not telling anyone how to think or act, or what their preference should be- the purpose was to educate people- about some common misconceptions and about the potentially devastating effect certain comments might have.

**Edit 2:** Just curious about the personal attacks- why is this post inspiring so much rage toward me?

**Edit 3:** I don't actually know much about the effects of childbirth, so i won't make any claims there. 

**Edit 4:** To everyone inquiring- *my* pussy is not particularly loose, nor is it extremely tight. As I said in a comment, I use the small size of tampons because regular/large are painful to insert since I'll be totally unaroused. However, I've managed to fit some very large dicks in there when properly relaxed, wet, and prepped. I do have longish inner labia. *Both of these features have been consistent throughout my sexual life.* I can't speak to whether any of you would be attracted or repulsed by me- nor can you really, since you haven't seen it, but I've had people say I'm tight, say my pussy is pretty, say my pussy looks ""like I've been fucked too much,"" pretty much everything. As much as I'm enjoying the conjectures as to the color, looseness, labia-y-ness, or repulsiveness of my pussy, I thought I should step in and at least give you some info to back it up. TL;DR: it kinda just looks like a pussy. Carry on.

**Edit 5:** Firstly, I suppose I do consider myself a feminist, because I do support the idea of women having equal rights to men. Feminism seems to be getting used like it's a dirty word around here. That's kind of silly. I also don't see where people are deriving sexism from my post. I think *anyone* can be ignorant, *anyone* can be cruel, and *anyone* can be the victim of cruel behavior. I am not speaking only to men in this post. And I in no way support cruel retaliation. Anyone can be shitty, and shitty stuff can happen to anyone. See edit 1.

Thank you to the men who don't try to force their dick all the way down our throats or push on the back of our heads. That's a good way to get bit or thrown up on.

Twenties. I dated this girl for about 2 months and we were pretty casual. We have talked about sex and other things in that topic line a few times and decided we both really wanted to do it. In our past conversations she told me how she absolutely hates the idea of giving head and how she would never do that because it is ""demeaning to women to make them do such a thing"" So I obviously am not expecting oral to take any part in our sexual experience.

We have a long makeout session and she is starting the dirty talk about how she is so wet and so horny and all that bla bla crap that girls do. When clothes start coming off we start using our hands to touch and feel and lead up to it and when it seems like its time to ""start"" she says to me ""no not yet, I am not wet enough, you should go down on me and make me nice and wet for you.""

I instantly get kinda tweaked from this comment because I myself am a man who LOVES giving AND receiving oral as a precurser to sex. I think its something most people enjoy doing and has to be pretty standard. But coming from the girl who has on multiple occasions told me that she would rather slit her wrists than touch my dick with her mouth had me kinda shocked. What happened next is what blew my mind.

I kinda wanted to stay on my high horse and in a sexy voice told her I just wanted her now. She responded with ""No you need to earn it."" I kinda got up. Was instantly out of the mood an tried really hard not to laugh at her. She looked confused and asked what my problem was. I simply looked into her eyes and said ""I am not in the mood anymore"" which was 100% true. 

She immediatly got extremely butt hurt and started bitching to me about how I am an ass and would not let me get a word in edge wise. I was taking the insults just fine until she raised her voice. As soon as she started yelling I got out of bed grabbed her clothes and proceeded to throw them out my front door and told her to get the fuck out. 

Where do girls get off thinking that they can require a guy to do the very same thing that they would never do. I am sorry ladies but passion and sex is a give and take process. If you want sex to be all about you then grab your favorite toy and go to your room and do what you gotta do.

And I love being naked, especially in front of my partner.

I had a threesome with my partner with another girl and she was so shy being naked and I didn't understand. She had the perfect body. She looked like a goddess to me, and yet she was uncomfortable being naked because she didn't see herself as that attractive.

And then it hit me. I had my own personal cheer leader. In the morning, when we would wake up, he would smile at me and say ""Boobies"" which would make me giggle. Then getting dressed he would say, ""yay, naked!"" and then when I put on clothes he would always say, ""aww, clothes?"" which would make me smile. I could be coming out of the shower and he would say, ""Vagina!"" (yes, I know, it's vulva). Etc, etc.

Basically, several times a day, every day, I am encouraged to be naked and he lets me know that he loves to see my body. It isn't always sexual (although sometimes it is) and he does it to make me laugh more than turn me on. But it's honestly like having my own cheerleader that follows me around and let's me know that I'm beautiful, wanted, and that imperfections are in the eye of the beholder, and I don't have to worry when he's the one doing the beholding.

I wasn't always comfortable being naked, and I wasn't always confident. But after being complimented so often, in cute and funny ways, it sinks in. Just like if you are teased for a long time, you start to believe what they say, if you are cheered on, celebrated, and appreciated for long periods of time, you eventually just come to accept that dammit, you're loveable.

So partners of those that are more shy or less confident, remember to be a constant cheerleader. Find creative ways to celebrate your partner's body. In fact, even if your partner is confident, you can still be a cheerleader and let them know you appreciate every facet of their being.

1359213788.0,1918,self.sex,17bfbn,Kegels: A Guide to Better... Everything.,2815,897,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/17bfbn/kegels_a_guide_to_better_everything/,"I've seen quite a few posts here, and around the interwebs, asking either directly about Kegels, or asking how to do something that Kegels can allow you to do. So here's a guide. FYI, I am a cis gendered hetero male, in my 30s.


**CAUTION**: Increasing your mental control of these muscles and their physical strength can cause you to emit an irresistible aura of a sexual super here. People will throw themselves at... just kidding. Real reason for caution: You can eventually get strong enough that as you flex, you can tear muscles. I have even heard of some people urinating blood after squeezing too hard, although I'm not sure if that's true or not. Point being, use common sense. Never squeeze so hard you are causing yourself significant discomfort or any pain at all. If you do experience pain, stop immediately, and allow the muscles to heal for a few days before continuing at a *decreased intensity*.


**What can you gain from Kegels?**


*Male bodied people:*


-Stronger orgasms
-Potential to become FULLY multiply orgasmic (see ""Why I'm qualified to write this guide"", at the bottom, for full explanation).
-Easier, faster, and harder erections
-Greater orgasm control, both for delaying or triggering orgasm
-Greater ejaculate volume
-Increased sexual health
-Ability to flex and stimulate your partner. (More for a smile and a ""Wow"" than for intense physical pleasure.)
-Help to maintain erectile function as you age
-Increased prostate health, decreased chance of prostate cancer
-Increased libido (my theory, not proven)
-Massively increased confidence because of all of the above


*Female bodied people:*


-Increased orgasm strength
-Increased orgasm control, ability to orgasm more easily
-Increased potential to become multiply orgasmic
-Increased potential to learn how to orgasm via different stimulation types (clitoral, g-spot, a spot).
-Increased potential to learn how to ejaculate, and/or have ejaculatory orgasms (ejaculation and orgasm are separate events)
-Increased vaginal tightness and ability to physically manipulate your partner using your vaginal muscles. (Massive ""Wow"" factor. Some women can produce orgasm in their male-bodied partners using this alone, with no thrusting.)
-Increased libido (my theory, not proven)
-Increased sexual health and confidence because of all of the above


The pelvic floor muscles, abdominals, and anus all contract during orgasm in both male and female bodied people. This large set of muscle groups also plays a role in male erectile function (it may also play a role in female erectile function, I don't know). The whole group is incredibly complex, and is all up in your naughty bits. These are just the benefits and roles we know about. I'm sure their are lots we don't know about.


Male pelvic floor: http://prostatitis.hostei.com/images/male-pelvic-floor.jpg Female pelvic floor: http://promiscuouseating.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/perineal-muscles.jpg


Kegels are a conscious contraction, release, and relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles and anus, and can incorporate the abdominals. 


**Kegels and your Butt:**


Kegels do not require anal play, or penetration. The fact that the anus contracts during orgasm has nothing to do with a person's desire to engage in, or not engage in, anal play. It is simply a biological fact. In order to perform Kegels properly, you will need to learn about how your body works, and this will require touching your anus briefly. If you have an aversion to this, I would encourage you to overcome it for the sake of your sexual health. You will only need to touch your anus once, during your first session. If you can not overcome this, you can still follow along and put your hand as close as you are comfortable to your anus without touching it, or nowhere near it at all if you prefer.


**Establishing the Mind-Body Connection with the Muscle Group:**


Right now, as you read this, contract the muscles that you would to stop the flow of urine, or to hold urine in when you need to go. If you are unable to do this, don't worry. Your body just hasn't established the mental connection with those muscles as strongly. In this case, wait until you are urinating. Once you have started, stop the flow of urine. You may not be able to fully stop the flow at first. Repeat the squeeze and release of those muscles a few times. This should be sufficient to have trained your brain what muscle groups to flex. After you are finished and dressed, flex the same muscles. If you can do so, excellent. If you require more practice, just do so again each time you urinate until you are able to easily mentally control that muscle group.


**Feeling what the Muscles Do, Strengthening the Mind-Body Connection:**


Once you can do this, get naked (yay!) and lie in your bed. Reach under your leg with one hand, and place a few fingers across your anus. Place the fingers of your other hand across your perineum, or between your penis/vagina and anus. Now squeeze those muscles. You will feel your anus tighten and draw inwards. Male bodied people will feel the base of your penis firm up and push out and/or forward a bit. Female bodied people should feel a squeeze inside your vagina. If you do not feel these things, do not worry. At first your muscles may be weak, and the weaker the muscles, the less movement they produce. Contract and release the muscles a few times, and feel what they do to your body. 


Now, contract the muscles and hold for 5 seconds (hands still in place). Then release for 5 seconds. Now push, in the opposite direction as when you squeezed. You should feel your perineum and anus push outwards / bulge. More so the perineum. Push, and hold the push for 5 seconds. Notice that while this push is *similar* it is **distinctly different** from pushing during a bowel movement. If it feels *absolutely identical* try to stay focused on the muscle group you were squeezing, and use your hands, touching your perineum, to strengthen the mind-body connection, and focus the push. 


Once you are able to do both the squeeze and push, do enough squeeze, relax, push, relax, cycles that you feel you have good mental control of the muscle group, and can do them without your hands there to help focus. If you find you have lost some of that focus when you try your first 'hands free' session, just do some more 'hands on' work each time you are in bed until your control is good enough to be fully comfortable.


The push is extremely important, it is the reciprocal of the squeeze. It is fully relaxing and extending those muscles, moving them through their full range of motion (and over time, extending that range of motion). If you are *only* squeezing, you are progressively and repetitively flexing the muscle, without relaxing it. It would be similar to doing an arm curl with a weight, but only ever moving from fully contracted to 3 - 4"" away from your shoulder. There is *very little* benefit to doing 'half Kegels'. 


By exercising the full range of motion, you truly strengthen the muscle, and over time, extend it's range of motion. Also, for male-bodied people, you will use a combination of squeeze and push to delay orgasm during vigorous sexual activity.


**Kegels: The Exercise Routine**


So now you know how to perform Kegels, and you have good mental control of the muscles. Now it's just a matter of strengthening them. 


The cycle is squeeze, relax, push, relax. The goal is to squeeze harder, and longer. Start wherever you are comfortable, perhaps 2 seconds each, for 30 cycles. The stronger you are naturally, the longer you will be able to hold initially. But no matter how weak those muscles are, they *will* strengthen over time, so do not be disheartened if you can only squeeze or push for a second at first. Alternate your workouts:


Long Holds: Work up to holding each stage for 30 seconds, for as many cycles as you feel like. Should aim for working up to 30 minute sessions. These are the principle strength building exercises, and are also good for developing orgasm delay control in male-bodied people. 


Short Pulses: Squeeze for 3 seconds, and go directly into a push for 2 seconds. Try for as many cycles as you can. As you get better, shorten the time to 1 second per cycle. These are amazing for directly strengthening orgasm intensity. They more closely mimic the rapid, rhythmic contraction of orgasm. They are not as good for increasing strength as the long hold type.


**Ok, cool. But how long before I'm a sex god/goddess?**


In as short as 6 months, for only 3 payments of 29.95$... brutal. No, really, that's the super cool thing about them. While you will make incredible improvements over the next six months to two years, you will actually notice *huge* changes within a week or two. *If* you behave yourself and actually do them regularly, as in every day, ideally, or every second day. Also great news is once you've built up your strength over six months, or a couple years, you can chill it out a bit, do them twice a week to keep toned, and not really lose anything. 


Well, that was disgustingly long. Hope at least one of you benefits from this :) And if you do, say ""Thank you Veritas's Insomnia!""


**Why I'm qualified to write this guide** (no need to read, unless curious)**:**


I'm a cis gendered hetero male, in my 30s. Before starting Kegels around age 17, I was a standard-run male. Sometimes had trouble delaying my orgasm, was strictly singley-orgasmic, had a recuperation period typical for an antsy 17 year old, about 15 minutes. Orgasms were meh (although at the time I thought pretty great). Now, in my 30s, I'm multiply orgasmic. My record is 12 in a row during masturbation, and 3 with a partner (the stronger they are, the less of them I have). To be clear, what I mean by multiply orgasmic is a full-on, regular, ejaculatory orgasm via penile stimulation, stoping stimulation after orgasm for 2 - 7 seconds, continuing stimulation, and having another, regular, ejaculatory orgasm 5 to 15 seconds later. Repeat 10 more times. I have multiple orgasms roughly 2 to 5 times a month, usually 3 to 5 multiples. My orgasms have become FAR more intense. I have very good control of them. While every once in a while I have little to no control (orgasm can not be controlled/stopped after 1 - 4 minutes of very vigorous, fast, hard PIV sex), I most often can have ""porn hyper speed"" sex until I run low on oxygen and need to slow down for a bit, and moderate/fast sex can go on indefinitely without needing to orgasm. That control also works on the flip side, I can orgasm from very little stimulation as well. It's sometimes fun to be barely moving inside your partner, and orgasm, so they can feel every pulse. It's also convenient if they decide to give you a quick oral session in a less than optimal location, so that you can help things along more quickly. My orgasms are A LOT more powerful. My erections happen easily, quickly, are very hard, and require very little physical or mental stimulation to initiate. It would be annoying if it wasn't so awesome, I'm hard quite a few times a day. My recuperation period after orgasm is short. It depends on my recent sexual activity and level of mojo, but I'm usually ready to go in 7 - 10, and sometimes as little as 3 to 5. Rarely, but on occasion, it is 15 to 30. I have more orgasms, and a stronger libido, now than I did at 18. My partner and I regularly have sex for 2 - 3 hours (no, not all straight PIV, I mean playtime), and will have another quicky in the morning, or I will have solo play time. I attribute a lot of this to Kegels.

EDIT: Formatting (Why isn't there a 'preview post' function?

**EDIT 2: Many have asked for clarification on the push. I replied to the question in the comments, but thought I would add it to the post:**

Everyone is clear on the squeeze it seems. I can't stress the importance of using your hands at first. As absolutekraze mentioned, female bodied people may want to put a finger or two inside their vagina while doing it. For her, she found she felt very little on her perineum, but could feel it with a finger inside. Thanks for adding that absolutekraze :)

Some users have mentioned it's similar to pushing out urine. Maninachair put it well: ""Like when you are at a movie and don't want to miss to much so you pee as fast as possible and then it splashes back up on you and you're like well shit..."" That is partially it.

Some users have mentioned a similarity to pushing during a bowel movement. It is similar, but (and I have stressed this already), very, very different. Do not push in the exact same way as you push a bowel movement. And do not push hard, and certainly not hard enough to cause a prolapse, as some have indicated.

This is the best explanation I can come up with:

Push exactly like a bowel movement for a second. Now push exactly like pushing out urine for a second. It's kind of half-way between the two. Now do a Kegel squeeze. From relaxed state, you have contracted your muscles in a given direction. As you move from the squeeze, back to relaxed state, feel the way they are moving (you should be using your hands at first here). The push is to keep moving them a bit further in that direction, past just where they sit when relaxed.
From relaxed, the squeeze is a far larger motion than the push. The squeeze may represent around 80 - 90% of the range of motion. During the push, the degree of movement from relaxed will be much smaller. But it is incredibly important.

As Maxxters mentioned in her comment, not fully relaxing the muscles between each squeeze can cause all sorts of problems, and is actually worse than not doing Kegels at all. You're basically intentionally creating hyper tension in the muscle. The push, which is fully forcing the muscle to relax/extend in the opposite direction of the flex, and is so, so important, seems to never be mentioned. This is the main reason I made the post in the first place. I hope this has helped to clarify what it is. If it remains unclear, let's continue to work through it together :)",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1359309838.0,,,True,t3_17bfbn,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/17bfbn/kegels_a_guide_to_better_everything/,

Please learn from my mistake.,4229,2335,418,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ynbu4/bfs_penis_ended_up_in_a_jar_of_ice_please_learn/,"Last night, my boyfriend and I are watching TV and munching on my favorite kind of popcorn--hot and fresh off the stove, liberally sprinkled with salt and cayenne pepper. We finish up the popcorn, and a few minutes later, I get up and wash my hands. After all, I remember the ""milking my girlfriend's pussy"" post from a couple months ago, and I'm no idiot.

Hoping to spice things up during a Conan rerun, I pull down my bf's pants and start rubbing his dick. No problems there. After a few minutes, I begin to suck his penis, and he seems to be enjoying himself.

Then, suddenly, ""STOP OHMYGOD YOU'RE BURNING MY DICK MY PENIS IS ON FIRE!!"" I'm confused. After all, I did a really good job washing my hands. How the hell did--Oh shit. There's still cayenne pepper in my mouth. I can still feel it tingling on my tongue and everything. I am an idiot.

I grab a wet paper towel from the kitchen, which does jack shit to relieve his case of fire penis. Next, we try a paper towel dipped in milk. Same story, doesn't help.

""Get some ice!"" he shouts. I run back to the kitchen, grab the first empty container I can find, and fill it with ice. Upon my return, he shoves his (still hard! why is it still hard?!) dick in the jar and breathes a sigh of relief. We spend the next 5 minutes rubbing ice all over his penis until he jumps in the shower to rinse off the remaining cayenne pepper.

Moral of the story: BRUSH YO TEETH just do it

TL;DR If your gf puts her cayenne pepper mouth on your dick, you're gonna have a bad time.

I thought that I had just misplaced it or something and searched for it for a while before giving up. A few hours later I wen't back into the bathroom and it was back in it's little stand and when I picked it up I could smell that my 14 year old daughter had used it to masturbate.  
  
I don't care if my daughter wants to masturbate, god knows I was wanking myself silly when I was a 14 year old boy, but It doesn't exactly seem hygienic for her to be using my toothbrush to do it.  
  
How do I bring this up? I'm a single dad with sole custody of my daughter, she doesn't see her mum much, so it's going to have to be me who talks to her about it. I have no doubt it's going to be very embarrassing for a 14 year old girl to talk about her masturbation habits with her 39 year old dad.  
  
Do I buy her a vibrator? Is that even allowed, isn't there probably some law against buying a sex toy for a 14 year old? Maybe I could just give her my credit card and point her to a website and tell her to get what she wants.  
  
__Update__

Thanks for all the replies everyone. I didn't really expect this thread to be seen by as many people as it has been.  
  
Some of you seem to be concerned that I haven't spoken to my daughter about sex or puberty, I have on numerous occasions. Yes she gets tampons, they go on the shopping list and she get's whichever brand she wants and she knows how to use them. She knows she can come to me and ask any questions she wants about sex and I will do my best to answer them for her. I don't think my daughter is sexually active (she's never had a boyfriend as far as I know) but regardless she knows where the condoms are kept and I have encouraged here to take some if she ever thinks she might need one, she also knows she can get contraceptives from her doctor or a clinic, or a pharmacy, or a supermarket and I won't know about it. She also knows that she can get emergency contraception on the NHS just by walking into the doctors office or visiting a contraception clinic. Yeah i don't want to be a granddad yet.  
  
Now for the bit you've been waiting for. 
  
I had a conversation with my daughter about what happened to my toothbrush. She has admitted to taking the toothbrush, and I told her I know why she took it. This led to a very frank and open conversation about masturbation where I told her that masturbation was completely okay, that pretty much everyone does it, that she she never feel ashamed for masturbating e.t.c. but that using my tooth brush was not very clean (for either of us). I gave her my debit card and told her she could buy herself something from the internet to use, or if she want's her aunt can pick her something up. I told her that I won't know what she's bought, because I'll just get a generic product name on the bill, and that I will never go snooping around her stuff looking for it. I also made it clear that she could talk to her aunt (my sister is okay with this) if she ever needs a woman to talk to about anything. I do my best to keep informed, but as a man there are just some things I don't know. 

We'll now I'm off to buy a new toothbrush.

I originally came here for tips and advice on my monogamous sexual relationship with my wife, yet every thread is full of polyamorous/swingers giving advice and whatever that has no relevance to 98% of the population.  

This really gives people bad ideas and makes them think that they could deal with someone fucking their SO or that they can compartmentalize sex from emotion.  The end result for most people is not happy if they go through with it, and people end up cratering and watching their life fall apart like that guy in that 2000 post thread about the foresome.  

I'm not saying polyamorous or swinging is bad because obvious some people enjoy it and some like it, but telling people to get over jealousy and that their feelings are they way are because they are insecure is horrendous advice.  Hell, just the act of talking about it with your spouse can cause problems.  For many people, their fantasies should forever remain things that stay in their head.  I have fantasies sure, but I recognize that they are fantasies and not at all a representation of real life because real people never act or respond like they do in your own head.  

r/Sex really needs to be split into two areas, one for monogamy and one for non because having them together does nothing but cause problems and results in issues for people on both sides.

1346165141.0,1817,self.sex,yyoii,Some thoughts on foreplay from a girl.,2968,1151,568,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/yyoii/some_thoughts_on_foreplay_from_a_girl/,"Hello Sexxit,
I wanted to discuss something that has come to my attention recently involving foreplay, as a lady. I'm going to preface this with 'every woman is different' and 'talk to your partner'; however something seems to keep coming up with hookups, relationships, etc. and I have checked with my group of girlfriends and they feel the same way. So here it is.

  As a woman, I sometimes require 'warming up' before I'm ready to have sex. Not all the time - I love me a good quickie now and then. But I've been finding that almost all of my hookups and boyfriends try to get me physically excited by fingering, oral, and other vaginal-focused activities. Personally, I need a few minutes to get there. I want to be at a point where I'm thinking ""Oh my god, I can't wait 'til he touches my pussy"" before you go there. Even though I'm excited, it's just not vagina-time yet. The things that turn me on the most are cuddling, touching all over (hands going up and down my body), making out, and giving BJs. Doing any combination of these is 100% guaranteed to get me physically ready for sex, very wet, and well-poised for orgasm.  **Let me be clear on that: cuddling, touching and making out gets me more physically excited for sex than any combination of oral/fingering**. However, it seems that often times, my partners (and friends' partners) try to incite excitement by going straight for the vagina. Honestly, a lot of times I'm too dry for intense touching right away...and continuing to touch me there doesn't seem to help get things going. I get stressed about it - 'crap, he's touching me, I'm kinda dry right now, I *am* horny I just need something other than this!'. I often tell my partners ""Hold on babe, let's cuddle and kiss for a while"" but the point doesn't seem to get taken, at least not for very long. 

Let me re-iterate: **I am only one woman.** This information may only be relevant to those of you in longer-term relationships, where foreplay tends to become a little more brief. But I had a long honest talk with my SO about this situation last night and he was very surprised that, indeed, he actually has to *do less work* in order to get me physically ready for sex and orgasm. **You don't have to be an oral superstar, or master the best fingering techniques.** For a lot of women, non-specific affectionate play can make us physically and mentally prepared for sex much more effectively than anything else.

Even if you don't agree, I think it'd be something to try with your partner to spice things up. Let me know what your thoughts on the matter are.

**TL;DR: Try extensive cuddling, kissing and touching/light petting as foreplay instead of jumping to fingering/oral right away.**

Somewhere in the process of fixing up our house, we got curtains on *most* of the windows, but not one on our kitchen door. The door goes out to a carport, so it's not like the neighbors can see in all the time..

Anyway..After a long day, hubby comes home, we started kissing on a chair in the kitchen. There was music on.. things were going good.. We ended up just stripping down in the kitchen. It was pretty romantic/spontaneous. At some point, we moved everything off of the table, I layed down and he pulled up a chair and went down on me. It was hot! 

I get nervous easily, so I kept looking up at the door, just in case. I started to really get into it though, and things were going really well. I happen to look up again and I see the surprised faces of my father in law, and my 14 year old brother in law! They quickly turned and started walking away. 

I have never moved so fast in my life! I jumped up and ran down the hallway while the hubby was still sitting on his chair utterly confused and the in laws were returning to their vehicle to leave. Hubby asked what's going on and all I could yell out was ""Your brother, your dad! Your brother, your dad!"" 

I jumped in bed, still bare-ass naked, covered my face in bankets and cried! The hubby was almost laughing when he asked why I was crying. Through tears I choked out ""Your father and brother just saw me sprawled out naked, getting ate out on the kitchen table!"" (Where I invite them over for dinner!)

To make matters worse, for certain family reasons, my brother in-law stays with us about evey other week and has his own room in our basement. 14.. isn't that like prime spankin' it age?! What's he going to be thinking about now! How am I going to talk to my father in law again without it being weird? How am I going to invite them over for a family dinner?!

1351198841.0,1760,self.sex,1234ol,Semen Taste Experiment: Part 0,2729,969,362,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1234ol/semen_taste_experiment_part_0/,"**UPDATE #1** Previous readers please head to the bottom



**Warning:**

I am a young, healthy, physically fit male with a background in chemistry doing this under the supervision of a physician. This will not be a life long change. Please do not attempt this without first consulting a medical professional.

**The Idea**

So the idea of drinking pineapple juice as a taste booster for semen has been floating around for sometime now. I'm sure we have all seen the comments and the claims. Well, as a chem major they have always bothered me and I am looking to use myself a guinea pig ""for science"". I also don't expect this to be definitive proof but something a little better than ""My cousins boyfriend drank a liter of pineapple juice once and she said he immediately tasted like a pina colada."" A gross exaggeration but I hope you get my point.

**Background:**

After doing a bit of research and taking the mental leap that fructose content is responsible for semen taste I stumbled upon some researchers trying to limit fructose's effect on sperm of diabetics(Fructose kills and messes with sperm. The theory being that it's not there for the sperm but to kill the sperm of following rival males). It seems that diabetics have much higher levels of fructose in seminal plasma (Vitamin C seems to help, consult your pharmacist/doctor for safe levels if you are in this boat). I have also seen a few comments stating that diabetic partners had sweeter/better tasting cum. A few more database searches and I had figured out my methodology. Unfortunately it will not involve pineapple juice (I'm sorry) since pineapple juice isn't very high on the glycemic index or for glycemic load (how long the body processes and keeps the levels of glucose int he blood up)

**The Plan:**

Next week will be my control. I will use a glucose monitor to test my blood sugar and make sure it stays in the normal levels. I will take semen samples from myself (for science) every few days and test pH using test strips and fructose levels(more on that later). After the week I will fast for 1 day and get a fasting blood sugar level. I will then incrementally change by diet to consist of food that will drive my blood sugar up (to higher but still safe levels) like processed carbs and fruit roll-ups(super high glycemic index/load). I will also do my best to maintain consistent levels of calories, vitamins, minerals, salt and water. I will not be smoking(I rarely smoke anyway), drinking alcohol(kill me now) or coffee during this experiment. And I am a vegetarian already so no need to worry if meat is a factor.

**Analysis:**

I know what you are thinking, ""How are you going to test for the taste and fructose levels?"" Simple! Qualitative and Quantitative analysis.

The Qualitative analysis (quality/taste) will come from my brave loving girlfriend (I promise it's for science and she likes it) since a. the consistency/texture of semen weirds me out and b. higher levels of blood glucose lead to higher glucose and fructose taste tolerances.

Quantitative Analysis is a bit more tricky. Fructose isn't very soluble in 95% ethanol while most other components of semen are. So I will just be used the ethanol to precipitate out the fructose and then weighing and analyzing for purity(additional washes of other solvent to remove impurities, and then comparison to literature values for melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc).


I will then use these results to try to draw a correlation between semen taste and the amounts and times I eat foods high in glucose i.e if I eat food ""A"" at time 1 and get my blood glucose level to level X, my semen will have taste Y at delta t(time 2 -time 1).

**TL:DR I'm testing if a diet high in glucose will make my semen taste sweeter as scientifically as I can without using my departments resources**

Thank you for reading all that (now you see why I'm not an English major). I would love to hear any comments, concerns, ideas, criticisms and questions that the good folks of Sexxit have. If any one would like to see any other the research I found just let me know; although much of it is hidden behind pay walls, I will do my best to get you the info.

EDIT: Forgot to mention I'm a vegetarian 

EDIT2: If anyone knows of a way I can I a control for my girlfriend's taste tests I would really appreciate it. I don't think saving the semen in a freezer or refrigerator and reheating it will be viable control. Anyway back to leaning about clinical taste tests

EDIT3: I seemed to have found some lab based taste test worksheets. Soooo what I am thinking I will be doing is homogenizing the sample and having my girlfriend compare it to known samples of fructose in water (which I will correct to the proper pH). 

EDIT4: For everyone that thinks I don't have have a girlfriend please take your hate elsewhere.P.S. She might be on later

EDIT5: Cropped one of the pics so that you can see the Reddit post better and removed the middle finger. It was a bit childish.It was only meant for one rude individual and you have my apologies if it offended anyone .Thanks to imnotlegolas for pointing that out to me. 

Thank you for all the responses. I am way more excited about this now since I kind of feel like you all are coming on a field trip with me. 

(10/26) So I have decided that the first update will be posted in a new thread. If anyone has any issues with this or anything else please let me know I'm trying my best to respond to as many comments as I can. That step will be done in about a week and will consist of my finalized complete procedure, pics of my setup (maybe some of lolabeans and myself), and approximate cost for stuff if anyone wants to reproduce the experiment. I will leave that post up for a few days for comments and suggestions before finalizing everything and beginning the experiment. I will also be adding a kind of FAQ to this post for some of the thought provoking questions I have been asked. I know asking people to upvote things is frowned upon but I just ask that if you like the questions also that you find the person (CRtl-f and search for their name) who asked the question in comments and give them an upvote. This will also be the last post that my girlfriend (lolabeans) will be allowed to see or participate in. Also, I regret to inform you that this will not result in an increase in my blowjob frequency (the opposite actually). To keep things as consistent as possible blowjobs (lolabeans jaw is cheering, she has TMJ), masturbation(hi http://reddit.com/r/nofap) and sex will be minimized and documented (looks like we will be getting to know each other Reddit) along with physical activity and stress. To keep lolabeans from clawing at the walls or my groin her oral sex level will be dramatically increased. I know this is a little TMI but people have and will ask.  After this is done pineapple components are next possibly followed by pH decrease, reduced alkalinity, and/or viscosity. Who knows maybe this will lead to a pill that makes semen taste like schnozberries. 

**SCIENTISTS** I am looking for a way to separate the pheolitic/aromtic components from the sugars in pineapple juice. If anyone knows of a method that is cheap, and still renders the products safe to drink ( I have a small lab setup so hardware or materials shouldn't be an issue) ",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1351284998.0,,,True,t3_1234ol,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1234ol/semen_taste_experiment_part_0/,

The years following were a very confusing time where I questioned my sexuality and whether or not I would ever be able to have a healthy sex life out of pure fear of sex. Flash backs were a regular thing for maybe the first 4 months. At that point I realized I had to go see someone to deal with things instead of letting what happened drag me down. To those who are victims I seriously recommend seeking help and just talking about what happened. It is SO easy to blame yourself initially which makes you feel even worse about the situation. 

I am now 21 and shortly before my 21st birthday I found myself in a relationship. At first this is a terrifying thing because you have a fear of people rejecting you once they hear A. You're not really a virgin, but you are and it's fucking confusing to explain what exactly you are and B. You were a victim of rape. Be as open as you are comfortable with being, if they can accept and appreciate you for what you are regardless of what happened, once you reach the point of having sex with them you will have trust and feel respected. I never thought I would be able to enjoy sex and it wouldn't feel good, seeing as my only encounter with it was a painful one. But I will just say it is fucking AWESOME. It can, and will happen for you. To whoever this applies, stop beating yourself up for not being ""normal"" because you're afraid of sex and the things surrounding it. If you work through your fears and wait until you're with someone you trust, it's amazing. 

So.. that was really long. I'm not sure if anyone will read the whole thing. But just know that you're not alone, and that one day (soon or down the road) you CAN have a healthy sex life again even if today it feels like you've been broken down and had that taken from you.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1c45kb,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1c45kb/i_had_sex_for_the_first_time_since_being/,

I'm not putting this on my throwaway, because it is an honest and painful account in rebuttal to [""getting married the right way""](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/09/14/staying-celibate-before-marriage-was-best-thing-ive-ever-done/).

Let me preface this by saying this: my wife and I not only waited sexually, but we courted each other in a way that was consistent with the religious sexual brainwashing we received.

**We did it wrong.**

We courted for five years before tying the knot. Even then, the love I possessed was a slanted view based around a hormonal need to feel connected.  I thought that by waiting for years, I was showing that sex wasn't my reason for committing for life. The self-control was evident, but the desires 'to do it right' overrode the glaring flags in front of my eyes. 

Our wedding ceremony was a financial burden on us and our families, so the bare essentials were all we maintained. It was incredible for the price point we managed, and everything I had always wanted. The stresses of the day, however, meant that by the time we got to our hotel for the night, we were both exhausted. What was supposed to be a beautiful night, turned into attempting to consumate our marriage just because that was what you did. 

Our honeymoon was interspersed with bitterness and fighting after it became apparent that my wife's sexual drive was near non-existent, while my libido was raging. No matter what I had been told, I always assumed that we'd always at least meet in the middle; but in a situation like what I was thrown into, the partner with a low libido holds all the power.

This evolved into a constant struggle over years: my pushing, and her becoming bitter towards sex. The hangups I received from the ""right way"" still haunt me to this day, but I won't delve into all the misinformation we received from those who were ""trying to help.""

After a couple years, and a horrible economy, I was forced to take a job over an hour from my wife and young son *(edit: [more details](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/105c0h/the_painful_side_of_getting_married_the_right_way/c6am6xf?context=1))*. I worked tirelessly in a dead-end job I hated, only being able to visit on the weekends. The apparent strain eventually had me reconsider the distance, and I moved back; trading the distance for a daily hour long commute both ways. This was only marginally better. 

One night, my wife went out with her friends, while I stayed at home babysitting. As I was going to bed, I left a poem on her pillow, still feeling love in a painful situation. The morning brought me to panic with the poem still nestled on her pillow in that lonely bedroom. Panicking, I called hospitals, police departments, and anything else I could think of; after moments that felt like years, a friend of hers picked up, saying my wife should have been home at 3 when they left the bar. Several heartbreaking minutes later, my wife called. I managed to find out that she had spent the night with a man from her work that had went out with them. 

I was shattered. Despite being broken, I committed to repairing our relationship; then she did it again. I'm still not sure why, but I tried one more time. Her reluctance to go to counseling or have a mediator of any kind made it feel like it was a pointless endeavor. 

After 8 months and very little progress, I was so broken I moved out. We are now in the process of arranging our divorce. 

Do your wedding the ""wrong way"". If you're young and wondering whether you should wait, whether you should just give in, and do it the world’s way. If you're wondering whether the perfect scenario is worth it, let me tell you without a doubt that it isn't. Your wedding can be the a loving and beautiful ceremony you have with someone you know will last the long haul... or the pain you'll carry for the rest of your life.

I had met a nice girl, lovely, sweet, long dark hair, exactly my type, and we were on the couch making out.  I thought we were headed to second base, maybe, but turns out, it was my lucky day.

She reached down, unzipped me, released the Kraken, if you know what I mean.  I was thinking, this is a *very* nice girl.  Even nicer than I thought: she slipped off the couch and knelt between my knees, gave me that ""You want it?"" smile.  Yes, it turned out, I did want it.  She bent her head down, gave Mr Happy some preliminary smooches, and then made a sudden motion like she just remembered something.

With one hand, she opened her purse and started rooting around in it.  I thought she might be looking for a condom, or breath spray, or a Chap-Stick, or something.  I didn't know.

Unfortunately, she brought out what I can only describe as **The Sex Toy From Hell**.

It wasn't very big.  If you curve your fingers into a C shape, you get a good idea of the size and the shape of the thing.  It was made from two pieces of dark plastic, each with a half-dozen long sharp teeth, and hinged and sprung so the teeth interlocked like the teeth of a rabid Rottweiler.  It was fitted with small wing-like grips so when she squeezed them, the whole thing gaped open, the slavering mouth of the Rottweiler; when she released, it snapped shut.

I had a vivid, vivid mental picture of the horrible thing clamping down, as it was obviously meant to, on my penis, the teeth digging into my flesh.  How sharp were those teeth?  How strong was the spring?

The girl wasn't looking at my face, but she'd kept her free hand on my erection and when that collapsed like a crushed paper cup, she looked up at me with a puzzled expression.  She saw my bug-eyed stare and looked back at the toothed, emasculating horror in her other hand and then looked back at me.

She got it in a second and held the thing up, she made it give a few more horrifying dog-like snaps at me, and then...

And then, she tilted her head back and used the Toy for its actual intended purpose: [she clipped her long hair back away from her face](http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/1213638/2/stock-photo-1213638-hair-clip.jpg).

My GF is Jewish, not extremely religious or anything although her family is perhaps more so than her. 

We have been together 10 months now, and for about the last 6 months sometimes she will ask me to handcuff her naked to the shower and then I whip her with a riding crop and threaten to turn on the shower which we pretend is gas - basically like she's a Jew in Auschwitz about to be gassed and I'm a prison guard. She then bargains with me to save her and I have sex with her or she goes down on me. She likes it when I yell German words at her like ""Raus"" or ""Schnell"". (sp)

I felt sort of weird about it to begin with, I do have 1 Jewish grandparent that survived the holocaust myself (I wouldn't say that my family observes the religion though or anything like that.) and I know it would be incredibly disappointing to my grandma that I did something like this.

Anyway, I admit I like dominant kind of sex or BDSM stuff so it didn't really bother me but 2 days ago she told me she got me a surprise and it turned out to be that she ordered me a German WWII nazi officer uniform off the net for when we have our shower-gas-prisoner sexytime. I think this was where it got too weird for me. I haven't worn it yet but I'm really anxious about when she will ask me to.

It's kind of making me feel like I shouldn't have even been doing the shower stuff without the uniform.

I really really like this woman, we have talked about the future and everything and she's very cool and I am in love with her. What makes me feel worse is that early on we promised each other we would never judge each other sexually for quirks or fetishes that we admitted to and it's been very freeing and all around the best sex I have ever had so far. I don't want her to feel like she is being judged as too much of a freak over this but I don't know what to do.

I made a follow up post to tell you that when I confronted here about the change I found out she had been cheating on me.

I know this has probably evolved past the regular content of r/sex but I wanted to give you all one final update. I have received many encouraging messages from people that read my posts and reading your words of encouragement got me through a very rough time.

First of all (since this is the question I get the most), I am in the process of getting a divorce. The wife and I had a pre-nup with a fidelity clause so I am looking at keeping about 75% of our collective assets. I want to settle as soon as possible so I can move on but I get the feeling she wants to drag this out as long as possible.

I finally decided to contact her about two weeks after I initially stormed out. We decided to meet up at my hotel to talk. She came over and we talked for about four hours. I knew it was over before she even came over but I get the feeling she came over with the intention of convincing me to stay with her. She apologized dozens of times and told me the story of how her affair started. I don't exactly blame her for the initial infidelity. If I am being honest I was emotionally unavailable during some of that time because of high stress at work and the death of my father. But the length of her affair and the continual lying she had to do to keep it going have convinced me that I could never trust her again.

Our conversation that day ended very awkwardly. There was a lull about 4 hours in when I think both of us were exhausted from talking and shouting. She took that opportunity to try to make a move on me. I rebuffed her sexual advance and that made her start crying. It was really sad. She was balling but still offering to give me a BJ or ""whatever I wanted"". I think I can count on one hand the number of BJs I have gotten from her in the last year. This was not like her. This was sad, desperate, and unattractive. I made her leave. I have not directly spoken to her since.

On a personal level, I am generally coping okay. I have basically thrown myself into work to avoid being lonely. I moved into a new condo last week. I know ""condo"" sounds bad but this is in a high rise with a great view. I have been maintaining my fitness regimen and have even started marathon training. I am not officially dating anyone but I have been on a few dates with a friend from law school. Word about my divorce traveled fast because I instantly got calls from many of my friends offering their support. It turns out many people also knew about the infidelity. No one that was extremely close to me knew but it still hurts that so many people out there were in on something that made me look so foolish.

It started when we finally got to our room after traveling all day. I was very turned on and he was eager to go down on me. So we began. Things happened like always. First, he did what he does best... had his fingers inside of me, licking, and sucking, making me shake, all while I was grinding hard against his face. Then he slid a finger into my ass. It felt amazing so I went with it. I started squirting everywhere. I had a very intense orgasm! After laying there for a minute, I thought something smelled weird, but I didn't think anything of it.

I laid on the bed for a second and he went to the bathroom. And when I stood up, oh my god. Poop! All over the bed and me. Running down my leg. He came out of the bathroom and I started crying. I was mortified. Of course he held me and told me it wasn't a big deal. He's amazing like that, but I cannot help to think he thinks I'm disgusting! Like I can't control myself. He kissed me a million times and wiped my tears away so I'm trying not to let it haunt me, but I am so embarrassed! 

Of course one of the first things from his mouth was, ""shit happens""... 

Has this ever happened to anyone else?

He's been talking about it ever since we got together and he seemed to be a real butt-enthusiast. He always likes to grab my ass and play with it (using his finger) during sex and talk about how he'll penetrate my tiny little butthole and stuff like that. It feels good and makes my orgasms more intense which is awesome, so I finally agreed to have anal sex. 

He seemed reaaallyy excited, like really fucking excited and since he's been talking about it for ages I guess it was like Christmas for him that day. He was rock-hard and so horny and I loved it. BUT! After penetration he didn't seem to enjoy it as much as we thought he would. He asked me to try and tighten my sphincter muscles during play because I guess I was too relaxed......so ofc I did. I really tried my best to be as tight as he imagined I'd be down there. Poor thing seemed really disappointed because this has been his fantasy for soo many years... I feel ashamed and kind of useless in a weird way. we never spoke about it afterwards and he never ever asked for more. Like...now he doesn't even touch my ass the way he used to. I really feel like my asshole crushed his hopes and dreams. 

Can you imagine how I'm feeling right now? All I want to know it if this is something that happens other guys. Have you tried anal and been disappointed because of your gf/bfs loose butthole? I don't know if my butthole is loose even, to me it's pretty damn tight - but he's not very well endowed so.... :( I know that he's disappointed but I don't know how to make up for this. Should I talk to him? This is really bothering me and I can't stop thinking about it...

Edit: Thanks for all the help guys and gals. She doesn't get home from work for a a few hours so ill post about it then. Sorry for such a delayed response!

Edit: For people saying I should post a picture of her face when I posted a pic of her body, no. Its not the same thing. I dont want to post a pic of her face and have some stalker find her facebook page. Unfortunately I cant get her to post a verification picture, as im pretty sure that wouldnt go over so well.
And to those saying im trolling, why would I go through the trouble of making this post to troll? I legit wanted to hear the opinions of other people and the consensus seems to be that its most likely not her. When she gets home ill just show her the gif and see what happens.

I don't really see disabled people as disabled, kinda hard to explain. Anyway, in college I became friends with a girl who had muscular dystrophy. It wasn't very bad, but she was in a wheel chair, could walk a bit in a walker, and slightly effected speech. We were in a few of the same classes and I always went out of my way to say hi to her, be generally friendly, and basically try to make her feel like she was just a normal person (this is what I really learned to do when volunteering all the time). She ended up being really cool, so I would walk her to class and hang out with her a little bit. She had a full time helper for school and basic living stuff during the week, but was all alone on the weekends when the helper was gone or her family wasn't in town. I would come by every once in a while and give her a hand with stuff, watch t.v. or movies, and just chill. I know she wasn't supposed to drink, but she was in college and wanted to try it so we drank together a few times. Once, she started asking me about sex and everything, and told me how she watched porn but couldn't really do much about it. Blah blah blah, long story short, she ended up asking me to sleep with her. Strictly as friends. So I did it. I guess her parents had offered to help her in that regard in the past, but she was too embarrassed, so she said no to them.

Most of it was just letting her explore/see me, and me pleasing her. She really liked it and thanked me immensely afterwards. We stayed friends and had fun once more after that. We still keep in touch and she's now happily married to a great guy. I was wondering if anyone else had ever done this?

Your pubic hair (in whatever configuration) is fine. Some will prefer it, others won't, and it's fine. 

You do not need to have your genitals look a certain way.

Your junk is not dirtier or grosser than a man's. 

Going down on you is not more disgusting or more objectively intimate than taking a penis in the mouth. 

You are not being shallow or bitchy or sex-obsessed or overly demanding if you want oral sex to happen at an equal or near-equal rate.

You do not need to stay with men who remain one-sided in the sack, even if they are otherwise nice or funny or what have you. It's up to you, and not the same for everyone, but it's fine to have sexual fulfillment be a dealbreaker. Really.

You can communicate your desires - I believe in you! -  and in fact, you probably should. He might be more receptive than you think.

There's a solid chance your pussy lips are normal, and not in need of labiaplasty, even if they are larger than the pornographic staple.

There's also a pretty solid chance that if a dude ever trash-talked your body, he was not someone to listen to or care about, at least not in that moment. 

It's ok if you take awhile to come. 

It's ok if you can only come through clitoral stimulation.

Your larger labia are not a sign that you've had too much sex, or too much sex with different guys. That is a bullshit myth :)

In short: Treat yo'self, try to start loving your body. Don't sell yourself short through insecurities. 

(This rant brought to you all by the sadness I feel at the plethora of ""I give a million blowjobs a month with no reciprocation, that's normal right?"", ""My vagina is ugly, help!"", ""long labia: disgusting or not?"", ""I never get off and he won't even try to change, how can I get him to care about my needs?"" and ""I only have clit orgasms, but I want real ones!"" posts I've seen in this subreddit since I started lurking here ages ago.)

Am I selfish to expect progress?,2391,874,784,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/17xjft/my_long_term_girlfriend_is_becoming_increasingly/,"I'm 26/m and I've been in a relationship with a 26/f for 10 years now. When we started out she was very sexual, more so than I was, but over the years it petered out. We've lived long distance from each other a couple of times, and I guess being out of intimacy might have killed it. It went from being every time we saw each other to maybe a couple of times a week, then maybe once a week (to be expected). Now, over the last 2-3 years it has been getting worse and worse. Right now I'm approaching 2 months. It was at least six weeks before that, and last time anything happened she was quite drunk.  

I say anything, because I'm including anything. She says she clamps up and penetration hurts, she says I'm too big (I suppose I should see that as a positive in all of this but I don't). I've tried to be understanding, I've given her time, space, I've been gentle and never gotten annoyed with her at failed attempts (I mean this - I haven't just hidden it, I haven't been angry at all). I've told her to try whatever she can - although I've told her I'd prefer something better than a handjob because I can do that myself. It's becoming less and less frequent, as though she's not trying. We've tried lube, we've tried rules to make it easier (eg. both agreeing we won't try penetration even if we both want it). I've even suggested mutual masturbation would be enough to get comfortable with each other again. The only time I get angry is if she's trying something and obviously looks annoyed.  

She says she doesn't like sex, has no drive for it, doesn't want it, and she can't help it. She says everything leading up to it is the same; without arousal she doesn't want it. I asked her to try building up to the point where she remembers how much she used to enjoy it. I make sure she has an orgasm every time (even if she has to help out).  

We've only ever been with each other, and I've never cheated. If this was anyone else I'd suspect she was, but I know she isn't; I can't explain why I just know she would never do that, and I believe her reasons.  

I am getting so annoyed with the situation, so frustrated. More and more I'm thinking I'm in the wrong here, and that instead of expecting her to be something she isn't, instead of being selfish, I should either accept it or leave. I love this girl completely, but I feel like I'm stuck and consigning myself to a life of frustration if I stay. She says she wants to marry me and have children (I've tried explaining how that wouldn't work) and I want the same except for this one thing. I just can't keep doing it. I've spoken to her about it a load of times. Sometimes I sleep in another room because I'm so frustrated lying next to her. I told her that seeing her undress really annoys me now because I want it but can't have it.  

It's so frustrating. I feel like I'd be leaving her over something trivial, yet something so important. I've told her she's left me in a position where I'm sexually frustrated and can't have sex with anyone in the world. I've told her it's ridiculous that she holds exclusive rights to something she doesn't want, that I don't want to be with someone else but she needs to realise the situation she's putting me in. My options are not have sex, cheat, or leave her, and I'll never cheat.

The texts have gone from fun and flirty.. to slightly explicit and naughty which I'll admit I liked. We finally had our first date I went to his place we had dinner and watched a movie. Hugging turned to cuddling turned to snuggling turned to me bent over the couch with his face deep between my cheeks with his tongue in me. I was totally into it and everything he was doing until he stopped for a second and was kissing my hips and he said "" there better not be any other guys competeting for you ... Cause i'll fuck those dudes up "" . I heard what he said but paid it no mind .. He literally was  tongue fucking me into a stupor so it didn't register like it probably should've .. It registered like oh he's being aggressive and macho and trying to be ""that"" guy.

Now once he made me orgasm 4x and when I was shaking and recovering .. He slid my panties back up ..pulled up my leggings straightened my shirt .. Then he pulled me up grabbed me rather firmly by the back of the neck and looked me in the eye and said "" you better stay talking to me or I'll fuck you up. Now give me a kiss little girl "" I kissed him because I didn't know what else to do.. I'll admit I was scared but in an arousing sort of way ..I sort of liked his laying claim to me. 

We cuddled for a small bit after I was a bit more closed off because him saying that started to play in my head .. What did he mean ? Did he just threaten me ? Was he being for real ...or was it just him trying to be sexy?  Minutes later he pulls me into his lap and we kiss and he's telling me how beautiful he finds me .. I ask him if he wants me .. He says yes I tease and say how bad tell me you want me .. He then quickly grabbed me by the throat flips me back and slams me into the couch holding my throat and says through his teeth .. ""You fucking ask me that one more time .. Of course I'm going crazy I want you so fucking bad ""  and that actually scared me.


Wtf does this mean ? Should I be alarmed ? And if so how do I ease out of it without poking the bear and him reacting in a way that hurts me. I sorta feel like it was meant to be sexy and aggressive and I love that in a man .. Someone who can toss me around a bit .. But something about it ...

1375908007.0,1446,self.sex,1jwpto,UPDATE: I had sex with a paralyzed girl.,1970,524,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jwpto/update_i_had_sex_with_a_paralyzed_girl/,"A couple days ago, I posted [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jrtht/quick_advice_im_about_to_have_sex_with_a/) about having sex with a paralyzed girl that I knew. Yes, it is a different account name, but I was at work at the time and didn't know the password to my account (I use RoboForm to manage my passwords) so I had to create a account on the fly. This is just an update for anybody that was interested in my situation.

A lot of your concerns were if her condition would allow her to have safe sex. I spoke with her about it, and her doctor had told her that sex would be safe as long as we were not too rough. 

Next is the comfort level. She was a bit nervous at first, but who wouldn't be. She had not had sex in over a year, and I believe that she was a bit embarrassed that I had to help her get her clothes off and move/bend her legs. But, we started out with kissing, neck biting, and getting all touchy. I could tell she was still a bit nervous, so I made sure that I was being vocal so she knew I was enjoying it. After about 5 minutes, she told me she was too horny for all this foreplay jazz and told me to fuck her. Instant turn on for me.

As far as positions go, we started out with missionary since that was obviously the easiest. We then moved on to her laying on her side and me laying behind her (She said this was her favorite). We had planned on her trying to get on top, but the sex got so hot we just completely forgot about and it ended with her laying on her stomach and me on top. Afterwards, after we had cleaned up and gotten dressed, she was still curious if she could ever be on top. She can hold her balance fairly well, so I helped her bend her legs and she straddled me, and she leaned forward with her hands on my shoulders to support her. I would obviously have to do most of the work, but still very doable.

All in all, I enjoyed it and she did as well. She was nervous at first, but I tried my hardest to make her feel sexy and show her that I was enjoying it. I could tell she became extremely comfortable with me afterwards. I was helping her get her clothes back on and she cracked the joke, ""Damn. Normally I'm begging boys to take my clothes off, not put them back on!""

For the ones that were curious about my situation, there you go! If you guys have any further questions, I'd be more than glad to answer them!   ",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1jwpto,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jwpto/update_i_had_sex_with_a_paralyzed_girl/,

EDIT: So a few users are claiming I pretend to be a know it all and this makes me dangerous. They're engaging in ad-hominem attacks that are not even required.
What do I say at this point? An internet guy using a throwaway account is a know it all?  I sure as hell didn't do this for any recognition. Nor the insults. I'm just sharing things with you. I know the internet is a nasty place at times but give me a break. Please at least read the post before deciding if I'm evil or not. Nothing's worse than being misinterpreted and having to explain yourself over an over. Further, it upsets the other users and the post loses credibility. If you have a correction, it's cool, but do not make this a flame war. Please. 
 I'm getting so much shit for the paragraph about how the ass can be sensitive and saying that size doesn't matter and people are being nasty in the comments section. Why not treat free advice on reddit like it is? This is the first time I've posted here and I think it might be useful. If you do not find it useful then do not follow it, simple. Let's not get personal here, people. Anyway, I'm not replying to comments any further unless you have questions which I'll be glad to answer :)
In any case my post will remain unedited. If you've got a better way of doing things, please post it in the comments. No need to try and bring me down. Have a good day everyone :)

Hey Reddit!

Some things before I start:

* This is a throwaway account. Don't ask why. 
* ""Partner"" because these should work on a man or a woman, though they are optimised for a guy to use on a girl. Go LGBT power!
* I'm an average looking straight guy with a skinnyfat body. It turns out I'm  good at making a girl feel good, even though my physique and demeanor would suggest otherwise. Someone remarked that I shouldn't hide this knowledge ( I don't even know!) so I'm posting this here.
* STOP READING COSMO AND MAXIM OTHER SUCH BULLSHIT. IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE ABOUT YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU SPEND MONEY ON THINGS THEY THINK WILL MAKE YOU BETTER. THE SEX TIPS THERE ARE THE BIGGEST LOAD OF BULLSHIT I HAVE EVER READ. YOU HAVE BETTER CHANCES WITH A GOOD SEX LIFE BY USING CRAIGSLIST.
* I might elaborate on things if you want me to but remember I'm no sexpert or doctor or jock. No personal question please. I'm just average and normal, I play games and spend time on reddit and look at tentacle porn just like you all do. This is just what I think works. If you disagree then post it for the better of readers, not because you wish to one-up me.
* This post is divided into two parts, mental and environmental, and physical. Then there's a conclusion. I'll be glad if someone wants to tl;dr this but finishing a sex post in 30 seconds will send the wrong idea you know. So for once don't rush. Read on.

MENTAL/ENVIRONMENTAL:

You're a guy. You have a penis. When the penis is rubbed for a sufficient amount of time you will eventually orgasm. It's quite simple. You don't even give a fuck about who's rubbing it. 
She's a girl. For her, sex goes a little beyond that. The female form is much more complex and subtle, sex is much more mental than it is for you. Remember, when you are having sex, you're not dealing with yourself. You're dealing with a different person and their pleasure may not always come through the ways it comes in for you.

1. UNDERSTAND HER. The key to good sex is to pay attention. I'll actually explain this so no freak out. If she arches her body, she likes it. If she breather harder, she likes it. If she pulls your hair, she likes it. If she's purring, she likes it. Trust me, these hints aren't subtle. If you're doing it right, they're obvious. Why don't you see them all the time though? Allow me to explain. BACKGROUND NOISE. You are so much into being rough and getting into her pants that you miss the hints. Slow down, tiger. Listen. Feel. Want to test my theory? Kiss her around the neck, lightly at first, then tongue, finally bite a little. With any luck, you shall have located the spots she likes you in. Now mix and match, but remember, she loves it at that spot. She will have displayed all these signs for you to notice. A woman is beautiful and she WILL communicate. Just listen ;)

2) EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT. You need to feel your way around to understand the mechanics of every girl. It's not a chore, it's not hard, it's just something that unfolds beautifully with time. That's why long-term partners have better sex than people who have just met. Now I'm sure you won't have much time to understand the girl who you're making out with at the bar but remember, even in a short time you can understand enough. And trust me it feels GOOD! 

3) THE PLEASURE IS SOMETIMES IN THE CHASE: We all like rough, spontaneous sex. The kind where she's just bending over in yoga pants to pick something up and next thing you know, you're doing her like an animal and she's loving it and within a short while you both lie in a mess. So good, right? Try doing the opposite though. Tease her from the beginning of the day. Act like you'll do her even before getting out of bed then stop. Touch and text her provocatively. Mix the two. Slide a finger around her waist when you see it. Kiss her neck when you're behind her. Then act nonchalant. When you're finally alone, act like you'd do anything to do her, but restrain yourself. Just till the edge. Lean close and pull out of a kiss. Now suddenly rub her vagina hard (don't hurt her!) and act like nothing happened. Back to the game. Enjoy it. Keep it on till she can take no more. Then give her the sweet, sweet release. Trust me she'll come before you get your pants off. Achievement Unlocked.

4) BE CLEAN: I cannot stress this enough. You need to smell nice and fresh. Good hygiene is VERY important. Always wear clean underwear. Just a little cologne or aftershave. Have a REALLY clean pubic region if you want a blowjob. Shaved balls mean they get some love too. A little natural scent is a turn on but don't stink!

5) ENVIRONMENT: Try lighting candles sometime. Incense if you like. Dim the lighting. Do it in the evening instead of the night. Do it in an open balcony (inb4 google earth). Have a huge bed. Or a couch. Or the kitchen floor. Mix and match. Don't make the setting always predictable. Now I'm not saying you can never have sex in the same place twice but make it special sometimes. USE MUSIC! Massive Attack and Burial and Bonobo and Sigur Ros and whatever you want!

PHYSICAL:

Aah. Now for the more actionable tips. Read on.

1) EVERYTHING IS KISSABLE: The asshole and the armpits will often be a girl's guilty pleasure that you should be careful with but try sometime. The ears are always good, so is the neck. Go wild and wet and rough on the neck, then tender and slow. Your breath down her back feels good. Turn her around and show the back some love. Those muscles hold up her breasts all day. Trace a finger around the waist, then kiss it. Kiss under and between the breasts. Kiss the belly, the pubic mount. The thighs, the knees, the back of the knees (LOL Scott Pilgrim ) the feet, the toes, suck them a little if she likes. EVERY DAMN PART NEEDS A KISS UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE. Show her body some love. Not only is this a turn on, it makes her more comfortable about herself. Also by the time you've kissed her all over, she's wet for you like crazy. See tip 3) above ;)

2) THE ASSHOLE CAN BE VERY SENSITIVE: While all girls are comfortable with you playing with the butt, the hole itself makes them shy. It's not always because she hates it, it's sometimes because she thinks it's unclean. I've found a good way for this. Start kissing and licking slowly down her back. Soon it'll be clear that the ass is a stop. So ease her into it. she'll agree more often than not. If she refuses weakly, tell her to be quiet and carry on (only if it is clean!) Breathe on it gently first. If she acts favorably, kiss and later, tongue. Remember, although you need to try new things, you also need to respect her limits. If you cannot do that, get a blow up doll.

3) BE CREATIVE WITH KISSING: Why would you not do that! Few things are as arousing as a man's lips on hers. Suck the lower lip. Then the upper one. Kiss all over the face but not the lips. Pull away, smile, then French kiss. Use the tongue. Kiss her when she's on your lap, you're on hers, both of you are standing, all that. Kiss her in public sometime. Just a light peck. Bite her lips sometimes. Kiss the nose and the eyes. Kiss the goddamn jawline, it's magic. Kiss the spot below her ear. Kiss the ear. Lose yourself in her scent. Enjoy it, man. You're not a slave. This should make you feel good too. Trust me, a woman is an acquired taste :)

4) FUCKING LEARN HOW TO MASSAGE HER. And don't pay for it. Use Youtube. Not porn sites. Youtube. Massage her all over. I'm a massage God and I never ever saw even a video or got a massage. I'm just too good at reading a girl. A massage is not only wonderfully erotic, it'll teach you to read girls better and it'll make her comfortable with her body which was very beautiful to start with. Use oils and lotions but you can do it without them too, just be careful. Also remember a massage can often put a girl into (PLEASURABLE) sleep. In such cases it's best to take your clothes off, hold her tight and kiss her to a beautiful, dreamy sleep. Morning sex will ensue.

5) DOMINATE SOMETIMES. Hold her hands behind her. Bend her backwards when kissing. Pull her hair near the roots. Bite the neck. Use your body weight when on top sometimes. Push her against a wall and kiss her all over, then turn her around and touch her pussy while you kiss her lips from the back. Then drag her into bed. Of course you need to understand that she needs to be wanting this! But be a damn man sometimes and take what's rightfully yours.

6) [LEARN TO EAT HER OUT]( http://www.xvideos.com/video51477/nina_hartley_giving_pussy-eating_lessons_to_sunny_lane) In addition to this, tease her with the tongue on the thighs. Go down slowly, starting at the face. Let the anticipation build. When she's ready to come, hold a steady rhythm. Also finger her when giving oral sex. Also lots of saliva (You don't need to spit, porn is bullshit.) Also yes, I got this video off reddit and was surprised to find this is exactly what I do! And try 69. Works great although it's tough to get off because the other partner will lose their rhythm when close.

7) LEARN TO FUCK HER. You don't need to try the Kama Sutra to begin with (which by the way is a weird book that says letting insects bite your dick makes it bigger and only eunuchs suck cock). First, you need to get over YOUR image issues and remember size doesn't fucking matter. Try three basic positions : Missionary, Cowgirl, Doggy style. Now there are tricks to each: 

Missionary : Prop yourself up on the balls of your feet with legs extended. Go high. then go deep and slow. Slooooow. Like a machine powering down. Repeat. Ask her to fold her legs upwards, makes it deeper. The slow move KILLS. Kiss and bite often, use the hands on the breasts. Also, [read this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coital_alignment_technique)

Cowgirl: Prop yourself up on your elbows and push into her when she's bucking wildly. Align your movements with hers. Very pleasurable. Don't just lie down there! You can make it so much better. Let her hang her breasts into your mouth too. And play with the butt.

Doggy : ARCHING IS THE KEY! [So is making her legs not parallel, thus twisting a little. Exposes so much more pussy.](http://th05.deviantart.net/fs16/200H/f/2007/213/6/a/Cat_girl_on_all_fours__by_Bradwells.jpg) (Sorry for the example, couldn't find anything else.) Before you  enter, lick her pussy and ass. Play with the breasts a lot! And try going slower and slower like a machine powering down. KILLS!

8) DO MORE! Rub your dick all over her. Ask her to sit on your face. Lie naked till one of you NEEDS to fuck. Fuck the breasts. Lie on top and get a blowjob. Be creative. Just because the porn you saw had half an hour of sex and a money shot doesn't mean your sex life should be like this too.




CONCLUSION: Hopefully you read thus far. Now for the secret: THERE IS NONE. Just read her, enjoy her, get off on getting her off. That's all. No philosophical bullshit, no secret pleasure points. Nothing. Don't read stupid big-corp websites and magazines and goddamn Oprah. This is not their game, it's yours. It's yours to enjoy, not to win. At the end of it all when a sweaty, spent girl will give you the biggest smile ever and kiss you, you'll know you've been good. Sex is beautiful, as are you. Feel it.

Phew. That was some typing. Hope it's put to good use. Have fun, reddit. And always wear a condom :)
Also guys, listen to the album Doolittle by Pixies. Best songwriting ever. I was listening to it as I wrote this.

Love!

1367014876.0,1427,self.sex,1d6l91,Let's stop virgin shaming,2569,1142,404,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1d6l91/lets_stop_virgin_shaming/,"[inspired by this recent jackass](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1d4j1m/why_are_people_so_weird_when_it_comes_to_virgins/c9mxw83), I feel it is my civic duty to stop virgin shaming. 

To summarize:

virgin =/= stage 5 clinger once penetrated. 
This is as offensive as saying someone who has had a high number of sexual partners probably has STD's or has Daddy issues. It may be true for some, but it's certainly not true for all


virgin =/= a child incapable of their own decisions. Seems to me a lot of non-virgins with virgins feel ""responsible"" for virgins. Virgins are adults who are capable of making their own decisions and dealing with the consequences, just like non-virgins. Treat them as equals, because they are your equals. 


virgin =/= sexually oblivious. 
Just…trust me on this. Just because you haven't had PIV doesn't mean you aren't experienced in other sexual activities, or that you don't have sexual fantasies or interests.


virgin =/= emotionally oblivious.
Did you ever think that maybe some people wait because they are VERY aware of the intricacies of relationships (both sexual and non sexual) and are carefully weighing pros and cons and working on developing their relationship skills before fully committing to someone else? 


(male) virgin =/= desperate.
I am sure there are plenty of male virgins who have had reasons or beliefs for waiting, and that their status is not result of a lack of opportunity. We should respect that. I'm sure this can apply to females as well, but this is something I see more applied to male virgins.

Before anything else, the mods truly want to thank you for making this community the great place that it is. Your contributions are invaluable and we love the discussions that take place here. We all learn so much from the posts and comments and gain so much from this community. 

Many of us in this community have really noticed the influx of new members who aren’t aware of what this /r/sex stands for. We need your help in making it clear that this is a sex-positive, safe space for everyone. Many members have messaged us with their concerns about the hivemind mentality starting to be seen here, with derogatory comments becoming more prevalent. 

You know the “**report**” link that can be found under every post/comment? If you believe they’re breaking our sidebar guidelines, then we really need you to click “report”. Your name does not show up when you do it; the mods simply get a notification that it’s been reported and then we look into it. Violations of the guidelines result in one warning and if it happens again, they are banned from /r/sex. There are some instances where the hate-speak is so extreme that they are immediately banned without warning.

Another thing that’s important to remember is that the upvote/downvote buttons are not to be used as “I agree/disagree”. Members have been noticing more and more that with the added numbers to the community, threads are beginning to take on a hivemind mentality, where any post that goes against the dominant belief being expressed in that thread is downvoted into oblivion. One of the greatest things about /r/sex is the diverse beliefs and opinions on topics. Everyone has the right to express their opinion here, as long as it’s done in a respectful manner and follows the sidebar guidelines. People need to be able to express opinions that are different from the majority of the comments without having to worry about being attacked or having their comment pretty much disappear due to the downvotes. We encourage you to engage in actual discussion rather than using the 
downvote button to express your disagreement. 

Lastly, a reminder to please read through [the FAQ/wiki]( http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index) before posting as well as checking the /r/sex history (especially if you’re submitting a link) before posting. We’re also looking for ideas from you to let us know what can/should be done to ensure that with the added numbers to this community, it remains a sex-positive, safe space for everyone. What do you need from us mods and what can other members do to help?

I am not trying to put down anyone's porn taste, but jesus christ, I've just about given up.

I can't speak for everyone, but I personally am turned on by people's bodies, and their reactions to pleasure, not fucking close ups of people's genitals clashing together over and over. I am not turned on by this high pitched fake squeaking or any of this porn bullshit.

Porn has some great potential, but fuck! It's nearly impossible to find. Even 'quality porn subs' like r/passionx have been in decline, and aren't that much different from your average freudian explosion of fucking baby talk, bad makeup, and fucking cumming on people. 

Why always with the cumming on people? Don't you have a condom? Can't you just *not* cum on her face? Is this what everyone else finds fucking attractive? These goofy, squealing morons making fake noises as their fake breasts jump up and down as they fake orgasm on some fake couch?

Christ! can't a man get a fap in every now and then? Apparently not.

I guess this is more of a rant than anything, but I just am wondering if anyone is as frustrated with porn as I am.

What in fuck's cunt is sexy about any of this?

So I was a 25 year old virgin till yesterday. I met a girl on a party this friday. We kissed and she always told me what she want to do to me in bed. We had no place to go on this evening so we decided to meet on saturday. It was 100% sure we gonna have sex. She didn`t know I was vigrin because I lied about some sex stories. I was nervous because I thought that I would blow my load as soon as she touches me. That´s where you guys came into the story. I browsed /r/sex for about two ours to be prepared.

Back to her house. We started immediately as I entered. She blew me for about 10 minutes and I was surprised I could take it without cumming. After that I went down on her for my first time and because of [this](http://www.xvideos.com/video51477/nina_hartley_giving_pussy-eating_lessons_to_sunny_lane) she came after 10-15 minutes. Then we started fucking. To my surprise i managed three different positions till we came together. We spend like 5 hours in bed with some breaks and I gave her several orgasms. After I came the second time I wasn`t even able to finish so she asked to stop because she said it was too much.

All in all it was the best fucking night of my life and I just want to spread the message to other virgins that the internet is a wonderful place to learn everything and that you shouldn`t be concerded like me that you cum too fast or that you dissappoint the woman.

a new sexxit post.",2578,1190,472,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fuqca/that_does_it_here_are_your_answers_before_you/,"[edit] I AM A GUY. There. That should do it.

After seeing the billionth post about ""I have a guy who keeps going soft,"" ""My woman is dry,"" and ""We're about to lose our virginity, pls help,"" I am giving you the answers, here and now. If you're thinking of posting in Sexxit, read these first and see if it answers your questions.

Credentials: I'm a slut in a poly marriage. I have racked up a count of lovers in my 36 years on this earth that makes many people blanch and step away from me. 21 years sexually active, VERY active. I am not a sex therapist, just a person who fucks a lot. I was once a virgin, I have been married, I've been single, and I've done it all, baby.

- If she's dry, even when she's turned on, go buy lube. Use it without shame. Something between 5.6% and 26% of women experience vag dryness, depending on country and poll. It's common. If she says she's into it, trust her at her word, put a splot of lube on, and go to town. You'll both be happy you did.
- If you're both virgins, nothing Sexxit tells you will cover all your bases. Your first times will be fumbling experiences, and you'll likely run into things like him not fitting into you easily, or him getting off too quick, pain, blood, cramps, shame, etc. All of that is normal. In the end, the only way you'll get better at sex is if you practice it more, and you communicate with your lover honestly. 
- He's going soft, in a new relationship? He's anxious. He should relax more. Alcohol can help, as can time together outside of the bed. 
- Provided that it harms nobody unwillingly, there is nothing wrong with $KINK. Even if it's ""deviant"" and ""sick,"" if it gets you off, it's all good.
- Communicate with your partner.
- Do Kegels.
- Just fucking talk to them, if you're approaching them for the first time. 
- Use condoms. When in any form of doubt, use them.
- Most women, by a giant majority, don't give a fuck about penis size. If you're longer than 3"", you're fine. 
- Women who squirt are sexy. It is not disgusting to us menfolk. We love it. We want to roll around on it like a dog in the garbage. 
- Get tested, as often as you need for peace of mind. Just fucking do it already.
- No, really, communicate with your partner.
- Getting into a three-way is always a touch-and-go situation, and nobody here can give you a perfect answer about how to make it happen.
- Friends with benefits situations are perfectly normal, and if done with no strings attached, really goddamned fun. Stop obsessing about it. Just go with it. 
- If your lover professes that they think you're hot, fucking **believe them.** Stop second-guessing. 
- They're called the G-Spot and the Anterior Fornix Zone. Google that shit and read up on them. 
- Everyone cums differently. Everyone. 

I hope this post can be pointed to in the future as a sort of FAQ for sexxit. Bring on the downvotes and anger.

I didn't even change out of my moving clothes: sweats, messy unwashed hair, PLUS I hadn't shaved my legs or lady business in almost a week. I was sure there would be no funny business.

So we sat down with some chips and salsa while he listened to me ramble about Star Trek and college and religion and ovulation until we settled on watching some decidedly unsexy Futurama.

Sitting turned to laying, laying turned to cuddling, and soon he began to caress me. His hand crept up under my shirt (which I can never say no to) and pretty soon he started to wander south.

""Um, hold on. I haven't shaved,"" I said. Before tonight I had always been precisely clean shaven by my own preference. But then he said those magic words... ""*You think I give a fuck?*""

He proceeded downward and fingered me until I had long, slow, and intense orgasm, trying desperately to stifle my moans as there were other people sleeping in the house.

Then he unbuttoned his fly, pulled me off the couch, bent me over, pulled my sweatpants down *just* enough...and fucked me right in the middle of the living room.

Not only was this hot in the semi-public we-could-get-caught way, but I also just felt so desired and sexy, in complete opposition to how I felt in the beginning of the night. It didn't matter what I was wearing, it didn't matter that I was a bit scruffy, he wanted me anyway. With enthusiasm.

**TL;DR Boyfriend fucked me when I felt like I looked my worst, it was really really hot and now I feel goddamn sexy.**

Help?",1787,454,433,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/17c8oa/i_23m_just_discovered_prostate_stimulation_and_i/,"First. Sorry for the way I wrote this. Writing it this way I'm really embarrassed by all this and it was the only way I could convince myself that I could post it, even anonymously. Just bear with me, okay?
  
  
This starts in a stupid, embarrassing way. I’m 23, but my doc decides he wants to do a prostate exam during my physical. (Quick question - isn’t that like twenty years early?)  
  
Okay. So he pushes in and it is the first time anyone’s *ever* been in there. Like **ever**. And two things happen within three seconds: I get idiotically, you-could-bend-a-steel-bar-around-my-dick, *stupid* hard. And I groan. Involuntarily and explosively and horrifically.  
  
My doctor laughed his ass off. I mean *laughed*, and told me it was okay. “Really,” he says. “It’s pretty common” he says.  
  
But his face tells me it’s not that common.  
  
Dutifully, I went to Reddit and looked this shit up. Reddit fucking loves it some straight guys getting off on their prostate. “So okay,” I say to myself, “let’s buy a fucking drumstick and do this thing.”  
  
So I go to a music store and buy a pair of drumsticks, talking incessantly about what a goddamn professional drummer I am, and how fucking necessary it is for me to own some drumsticks right then, as if the guy behind the counter could see *into my soul*, perfectly aware that I was going to shove one of those sticks right up my ass when I got home.  
  
I knew. He knew. The guy driving the bus knew. The drumsticks sat in that bag like the fucking One Ring, bending space around it. I had guilty secrets, stolen form the Gods, and I was going to fuck myself with them.  
  
So I get home and I do all the stuff. Lube, stick, push, feel, POW.  
  
Shit like cum, but not cum, some kind of watery *fluid* slips out of me in a big knot and feels fucking magnificent. Right out of the tip of my purple-tipped cock.  
  
(Another question. Purple tip. Normal when super-hard? Or am I going to give myself a blood clot or something? This is new for me.)  
  
It keeps coming, and the feeling gets better and better. I stop jerking off. (Oh, another note: I was jerking off.) My face gets hot. I realize I’m blushing. My chest blushes, too. That’s new. All my muscles tense up under my skin. They’re probably fucking blushing by now, too. I’m a big, red, purple dicked, autoerotic machine, pounding this drumstick into my ass while my GF is at work, feeling like a fucking idiot.  
  
My balls get this frozen cold sensation, and grip up into me, terrified of what’s about to happen (I would assume).  
  
At which point I actually, literally, honest-to-god it’s apparently not just a stupid phrase, see goddamn stars. Little colored lights. My head rushes. I cum so hard I actually scream. Not like a girl, I scream like an extra in 300. I scream like someone lifting a Buick over their head.  
  
Long story short it was the best orgasm of my life. And later that night, I had sex with my GF and the comparison was... I mean she’s sexy and wonderful and we have(had?) great sex, best so far, she’s awesome, but it didn’t compare. 
  
Next day, more drumstick. This time with porn. Porn gets shut off ten minutes in. I don’t need anything else. I’m a fucking prostate *monk*, austere in my faith.  
  
More sex with GF. She knows something’s up. Maybe not “I FOUND OUT MY BF IS FUCKING HIMSELF WITH SURPLUS MUSICAL EQUIPMENT REDDIT WHAT DO I DO?” up, but she knows.  
  
I keep the drumsticks on the nightstand like the fucking purloined letter. I say they’re for her. But I can kind of tell she’s not buying it. She knows I’m not as enthusiastic about sex.  
  
Fast forward three months. By now I’ve graduated to a full-on cock-shaped dildo stuck to the bedroom wall. Ass up, head down, biting a pillow. Believe me, I don’t get this either. Why cock shaped? Because I wanted something thicker and I figured if I was going to be fucking myself on a daily basis, I might as well get over any lingering homophobia that might be clinging to my soul.  
  
Okay, serious time. I’m not gay. I’m not Bi, either. I also don’t think there’s anything wrong with being either. In fact, it would be super convenient if I were Gay, because then I could tell my GF that I’m gay, and get fucked on a regular basis. I don’t know what to do about this. GF tries to seduce me a few times a week and I go along with it. She cums... and so do I, but it’s not fun for me. I lost interest in her. It takes me forever to cum.  
  
No, using a plug doesn’t do it. It has to be an “in out” motion, not just a brick in my rectum. No, my GF wouldn’t peg me if I asked her about it. I brought it up, hypothetically, in terms of “something I found on Reddit.” Her reaction was not promising. I’m not going to say she’s homophobic or anything, but she has very traditional views of what men and women are supposed to be like, and writhing like a demon  while a huge cock slides up into your hole is *not* what the man is supposed to do - so she says, anyway.  
  
And the problem is also that I just don’t want to fuck her anymore. I want to *be* fucked. And even though I’m not attracted to men, I’ve considered breaking up with her (first, obviously, no cheat-o) and hooking up with guys. But even that isn’t something I want to do, because I love her (we’ve been together for almost a year) and I love being with her. Just not “BEING WITH” her.  
  
So, Reddit. What do I do? I want to be a normal boyfriend. But I also can't deny that I am sexually oriented to being fucked, and not fucking. I cum without touching myself. I don't even WANT to touch myself. Doesn't that mean something obvious?  
  
Suddenly occurred to me: if being gay is genetic, could I be physiologically gay but psychologically straight?

Just a heads up, my post is going to be pretty NSFW. You've been warned!

So, my husband got off work and was tired so I didn't talk with him then. I've been waiting for the right time...and the right time happened to be last night!

I cried a bunch (predictably). I said a lot of the same stuff I had been saying in the other thread -- how I had been having fantasies of women and struggled feeling sexually attracted to him. I thought he was going to be super hurt, and he *was*, but not for the reasons I thought.

I thought confessing my lack of satisfaction with our sex life would hurt his pride or ego or whatever, but (just like a lot of you said) what really hurt him was that I hid any of it.

I felt pretty sheepish after that. There was a lot of apologizing and watery laughing after that. I felt this huge burden lift after crying it out. We chatted about other stuff in our lives, but the conversation ended up back on sex again as the night wore on.

I felt nervous and wrong-footed. It's been a long time since I've been so vulnerable and open, all my secrets were kind of out there. 

He said that he 'wanted to try something'. I was SUPER self-concious, pretty much just laid there like a corpse, all stiff limbed and somber.

But he talked me through it. I didn't have any expectations really...after putting everything out there in the open, I felt like the charade had dropped and that I didn't have to fake being as 'in to it' as I had been trying to previously.

So I'm lying there, kind of passively (please remember, super super uncomfortable still, okay?) and he starts talking about my body. He's petting me and rubbing me and it felt nice, in a calming sort of way.

But then *OH MY SWEET FUCKING GOD* did he surprise me! He started out saying innocent enough things, like how much he liked my hair (while he played with it), or he'd stroke my arm and remark about a group of freckles there. That kind of stuff.

But then like all of a sudden he starts saying totally raunchy, straight up full monty, spreadsheet of Penthouse kind of stuff. We're talking explicit stuff, stuff that would make your hair curl. And like....he put an extra focus on all of the feminine parts of me, talking about how hot girls are.

I started picturing it along with what he was saying, started jacking him off (because he had a raging hard on for the longest time at that point and I'm not completely heartless). 

We started talking back and forth. He asked questions about girls that I'd pictured or fantasized about. We compared what we liked. It was straight up, hands down, the HOTTEST thing I've ever done. We didn't end up having sex but --heres the best part-- I ACTUALLY CAME!!!!

Okay. So, it's like the biggest deal ever for me. I don't feel like any sudden attraction to my husband has cropped up, but I feel a lot less hopeless.

Honestly it was all the dirty talk that helped me through it. And hell, it wasn't like it was a chore or anything! I love him and you know what?

Best decision I ever made for my sex life.,1919,593,250,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1ghkr1/been_off_porn_for_4_months_best_decision_i_ever/,"I'm a 31M that has always had a fairly healthy sexual appetite, but never in my life have I relied on porn as much as I have been in the last 3 or 4 years. I have been in plenty of relationships, but when you can have all the beautiful women doing whatever you can imagine, all in high definition and at your fingertips, it's really hard to resist indulging.

I've noticed my libido started tanking in my late 20's. I have been on Propecia for 5 or 6 years, and I attributed it to that (decreased libido is a side effect) as well as just getting older. The thing is, I could get really excited when I watched porn, but it took a lot more to get wound up when I was with a partner.

Long story short, I read some great advice online that suggested cutting out porn. I did this 4 months ago cold turkey, and I can't believe how much of a difference it's made. I have random boners all the time like a teenager, sex is mind blowing again, I have such a ridiculous imagination and appetite now.

The worst thing about porn was it was completely desensitizing me to women and sexuality. Having a naked girl in front of me just wasn't a turn on, because there weren't three other chicks banging her with dildo's or whatever. I sometimes had to fantasize about porn to get off when having sex. How fucked up is that? That isn't healthy! Aint nobody got time for that!

Don't misconstrue this as me saying porn is bad. I don't know how many people this issue might effect. But if you feel your libido has been lacking, you might want to look into your porn habits.

It took about a month to see any positive change. In fact, the first month my libido was almost zero. Then almost overnight, I was thinking about sex constantly, dreaming about it, and I felt like I was just shot full of testosterone!


**tl;dr:** I quit porn and now my libido is ridiculous.


**EDIT** HOLY SHIT. I had no idea this would get such a huge response. So many questions, and I will get to them as soon as I get home from work tonight!

**EDIT2** Since so many people asked, yes I still masturbate and no I don't try to control that urge. I now partake in the activity almost every night, where as previously it would only be a couple times a week and always with the aid of porn. I don't feel this has affected my libido in any way, but on the same token I haven't tried abstaining.

I probably won't feel it at first anyways...

1358291550.0,1303,self.sex,16nc8j,Still doing the alphabet thing ? Here's how you should deal with going down on a girl,2129,826,272,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16nc8j/still_doing_the_alphabet_thing_heres_how_you/,"I originally posted this as a comment, but after reading countless comments on the advice mallard thread, I realize lots of guys really are clueless about how you should deal with this. I spent so much time writing this down I might as well publish it here, if it's bad and I should feel bad well so be it but I think this might really be helpfull to some people, so here it is ,How to make good cunnilingus by Me, oral enthusiast and dedicated pussy liker 

First , you need to master three different simple moves :
1 - The most basic is of course, up and down, right to left. This is what makes the magic happen. Not much to say about this, that's what we all instinctively do.

2 - Circles. This move is very useful for a particular reason : I noticed that going straight to the clit can be kinda painfull at first for the girl, it's too sensitive sometimes and you need to warm it up. so you'll need the circle move, that allows you to stimulate around the clitoris. Imagine that it's like when a girl gently slide her hand up and down your cock before blowing you, it does not feel particulary awesome, but it get's you hard and waiting for the real deal.

3 - Suck. Yes, suck. The sucking adds variety to what is happening to her clit, I guess it drives blood into it, and such things... but this move is important because it allows you to rest your tongue, it gives you this 1 or 2 seconds break you need, plus she'll want you to start licking again, while still feeling stuff.

So you tried those three moves while reading this and it's pretty simple, now what ?
Don't go straight to the mofuckin' clit. Never. Have you ever had an inexperienced girl go ham on your cock like she's Sasha Grey ? That doesn't feel very good, does it ? It's too sudden, too fast, it takes all the fun out of getting a blowjob. Well, for girls, it's even more important to really build things up, because it's not really about how much they are stimulated, it's about how much they are aroused. So what you need to do, is take your time to get where she knows you're going. Caress her legs, her ass, her pussy without opening it up and sticking a finger in it, kiss her tits, her belly etc... while you slowly go down there. At this point, she should be getting hot, she's expecting your tongue in her pussy at any moment but doesn't really know when, and it drives her mad in a good way.

Then you finally stick your tongue in. I'm not going to explain how to find the clit or whatever I'm going to assume you've had a little sex ed in your life and will be able to find your way. Make sure the lips are spread apart, so you've got enough room to operate. Again, you need to warm her up, and the best way to do that is to make sure she experiences a wide range of pleasurable feelings, and a little frustration too. So you gently but firmly explore her pussy with your tongue, the inner lips are not very sensitive, nor is the entry to the vagina, but still make her feel your tongue there and there, mess around. Then, focus more (but not only) on the more interesting parts : circle the clit and go up and down in this kinda flat area beetween the clit and the vag. You can start to lick the clit too, but don't rush things up, be gentle and soft.

So this was the two parts of the warm up. She should start to enjoy herself, moan a little etc... The thing is, you really don't know if she's already warmed up enough, and want you to really get started, or if she wants you to keep this pace for a little more time. Well, my friend, you have to guess this by how she reacts. Let's say she's ready for you to really give her pleasure. Now you can lick the clit up and down, but not too fast ! Lick the whole area between her vag and the top of her clit, so each stroke starts and end on a part not too sensitive but always stimulate her clit. Accelerate your pace, but keep doing other stuff. Try things. Stimulates the upper part of the clit, which is under some kind of ""hood"" with a left and right movement, suck on that clit, stick your tongue in her vag... Keep accelerating your pace slowly as her pleasure builds up, apply more pressure etc... At some point you'll realize it's probably a matter of really short minutes, even maybe seconds before she comes, so then and only then start to really go nuts on the clit, do wide, strong movements and short rapid licks, suck on it strongly when your tongue starts to hurt... when she starts to cum, and you'll notice, just focus on that clit for a final rush, but at the end, when she's at the very climax, just suck on it strongly, and then release it. It's probably getting too sensitive for direct stimulation, so sucking on it is the best option for the grande finale.

Now there is a few things that are absolutely essential that I have to add. First, get to learn every girl you go down on. Some things that work with a girl, might not work with another, see how she reacts to what you do and adapt. TALK TO HER. There's nothing shameful about asking what was good and what was bad, communication is the key to all relationships. Secondly, but it should have been first, be sensual. Listen to the girl's body, try to feel it, take pleasure from what you're doing, make her feel that you're into her, even if going down on a girl is not particularly something you like. In one word : be fuckin passionate about it ! This means use your damn hands. Keep caressing her, more and more firmly as it gets more intense, grab her, push her towards you, look her in the eyes. It should not be just a tongue on her clit, it should be a man (or a girl, I don't care, but I'm sure lesbians don't really need this kind of advice) making love with her with his mouth. She has to feel that, between her legs, there's this awesome guy which is completly into what he is doing. Finally, don't focus only on making her cum focus on what your are doing at the very moment you are doing it so it is the most enjoyable, and don't apply these advices as a recipe. Rely on what you feel, use the force !

How to get bonus points : put some Marvin Gaye on, make sure she's not cold if she's naked, make her comfortable, let her rest a little while cuddling her when it's over even if you're going to bang right after that

TL;DR : Read the whole damned thing for fucks sake, this post is a masterpiece :(

Sources : Nina Hartley, Danny Brown, Plenty books about sex, My ex, Me.


EDIT : This post is going to be a collaborative post I think. I re-read it and there's two things I had to precise :

First : when I'm talking about the final rush, or going nuts on the clit don't take this too seriously. If you follow my advice, you've been pretty gentle from the begining, so going faster and stronger shouldn't mean going really crazy, the line between ""hm, harder, this feels so good"" and ""huh, it hurts"" is easy to cross. 

Secondly : some people here wrote that they had some even better results when the slowed down at the very end. I think it's really interesting, and I'm going to try it ASAP, and you should too.


EDIT 2 : As some girls said, depending on whether or not the girl you're giving oral to likes penetration a lot, fingering her can be a great idea, or not so much. Again, get to know the girl so you know what she really likes. Here is, according to carolinared, how you should proceed : 

&gt;two fingers going slightly in and straight up in a come hither motion while the clit is getting some work done is fucking amazing.

Warning : I've heard that it might cause female ejaculation, which I personally wouldn't mind at all, but it might be a little surprising 

EDIT 3 : Ok, so things are getting pretty serious right now, are you ready to step your game up FOR REAL ?
Here's a secret move I used to do but that I somehow forgot to mention and that a kind redditor reminded me of, upvote him its in the comments ! Here's the protip : when you suck on the clit, well, you can flick it with your tongue at the SAME DAMN TIME. As you can imagine, it works like a charm. Don't be too rough tho.

I must add another warning of top of that, some female redditors have told me that many women find direct stimulation of the clit to be hurtful. If you notice this (you should ask, it might seem like a weird question but it's always better to know before you get started) lick the clit from upwards, where there is a hood that protects it. A few millimeter up, you can feel the ""root"" of the clit, as I call it, which is a great place to be stimulated with a left to right movement according to my experience.

EDIT 4 : Ok, so, first ? Shout out to the guy or girl that gave me reddit gold, seriously pal that's awesome now I'm gonna be branded as a karma whore for the rest of my life on reddit but fuck it ! Feels good ! #1 of the Sex page ? More than 700 upvotes ? Common guys I barely had 700 karma points yesterday !!

Secondly, this text has received so much attention that I feel like I have to be even more clear on some points.
I made this because I realized some guys would probably bore they GF to death if they tried to perform oral on her, so it's kind of a ""how to"" manual wrote by a 19 yo who performed lots of oral on his longtime (ex) girlfriend. I still think this is great advice, but as some people here have pointed, some of the techniques shown here may be completely ineffective or even weird to some girls. I think I have to stress even more that EVERY GIRL is different, and that even if I praised a technique in this post, you should make sure it does work, and stop rightaway if it doesn't. Listen. To. Your. Partners. Body. 

What is the most important in this post, and what you should remember, is not the moves, but how you should work on your timing, your pace, how you should make your partner feel, because what saddens me with a lot of men, is not that they do not have the right moves, but that they simply consider oral as basic ""let's get her wet"" foreplay and don't do it seriously. Do not be that guy that just puts his dick in her, be passionate, be dedicated, be willing to do your best !",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1358333740.0,,,True,t3_16nc8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16nc8j/still_doing_the_alphabet_thing_heres_how_you/,
1364998379.0,1301,self.sex,1bl63c,Enjoyable sex for the first time in years. I just have to vent and brag.,1878,577,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1bl63c/enjoyable_sex_for_the_first_time_in_years_i_just/,"First of all I want to thank everyone here on r/sex, you guys remind me that there is never any shame, and if it wasn't for my lack of shame I would still be in that dark, sexually repressed, sad place I was this time yesterday.

After 7 years of trying to deal with vulvodynia, being shafted from Gyno to Gyno, physio to physio, through a system that often forgets about chronic patients, I went to my local STI clinic for a general screening, only to have the nurse drop everything and find me a vulval specialist who saw me within the hour. I had never had such great care and service in my whole life.

She was really kind and she did everything right when it came to the physical examination. And then she did what none of my previous doctors have ever done for me. She gave me something for the pain. Previously I had always been fobbed off with ""Just take some advil before sex"" as though that was my biggest issue (I had to give up bike riding, I ruined my hip joints because my vulva wouldn't let me sit down on the train, I can't even pee or bathe without the pain, most days I find it hard to walk)

This specialist was shocked that my doctors had ignored my pain, she gave me the most basic of anasthetic gels given to almost all men and women at the first mention of pain. BASIC MEDICATION! It's available over the counter and it's dirt cheap and no one, not ONE of my 20-something doctors ever suggested I try it, Nor has any pharmacist recommended it when I came in to buy 700 billion tablets of Advil for my crotch. I never knew it existed.

She then said she would like to make another appointment with me (Yes! Ongoing treatment, She isn't just sending me away to another doctor), but she is really busy so it wont be for ages. I was prepared to wait 9 months because that's how long some of my other doctors had me wait. She booked me in 11 days from now, and apologized for it being so far away. I'm just so overwhelmed with how brilliant this service was, and also really annoying that this place was right under my nose this whole time and I had just spent 7 years in pain when there were so many people willing to help me that I just hadn't met.


The new pain killers are working well. I had sex with my husband for the first time in 3 years, I even came 3 times. I pretty much cried in joy the whole time, but that's ok because he teared up a little too. and one thing I didn't expect, No afterburn! This is what a healthy person must feel from and after sex, No wonder people do it just for fun. I have never felt such pleasure, such connection and just such relaxation. I'm just so happy that there is finally a light at the end of my tunnel.

To top it all off this treatment, and my ongoing consultations are FREE! my gyno appointments were up to $200 each, but this place is covered by government funding for your first visit, and public health covers any returning visits.

The Clinic Was [Melbourne Sexual Health Center](www.mshc.org.au) in Victoria, Australia. If you are in the area and haven't heard of it, keep it in mind next time you need fast and anonymous advice and answers. I know some of the staff members can be very blunt, But I saw nothing but dedicated service no matter what their individual personality.

**tl;dr:Free sex clinic was surprised at how shit my past doctors were, gave me some basic medication to help ease my genital pain. Pain is almost gone after 7 years of suffering, I had the best sex of my life and I feel like a giant cloud of low-lbido depression has just lifted.

1322840773.0,1290,self.sex,mxlle,5 tips that are more important than penis size from a dirty old bastard. ,2012,722,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/mxlle/5_tips_that_are_more_important_than_penis_size/,"I'm really not surprised at all of the hubbub from the small penis crowd. There's a lot of pressure, and a big society message that bigger is better. Yes, it fucks with your head. Yes, it fucks with your security. Yes, it fucks with your confidence. The good news is, it really doesn't have to. 

I'm a 36 year old mostly straight male who has never been described as an Adonis. I've always been a little on the chubby side, and my penis probably varies between 5-6"" depending on how much fat I'm carrying at any particular point in time. However, I've had the opportunity in my life to have had a great many lovers before settling down into a remarkably fulfilling long term relationship. Being someone who's had a reputation of being an amazing lover, and of being a kinky son of a bitch, I figured maybe I can assuage some of your concern by sharing some of the things I've learned along the way. Yes, this advice won't work for everyone. Yes, this advice won't work ON everyone. However, I assure you, if you take it to heart, you'll find your sexual relationships to be far more fulfilling, and it will probably go a long way to getting you to chill out about your cock size.

(Oh, and this advice is for straight guys. Nothing against you gay dudes, I just don't have enough experience with you to say anything worthwhile.)

1 - **Learn to talk.**

Seduction always begins with conversation. You MUST first engage a woman's mind if you want to engage with her body. Find out who she is, what she's interested in, what her experiences have been. Ask her about sex, what she likes, what her fantasies are. Tell her what yours are. (Pro-tip: If early in the conversation, she mentions how she loves huge horse cocks, this is probably not the right partner for you. Move on). As you move into an erotic comfort zone with her (meaning that there's clear sexual tension between you), tell her what you'd like to do. Be detailed. When, where, how, the setting. Describe how you think it would feel. Describe how much you want it, how it's making your cock throb just thinking about it. Tell her how you couldn't help but masturbate thinking about her. Before you ever turn on her body, you've got to turn on her mind. Mental sex is the BEST foreplay.

2 - **Educate yourself on her anatomy.**

For god's sake, learn where the clitoris is, and what its purpose is. More than that, understand that women are COVERED in erogenous zones...it's not all about the pussy. Your hot breath on her shoulder as you move in from behind to nibble the place where it connects with her neck can have far more turn-on effect than your clumsy fumbling around in her panties. Learn the specific variances of HER anatomy...some women like their nipples bitten and sucked, while to some, anything other than the most delicate of touching on their breasts is painful. Even in a single woman, there can be variances depending on the time of the month. Which leads me to...

3 - **Pay the fuck attention.**

Human sexual response is physiological. It's observable. There are visible keymarkers that will tell you if you're doing it right. PAY ATTENTION. Is her breathing getting deeper, louder, faster paced? Did her body arch toward you when you touched her, or did she pull back? Are her cheeks flushed? Did her nipples perk up? Read her body language, and adjust what you are doing accordingly. Err on the side of softness with each new thing that you do, and build up to more pressure/intensity based on her body's responsiveness to your actions.

4 - **SLOW DOWN**

Yes, sometimes it's going to be a quickie, wham bam thank you maam kind of thing. Sometimes, that's all a woman wants. However, I hear far more often that there is a rush to insertion. This is a HUGE mistake, especially if you're worried about your penis size. You know how blood engorges your penis, making it hard? Blood also engorges the vagina and vulva, *making it smaller and tighter*. This is directly to your benefit. If you've brought her to climax before you ever slide inside her, you're going to find that she's tighter and hotter than if you just go straight for the main course. Take the time to explore her body, finding all of her erogenous zones, and engaging them. Kiss her all over. Touch her, long and slow, tracing the curves of her hips, and letting your fingers dance lightly across the upper pubis before engaging her clit. Cup her vulva, letting the warmth of your hand transfer to her. Lick, nibble, and taste EVERYTHING. When you're going down on her, treat it like her pussy is the most delicious ice cream you've ever had, complete with your own sounds of enjoyment. If you're fully engaging her, you're going to know when it's time, because she will be so ready that her body will be begging you to be inside her. 

5 - **Fuck like you have a big dick, even if you don't.**

When you enter her, slide in slow, and just enough to feel the wetness. Back out, and then back in a little deeper. Repeat that process until you finally feel it slide completely home. Don't get lost in your own sensation, no matter how good...think of your cock as a finger with which you are touching her inside. Don't just jackhammer away, hold her tightly, and deliberately thrust inside her. Bury yourself to the hilt, and hold it there for a second, pressing into her as hard as you can. If you're in a missionary position, adjust your position so that you're ""riding high"", with your pubis pressing into hers. Shift your hips as needed, and add some side to side motion, so that you're touching her in different places inside as you move together. If you're in a position where you can reach, touch her vulva and clitoris while you're moving inside her. In all of these things, remember all the previous tips...talk to her, pay attention to her body's responses, and take your time. 

If you saw me on the street, you'd never think of me as ""The guy who gets all the girls"", and yet I've had an extremely varied and very fulfilling sex life by being a competent, attentive lover, who's never afraid to explore new things and test my (and her) limits. Your lack of confidence will utterly fade away if you're having good sex every time, and your new self confidence will only lead to better sex, and more opportunities.

(Was final in July). No kids. In early August I accepted a new job, and moved into one half of a duplex house in a neighborhood of duplexes closer to my new job.

My side faces the next door duplex which is inhabited by an extremely attractive, busty, in shape, 40yo woman (she has a bf that does not live with her) and her 16 yo teenage daughter which possesses all the womanly characteristics of an extremely attractive 20-something including very adult hips and what only can be described as large, perky breasts. 
Indeed I thought she WAS a college student living with mom until they both told me she had just turned 16 and was going to be a junior in her high school.  

If you know who porn star Lexi Belle is, then you can picture this girl almost exactly, just give her darker hair. For anonymity sake, I'm going to call her Lexi.

Lexi flirts and teases excessively. Shortly after I moved in, I was washing my car and her and her friend came over and started asking me about my past relationship. (Her mom and I had talked briefly about our divorces in front of Lexi after we first met) They were both giggly, and Lexi said something along the lines of ""She was crazy to divorce a man as handsome and as nice as you"" Which kind of flummoxed me, I just said thank you politely and said I had to finish washing up the car because I had an appointment. (Which I didn't have, I went to the store).

Also a couple weeks ago on a Saturday I went to collect my mail. Lexi was lying on her lawn getting a tan in a little bikini. She sees me and comes up to say ""Hi"" and says ""Look my mom let me get a tongue ring"" and proceeds to stick out the tongue to show me. I'm lucky I didn't get a boner right there. I said like ""Nice. did it hurt?"" and she was like ""only a little, like losing your virginity"" and giggled. 
At this point I'm like thinking ""is this for real? it's like a penthouse porno."" I swear this girl was put on Earth by Satan to tempt me. And I'm an atheist!

I was just like ""Well..Say hi to your mom!"" Awkward! Went inside, and leaned against the door to stop my heart from beating so fast. 

The other problem is my bedroom faces Lexi's. She has a tendency to leave her blinds open. I've seen glimpses of naked or semi-undressed before and immediately left my room so I don't feel like a dirty pervert. I've started to keep my blinds closed in there all the time. Thank god my computer room is in the other bedroom, as that's where I spend a lot more time.

Fast forward to this Saturday. Lexi's mom tells me to keep an eye on Lexi if I can, because her and her bf are going to SF for the weekend for some race/marathon. She's like Lexi is allowed to have friends over, but if she throws a loud party don't be afraid to call the cops on her. I'm like, it doesn't bother me, whatever.
Saturday night comes around, no party but Lexi has like 6-7 people over. I hear them in her backyard (We share a fence) and they were being chatting and yelling, but nothing to bad. I'm pretty positive they were drinking (and I wonder if I should tell Lexi's mom) but I was trying not to be nosy.

Fast forward to about 1 in the morning. I've gone to bed and gone to sleep. I sleep with the window open, always, because I'm one of the people who cannot sleep in a closed room. The stuffiness gets to me. I'm a light sleeper, always have been, and I awake to the sounds of porno. Or what sounds like porno. Curious of course, and not thinking, since I was asleep. I go the window and peer through the blinds.

Lexi's window is open. Her blinds are down, but the slats are turned so as they are open. Open enough to see by the blue glow of a lava lamp in her room, lexi and some teen guy are having sex on her bed. Doggie style. And she's being loud. Clearly enjoying it. 

I immediately know I need to close the blinds and go away.

I also immediately have a hard-on. (A guilty hard-on. Who wouldn't in this situation)

I close the blinds. I decide to go to my computer room, shut the door, and play a game for a while. 30 minutes later, I'm exhausted. Head back to bed. It is now quiet. I cannot resist a peek. Her room is still lit up blue from the lava lamp, and it looks like she's asleep on her bed. Guy might be gone, I don't know.

I go to sleep, and don't get a lick of sleep because my hard-on wouldn't go away, and I'm too guilty to masturbate because I know, I KNOW, that she will pop into my head. I cannot get the image of her having sex out of my mind.

I think I have to move. I'm a grown adult. Admittedly I haven't had sex in a long time, and have only recently thought about dating again. This girl is driving me crazy. Should I tell the mom? Should I move? Should I tell her she's acting inappropriately? I feel like it's wrong I'm extremely turned on by this, but she is very womanly, and I think any guy in my position would be equally frustrated. Just to be clear *I would never do anything with this girl*.

TL;DR Hot jailbait daughter flirts with me excessively - now I see her fucking. Can't stop thinking about it. Feel guilty. What do?

I remember a column in Savage Love where a man was talking about his penchant for chubby chasing. He had married someone who was socially acceptable to his friends group, but was cheating on his wife with women who actually turned him on. Dan advised him that A: he was ruining the marriage, hurting his wife, and that he should divorce her, but he also advised something that stuck with me to this day:

Your kinks are your kinks. You can fake sexual attraction, but it will not be fulfilling. If you are trying to deny what it is that turns you on, you can't possibly be honest with your partner. It all starts with you being honest with yourself. 

If you get off on sniffing farts, own it. If you get off on clown costume sex, own it. Whatever your fetish is, whatever your preferences, do yourself a favor and own up to it.

Too many people maintain relationships they think are socially acceptable, and simply try to repress their own desires, or simply act deceptively to meet those desires. There is too much joy and happiness to be had with a partner who accepts and meet your needs to be cheating yourself or your partner this way. 

Own it, and find someone who likes it. It's the only way you will ever be fulfilled.

###Addendum:

A small group of people keeps bringing up the unholy trifecta: children, animals, corpses. Listen, people: everything we talk about in sex positivity is guided by the concepts of SAFE, SANE, and CONSENSUAL. If you have a pathology which leads to criminal sexual desires, my advice isn't for you, and I'm not qualified to answer your questions. You'll need to seek professional help with someone experienced with those pathologies. 

Additionally, ""make peace and own your kinks"" doesn't mean ""my partner has to do anything I want to do or I break up with them"". A partnership is based on two way communication, and what Dan Savage calls ""The Price of Admission"": if your partner doesn't match up with your kinks, and isn't particularly interested in giving any of them a shot, it's still up to you to decide if the rest of the relationship makes up for the things you feel like you're missing. 

Either way, you first need to be honest with yourself about what those kinks are, and that's the foundation of this post.

I'm a sexual health major and activist who is working towards her bachelor's degree in Public Health Education; I also happen to be a call girl. It sustains my extra spending, gotta find some way to make it through college xD I'm often tempted to give my opinion on various questions I see on Sexxit but I find that there are a lot of the same trending questions, so I though I'd just make a Sexxit-answering Reddit account and post my opinion by topic. Hope it's at-all helpful xD

Men and penis size: From my experience, I've found that the way a man feels about his penis will affect his performance far more than the size of his penis will. I personally have received far more orgasms from mouths and hands than I have from a penis alone, and I'm definitely someone who enjoys penetrative sex. Confidence is key, and if you feel that the size of your penis is affecting your performance, that's your first problem right there: blaming the penis. Being able to get someone riled up, in the mood and into YOU is going to get her there a lot faster than a large penis. I've been with my fair share of well-endowed men, and from my experiece it didn't seem to make them especially cocky unless they had actual underlying bedroom skills to back it up, otherwise it was akin to a viking flailing around a large sword. Remember, gear doesn't count for much if you don't know how to make it work for you. Sex is extremely psychological for women; that doesn't mean that we need flowers and froofy romantic gestures to get into the mood, but we DO need to vibe that you're relaxed and into it as well, which is hard to do when you're hung up on the size of your manhood. The kind of confidence that makes me shiver with anticipation and have a really wicked connection with someone does not come from having a large penis, but from knowing you are about to rock someone's world with a whole combination of body parts.

If you found this at all helpful, please comment ^^ I think I'm going to do High/Low libido dating pairs next

**EDIT**
I'm also adding my answer to one commentor's question: Large penises are a trophy society has created; like karma, it has no real world value but we want it, because we're supposed to want it. The issue is not physical, it only exists in the mind. Even if a guy doesn't care about boob size, he's gonna feel pretty baller with Ms. DD's on his arm if he feels that large boobs are something that is considered desirable at large. I am someone that finds bed skills valuable, not penis size or looks. So I don't brag about how hot I am, but I will gloat like a warlord over my technique in the sack, because I find that skill worth bragging about.

**FINAL EDIT**
I am shuttin' down this comment spree on my end, folks. I'm definitely doing high/low libido pairs next, probably in a few days. As a closing note to all guys who disagree with my opinion: I can't change your mind. From what I've seen, every girl on here agrees with me wholeheartedly and if that's not enough to change your mind, then I certainly can't. You're going to get girls who say a big penis is what matters, and girls will get guys who say that a huge rack matters, and my gift to you is this: 
Don't sleep with them.

I wanted to share two of the most life changing events I think I'll ever have happen. Long story short, I was raped at age 15 by my then boyfriend. Sex has been more unappealing than tomatoes and ice cream. I've been dating a guy, we'll call him T, for about 5 months now. We're both 18. He's been wanting to have sex for a little while and I told him all about the rape. He has been very supportive of whatever decision I make, thought we both thought that having sex for good reasons would be a great thing for me. After a couple of failures, and a sweetly frustrated T, we finally did last night! We spread out a big towel on the beach at night. After lots of intense foreplay, we went for it! It only lasted about 8 minutes, but I am so so happy that I did. Sex is good. To any other rape victims out there, I encourage you to try sex out at some point in your life. I love T very much and that made a world of a difference. 

EDIT: I've gotten asked how the sex actually felt.
First, I was nervous and a little tense, but excited. Once we got going, it hurt in the same way first time sex usually hurts. Really, it was just satisfying. I was able to understand that sex is good and that I can appreciate it, along with everyone else, no matter what my past holds. I truly encourage all rape victims, at some point in their life, to truly try to appreciate sex. I know they're are a ridiculous amount of different stories, but I've experienced such a growth.

 Soo many people don't know,but you can get them for FREE at a local county health department. Most of the time you don't need to make any sort of appointment ( varies by state and county) most of the time all you need to do is WALK IN and ASK the receptionist.

 I have gotten free condoms, lube ( sample sizes) female condoms, and dental dams for FREE in several different states I have lived in. Not a single one I have visited personally needed an appointment for condoms. They most often hand you a paper bag that is full, anywhere from 15 to 50. No questions asked, no names asked, no payment asked for and no forms to fill out, and no waiting ( sometimes they need to walk down the hall and get them from a store room)

Std testing, you will probably need an appointment. Sometimes you won't, it depends on how busy there are but it is best to call ahead. I have gotted tested for free, and been charged as much as 15 dollars. This is most often a sliding scale based off your income. If you have no income it is FREE.  ( note here, when I was broke I got tested at the county health department, when I was working I went to my regular gyno that my insurance paid for)

They also offer birth control services. Some will hand you pill packs just like planned parenthood, some will write a prescription. This is also based on what state you live in, but is worth checking out to see if you can get them for free or cheaper than you can from a regular doctors office. Plan B is also given out at most county health departments. They also do pregnancy testing.



Depending on state laws, teenagers can get services without informing parents, and for free.

This is a link to ONE county health department in the US. I picked this one as being the first one on google search that shows a range of services that I have found typical in the many states I have lived in. http://www.dadehealth.org/women/WOMENfamily.asp



Please, if you see a post where someone complains about the cost of services, lack of planned parenthood sites nearby, cost of condoms, tell them about this all important resource. Nearly every populated county in the US has a County Health Department. 

Edit 1 : yes Planned Parenthood offers all this too. But they are not in as many places and might be harder to get to for a lot of people. I know the closest one to me is about a two hour drive. Find your nearest Planned parenthood http://m.plannedparenthood.org/mt/www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/?un_jtt_redirect

Still looking for a ' nearest county health department link' ( I'm on mobile so its a bit slow)

Edit 2 : A user is having a hard time getting latex free condoms. Does anyone know a resource for them? I don't know if County health has them at all or if planned parenthood has them. ( I feel like they should but never needed to ask for them)

Can we help this user out? 

Edit; planned parenthood has latex free. A call to my local county health department confirms they have them too.





Last edit for now. I am still looking for free non latex condom resources.  I am sure there is something out there and will keep looking.  If a mod wants to add this post to the sidebar, as a few suggested, feel free. My whole purpose in posting was to educate on resources that don't seem popular knowlege. 

I had a lot of fun today, my phone died 3 times, a lot of very useful info got posted and it still didn't turn into a circlejerk ( wtf reddit? Lol) 

I might do this again if I can find better links, going to have to wait until I get to a desktop for it though.

Thanks again for everyone's thoughts on this one.  I ended up telling my gf the other night about masturbating next to her and how hot it was.  She truly was asleep and didn't seem to really care that I had done it.  She was however not very open to me masturbating next to her while she was awake.

Fast forward a couple days, she tells me that she thought about it some more and that we could try it.  So that night I did and it was probably the best masturbation I've ever experienced.  It wasn't as good as sex.  I would say that it's better than any handjob and gave most blow jobs a run for their money.  Something about the emotional closeness of my gf with something usually so private.  She said that it wasn't as weird as she thought and that she'd be fine with me doing it in the future when sexytimes weren't an option.  

From there, things got interesting.  That night, I woke up to deep breathing and the bed shaking.  This time it wasn't me doing the masturbating.  I offered to help, but she said she wanted to finish on her own and that I should just hold her close.  And while nothing else went down that night, our normal sex has been fantastic since.  So far it has been a good thing.    ",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1gahqp,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1gahqp/update_masturbation_next_to_sleeping_so/,

Being the male however, I usually have the higher sex drive. One night while I attempt to initiate sexy times, she looks at me and says ""Man, you're like a sexaholic!"". That may be slightly true, but I was a little put off, so I proposed we turn it into a game. 

The deal was, first one to beg for P in V sex owes the other $20. She laughed, thinking that there was no way I would last more than a day and she was happy to shake on it, smartly saying ""Thanks for the $20"".

Not an hour later she was all over me trying to get me riled up enough to beg. It was *hard* to resist but I didn't give in. The next two days consisted of her wearing her sexist underwear, lots of heavy kissing and touching and teasing, and lots of her super sexy attempts at making me give in. The trick was, the more she tried to make me give in, and the more I resisted, the hornier SHE became, and by the third day she was desperate. On that night, she gets in bed, straddles me, pulls off her shirt and mine, kisses me hard, and pulls $20 out of her pocket and throws it in my face, right before removing the rest of our clothes and fucking me like crazy. It was just awesome to see the tables turn like that.

Try it sometimes, especially if you (the guy) feel like you always initiate sexy times. For bonus points, use the sex champion victory money to take her out to the movies.

tl;dr: Made a deal with my GF after she called me a ""sexaholic"" that the first one to beg for sex owed the other $20. 3 days later, she turns into a ""sexaholic"" and gives me $20

As soon as I know that she got to that part I will ~~take off her pants and start going down on her~~ slowly run my hands up her inner thighs, while I hope she will continue reading my paper; which is pretty graphic and uses words I would never dare to say.

I just don't know if this is something that would scare her or would make her think that I am disgusting. Like I said I am not outgoing, never talked dirty, or anything like that.

PS: If you have any tips or suggestions please let me know. I am new to this.

**EDIT:** Thank you for the responses. I just got done reading through them and the feedback seems to be positive. I will still have to think more on how I go about it, and I will include in my transition how good looking and sweet, etc. she is, but sometimes I can't help it but...

I will give you an update of how it/I went down and and you will be able to download the paper in a few months on EBSCOhost via interlibrary loan.

A few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try out threesomes (both MFF and MFM) for the first time. Somehow, we got hooked on MFM sex. We both loved it so much, that it ended up becoming a regular thing for us. In fact, it may have become too regular as ~75% of our sexual encounters involved one of his friends. What started as something new and exciting and fun had become somewhat expected and anytime we would get in the mood either he or I would habitually ask the other which one of his two buddies we should call. It was obvious that we had completely become disconnected sexually and was worried that it would soon lead to us disconnecting emotionally.

While I didn't mention any of this to him (for various reasons), last weekend I decided that I would make an effort to reconnect with him one-on-one. It was Friday night and we started to get things going. Sure enough, he asked me who I wanted to call and I told him that I just wanted to be with him that night. I did the same throughout the weekend and by Tuesday, neither of us even brought up the topic of adding someone to our private time. In fact, by the end of the week, we weren't even trying to do anything ""freaky"". No crazy positions, no dirty talking, no toys, no cumming on my body. It was just intimate, one-on-one, missionary, emotionally connected love making in a way that we hadn't since we first started having sex. 

Don't get me wrong, we both still love all of the other stuff. There's always going to be those times when we just want to ravish each other and be ""dirty"" in so many ways. And we both enjoy threesomes way too much to say that we're going to stop having them. In fact, last night we brought up the idea of bringing in both of his buddies and try our first foursome. What I'm saying is that in our case, we had lost that intimate connection that makes sex great between partners and it's important not to lose sight of that. The best sex I've ever had has happened over the span of this last week. Nothing ""crazy"" was required.

Well its day 2 of her visit and after a saturday night out at the club and a promise of a swallow, we head home (2am) and she starts off with a nice blowjob leading to some deepthroat. After a bit of that we start goin at missionary style and switch it up to doggy, and she is getting really really wet.  So i lay her back down on the bed and start goin really hard and deep into her and she starts moaning louder and that just makes me go harder and faster.  Mind you i slipped out like twice already.  

So as im going in her with a force of a hundred men i slip out one last time and BAM something felt like it snapped in my penis and i stopped in my tracks ( I basically slammed my penis into her bone around her vagina) shot straight up looked down and freaking blood all over my gf vagina and upper thigh and i thought maybe it was her or something.  Nope i SAW blood gushing out of my penis in spurts like wtf holy shit.  What erection i did have now in its place was a flaccid penis and a huge ass swollen bulge beside my penis!  That bulge was bigger then my penis. So i hold it and the blood stops and i run to the washroom and point it in the toilet and blood is just gushing out all over the place in spurts.  (throughout this whole ordeal i didn't feel any pain so maybe i was in a bit of a shock or adrenaline rush) tell my gf to grab the keys were heading to emergency and i basically just wrapped my penis in so much toilet paper so it wouldnt seep through the pants. 

so head to the hospital at 3 am and basically jump the line and the staff ask me if its an emergency and i was like umm we were having sex and now bloods coming out of my penis.  the guys the staff were serving were like damnn what did you do to him to my gf lol.  i thought that was funny. so they take me in and give me somehting for the pain and we wait till 1030am for the urologist. 
he checks me out and gives me a ct scan and an xray with a dye test.
at 1 pm we do the surgery and it came out that i rupture the erection vessel that holds the blood for the erection he called it a canon.  and i had a ripped in my urethra.  

now here i am with a catheter in my penis and basically dont control my pee. it goes directly to a portable bag attached to my leg.

blunt trauma to my penis resulting in a rupture in 2 different vessels

TL;DR broke my penis while having sex.  Ruptured the erection vessel and urethra, almost got a circumcision got stitches for the tear. Now have a catheter in my penis.   And in the end i didnt get my swallow :( 

**Edit:** I should heal up in about 2 months and doctor said it should be normal for the most part.  As for the Catheter it comes out in a week.

I bought these bastards last night and used them last night with some slight discomfort. I removed the condom to find that my penis was all red and irritated. I was concerned, so I searched around to find that, yep, there were a fair amount of users who'd reported pain and irritation after using these condoms. 
  
The most frequent symptom they reported was excruciatingly painful urination. 
  
So I drank some water and stayed up for a bit to wait to go to the bathroom and see how bad it would be. I did, and while it stung a little bit, it was no where near what I would describe as excruciating.   
  
That was until this morning. I got up to go to the bathroom and almost fell to the floor in pain. It was like trying to piss hot needles. I could only pass a few drops before the total agony shuddered my bladder closed, and any lingering urine in my urethra continued to sting.   
  
The box does disclose that some users might be sensitive to the  spermicide, nonoxynol-9... on the back, and inside of the packaging. ""sensitive"" is not quite the word I'd use. While it's true, I can certainly sense this pain, it's not like a faint, general irritation. It's like getting stabbed in the dick. The CDC doesn't even recommend this shit. Why would they cover a condom with it?   
   
FOR FUCKS SAKE, DO NOT BUY THESE CONDOMS.   

Now my bladder is full and I can't fight it any longer. I am off to try and piss without crying. Wish me luck.  

EDIT: not a latex allergy. I've used hundreds of latex condoms with no ill-effects.   
  
GOOD NEWS EDIT: My pain has decreased substantially since this morning. I've just been drinking a ton of water and every trip to the bathroom gets a little easier. Hopefully I'll be right as rain by sometime tomorrow. 
  
EDIT 3:  I wanted to take this opportunity before this left the front page to clear some things up.   
  
First of all, my case is rare. The majority of people can use condoms with one variety of spermicide or another and be fine. If you're been using it and it works, that's fantastic. I made this post to caution people, and hopefully prevent the repetition of my reaction in others. Consider trying non-genital testing before using a new product. 
 
Secondly, Trojan ultra-thin is just the brand that happened to have the nonoxynol-9 on them. I'd used regular ultra-thins without any side effects before, which is why I bought them in the first place. That said, READ THE BOX and make sure that you know exactly what you're buying. It sounds pretty obvious, but when you're in a hurry...  just read the box.  
     
I'd like to thank everyone for sharing their experiences and support with me. Some of you guys even made me laugh... quite the feat. It really helped me feel better. This is an amazing community, and one I'll be keeping my eye on.... you know... so I don't end up doing something like fill my junk with what turns out to be stinging foam.

I absolutely love giving advice and this seems to be a common question in this subreddit so I'd like to share with you: How I give mindblowing head,1775,618,286,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/14k0s5/hey_sexxit_i_absolutely_love_giving_advice_and/,"Hello my beloved Sexxit! I hope there's at least one new thing you've never done in here so you can have a wonderful and sexy Sunday! Just browse the bolded titles for whatever strikes your fancy.

-------------------------------------

**The Basics**  

* Switch up the sensations every 60 seconds, or however often he seems to like a switch up. Do sweeping licks up and down the entire shaft. Use the flat of your tongue on some strokes, and the tip of your tongue on others.  
* Run circles around the corona, or rim of the head of the penis.  
* Lick your lips, firm the muscles so they're rigid, then bob your head so the lips run over that corona, slide past it a little bit, then come up and completely off his penis. Better if you can make a little *pop* sound as you come up.  
* Take him in as deep as you can. Move your tongue: stick it out your mouth so it runs the length of him. Wag it back and forth. Draw squiggles up and down. Make swallowing movements, but if that makes you gag don't (although he might reeeeeally like the feeling of you gagging on his dick, since it feels like a vagina mid-orgasm. In which case do gag on it if you're okay with that)  
* Swirl his head: think of the tip of his penis as a clock face. Lay the bottom side of your tongue at ""12 oclock"" swing down to ""6 oclock"", swirling your tongue so that the side of your tongue hits ""3 oclock"", and the top part of your tongue ends up at 6 oclock. Complete the circle so you're back to having the underside of your tongue resting on him in ""12 oclock"". Note that your tongue never stops contact with him (hope that gives an accurate description of swirling).

Important: your blowjob main position should be such that your lips are guarding around your teeth to avoid your teeth grazing his penis. Most guys don't like teeth. That being said, some guys *do*, so if he says ""Hey, I liked it when your teeth tickled my dick a little"" then forget this point and go back to what he likes.

-------------------------------------

**Get wet**  
This one's simple. Just use lots of saliva. Stop wiping it away with the bed sheets. Stop swallowing all your excess drool. I'm not saying spit on it like in porn (although he might like that), just let it run out your mouth, let it run down his shaft and down his thigh (extra stimulation -- tickles!).

-------------------------------------

**Ballsack: Basic**  
Lick it. Swirl an infinity sign around each ball (to this day, no joke, this is the one and only single decent tip I got from years and years of reading Cosmo mag). Run your tongue along his perineum (piece of skin between ballsack and butthole), alternating between lick types. So if you use the tip of your tongue on a downstroke, use the flat of your tongue on an upstroke. Use your thumb and pointer finger to massage both balls as you give head.

**Ballsack: Intermediate**
Proceed with caution: Wet those lips, plant them around one of his balls, and using a slight vacuum suck, very gently draw it into your mouth. 

**Ballsack: Advanced -- (Analingus, rimming)**  
You're gonna want to check if he's okay with this one, cause not everyone is into this! Okay, this is why he showered beforehand. When you've moved from his ballsack to his perineum, transition to his butt next. You can take this as far as both of you are willing, but since this is mainly a blowjob guide I'm going to keep it basic. Use the point of your tongue to draw circles around his butthole, flick it, do wide and long licks.

-------------------------------------

**Hair**  
If you aren't sure whether he will be into ass play at all, but you're curious... or maybe this will be the only ass play he will be into. Have him lie down, and you sit on his face and lean over to blow him, so you're 69ing. Take a strand of hair and tickle his perineum or butthole. It's extra stimulation, kinda like how if he plays with your nipples alone it might not do much, but if he touches them during sex it's amazing!

-------------------------------------

**Icy Air**  
When you've got his head nicely wetted up, form a light seal around it with your lips and inhale through your mouth. Sounds bizarre, but lick your hand and do it. Whoa, right?

-------------------------------------

**Deepthroating: Basic**  
This is kinda big-league stuff, but super fun if you can get the hang of it. Yes, you might feel bruised after the first few times, but you can reach a point where that won't happen anymore. The two easiest positions to do it (read: least likely to trigger the gag reflex) for me are 1. him lying on his back, me sitting on his face and bending over to his penis (since his bends up. If your man bends down, position yourself between his legs as he lies down. Or beside his hip if he bends to the side. Basically just imagine your mouth and throat and the shape they make, and arrange yourself so his penis is going to follow that curve) and 2. Me lying on my back, head on the edge of the bed, and him standing up. Note that number one allows for you to have more control, while number two you are in a more passive role, so if you are a beginner here number one is better to start.

Now, before you even try this, first establish an emergency pull-out signal. A smack, or a scratch, or a double tap, whatever. Obviously a hand signal is a better choice than a vocal cue! Play around and find which way feels most comfortable for it to slide in. For me, it's easier if his tip runs along the roof of my mouth, to the back of my throat, then around the bend. You can either get him deep and keep him deep, which feels amazing by itself. Or you can try to swallow, which will grip his penis and massage his tip with your epiglottis (which has been describes as ""that's just... whoa... 10/10""). Move your tongue around, though you'll have limited movement. If you're feeling brave start pumping, taking him in and out, putting him back in your throat with each reentry. This even triggers my gag reflex though!

**Deepthroating: Super advanced (Face fucking)**  
You should NOT do this until you feel you have begun to master the basics of deepthroating, because your muscles will NOT have gotten used to the action and you WILL bruise your throat. I think it's safe to say it's like a bad case of mono. That being said, I can take my SO with no discomfort the next day, so there is a certain mastery to this. Just get into position 2 described above and... let him go. You might want to indicate how hard and fast he can go by stroking his leg (start slow and gentle, pick it up as you feel comfortable).

-------------------------------------

**Have fun!**  
LAAAAAAAAME. But I'm not joking. That's how I discovered the Hair and Icy Air tricks. I was just playing around with his penis while sucking him off and had a stroke of genius. If you keep it fun, then your partner can fully enjoy it guilt-free, because it's not like he's putting you through a chore. Plus it plays into my next tip.

-------------------------------------

**Attitude**  
Yeah yeah yeah, we've all heard the best thing you can do is be enthusiastic. But what exactly does that mean?

*My man gets home from work. I instruct him to hit the shower then meet me in the bedroom, and don't bother getting dressed. I walk into the bedroom, admiring his body. And then I see his cock. My eyes light up. I think to myself, ""Yeah, I'm gunna sit on that"". I approach the bed with a little smile and settle into my position between his legs. My eyes haven't left his package since I laid eyes on it, and now I'm thinking of all the terrible, terrible things I'm going to do to it, and I can't help but smile in anticipation. As I'm licking him, I'm also kissing it and making little sounds of pleasure. Like a porn star, I suck his dick like a champ, really getting into it. Saliva is dribbling out, but I don't even notice, I don't even care. I look up at him to see how he's liking it; he's watching everything with an indescribable look on his face.*

Ok, so ~~some of that~~ all of that sounded like a bad erotic lit novel, and I apologise. But if you can get past that, notice how each thing I did there showed I was looking forward to and enjoying the blowjob. The instruction that he take a shower was a legitimate tip; it's a lot easier to be enthusiastic over a freshly showered penis than a I-just-worked-my-ass-off-all-day penis, amirite ladies? You can do as I do and just get down to business (Hey, I'm a straight to the point kinda gal, plus the guys I've been with digged how it seems like I can't wait to wrap my lips around them) or you can tease him for as long as you like. The ""little sounds of pleasure""... well, I don't know what else to call them, but they're the same sounds YOU make when he's eating you out. I normally DO NOT like to blend porn sex and real life sex since they're totally different, but it's okay to steal some of their tricks. Looking up at his face is a great move, because lots of guys like how you look like that, but also because his facial expression will give you positive feedback to keep your enthusiasm up. 

Whether you love to give blow jobs or not, act like you love it. Worship your man's penis and give it the love and care it deserves (thanks lecolorchristine for the great phrasing)

And that's about all I can think of for now. Happy sexing!

1304118234.0,1153,self.sex,h0hr9,I just watched my partner orgasm non-stop for 3.5 hours. It started in my apartment and ended in the emergency room. I swear I am not making this up.,2145,992,489,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/h0hr9/i_just_watched_my_partner_orgasm_nonstop_for_35/,"The point of this post is not to take any special credit for causing the epic orgasm, or for being any kind of porn star.  I do not know the ancient five-point exploding vulva technique, nor do I suspect myself of having discovered any such thing.  I’m just posting this to share the whole weird, stressful, and utterly bizarre experience as best I'm able.

It all began innocently enough, just an average morning for the two of us… To answer the obvious question, no, we didn’t do anything especially freaky or unusual. We’re a little kinkier than your average, um, bears, but we weren’t getting up to anything we haven’t already done a zillion times without any remarkable consequences.

So, she seemed to be having this great orgasm… a few minutes into it, I gave myself a congratulatory smirk for managing to get hard again before she had even finished coming from the previous go.  We got back at it.  In the midst of it, my alarm went off.  That was when I first made a note of the time: 8:15 am.  She’d been coming for nearly ten minutes.

 “Best orgasm of my life,” she said at the end of round two.  We had a laugh and waited for it to subside… it didn’t.  I thought of the cute girl who lives next door, and hoped she could hear it.  I’m not above basking in a little unearned notoriety. 

Anyway, when it finally occurs to you that your partner will, apparently, continue to moan and writhe in ecstasy no matter what you do to her, you take advantage.  The exact, lurid details of round three are left to the imagination of the reader.

As the 60 minute mark approached, we started to get concerned.  She didn’t want to be late for work.  Plus, we wanted to move her car before the meter maids came around...  She decided it was time to call her doctor.

Yes, the conversation was hilarious to listen to.  The doc asked if she was certain she wasn’t having a seizure.  No, she assured him, moan, she was fully, moan, mobile.  No, she hadn’t taken any drugs.  (moan)  He tentatively suggested the emergency room.  She doesn’t have health insurance, so she opted to ride it out a bit longer.

She texted a friend of hers who is interning at Columbia.  The friend asked something about vaginal contractions, and suggested taking some Benadryl.

So I got dressed and went to the pharmacy.  When I got back, I could hear her moaning the second I stepped out of the elevator.   I took that to indicate that she wasn’t faking it for my benefit.  By that time, she’d been moaning non-stop for about two hours, and I worried that the neighbors would consider us rude for the flagrant sexual marathon they no doubt imagined was occurring.  In reality, there had been only twenty or thirty minutes of actual boning.

So she took the Benadryl and we kicked off round four while we waited for it to take hold.  Half an hour later, she called the doctor again.

“Get to the emergency room. Now.”

Okay, it is now officially scary.

She couldn’t get dressed, so I threw her clothes in a bag and put my bathrobe on her.  I dreaded the possibility that the elevator would be occupied.  I especially worried about running into a real estate agent showing one of the building’s unsold units.

As we drove to the hospital, my imagination started to run away with me: was she having some kind of bizarre stroke?  It was a fast drive.  Hazard lights on, passing traffic at every opportunity.  Now I know how it feels to rush a woman to the hospital.

“My legs are going numb,” she said at one point.  She slumped against the window, and saw herself in the rear-view mirror mid-moan.  “I look like a mental patient,” she said.  (I thought, “Well, technically…” But I kept my mouth shut.)

At the hospital, I parked in the spot designated for expectant mothers, and then helped a moaning, disheveled woman in a bathrobe into the waiting area.  They rushed her through the double doors, while I stayed behind at the registration desk.

The waiting room was crowded with people who mistook us for about-to-be parents.  An elderly couple beamed at me.  Somebody else told me I’d remember today for the rest of my life.  “You got that right,” was all I managed in response.

Meanwhile, they asked her to look at one of those pain charts that describes degrees of pain on a scale of zero to ten.  Where did she feel like she was on that scale, they asked.  “A good, solid zero,” she said.

I also learned later that while I was in the waiting area, the doctors quizzed her at some length as to whether I might have drugged her somehow.   (Here, I feel a pang of regret: if I knew of a drug that had that effect, I’d be richer than Google.)

Not much later, as the doctors were literally reaching for the valium, it appeared that the Benadryl had finally kicked in.  Orgasm over.  It was about 11:40 am.

The doctors were at a loss, but they speculated that it may have been a side effect of her sleeping meds.  (With some reservations, I’ll pre-emptively answer the inevitable question: ~~Triazolam~~ Trazadone.  It’s a shaky hypothesis, as she didn’t take any last night, although she did go to sleep extremely drunk.)

We left the hospital just before noon, with her now dressed in the clothes I’d brought along, and no baby or baby belly anywhere to be seen.  A couple of the folks in the waiting room gave us confused looks.

“Are you okay,” I asked.

“What, me?  I’m freaking *great*.”

Finally: shared with her permission is a scan of the [discharge instructions](http://i.imgur.com/RWgzQ.png) from the hospital.  The typo is theirs.  And yes, I’m having it framed.

As with all sex advice, I'll just quote from the original post:

""Yes, this advice won't work for everyone. Yes, this advice won't work ON everyone. However, I assure you, if you take it to heart, you'll find your sexual relationships to be far more fulfilling, and it will probably go a long way to getting you to chill out about your ~~cock size~~ breast or dress size.""

**1. Own your sexuality.**

I see so many posts on here asking what you can do for him, what he'll like, how to be compliant, but I don't see anywhere near enough about *knowing yourself*. The very best sexual relationships involve both partners being equally fulfilled, but if you're unsure or uncommunicative about your wants and desires, we're going to be absolutely clueless (which is not going to get you off). Be introspective about your sexual identity, and engage with us in honest communication about what you want, need, like, and dislike. It can be a tongue tying experience if you're not used to open conversation about sex, but understand that we both want to know, and think it's really hot. 

**2. We need seduction too...it's just easier on us than on you.**

While many men seem to forget the importance of foreplay, many women seem to think that once they've shown up with the appropriate physiology, all work is done. If he really was attracted to you, it would be instant boner, sparks and fireworks, right? Hell no. I love my woman, and lust for her near constantly, but a hard day, parental duties, financial stresses, and all of the other things that affect you affect us as well. There are plenty of times that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. A surprisingly small amount of sexual aggression from you can turn the couch locked evening in front of the TV into an unexpected second wind of energy for some bomp-chicka-wow-wow. Which brings me to...

**3. You are ~~allowed to~~ ENCOURAGED TO ask for sex too.**

Hopefully we've come far enough by 2012 that women don't as a rule think they're expected to play coy and resistant. Yet a lot of women still seem to think that the guy should be initiating all sexual contact. We've seen some excellent threads here lately asking about how to initiate sex. Nothing works better than asking for it. Men tend to experience sexual appetites similar to physical appetites; when I'm in need, I'm *hungry* for it. Porn stars exhibit a masculine hyper sexuality by being ""cock hungry"", and that sense of shared hunger is what's so appealing about it. If I'm sitting at my desk stressing about some crisis or another, and my lover rests her breast on my back and whispers in my ear that she needs me inside her, we're going to be in the bedroom in about four and half seconds. 

**4. We jerk off. We suspect you do too. Can we just be OK with this?**

Nothing will kill a sexual relationship like one partner being shamed for sexual behavior. I've seen the subject of masturbation come up on here over and over again, with some women feeling legitimately hurt that their partner was masturbating (with and without the use of porn). At the end of the day, we're just as insecure about our sexuality as you are, so being hurt about our masturbating makes us feel ashamed for engaging in a personal behavior that's been with us for as long as we were capable of doing so. Worst case scenario, just accept that it's going to happen. Best case scenario, let's play together! There are tons of fun scenarios for separate and mutual masturbation in a relationship, and these are also good opportunities for us to learn what you like. 

**5. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is as sexy as your confidence.**

OK, so you've gone and bought a hot ass teddy and some high heels, and now you're tottering through the living room feeling like a silly girl playing dress up, wondering what the hell you were thinking, and how ridiculous you feel. You know what we're thinking?

""OH MY GOD, I AM GOING TO FUCK HER SO HARD.""

We want to feel like powerful, sexy, conquering beasts, and your sexual confidence is what takes us there. When you look us in the eye during sex, when you vocalize your desires, when you strut your stuff and shake your ass, when flash us in the middle of the afternoon with a twinkle in your eye, when you buy those special panties and tell us about them, all of those times when you're ""trying to be sexy"", you *are* being sexy. When you push the boundaries of sexual experience, tell us your fantasies, dress to get fucked, you're weaving a powerful combination of inspiring lust and giving trust that hits us on both the physical and emotional channels, and builds a powerful connection that keeps both our libidos and hearts focused on you.

**Just because it's referred to as sucking doesn't mean you have to actually suck.**
At least not all the time. It brings teeth into contact (which a lot of guys dislike) and limits the use of your tongue. I rarely actually suck, and when I do, it's not prolonged.

On the teeth/suction thing, it can actually cause pain - a friend of mine told me flat out he hated blowjobs and when he explained it turned out this was what caused it.

**Use your tongue.**
Now, as a general rule, I make sure I'm in a position where my tongue is comfortably on the scrotal side of a penis. Because, quite frankly, that's generally where all the most sensitive areas are. Try to tickle and massage with your tongue. I usually concentrate on the webbing at the base of the head.

**Don't feel like you have to maintain eye contact *all* the time.**
Yes, eye contact is something a guy usually likes in a blowjob. But if he can tell you're absorbed in the wonder of making his cock feel amazing, he's going to be turned on by that too.

**Listen, and ask for feedback.**
Listen when you're giving head. Be aware of grunts and moans that tell you what you're doing right. And during pillow-talk, ask for feedback. Ask what worked, what didn't. Bring that knowledge with you when you give head next time. Build on it, ask for more feedback; etc. Treat it as a skill you're honing, because it is.

**Love his member.**
I am *this close* to creating a god damn shrine for my boyfriend's cock. He knows it. So when I'm down there doing my thing, I'm kissing, licking, smiling and giggling. And this matters. When you give head it should be a positive experience for the both of you. 

When you're down there, fall in love with it and what it can do. Don't feel like the only point of being there is to get him off, or get him hard enough to fuck you. Romance the hell out of it, kiss it, caress it, and tease it. I can't exactly teach you this, but this is what a guy means when he asks for 'enthusiasm'.

1368546933.0,1121,self.sex,1ebjbr,Just struck a big item off my sexual bucket list... feeling pretty great and wanted to share some thoughts,1875,754,285,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1ebjbr/just_struck_a_big_item_off_my_sexual_bucket_list/,"So recently I [F] pegged a guy for the first time. I recognize pegging's not for everyone, but I just want to put this out there: if the mere thought doesn't make you sick to your stomach, you should give it a try!

The best reason to try pegging, of course, is that one or both partners are turned on by it. However, even if that's not quite the case, the penetration reversal can be a real eye-opener (as well as ass-opener, obviously) for both parties in your standard heterosexual relationship. I feel like it's a great way to fuck a mile in your partner's shoes. Here's a little of what you might take away:

**For guys:**

* Face fucking can be a little overwhelming. Some people have more sensitive gag reflexes than others, but it's very easy to end up gagging, almost puking, tearing up, and doing all kinds of involuntary things if your partner's a bit too aggressive with the oral penetration. This may give you a little perspective when these roles are switched.

* Things in your ass can feel pretty damn awesome. And if it worries you, it doesn't make you gay to like having a dildo in your ass. It really doesn't. Though I'll point out that being gay is not a bad thing, as Captain Obvious will agree. 

* Things in your ass can also feel bad. I feel like everyone knows this on some level, but it bears repeating. Anal sex can be a bit of a camel through the eye of a needle-type ordeal. You're going to have to communicate really well about how you feel and what you're willing to try, especially the first time. 

**For girls:**

* Holy crap, even for those of us who like to take control and ride our men into sweet, moaning bliss, fucking with a dick is so different from fucking with a vagina. It's *a lot* more work. You'll come to appreciate the stamina that goes into swordplay a lot more once you've acted as the penetrating party. 

* Positioning yourself in doggy style is hilariously difficult at times. Differences in height can really affect your success. Your best bet is to grab the hips and plunge away, but you may need a few attempts.

* Being gentle isn't quite intuitive. It's so tempting to start thrusting maniacally, but remember: **you're shoving a fatass shaft into your partner's ass**. You gotta take it slow. Most importantly, once you've passed the first hurdle of even getting tip in, it's a good idea to just let it sit there for a little while your partner adjusts, then slowly work up to actually fucking. 

* Lube lube lube lube lube lube lube lube

* If he's into it, pegging is going to be a power high unmatched by a lot of other sexual activities. I'm kind of a dom though, so YMMV.

**Other things to think about:**

* Using a stiffer dildo will make it easier to penetrate, but the reduced flexibility in the shaft could make it less comfortable for your partner. 

* Dat reacharound. If the guy's on his back though, he can easily fondle himself, which is also fun.

* If you're flexible, ladies, you may be able to go down on your guy WHILE you fuck him. Just food for thought (and/or ""food"" for mouth? I mean semen isn't really food, but ya know...).

I may come back and update this later, but I just thought I'd share some of these observations and wish you all happy and frequent sexings!

**Edit:** Ladies, absolutely trim your nails beforehand. And gents, get that butthole clean! A little rimming can be a great way to sensitize the area and get you in the mood and few people want to tongue an asshole that smells/tastes, well, like an asshole. Flavored lube can help with this too.

So, the other night, my boyfriend and I were making love, and when we were done, I felt that surge of emotion again.  I just let go, like a few of you told me to do.  He was holding me, and when he saw my tears, he stroked my face and said, ""Well someone is just a big ball of emotions tonight.""

I smiled, and I decided to talk to him about it.

""I'm not sad,"" I said, ""I just love you a whole lot.  I've never felt this way about anyone before, and it's a lot to handle.  So I cry.""

He smiled, then a sliver of tears showed up in *his* eyes!  

""I feel the same way sometimes, I've just been stopping myself from crying.  I didn't want you to think I was a sissy or something.""

We layed there in each other's arms, kissing and stroking each other's hair, crying.  It was single-handedly the most beautiful experience I've ever been a part of.

tl;dr I had Super Cryfest 2012 with my wonderful boyfriend.

1375139693.0,1085,self.sex,1jb74r,My fetish of having my boyfriend have sex with other women is becoming an obsession and I'm afraid it's unhealthy.,1502,417,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jb74r/my_fetish_of_having_my_boyfriend_have_sex_with/,"My boyfriend (25m) and I (24f) have been together for 2 years, we have an incredibly healthy relationship with very good communication. We absolutely adore each other. 


About six months into our relationship, we started opening it up to threesomes. I would seek the girls out and we’d have some fun. I discovered during this time that **a)** I’m not really all that bisexual, **b)** I LOVE the idea of my boyfriend with other women, the look on his face when he discovers a new pussy for the first time is overwhelmingly hot and **c)** I like hooking up with friends more than strangers/randoms. 


Over time we’ve had a couple more threesomes and he’s hooked up with one of my best friends one on one a couple times and he’s flirted with a few girls (with my encouragement). I’ve only had to veto once because I really didn’t trust the girl’s intentions (and I later discovered my gut was spot-on).


As we foray deeper into this fetish (which is more like an obsession. It’s almost all I can think about) I’m starting to realize it’s a lot more complex than me being turned on by sex, it's a mental thing almost to the point that it’s a mindfuck and I’m beginning to worry whether it’s healthy. Here are some of my concerns:


**1)** I can only get off to imagining him with other women. Sometimes we masturbate with me watching him masturbate to other women on GW. We still have loving one on on sex on the regular but this fetish is so strong I feel unsatisfied if we don’t have a current prospect for him.


**2)** About prospects, I have a lot of trouble not seeing my friends/acquaintances/new women in my life as sexual prospects for him. It’s really hard for me to compartmentalize and I have to try very hard to take these ladies out of the potential-sex-partner-for-my-partner bubble. It’s so bad that when a conquest starts dating someone new I get as disappointed as if I was a single man with a crush on her. I don’t think this is healthy and I’d really like to learn how to separate my fetish from every day life.


**3)** Thinking about him with other women leads to a strange combination of arousal, compersion, sadness and jealousy. Sometimes I’m happy for him, sometimes I’m angry at him, sometimes I want to prove myself the best, sometimes I’m just really fucking horny and want him to tell me about it while he fucks me. I really can’t control it and sometimes it can affect our relationship but he’s excellent at after-care. The arousal always tends to beat out all the other emotions in the end though.


**4)** Speaking of proving myself, I know he’s absolutely head over heels will give up anything in the world in love with me but sometimes I get off on the feeling of inadequacy that sometimes crops up after he’s with/goes on a date with another woman. I like to try to be the best girlfriend ever by cleaning and cooking and doing sexual favors for him afterward. It makes me happy but the fact that I love playing wifey to prove myself can’t be healthy either?


**5)** I’m not interested in polyamory so I’m afraid I’m playing with fire here. I love when he goes on dates and tenderly kisses and makes love to other women but I absolutely do not want him to fall in love or have a relationship with them beyond close friends with benefits. This is why ideally I love when he hooks up with our mutual friends because I know there is an intimacy between the three of us and the girl he’s with won’t see me as a threat and try to undercut me. I know I can’t control his heart but this is such a great fear for me.


**6)** I have no interest in swinging or being with other men in any fashion. The idea makes me sick. I guess it goes back to the inadequacy thing but I like being only his but him not being only mine. Being with another man would ruin the fetish for me completely.


**7)** Sometimes I pressure him to pursue women and I should back off and let things develop organically. Really no advice you can give me here, just adding it as a reminder to self.


I think I covered it as well as I could, as you can see it is quite complex. I’ve tried to quiet this but it seems I can’t, it’s powerful and it’s here to stay. Is this healthy? If it’s completely terrible is there a way I can rework it in my mind to make it healthy? Those with similar fetishes, how do you reconcile all the opposing feelings?

I'm happy and we're happy. I'm a beautiful woman with a great job, great friends and a great education but I'm afraid my dirty little secret might be damaging in the long run even though it isn't now.


Thank you so much for your time :)

Why hate it the whole way through? Get acquainted with your labia, your clit, your asshole. Check it out, get to know it, take it on a date, yadda yadda. Okay maybe not that, but you get the idea.

Look at it as a part of you, something that makes you unique to other girls. I love my clit, I think it's adorable in a way. I used to hate my inner labia and some of the skin tags I have (gyno says they're from my torn hymen), but now I look at them as a unique part of me that can be fun to play around with. It's also crazy, cause whenever I imagined my SO going down on me I pictured a not-so-pretty scene, but looking at it with a handheld mirror... it's really actually pretty attractive.

So yeah, that's all I have to say. Stop beating yourselves up over little imperfections. Imperfections are what make us all beautiful and distinguishable from one another, male or female.

Foreplay summarized.",1570,497,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/10mx6z/for_guys_who_are_insecure_in_bed_here_is_how_to/,"I see so many guys worry that we will judge them harshly by the size of their penis, stamina or general skills in the sack!  

Here`s something you can work on regardless of your insecurities, if you have fingers and a tongue. Remember to TAKE YOUR TIME. Dont rush through them! 

1. Be dominant and give yourself time to tease the shit out of her. Consider foreplay as a fun kind of torture to understand it better and tease her before she gets to see or touch you. 
2. Run your fingers around her neck and arms while you kiss her. 
3. Run you hands lower around her breasts WITHOUT touching them, while you kiss her neck. 
4. Occasionally brush over her nipples, but when she isnt expecting it. Basically tease the shit out of her. And when you think she NEEDS it, touch them briefly, but maintain that power! 
5. Keep this power game of teasing up so that she almost has to beg for you to touch her. 
6. Move on to the next hot points between her thighs with the same teasing technique. Run your fingers up and down her legs, avoiding her pussy completely, but acting like every time that you MIGHT touch it.
7. Move your fingers inside of her pants or panties if she still has them on, and tease that crease between her thighs and her vulva.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 all over again...remember you still havent touched her pussy yet. I promise she`ll be soaking wet (!EDIT! or generally aroused)  by the time you get to it.
9. When you finally get to her pussy, with your fingers, take the same torture technique to her labia inside and out, whlie avoiding her clitoris and putting anything inside yet. 
10. Rub around it, next to it etc, and watch as she squirms trying to get you to touch it. 
11. Run through steps 1-10 again. I think you see what`s going on here! TEASE! 
12. Eventually when you do touch her clitoris with your fingers, check her responses to how she likes it touched - that you DO need experience for - and if you do the steps above, you will be getting lots of it i promise! 
13. At this point you can also enter 1 finger inside her slowly, but remember to keep building up to every extra step you do! Push and pull. 
14. Do the same steps 7-13 with your mouth. 
15. Use your fingers inside her while you suck her clit. In porn I`ve seen that men often lick, but from discussions with my girlfriends &amp; my preferences, most women prefer having their clitoris sucked like it was a mini-penis. 
16. At this point she`ll most likely be demanding your penis, and you can ease into it confidently, knowing you made her feel amazing. 

I really hope this helps some men and perhaps women who want to know what great foreplay can feel like. I know that there are many other things, which feel great too - but here is just one script which people can use if they are worried, which will generally feel amazing to most women. 

TL;DR Toture your lover, teasingly moving your hands around their hot spots until you can see them writhing in agony because they need you to touch/lick/fuck them.

I've been getting more and more worried about it lately as it was getting to the point when we would go 5 or 6 days without it. So I decided to experiment a little this week and have sex with him every day whether or not I ""feel like it"". Even if sex is the last thing in my mind, or I haven't had time for a shower, I go for it anyway. I get into it every single time and the sex is incredible. I've learned that our biggest inhibition is just getting it started, but once we do it's passionate and wonderful all over again. We have been having sex 2 or 3 times a day again. It feels like we're back on our honeymoon. And the improved sex has leaked into the rest of our relationship as well. We haven't been as testy with eachother and I'm falling in love with him all over again. So i guess my point is if it feels like your sex life is going down the tubes because of busyness or stress or just plain not feeling like it, make it a point to try to have constant sex anyway. Kiss eachother! Make out again! Grope them in public as a tease for later.

Recently, I have been sending him porn links that I like and easing into the conversation about anal play. I play with his ass often, but he doesn't seem to be interested in mine. After a night of drinking, I asked him to finger me, but I moved his hands a little lower. The next day he asked if I remember asking for it, and I told him that I did... with a sheepish smile. He didn't say much but wasn't weirded out like I thought he would be.

Yesterday I was masturbating and felt a little frisky so I sent him a picture of our dildo  in my ass. When he came home last night, he asked if he could join, so I popped it in and we went at it. I loved it, he loved it, and I hope he will take it further.

I have a handful or so to work with, and it's a huge insecurity for me. I am never ever happy with my boobs, can't stand to have them exposed most of the time, and just generally kind of obsess over wishing they were bigger. I feel like less of a woman/less sexual a lot of the time because of it, which feels silly, but I can't help feeling like that.

Except...during sex when I'm on top, my (male) SO will lean forward and latch on to one of my nipples. And oh my god. It feels AMAZING. It's not sexual in the same way that touching my clit/vagina is, but it's strongly arousing and it's almost...empowering? and fills me with this huge rush of feeling like I'm taking care of him somehow. I've never had a child or been pregnant, so I have no idea where that feeling comes from. But it's such a great feeling, on par with an orgasm. I want it all the time. Not just during sex. When we're just spending time together, I wish he could be sucking on my tits.

The problem is...I don't know why I feel like this. Is it normal? To guys, how would you feel about your girlfriend/whoever wanting casual nipple ...? sucking, I guess. I don't want to call it a nursing kink because I feel like that has somewhat icky connotations, like associating him with a child. Which is really the opposite of our relationship completely, he's very dominant and I like it. But I digress. Do a lot of other women feel like this?

And...How do I go about asking for it? Our relationship is kind of complicated, I don't know how to approach him with something like this. Especially because I don't even like for him to touch my boobs most of the time because of how insecure I am about their size. And yet I want them to be sucked on all the time?... I'm so confused about my own feelings! I'm sorry for ranting, I guess I'm just worried about how normal this all is. Thanks to anyone who made it through.

I had an amazing experience today that spoke volumes to this. It was my first time being sexual with this new partner. 

So I'm going down on him and I notice him getting a bit tense and he covers his hands with his face and says ""I think it's happening"". So I immediately stop, thinking something's really wrong and I ask what was wrong. He responds with ""I'm getting anxiety about my penis"". Turns out he was getting worried about being able to impress me and was having a difficult time maintaining his erection (I had been having so much fun going down on him, I hadn't noticed that he was less hard). I swear to god... him being that vulnerable and opening up like that turned me on even more. I looked him dead in the eye and said ""so?"". He gave me a confused look and I elaborated ""I fucking love that you were able to just tell me that. But here's the thing... I'm having a lot of fun, so I'm not going to stop unless you really want me to. I'm going to keep going down on you, regardless of if you're hard or soft and I'm going to love every minute of it."" I could literally feel the tension easing out of his body. And not even 10 seconds later, he was rock hard. No more 'issues' with erection for the rest of the (2 hour long) session. But even if he wasn't able to maintain an erection, I honest to god would not have cared... I knew he was enjoying the stimulation and I was enjoying it too. And goddam, he had an amazing mouth.  

I know this won't work for absolutely everyone, but guys- if you're getting anxious around your erection, see if you can just let your partner know. I can't describe to you how amazing it was to be with a man who was comfortable enough with me to share his concerns/worries with me instead of freaking the fuck out inside his head.

Should i tell her i am a virgin? i have done my research on her, she is highly recommended and where i live its legal (sort of***(For more info on what i mean go here = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_United_Kingdom a lot of people bringing this up)***). Also any other advice is welcome!

More about me-

I still live at home with my parents and i am quite socially awkward. i have no real interest in relationships or anything like that but i do want to have sex. That's why i'm going this route.

Edit/update:Thanks everyone for the support, I should be back by 22:15 UK time and i will let you AmA.

**Update: Also very graphic and NSFW (ofc).**
So im back:D. Here i will kinda bullet point it and i will answer any questions you have in the comments

-When i arrived she greeted me in sexy underwear. she was a little older than i thought from the pictures but it didn't really bother me.

-I was kinda worried after reading a post below that i wouldn't be able to get hard until i entered her bed room, then i was ready almost immediately.

-handed over the cash and she told me to strip off (i'm not a great writer so i'm just going to say every thing straight.) I did tell her i was a virgin and i dono what i expected to happen but it was a total non-issue.

-I lay on the bed and she put the condom on me then started blowing me. It didnt feel like i expected it to but it was still great

-She got on top of me and started riding me (no penetration yet). then she put it in and started fucking me. i know now im not into the back and forth motion i like the up and down more. i went on top pinning her legs back like they do in porn thrusting is a lot harder than it looks in the movies. put her legs over to the side and started fucking her that way. I then got up and bent her over the bed and fucked her doggy.

-after a bit i lay on the bed again and she finished me off and it wasn't easy. i just wouldn't cum. she got some lube and really started going at it. seems i probably grip too hard when i jerk off which i guess i need to stop doing. 

-when i came i have never really done it without anything to catch it so i wasn't expecting it to shoot over my shoulder and onto the pillow.

few things i learned, don't jerk off before hand (no pun) i lasted 40mins at least before i came.

Would i do it again? probably not but that said i don't regret it. It was a great time.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the supportive and concerned posts, i will keep responding for the next few days so keep questions and comments coming, One of the reasons i wanted to be open about this is i see a lot of people my age asking ""20somthing yo virgin, should i go to an escort?"" i read quite a few before i went ahead on this. hopefully it will help them out.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1374625870.0,,,True,t3_1iw5dy,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1iw5dy/im_23_m_virgin_and_tonight_im_going_to_see_an/,

About two and a half years ago I was on holiday in Germany and I had a car accident. I'm told it was pretty horrific but I don't remember anything about it. I was in a coma for a month and a half before I woke up. I don't remember anything from 2 days prior the crash.

Once I woke up my leg was broken and so were 3 of my ribs. Although they had been healing along nicely during my coma. I was told all of this by my father, who was the only family I had left at that time. He died a year ago of a heart attack. 

However there was one thing he left out and I had to wait for my doctor to tell me this: In the accident some crushed/flying/tearing metal pretty much cut off my penis and mangled my balls. He told me I was never going to have children or have sex again. Over the next few weeks I had staged surgeries to restructure my urethra using the lining of my mouth.

After that I went back home and eventually started college. I made some friends but have never told anyone about my situation. The only people who knew were the surgeons in Germany and my father. And then later I guess my doctor here and my therapist.

I have never had a girlfriend, even before the accident. My friends just think I'm hopeless with woman even though I can socialize with them easily. Any time a woman shows interest I just ignore it or tell them I have no interest in them. Which has led some of my friends to think I am gay. Although they have never seen me with a guy or even heard something to that effect.

For the first year or so I was extremely depressed and went to therapist's and for a while I took anti depressants which I am now off. I no longer feel depressed, just numb.

Every time I see a post on reddit whining about how they are forever alone or how they are terrible with woman, or how they never get to have sex I get pissed off. At least you idiots still have the possibility. It's not as bad a year or two ago. But still every time sex is brought up, either on tv or on the internet or in movies or music or just in real life I still feel that pang of annoyance. Every time i feel like shouting out just for a second 'AT LEAST YOU STILL HAVE A FUCKING COCK!'. But I don't... Because it would just be weird, and because no one actually knows.

Maybe in time I might find a woman to will enjoy spending time with me, but I will never have that kind of a physical connection. And woman of my age, thats what they want. 

I also am extremely pissed off with myself. Why did I have to be that shy, introverted guy my whole life? Why didn't I go after the girls once I was young instead of thinking it will happen once I get older? Why did it take my fucking dick being severed off before I had the balls (pun intended) to talk to woman? Maybe now I know I have no chance in that department I have no fear about it anymore.

Obviously this is a throwaway account. My friends know my original one and I don't want them finding out by a post on reddit. I am also not sure where to put this. At first I thought I'd make this an IAMA but I realized I don't want to answer a load of questions. I just needed to get this off my chest. So now it is either reddit.com or sex. I think I'll just dump it in sex.

Oh and before anyone asks, I will not be posting any fucking pictures! heh..

**TL;DR- Got in a car accident when I was 19, severed my cock and smashed my balls to an oblivion. Will stay a virgin forever, and no one knows but me and my doctors.**


-edit- Spelling mistakes
-edit2- The not being able to have kids part, that I really do not care about. I always knew I did not want to have children. I guess if it was only my balls that came off it would have been an improvement heh!

**-EDIT3-** Jeez, I went out to get some groceries and come back and this has blown up. Really did not expect this tbh. I'd like to thank everyone who is being extremely supportive. I've been going through all the replies and upvoting practically everyone who has given good and thoughtful advice.

I'm seriously considering telling some of my friends in the near future. I have been on the verge of telling them multiple times but have always chickened out. The responses here have helped convince me that it would definitely work out positively.

Just to answer some questions. 
-Yes, I do take testoterone supplements. 
-No, I have not thought about a sex change operation, although as some people here have pointed out to undergo something like that you actually need parts of your junk. So it's not really possible anyway.
-I have tried anal stimulation, so far I haven't had that much succes, but then again I have not tried very often. It is technically possible to have an orgasm although I haven't had one since the accident.
-How much is left? Well a little less then an inch.

**-Edit4-**

This will be my last edit, after this I'm done. Apparently without me even noticing this has for a short period of time made the front page. I never expected the amount of replies and positive and supportive comments and remarks. I thought this would be a smallish thread in r/sex but instead is has blown up. The responses have literally changed the way I think about what has happened, and bout how I should handle it. Maybe in a few months I'll submit a short update. Although to be honest I doubt it. Most of the replies have made me think about myself and the way I have handled things in the past 2 and a half years. A lot of them have made me laugh, and a small amount have made me rage.

But most of all they have make me realize I should stop being such a pussy. Thank you and goodnight!

She’s just as sexy to me as she always was, but stopped sleeping with me because she isn’t comfortable with her body around me. How can I help her feel more at ease and more sexual?",1485,470,349,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/15vyvp/i_26m_lost_a_lot_of_weight_and_got_in_good_shape/,"**There are updates below**  
  
Pretty much as the title says, but here's the long version: 
We got married 7 years ago. We were both average weight when we got married. I put on a lot of weight, she stayed the same weight. Then, after four years of marriage, she cheated on me. I was obese then and hating myself, but at the time I figured I pretty much deserved to be cheated on (again, *at the time*.) I reacted to it by killing myself to get in shape.  
    
For the last three years I’ve done everything I could to make myself a better person. I started going to the gym three times a week. Then every day. Now I spend two hours a day in the gym. I went from an obese BMI from fat to an “obese” BMI from muscle. 8% bodyfat. Actual abs (which I never had), actual pecs. No shame (finally!) getting naked at the gym or taking my shirt off when I work outside. My dick even got longer. (Not kidding, I guess there is a pad of fat at the bottom of your penis that gets bigger when you’re fat and smaller when you’re skinny?) I get hit on by random people now, which never happened to me ever and now happens a few times a week.    
  
I’m really proud of all the work I’ve done. But the more I did, the colder the bedroom became.  
  
My wife started eating a lot. I’m okay with this. I know how it feels to be addicted to food. She’s gained a lot of weight. I’m okay with this, too. I think she’s as sexy now as she was before. But she “doesn’t believe me.” She insults herself constantly, no matter what I do or what I say.  
  
On those rare occasions when we DO have sex, she gets wetter and more excited than she ever did for “average” or “obese” me, and I can go longer and get harder, etc. But she pushes me off, always, after a few minutes, saying she can’t stand the thought of me touching “her fat body.” 
  
I thought it was ALL just bad body image, but then she got drunk this New Years (I was sober as I have been for three years) and admitted to me that she is no longer comfortable with my body, and is 100% convinced that I am going to cheat on her, and that looking at me with my shirt off, or whatever, “makes [her] hate herself and want to die.” She also told me that she wishes I would gain weight again so we could be “together again.” Which I don’t even understand. What does that mean? She also told me that I am going to cheat on her because “now I can have anyone I want.” Which is *bullshit*. The only person I want is her, and I can’t have her!  
  
It’s important for me to say a couple of things:  
1. I love my wife. I really DO think she’s sexy. Sexier than before in some ways.  
2. I never, *ever* insulted myself or said outloud that I got over the pain of being cheated on by telling myself I deserved it for not being attractive enough (which I *don’t* think anymore, and haven’t for years).  
3. We have attempted sex about once a month for the last six months. EVERY TIME she’s pushed me off and started crying and insulting herself.  
4. The reason I’m not submitting this to r/relationships is because outside of sex, our relationship is great. We go out, we play games at home, we go on trips. She laughs at my stupid jokes, I tell her how beautiful she is about 10 times a day and I mean it. When my shirt comes off, or worse, when hers does, then and only then do things start to go wrong.  
  
I just want to help my wife feel more comfortable with her body in general and around me. I want to help her feel more sexual without hating herself. I want her to be happy for me and not feel bad because she’s put on weight that I find sexy anyhow. What can I do to help her?
  
**UPDATE (14:25 EST)** Well, shit. I wasn't expecting this post to take off so much. (Or at all, honestly.) It's been on the top of r/sex long enough that one of my wife's ""friends"" (you know who you are) saw it and posted *screencaps* to her Facebook with the following comment: **""I guess there's been trouble in the bedroom since [My name] lost all that weight and [Her name] found it lol keep on dinying [I think she meant ""denying""] him, girl, all you're doing is pushing [My name] out of your bed onto the market again rawr""**  
  
For the record, I don't know this friend very well, but my wife knew her in High School.  
  
Since she posted screencaps, I can't edit anything here but I wouldn't want to. Nothing I've said is untrue. I love my wife, and I think she's sexy as hell, and all I want is to be with her. I'm not interested in this ""friend"" of hers or anyone else, and I think it's a pretty shitty thing to use an anonymous post asking for advice to shame your ""friend"" and sort-of hit on her boyfriend in front of god knows how many people.  
  
Also, sweetheart, if you're reading this, please see how many people are trying to help and how clear it is to everyone that I think you're incredibly sexy and that you have nothing to worry about from me. Now, as for your ""friends""... Ugh.  
  
**UPDATE (15:30 EST)** PLEASE DON'T ATTACK MY WIFE'S FRIEND. A few people have PM'd saying they found her Facebook (I don't know how, it's private) and have offered to do various things to ""get even."" Please don't do that. It's not necessary. Yes, the comment thread it sparked is ugly and horrible and I can't believe what her ""friends"" are saying on Facebook. No, I'm not planning to respond other than as I have: telling her I think it was inappropriate, asking her to take it down, and blocking her. I might delete my entire Facebook account, I don't know. I just want to forget this part of things. High School was a decade ago for me and longer for the ""friend"".  
  
I made sure my wife had a link to your comments. Most of you have been really awesome. Thank you for the PMs, too, they've almost all been really supportive.  
  
My wife says she wants to ""talk to me"" about ""all this shit"" when she gets home. She seems really upset but wouldn't talk to me about anything over the phone. I guess I""ll keep responding to comments when I get a chance (I'm not ashamed of or questioning anything I've said to anyone) and then maybe make an update thread later on, when I've had a chance to talk to her (assuming that's okay with her).

There is little to no hope for it ever being fixable. It had been more than seven years since I'd had any contact with a woman and my condition was only getting worse. To maintain sanity, I'd long ago had to reprogram my mind to intercept and suppress any sexual thoughts and had resigned myself to the fate of a lifetime virgin.

A few months ago, I finally decided that the night in question would be my last. I destroyed all of the documents I didn't want my survivors to find, took a hammer to numerous hard disks, and packed duct tape and a hose into my car. Carbon monoxide poisoning seemed to be the way to go. I drove to a nearby pub and spent three hours downing scotch to boost my courage. The plan was to drive to a place I'd picked out in a nearby park and run the hose from my exhaust to my car's cabin. Notes were left for the people I thought would care.

As I was leaving the deserted bar, the bartender came out and joined me during what I expected to be one of my last cigarettes. Out of the blue, she asked me why I'd never kissed her. I had no idea what she was going on about, but she said she'd been hitting on me for a year or so. I guess I was oblivious.

Before I could stop her, her tongue was halfway down my throat. We made out until the sun came up, and it was absolutely fantastic. My skills in this area are pretty primitive, so what went down is probably rather junior-highish by the standards of most of the people reading this, but it was still a fantastic experience. Her lips were soft and coated with some sort of nice-tasting lip gloss, and I can't describe how good it felt to have simple physical contact with another human being, to hold her hand and embrace her. Due to my condition, continuing things beyond simple kissing would have been impossible but I was so elated and buzzed that all the plans I had of killing myself evaporated.

So girls, if you see a homely, depressed, and sick looking guy and you don't have anything better to do, try kissing him. He probably won't be a suicidal sack of shit like me, but there is a decent chance that you'll be doing him more good than you can ever imagine.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_d5pep,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d5pep/kissing_a_girl_probably_saved_my_life/,

A couple of days ago, I decided it would be the day where I redefine my marriage and myself as the man in it.  My journey is by no means close to complete, but this was the first big step.  I had been spending the last 3 weeks pouring over materials on seduction, sex, and reading posts from [/r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) as well as committing myself to [/r/nofap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) (to which I also owe a huge thanks to)

It was Thursday and we had been almost two weeks without sex.  Sadly, this was not uncommon in the past.  My libido was never really that strong and my wife tended to only want sex when I became the initiator (I’ve now come to see this as a good thing since she is really looking for me to lead).  After reading posts, learning about how to properly hit the G-spot, Kegels, no porn, [/r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) tips, etc… a sudden readiness came rushing in on Thursday morning.  It was time.

I started the morning by sending my wife texts while she was at work.  Gentle at first, saying how I was thinking about her, then moving on to hints about a “surprise” when she gets home.  All I would tell her was “I was in control, all she had to do was follow my lead” and “All I can promise you is you are going to cum, hard and a lot”  She was a bit shy in her responses but very interested and I could tell she was getting herself revved up and turned on… I then began setting up.  

I went up to the bedroom and gathered the items to create a sort of schoolgirl outfit I always wanted her to wear for me along with a cute pair of panties and bra.  I placed the panties in my sock drawer with a little note telling her to freshen up now if she felt the need, then to put on the panties and bra and go to the second drawer underneath the TV table. 

In the second drawer, I placed a tight sweater, the very short skirt, a pair of knee-high socks, and a pair of heals.  These were accompanies by a second note which instructed her to go to a small bag placed under my nightstand.

In the bag were a couple of sex toys, some lube, and two long lacy ribbons.¬¬  There was also a note in this bag and the instructions were to take all the items out and place them in a display on the bed.  Sit next to the items and wait patiently till I came up, and finally to “Hope she wasn’t in too much trouble”
Everything was a go, and I was nervous as fuck.  I almost talked myself out of it a couple times, but I kept reminding myself that I am the man and she has been secretly hoping for me to unleash this side of us for a few years now (and boy was I right, but we’ll get to that).

The next few hours when she came home were tough, we have a 1 year old son who requires all of our attention.  I had to make sure to keep her arousal at an elevated place while we worked to take care of our son.  It was really hard to do and at one point I seemed to lose her completely after we put the kid to bed, but I was able to get her back to that place through a gentle escalation (increasing intensity kisses and gradually provocative innuendos) Jump to the moment where it was about to start, I had her in the kitchen as she was doing the dishes.. I came up behind her and pulled her up against me, kissing and brushing my hands teasingly all over.  As soon as I heard the heavy breathing and felt her body going slightly limp against mine, I began kissing her neck and teasing around her breast and groin til I heard soft moans.  It was time!  I slid my hand up along her body , then gently grabbed her hair and gently pulled her head back to expose her neck.. kissed her there a few times, and then told her “Go upstairs and look in my top drawer, you’ll know what to do from there”.  Obedient and sexy as ever, she gave me a shy smile and with a quick twirl, she was off.  

The 20 minutes following were nerve racking.  We had never done anything like this and I had no idea how she was going to respond, but I was committed.  Soon I no longer heard the heels walking around on the floor.  I let her sit there a few more minutes wondering what I was up to, then I gathered my courage, and went upstairs.

When I opened the door, there she sat.  She was the fucking hottest thing I’ve ever seen with her skimpy outfit and nervous but innocent look.  I got immediately into character and  walked past her without saying anything and removed a few items from my pockets.  I then turned to her and asked “Do you know why you’re in so much trouble?”  She responded she didn’t.  I then pointed at the toys on the bed and told her I found them in her sock drawer and wondered what she was doing with such dirty things in this house (the fact I was role-playing was obvious by this point since we had used the toys together in the past). She was very timid about getting into character and I know she was out of her comfort zone but she was enjoying it and trying her best.  She began playing as if she thought it wasn’t a big deal and told me she “only used them when I wasn’t around”.  I then stood her up and made her spin around, asking why she was dressed so inappropriately and accused her of dressing slutty to get the attention of the other guys at work.  She was catching on but still timidly embracing her character.  This banter went back and forth with me asking her to explain the items and what she did with them as well as picking apart her outfit while reprimanding her by grabbing her ass and sliding my hands “inappropriately” along her front.  The whole time, she was playing along and slowly embracing her role, even changing her voice slightly.. but still not yet fully immersed.  Finally I told her that “I would forgive her, but first she needed to be punished” Without any hesitation, I sat on the bed, pulled her across my lap, and laid a firm slap on her ass.  Bang!  And like that, she was fully in character!

As I alternated between firm slaps and rubbing her ass, I was getting crazy hard as she yelped then moaned with each slap, wriggling around on my lap and shifting her legs with a purr.  She was loving this and so was I. 

I next told her that I was going to remind her of what a real cock was like as I threw the small vibrator to the side.  I put her on my knees and told her to pull it out of my pants, and while holding her by the back of her hair, directed her to take me into her mouth.  She was loving this!  I was directing her with every move as she happily followed my instructions.  It was amazing!  After a few minutes, I told her to stand up, turned her back to the bed, and the pushed her down on it.

I loved being in total control like this.  When I wanted her shirt up.. I told her to remove it.  I aggressively lifted her bra to help myself to her tits and body in general.  Anything I wanted her to do, I commanded it, and she happily obliged without hesitation.  I then grabbed the ribbons and proceeded to tie her arms above her head to the sides of the bed, constantly reminding her of what a bad girl she was, and that I was going to make her cum however much I wanted as punishment.   She couldn’t get enough and would alternate between moaning and begging in response. 

After she was tied up, bra pushed up and skirt hiked to mid waist, I began teasing in between her legs, constantly acting like my tongue was about to enter her, then pulling away. Once I had her pleading for  me to taste her, I’d slightly go in, and then pull away again telling her I didn’t think she was ready for it and went back up to her breasts or other places.  She was squirming a whimpering so much that it was driving me wild.  Finally after one final tease, I let my tongue go in and then licked up the entire length of her pussy.  She lost it within seconds and was bucking her hips and crying out in an intense orgasm.  

At this point, there is a loss in my memory of some of the details up until I went in to give her a G-spot orgasm (we had done this in the past, but this was the first time I actually did it right).  Once I found the right pressure and firmness, she was screaming in ecstasy, trying to hold it in till I commanded her to let it go and commanding her to cum hard for me.   The orgasm she had was the most incredible/beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.  As the orgasm washed over her, her body went tense and started quivering uncontrollably and her face went into what I can only describe as a scream that was so intense it couldn’t get out… so she held there for a good 20 seconds, body shaking intensely and mouth open in a silent scream.  When the sound finally escaped it was more like a roar of insane pleasure and she started convulsing all over.. I thought she was going to pass out. 

Again, the specifics escape me after this point… but I held to my promise.. I had her cum over and over again.  Sometimes breaking to ravish her body or to give her my cock and tell her to suck it.  At one point her binds came undone and I used this as an opportunity to “punish her for trying to escape” as I put her on her knees, slapped her ass a few times, and then went back to work on her pussy.  

Finally came the time for me to go into her, she was so ready for me that she couldn’t control herself.  Bucking her hips towards my cock and begging me to enter her.  I used this opportunity to tease her some more… pushing in just a little bit and as she tried to slide down, pulling away telling her I didn’t think she could handle it.  Finally after one quick pull out, thinking I was going to tease again, I pushed into her hard as she cried out.   

I don’t think I was ever so big or so hard in my life… she also made it known to me multiple times how big I was and deep in I was going.  This is where the practice of self-control and kegel exercises started to come into play.  At one point, I told her I was going to make her cum on my dick, threw her legs over my shoulders, and drove deep into her.  The orgasm that followed was as intense as the G-spot orgasm with the added emotion you can only get from fucking… it was beautiful.  The only hard part was trying to stay inside her as her body was thrashing about.  Finally when it was my time to cum, I told her I was going to cum all over her.  She cried yes as I pulled out and covered her body… It was incredible and the first time I ever came on her like that.  Afterwards, I fell next to her making sure to give her one more orgasm so as not to leave her hanging, and then just lay there next to her as she was panting, speechless and staring at the ceiling.  After she was able to talk again, all she could say over and over was how amazing it was and how much she loved it.  We made out a good 20 minutes more before finally breaking away to the shower to clean up.

The best part about this is, after this night something changed in our relationship.  Something major yet I can’t quite pinpoint exactly what it is.  We went from sex once every 2-3 weeks to fucking 4 times in 3 days.  Whenever we are with each other, we make out and touch each other like a teenage couple early in their first relationship.  She is constantly doing things to turn me on like wiggling her ass in front of me or showing off her skimpy outfits.   Every chance we get, we are making out or rubbing our hands along each other’s body.  

The love we feel for each other has also unleashed. I always loved her, but the intensity has just amplified tenfold.  Her beauty which I’ve always acknowledged is now being “felt” by me, for lack of a better description.  It was like we were two souls meant for each other, inches away and knowing they were destined to touch, but not quite able to meet until that night.  I don’t know why it happened after this, but I love it.  The best example of this was the day after.  I can’t describe the experience and do it  anything close to justice.  After hours of not being able to keep our hands off each other, we finally put the kid down for a nap and made love.  It was seriously the most sensual, emotional, loving, and beautiful sex I’ve ever had.  

Also, the dynamic we established in bed that night has moved out of the bedroom, though in a much more mild form.  I don’t dominate her out of the bedroom like I do during sex sometimes now, but clearly she looks upon me as her dominant man.  Again, I can’t fully explain it, but it is like she has completely surrendered herself to me.   Emotionally and sometimes physically (Like now she loves for me to just pick her up, put her on my lap and rest her head on my shoulder  while we are watching TV or whatever).  For the first time in my life, I feel like I am finally fulfilling my role as the man and I can tell she finally feels like she can let go and be all woman.  Everything is perfect and words can’t describe how happy we both are right now.  (If anyone has insight as to why this happened after that night, please let me know).

I posted this because I’m hoping it inspires any couples (or singles) who were, like me, desiring to unleash themselves and become true to their desires, but hesitant to do so.   If by giving in to what you truly want, you feel even a fraction of what my wife and I feel right now, I promise you you’ll never regret it.  Thanks for listening! 

**TL;DR: Decided to take the lead and introduce my wife to the world of bondage, domination, and fantasies(role-playing).  Her response was better than I could have expected and has had a ripple effect of intensifying our relationship both in and out of the bedroom to levels I’ve never experienced.  Thanks [/r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/) for all the advice and confidence in pulling this off.**

A am a female so I am afraid that some of these tips might hinder male pleasure but please read on. 

The two major things that can ruin a good blow job experience:

* You don't say anything.

Communication is key. I'm not talking about giving the girl instructions while you go at it, but it is nice to hear a reassuring moan or ""that feels good."" If you can, tell the girl that you like the way shes using her hands or that you want her to go faster/harder/deeper. If shes a good girl, she will happily meet your requests. Personally, I hate feeling like I might be doing something wrong because the guy is completely silent until I am surprised by a mouthful of semen. Which brings me to another facet of this bullet point: warning before you cum is always appreciated. Though it is possible to tell through physical signs that the moment is near, it is not always so obvious. Every girls wants to make that climax as pleasurable as possible. When you're close, we want to know and be able to step up our game and take you over that edge. Heaven forbid I choose to slow down for a minute or take a breath of air just as you're getting close and then the tension that's been building is lost.

* I am about to throw up.

Some women can handle a large cock hitting the back of their throat for minutes on end, but for those of us with a gag reflex, this is not so easy. I am trying to give you a blow job, so please let me do the work so I can take some strategic breaths of air, set a rhythm that the back of my throat can handle, and maintain my composure, rather than you continually thrusting your penis into my mouth or pushing my head down on you cock. Go ahead and pull my hair and put your hands on my head and feel me going up and down on you but please, do not gag me with your penis! If I have no control over a large hard object hitting the back of throat over and over, I feel like I am about to throw up. If I have a stuffy nose and your cock is rammed down my throat, I can't breath. Neither vomit nor suffocation make for a happy blow job experience. My mouth is not a vagina, it is a passage way to my lungs and stomach and can't take a pounding. Consider this.

I love women and I love my wife, but ever since I was in highschool I've just had this fantasy of giving a blowjob. I've never found guys attractive and was never a particular person, I just wanted to give one. My father was always the macho man kind of guy and would call me and my brother faggots and homo when we did poorly at sports and stuff like that. 

When I finished highschool, I moved out of our small town and went to a major city on the East coast. There I met a girl who would eventually become my wife. But there was an issue. Her best friend since childhood was a gay man. At this point i was so conditioned to be anti gay. I never said anything mean to him and made sure not to offend him in anyway, but i just felt so uncomfortable around him and I told my girlfriend about this. She told me I would have to learn to accept him for who he was or she couldn't be with me. So i tried to get to know him better and we had so much in common we became best friends within about a year of meeting. 

Fast forward to this month and I finally confess to my now wife that I've always had a fantasy about giving a blowjob. We talk about it and she says that if its something I really want to give a shot that we should do it and we should talk to our friend who we are still incredibly great friends with if he would be interested. So we invited him over and talked to him about it and he was totally on board. 

So last night was the night. We decided that my wife would watch and if she or either of us got uncomfortable we would discuss it and figure something out. She was on the recliner while we were sitting on the couch. And then it started we started kissing and that part wasn't so great for me to be honest. his tongue was much rougher than a females. before long he had unbuttoned my pants and was stroking me. i was really hard he was pretty good with his hand. then he went down and started giving me a bj. the man was amazing. after about a minute i had to tell him to stop or i would cum. i undid his pants and pulled his dick out. it was rock hard and i gave it a few strokes with my and then took a deep breath and put it in my mouth.

so much was going through my mind. like oh my god am I gay? i finally did it, something ive fantasized about and jerk off thinking about for 15 years. i feel a great joy and rush of excitement. i look over at my wife and her pants are unbuttoned and her hand is down her panties. she smiles and winks at me. i go back down and start sliding my mouth up and down his dick. he starts talking me through it and guiding my head. after about 5 to 10 minutes he informs me hes about to cum so i stop and wife encourages me and to finish it off with my mouth. so i decided to do that. so i did and soon found my mouth full of semen. i found it really awesome actually. so i swallowed and my wife clapped for me, lol

I still had not cum yet so he proceeded to give me an incredible bj and i came. i felt like a new person. all the weight i had felt over this was gone. we then had some beers and played Cards Against Humanity for a couple hours.

tl;dr blew my best friend and loved it after 15 years of hating myself for my dick sucking fantasies. ",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_v5aj5,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/v5aj5/after_15_years_i_finally_overcame_the_shame_of_my/,

When I was around 5 or 6 I would hump the floor/pillows/rolled up socks until I fell asleep. Being innocently-minded, I did this in front of all my family members and they still joke about it to this day. None of them realize I still do it or (and I'm hoping) they never realized it was for sexual gratification.

It wasn't until I was 10 or 11 that I realized I was masturbating. I would find sexy scenes in movies or in my mom's romance novels and  hump away. I could (and still can) do it for hours.

I have never been able to masturbate successfully with fingers, ever. I bought toys and still failed, and oh I have tried. My fingers overstimulate my clit and it's just easier setting a rhythm with humping. Luckily I can get off with sex but I have to be rubbing against the guy during, which can be awkward. I have admitted to past SOs that I hump to get off but I have never felt comfortable doing it in front of them. It's strange because I am a pretty open person about my sexuality but it's like my deep dark secret because nobody talks about it like it's a normal occurrence, so I've always thought I was a weirdo.

(warning: long and graphic),1465,489,386,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/14gt5x/got_deepthroated_while_cumming_anyone_else/,"I'm a 25 year old male and fairly well-endowed (a little over 8""). And---whodathunkit?!---I've always wanted to feel what it's like to get deepthroated. None of that brutal gagging/mascara-running-down-face crap marketed in porn these days; a woman who can effortlessly and enthusiastically take a dick all the way down her throat.

I'm self-aware enough to know that this isn't an easy topic to bring up to a girl because: a) I should be counting my lucky stars that I'm getting head in the first place, and b) I can't really enjoy being pleasured when the person on the giving end could boot at any second. So, I played it pretty safe over the years with various girls; casually but carefully asking how far down they could go while giving head. If there was noticeable discomfort, I'd back off. 

I've been hooking up on-and-off with this 20-year-old girl I met a few months ago. Within a couple of encounters, it was clear that she had absolute control over her gag reflex. She hops on top of me, we sixty-nine, and she basically makes me disappear down her throat. I've spent a good chunk of my life wondering what this feels like, and the result was a million times hotter than I ever anticipated. It's impossible to hold back my moans---just one loud, glorious sigh after another every single time I hit the back of her throat. There's no gagging whatsoever. No deep breaths beforehand. No sore throat after. Only precaution she takes is not eating 2 hours beforehand. Best part: she enjoys doing it, integrating it as much as possible into her regular oral routine.

Cut to last week. I'm getting close to orgasm, and, on a whim, I ask her to try to keep me in her throat while I'm cumming. Just as I'm about to burst, she takes me all the way down. What happened next is like piecing together a murder scene. 

The tightness of her throat and the subsequent pressure on my dick must have delayed my orgasm for a few seconds; it was like shutting off a faucet, turning it back on, and anticipating the cold water turning hot again. I felt the blood draining from my head and my toes go numb before I erupted straight down her throat. The entire orgasm must've lasted 15 seconds minimum---about twice the usual length. She kept her mouth firmly planted down the entire time.

I had to throw a pillow over my face to muffle my screams. I felt like I blacked out for a millisecond. My arms and legs were visibly shaking for the next 10 minutes; it took another 15 before I could even stand up. I had the most gloriously splitting headache. Oh, and the kicker? Immediately after the deed, she asks me ""wait, did you cum?"" I mean, this was obviously right before she noticed the cum oozing out of me, but every shot down her throat (maybe 7 to 10 streams?) went completely unnoticed. 

Sexxit, I feel like the luckiest motherfucker on the planet. In order to make this post more than just some rambling, bombastic tale of sexual achievements, I'll ask you: has anyone else been as fortunate to experience this? Is it a once-in-a-while thing or on a regular basis? It's no-strings-attached with the girl of the story, so I need to make every second count. 

I need to go masturbate now. Cheers.

I am 29 years old and have no children and I want to keep it that way. She is older has kids and DOES NOT want any more

Am I in the wrong in this situation? 
Thoughts would be appreciated.

Not necessarily mind-blowing sex, just an awesome time thanks to the situation, and I was hoping I'm not the only one. 

My girlfriend of two years and I were 17 and went camping with two other couples. Both of us were virgins. We were all aware that it was a trip mostly for the two of us to do it, so there were 3 separate tents set up. One of the other couples was my very best friend in the world who knew how worried I was that I would suck. First night we got there, we went for it. 

My girl was really nervous so we played some music and we could sort of hear the other couples in their tents. We tried to be quiet and after an hour or so of foreplay went for it. Got it in, we used protection and everything and she was surprised it didn't hurt.
We got really into it and after maybe ten minutes she had an orgasm (i was so relieved that I didnt let her down, although I did not finish.) and she moaned rather loudly. so i plopped down next to her and just looked at her. then we heard applause. 
Not just clapping, like shouting and cheering, so i wrapped a towel around myself and stepped out of the tent. There was my best friend in his whitey tighteys, surrounded by our friends and probably five people i didnt know who he had gathered from a campsite of other teens nearby, and they were all cheering for us. I'm sure I blushed when i ducked back into the tent.

Do:  
-keep good hygiene, no one likes sweaty balls (this one should be obvious)    
-hold her hair if she doesn't have a hair tie  
-let her know you are enjoying it with a moan or saying something such as ""that feels so good""  
-play with her nipples   
-keep a bottle of water by your bed  
-warn her before you cum  

   
Do Not:  
-shove her head down unless you want to get puked on  
-pull her hair too hard  
-jam your hips into her face   
-be completely silent  
-be afraid to kiss her after she has taken a sip of water  


  Edit: I don't claim these are for everyone. These are just some general basics, especially helpful if you've never received one. Power to you if you get freakier, just make sure your partner is on the same page. ;)

I noticed that my hand was a bit sticky.  We didn't really fool around during the night (period time, so I told him no).  

I texted him, ""one of my hands is a little bit sticky.. know anything about that??"".  He messaged me back and told me that my hand had been on his stomach and he'd really needed to ""relieve"" himself and didn't realize it had gotten on my hand. After further questioning he finally told me he had actually USED my hand while I was sleeping to help himself out a little bit.

What?!? Just what? We've never had sex.. the most that's happened, before he basically raped my hand while I slept, is a few goodnight kisses. He doesn't seem to think it was weird, or a big deal. Am I just making a big deal about it???

It just pushed me over the edge. I think I only lasted a little more than a minute before I came as hard as I ever have.

Later she told me that she had noticed how stressed out I had been lately, and she had decided to really give me a treat. So she had gone to the bedroom and masturbated herself to the brink of orgasm while lubing up her ass with KY, and then gone looking for me.

I do them everyday. Anyone can do it. Whether you're sitting down or standing up.

The benefits, that I found, is I can cum whenever I want. After a certain amount of time of course. I've never had a premature ejaculation and have never experienced erectile dysfunction. 

Plus, powerful ejaculate. 

On top of that, it only takes minutes for me to get another erection. Whether that's a benefit from kegels, I don't know.

I'm a 22yo male currently in a relationship with a 22yo female, whom I'll refer to as J in this thread. J is very tomboyish, to the point that she never dresses up in feminine clothing or use make-up, even when we're dating. Yet somehow we found a mutual attraction to each other due our similarities in personality.

Just recently, she revealed to me that she finds herself aroused at the idea of gay sex, not as in witnessing the act, but ACTUALLY participating in it - A lot of her fantasies revolve around her being male and having sex with other males, or occasionally other women. She uses the term ""Autoandrophilliac"" to describe herself (A term I found out is really controversial in the Trans-community)

Although I consider myself straight, I find myself actually intrigued by this ""unusual plot twist"", and my feelings for her haven't diminished despite these revelations. But I can't help but wonder what implications this could have in our relationship and if anyone else here has a similar experience.

P.S. just some points to clarify any possible questions

- At this point, I'm not exactly sure if she is ""transsexual in denial"". She does say at times that she ""Wishes she were a boy"", but nothing else that could lead to a conclusion.
- She hasn't had any previous relationships with men, owing to conflicts with her ""masculine"" identity.
- I wouldn't classify myself as bi-curious, although I don't mind participating in her fantasies.

But as a dude, I find it hard to understand why anyone would simply reject this option. Who would try to fly a plane without practicing on a simulator first? 

I've heard these explanations from women: ""It doesn't feel right."" ""It just seems silly."" ""I don't really know how."" ""I was taught that girls don't do that."" ""I'd rather just have sex."" 

I guess I can understand the last one well enough, in the case of a woman who can have sex basically anytime she wants. But I just have a hard time envisioning why sex would legitimately feel good to a woman...but masturbation would seem like a waste of time. 

Are the two activities really that different to a lot of women? Is solo activity just not stimulating enough to be pleasurable by itself? Or is the sensation very different from actual sex, for these women?

Pretty open-ended question here: Almost any response will probably enlighten me. As a dude, I don't think I would be a very good partner if I hadn't learned a lot about my own sexual responses through self-pleasure. But I gather that things work very differently for some women. 

**EDITED TO ADD**: Lots of very enlightening comments here. I'm frankly amazed. Also I'm surprised at how common this response is: ""I'd rather just have sex with my boyfriend/partner."" It just seems remarkable to me how many respondents appear to have partners whose attentions they can call on at will. I'm starting to think that being partnerless is most frequently a guy thing. I'd never thought about that before, in such stark terms. Interesting to note.

The scent smells like 4 or 5 different really cheap perfumes all mixed together. It is a really unpleasant smell, enough so that I actually have to leave the area. For years, I could not figure out what the hell it was. I always asked what perfume someone was wearing, but they would give scents that I knew didn't smell like the one I was smelling.

I came to realize what the scent was after a previous girlfriend accidentally bought the scented kind. I immediately recognize it, and ever since then, any time a girl is wearing scented tampons, I recognize it and know. It is a pungent odor that overpowers literally everything else in the area.

A lot of guys will mistake the smell for cheap perfume. This is better than them realizing that it is a scented tampon, but not much better because the smell is still very unpleasant.

The vast majority of women I know do not use scented tampons... I gather that most have figured out the scent is not a good one.

Just wanted to give a heads up, as I've never seen this mentioned before by anyone and I thought it should be said.

Edit: Let me be clear, I am not talking about the normal smell of a woman on her period. That is subtle, and not really a bad smell. It's just a little different, and in most cases you can't smell it. The smell I am talking about is a pungent scent that in all seriousness makes me gag. 

Edit2: Apparently some women are taking what I said to imply that a man knowing you are on your period is bad or you should be ashamed of being on your period. That is not what I meant at all, never even entered my mind as I can't think of a reason one would be ashamed of being on their period. I only meant to be helpful by possibly informing someone who may not realize that the smell given off by scented tampons is really, really bad. Typically a bad smelling vagina is unhealthy or uncleanly, and knowing it is a tampon means knowing that the smell is coming from the vagina... which is significantly worse than thinking the person just has on a bad perfume.

Every once in a while my girlfriend will be waiting in bed when I get home, usually naked and spread on the bed with her vibrator already close to cumming, and it's damn near the best thing I can imagine to come home to. I wanted to return the favor, but wasn't sure the exact same thing but reversing roles would have the same effect, so I decided to do something a tad more elaborate. Not to mention that her job had been stressful so if she just wanted to relax when she got home, I didn't want to guilt her into sex right then and there. My solution?


I came up with two alternate scenarios. She would come home, and upon opening the door would be greeted with her laptop in the middle of the hall with a giant 'push me!' button in the center of the screen (all written in VBA through Word, though you could also do it choose-your-own-adventure style in regular Word). The next screen would tell her that she had two options, and would have to follow through with whichever she chose, the two buttons being labelled ""I have some-to-lots of energy and am feeling frisky"" and ""I'm low on energy and want something relaxing"". The relaxing option was something along the lines of ""Go into the bedroom and open the lower drawer of our dresser, there's a an outfit laid out [it was the most comfy everything she has], change into that, go over to the nightstand and light the candle there. Once you've done that, come find me; I have a glass of wine and massage oil waiting for you [and I was planning on giving a nice slow full body massage]""


Lucky for me, as I was hoping she chose the first option, which read something along the lines of this: ""First, go wash up, get a drink of water, whatever you need to do. Once you're done, go into the bedroom and open the top drawer of our dresser. Inside, you'll find a present and an outfit. First, put on the outfit, exactly what I've laid out, nothing more and nothing less [it was thigh-highs, crotchless panties and a shelf bra that left her nipples exposed]. Next I want you to open the present there, take it out, and leave it on the bed next to you, but don't use it [was a new g-spot vibrator]. Next, I want you to blindfold yourself, then use our restraints to tie yourself spread eagle to the bed leaving only your right hand free. Use your right hand to send me a text letting me know you've done everything.""  
[[edit: told in slight the wrong order, as a number of you figured out, blindfold came last]]


When I first went in there was lots of teasing, slowly running my hands all over her body, and then kneeled next to her head and made her go down on me, and eventually turned her over for some spanking before tying her up tight and making her cum using both the new vibrator inside her and another one right on her clit.

I had allready admited that it was my first time but she seemed fine with it. She even said that it was kind of cute to have the pleasure of teaching me the ways and some other stuff like that.

 We made out for a bit before she instructed me to strip. I guess she wanted to assess the equipment and evaluate me as a bed partner or something along those lines. I guess this is what most women do, right? So I undress myself until I'm standing there in just my underwear at which point she steps forward and pulls them down. I was pretty nervous but thrilled that fortune was finally coming my way. I wait for a moment to see what happens next and she sort of gasps and steps back and says that she has never seen one like mine before. I was circumcised when I was younger. I never really bothered with my genitals when I was younger. I can't speak for the rest of the world but men don't compare part where I live, so for years I never knew about the foreskin and all that. It never retracted, even when erect so I thought it was all in working order. When I learned about how it was meant to pull back, I tried it on myself but the pain was incredible, so I got it checked and I had an operation a couple of months later. That was when I was 17. Those who are circumcised at birth have it way easier. Waking up in the middle of the night with an erection that you got in your sleep when none of the stitches have disolved yet is not pleasant to say the least. There is a slight scar and some excess tissue left from where it turned out that my foreskin was fused with the glans since birth, but everything works fine, or so I thought. 

Fast forward something like eight years and here I am standing completely nude in front of this girl who can't stop staring. She started laughing a bit, although it was more of a nervous giggle I guess, but she asked me to put my clothes on and said that she couldn't be sure that I was clean. I explained it was just scar tissue and that there was no way I could have caught anything as I'd never been with anyone else before, but she said she had to think about it and asked me to leave. I felt completely worthless. I do not think that I have ever felt so weak before. If this is what emasculation feels like then it is not fun. I really need some advice on how to solve this mutant of a body part I have.

Edit: Thank you all for the words of encouragement. All of you have been very kind and I can safely say that I feel ready to face the world again.

2nd Edit: Again I thank everybody who has shown some encourgement, and it has made me feel much better about my situation after others revealed they are in a similar position. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the constant use of the word ""bitch"" all of the time though.

I decided to post this to share my perspective on two issues.  First, frequency/quality of sex after marriage.  Second, mechanics of PIV sex (nothing to do with marriage but I see a lot of people worried here).

First, marriage.  There's obviously a lot of dead bedrooms out there, but I want to tell you its not always like that.  We have sex pretty much daily.  Tends to be quick and lazy most of the time (spooning sex most weekday mornings), with more time taken at the weekends or whenever we have the energy.  We're busy, have kids, get tired, get stressed - but we try to connect daily as it brings us together.  We probably had more when first married and before kids, but I'm happy with what we have today ( I know its more than average - and I'm just fine with not being the average!).  We've been lucky with each other but looking back, I knew she loved sex and had a high drive before we married - and I knew that suited me - so I guess that set us up well for marriage.  I'm really not qualified to give advice at all, but I can't understand people who don't sleep together before marriage.  Sex is a big deal - test it before committing.

Second, I read a lot about guys worrying about cumming too soon.   For regular sex, I tend to cum pretty quickly - a couple of minutes - less than five.  Of course, I can stop and re-position to lengthen a session, but if we're having a quickie, then its, well, quick.  Quicker than when I was younger.  Wife can't cum from vaginal sex but gets genuinely upset if I don't cum.  So, over the years, I've adjusted/trained myself to making sure I cum.  This worried me for the longest time - that I'd cum and she wouldn't - but when I talk with my wife - she's 100% OK with this.  As someone said on this board really well - sex is like cake, cumming is like cake with icing on top.  And we all love cake.  When we have more time, we mix it up a bit - she cums hard from oral, and I make sure she cums regularly - albeit significantly less than me.  I think the takeaway for me is that everyone's different.  When I read about someone pounding away for 30 mins -  it makes me (and my wife) cringe.  If that's not you - no worries - find a woman who's OK with who you are.  Quality sex isn't measured by a clock. 

Hope this gives hope to a few redditors out there!

Someone please help me.,1360,463,480,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1hnanx/my_girlfriend_doesnt_have_very_good_genital/,"So me [m20] and my girlfriend [f19] have been together for about two years. She is somewhat overweight, and she is very very insecure. This has obviously affected our sex life, and we don't really have sex that much. 

She is also afraid of vaginas. Her own, and others. She says she thinks they're weird and disgusting.

She doesn't really like anything but PIV sex, her performing oral on me, and me touching her through clothes, for various reasons. I've tried to go down on her before but she has never really let me. 

The point of this is that I've never really gotten a good look at the inside of her vagina before. That area is very .. closed? I guess? How do you describe female genitalia? Anyways.

So the other day she comes over and things are kinda getting going and she says before we do anything she wants to take a shower. She goes and takes a shower and she comes back and we get going. We have some sex and then I actually get her to agree to let me go down on her. 

I get in position and then I kinda spread open her vulva ... and it's freaking disgusting. There's this goopy yellowish stuff in all the folds, and I am getting sick just thinking about it. She squirms and tells me to not spread her open like that and that it feels weird. 

I don't say anything about it. I kinda lick and kiss around her legs and stuff. She's never had anyone do this so she doesn't know what it is supposed to feel like. I'm so turned off I don't know what to do.

She just got out of the shower. I imagine she cleaned down there. What does that mean? That she never cleans herself well and completely? That she doesn't know how? 

I don't think I can bring it up to her, we barely have sex as it is, and knowing her this will cause some serious damage. But I can't just let it lie either! I have rejected any advances she has made since, because all I can think about is her disgusting vagina. 

What do I do? I imagine people will tell me to talk to her about it; I imagine that that's the only real answer here, but what do I say? How can I possibly have this conversation with her? Even if I do tell her, then what? I don't really know how to was a vagina, but I have to imagine it's not THAT difficult. Uggghhh someone save me.

1361207935.0,899,self.sex,18rcih,[UPDATE] Valentine's Day Facial,1173,274,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/18rcih/update_valentines_day_facial/,"Last week I made a post (http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/18g7rm/my_boyfriend_has_been_begging_me_to_let_him_give/)
 asking you all for advice on how to receive a facial properly from my bf for a special Valentine's Day. I promised an update so here it is:


First off, I was really nervous when I made the thread because I initially thought the idea was kind of gross and slightly degrading in my mind. After finally receiving my first facial, I take both of those sentiments back. If there are any ladies out there that were unwilling to do this for their SO's, take it from me **it's not that bad!**.

Long story short, we got back from dinner, couldn't keep our hands off each other, and went at it for a while. If I come first, I usually let him keep working and pull out when he's ready and he just comes on my stomach or boobs. This time when he said he was coming soon and asked me where I wanted it I looked him in the eye while he was on top of me and said ""I want it on my face baby"". He literally stopped thrusting and gave me a very confused ""What? Really?"", and I said ""Yes, I want your come on my face tonight."" 

The look on his face was very hard to describe, it was like 5% disbelief, 5%concern that I was crazy, and 90% excitement. He said that me just saying that nearly made him lose it. I actually got turned on by the fact that he was so turned on. So I did what you guys suggested and told him I was going to get on my knees and wait for him to do his part. I was still a little nervous about it all so I laid out directions, that when he was ready he could pull out of my mouth and point and shoot himself, so I could just sit there and ""enjoy"" the moment.

When the big moment came he told me he was ready and pulled out, I shut my eyes and tried to make a sexy moan (but I think it came off as a dying cat instead). It felt like I was waiting for longer than I actually was, and even though I was still weirded out, all my negative feelings went away as soon as that first rope hit my forehead and went down to my nose. Another one hit my cheek and some drops hit my lips/went in my mouth. 

Luckily I didn't feel anything around my eye so after it was over I opened them up and looked up at my man. He looked like he was on Cloud 9 and kept telling me over and over again ""that was so hot"" or ""you look so hot"" or ""wow you're hot"". He looked so incredibly pleased and happy, I was just thrilled. He started smiling and laughing a little bit looking at his handy work, so that put me at ease and made me smile and laugh too. We cleaned up with a towel and some baby wipes, then just laid in bed.

Overall, it was an amazingly positive experience! I don't know if I would do it *every time* but I will definitely do it again and again in the future for him since I now know how happy it makes him and how totally harmless some come on the face really is. Thank you sexxit for your advice and help!!!

**tl;dr - Was nervous about receiving facial. Let BF do it. Made him ridiculously happy/turned-on which in turn made me ridiculously happy/turned-on.

Anyway, I wanted to try to make it up to her.

After a few nights of asking ""Want to have sex?"" and her emphatically declining, she finally decided to humor me for the few seconds it would take me to stick it in and finish up.

But tonight would be different. I had a plan. I was going to actually give her an orgasm. Though not with my penis, but with my mouth.

After some kissing and whatnot, I start sliding downward. She pulls my head back up.  At this point in our love lives, she's well aware of my inept cunnilingual abilities.  My tongue does nothing for her.  I cannot sustain a satisfactory rhythm for a long enough span of time to even get her close.

I'm adamant, though, and she finally acquiesces. I see her look up at the ceiling resigning herself to the sorry bout of oral sex she is about to endure.

But I have a secret. I remembered reading a while ago about a girl whose boyfriend had a cold and was treating his sore throat with a lozenge. Somehow, the menthol or eucalyptus or whatever contributed to one of the most intense orgasms she'd ever had.

I begin licking. No reaction, as usual. In fact, the silence makes it difficult to surreptitiously unwrap the Hall's cough drop I hid in my hand. But I do and I pop it in my mouth.

My breath feels cool in my mouth and I begin to smell the familiar medicinal odor. I exhale really hard a few times so the fumes can start doing their thing.

At that moment, my wife sits up. ""What is that?"" she asks.

""What is what?"" I respond.

""What is that smell? It smells like a cough drop."" She then adds, ""God, I'm all tingly.""

I really think I'm rocking her world. ""Yeah, you like that, huh?""

""No,"" she screams.  And she runs into the bathroom.

I follow her. She's standing with one leg up on the sink feverishly splashing water between her legs. She asks if I put a cough drop into my mouth. I say yes and she asks what the fuck was I thinking.

""It didn't feel good?"" I ask.

""No, my vagina feels numb."" she says.

I'm going to surf Reddit for a while until she falls asleep and then quietly crawl into bed. Then most likely avoid eye contact tomorrow. But let this be a lesson to you all.

So I (17f) have had this issue with my vagina for years and I've been to my physician a few times and even a specialist and neither ever gave me a real answer. They just gave me vague ways I could maybe fix it, gave me some steriods and sent me on my way. Basically what happens is I'll use the restroom and then my vagina just *burns*. It's immobilizing and has kept me up entire nights. The only way I've found to get rid of it is to drink a bunch of water, but even after staying hydrated all day it will still happen. I've come back negative for both UTIs and STDs and medicine just will not work. I can't focus in school or anything. I feel like it's taking over my life! My first time was not completely by my choice and he refused to wear a condom (I've been with 2 guys since. One always with a condom, and the other is my SO for over a year and he was a virgin when we met) so an STD was definitely a concern, but seeing as I've been tested and come back clean I don't think it is. Also, this has happened long before I was sexually active. I vividly remember an incident while at a zoo on vacation with my family where I couldn't even walk it hurt so bad, also I vaguely remember something like this around the age of 5 (when I was around 2-5 I had issues with my vagina growing shut and I would have to go to the doctor to have it torn back open).

I can't deal with it anymore. I feel like I can't fully live my life anymore. Does this happen to anyone else? What is it? Maybe if I had a better idea of what it could be my doctors could help me. I know I shouldn't go to the internet for medical advice but no one else can help me. Maybe if I reach more people someone will know

My wife of 7 years admitted to me that she cheated on me with her ""friend"". It only happened once and as I understand it was third-base action. She admitted this to me pretty much one hour after it happened but it took a lot of pushing for her to admit just how much happened. At first it was heavy make out in his car only, after seeing she is vague I pushed more and more until I think I got it all. This is a first time in our life together where she lied to me. I think I believe her final side of the story and after yelling, punching a hole through a wall and experiencing my first anxiety attack, I realized I have to forgive her. I simply can't see my life without her and last 7 years brought so much happiness to our lives. But the damage is done. She planted a seed of doubt in my mind. I can't shake it away. Is she really being honest now?

I just didn't expect it from her. She was the only person who I was positive will never hurt me, especially as she knows I have self esteem issues and over the years mentioned many times that forgiving cheating will be impossible for me. I am fairly confident that this never happened before. She looked totally shaken. Also, she is a horrible liar, so it would have come out. We were always so open with each other. Am I being a fool for thinking that?

We are becoming rather sexually open. We agreed that flirting is totally ok and we even entertained a thought of a threesome. One thing that we agreed will be a key is trust and never doing anything without the other one knowing.

She will never see this person again and wants to go to a counselor. She thinks this can make us stronger. Can it?

Sex is great between us when we get together, and there's no issues with him being shy in person or turned off by any form of dirty talk.

Issue I'm running into is I feel like I might scare him or come on too strong sometimes when I text him about coming over if I'm too blunt in what I want to do.  Perfect example was today.  He texted me to see if I was free over the weekend, and I asked him if he was free tonight to maybe get together tonight too since we haven't seen each other in a while.  He was responding as we texted a bit back and forth to try to see if we could work out a time (turns out it wasn't going to work because he had plans with his buddies).  My last text to him though I basically said that I want to see him b/c I'm incredibly horny and wanted him to fuck me.  No response after that, none!  

Now, it's not that I expected him to ditch his friends and come over, I wouldn't want him to do that to his friends no matter how horny I am, but a response to that text would have been nice!  It's not that he doesn't want to sleep with me either, since he's the one that tried to set up plans with me for the weekend to go out, and he's said how he can't wait to see me.  

So, I'm left wondering if it's possible I scare him?  Guys, do you not like a girl to be so blunt in what she wants?  I like this guy, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable, but I also like to express myself and be open, and I'm not shy about saying what I want sexually.  My friend suggested that a text like that puts pressure on him, so that's why he doesn't respond, but I don't know if that makes sense?

1361973477.0,871,self.sex,19brkq,Relationships and Previous Sexual Partners: Why the same repeated argument is irrelevant and the thing that women (in particular) are not understanding about this.,1429,558,610,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/19brkq/relationships_and_previous_sexual_partners_why/,"In regards to feelings of jealousy regarding a SO's previous sexual encounters: You have heard it, I have heard it. 

The most common response is that the SO has chosen YOU, and is with YOU now, and only the present matters. None of the previous partners matter because you have been chosen and are therefore the best (not at all true, by the way, but we'll get to that). While I understand this argument, and is an important thought when considering your overall relationship, people seem to be having a hard time separating this fact from what I believe to be the underlying concern. I shall elaborate, but not without a wee backstory first.

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years, and she has had quite a bit more sexual partners than I have. She told me almost right away, and it has never really bothered me that much. I know that a few of them had quite large ""members,"" were attractive, and all the normal stuff that normally causes this to become an issue. For me, it has only very rarely come to bother me. That being said, if I am stricken with a feeling of jealousy or insecurity, the notion that my SO has chosen ""me"" offers me very little consolation, for the following reasons:

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ARE JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE MALE INSECURITIES REGARDING THIS, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MALE. THEY ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN AS RATIONAL, SIMPLY TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

1. DEFINITIONS OF ""GOOD SEX:"" From what I've both heard and witnessed time and time and time again, women seem to have a much more global view of sex in a relationship. The ""whole picture"" of a relationship factors a lot more into their enjoyment of intercourse, as opposed to simply the mechanics of it. While a bigger penis (or let's just say ""the perfect size for her"") or a more coordinated lover might mechanically feel better, the sex is often deemed ""better"" overall with someone they care about or offers a better total package in the relationship. The problem with this is that sex can be a very primal thing for men a lot of the time, where you want to ""rock her world"" and be the ""best she's ever had."" You don't want to be ""the best she's ever had, because you make her breakfast and care about her and are a great friend who listens and cuddles."" Whereas ""Billy the Donkey Dicked Male Model/Fireman of the Year"" felt amazing and could fuck her in ways you never imagined, but was not very nice and never stayed the night. Men want to be Billy in the bedroom, because the rest just doesn't factor in as much to us. And while ""a Billy"" might have been in your SO's past, she'd still tell you that you're the best she's ever had because a.) she loves you and wants to make you feel good and b.) because in many ways the amount that she loves you actually DOES make sex with you the best. Unfortunately, it is the best sex in a way that - for whatever reason - is not in any way associated with a man's sexual confidence. So the argument that she's ""with you now"" can help for confidence in the overall relationship, but as far as sex (and I feel like this is where the majority of concerns come from), it doesn't feel good to know that there are so many different ways in which a previous partner could have satisfied her in a way you never could. The funny part is that you satisfy her in a way that a large part of these previous partners never did, but even though the way you satisfy her is likely exactly what she wants, it's the OTHER kind of raw animalistic pleasuring that we're intimidated by.

2. SHE'S WITH YOU SO YOU ARE THE BEST, FALLACY: Just because she is with you now doesn't mean anything. All of her partners in the past could have rejected her no matter how much she begged to be with them. She could have been with plenty of guys exactly like you, whom she ended up cheating on with guys like Billy. You could be filling a void in her life at the moment and having sex with you might be her way of keeping you as a friend that she needs right now. These are all very unhealthy trains of thought and should not be pursued, I just don't like seeing the fact that a SO is currently dating someone as proof that they're the best and should feel as such. 

3. THE PHALLUS AND ITS UNBREAKABLE CONNECTION TO THE MALE PSYCHE: Men have the penis, which can be a constant in a relationship that a woman can be stuck with. If you start off as friends, you fall in love, and then you start dating and have sex, your penis is the one she is stuck with. It could be great, it could be terrible. Very few decent people would leave someone they love because of the size of their penis. But the reality is that it could make for significantly worse sex, and the fact that she cares about you ""makes up for it."" That is out of your control and you have no idea how you measure up or how good it actually feels. No amount of cunnilingus or anything else matters to the average male self esteem. I love pleasing my SO through sex and all forms of hand and mouth play, but the only thing factoring into how good I feel about myself is how the PIV is. This is something that is very very difficult for women to understand because they think they have the equivalent of penis size in breasts. Dear women: This is untrue for so many reasons, but the main being that anybody can tell how big your breasts are right away. If I meet you, talk to you, woo you, and you have small breasts, there will be no grand reveal. I know about your small breasts and I don't give a shit. If I only like girls with large breasts, I only pursue women with large breasts. If you argue that there is some element of surprise to them, well then the more important part is that your breasts aren't all too relevant in the bedroom when it comes to intercourse. AA's or DD's, sex will feel the same. 4 inches versus 8, however, and you're in a whole different ballpark. Not to mention the addition of premature ejaculation or impotence. There is a whole array of male performance factors to which there simply isn't a female equivalent. (ya ya, you can take a while to get wet sometimes, boohoo and let's break out the lube).

/end

The point is, you are quite likely NOT the best looking, most well endowed, sweetest, or anything your SO has ever had. And your chances of this only decline as the number of previous partners increases. Unfortunately, you just have to get over it. The fact that you want to be the best in bed is just something you have to move beyond, and you just have to try to think like a woman in regards to how good sex can feel when you really care about a person. Do I believe that I am the best sex that my SO has ever had? Maybe, probably, considering I am her first serious relationship and her first real love. Am I the best sex she's ever had in the way that I care about? Probably not, but that matters to me a whole lot more than it does to her, and I have to get over it. In fact, me not getting over it and stressing is the only thing that really makes me ""underperform"" in bed to begin with. What is even worse is that I happen to be a pretty good looking guy with an average wiener and good overall package, I can't even imagine how difficult it would be coming to terms with all of this as someone dealt worse cards. It's a bitch, but you just gotta move on.

So I hope you enjoyed the insight into the male psyche, and why so many of the arguments that have been repeated against sexual anxiety of this kind are really not addressing the core issues. Women should be able to sleep with whoever they want, and as many people as they want, but these actions are not without consequence when it comes to this particularly irrational part of the male mind.

**EDIT:** Thanks for replies. I think that a lot of people don't fully understand certain aspects of my post.
* This is a post explaining what I feel previous posts concerning ""my SO's numerous other partners,"" didn't accurately address, which is the irrational insecurity.
* There are plenty of threads explaining why size doesn't matter, or what makes sex good for women. I understand this, and it's always good for men to hear, but like was mentioned before: that has very little to do with a man's feeling of inadequacy. Even if that monster dick from your SO's previous partner hurt her and made sex difficult, it is very difficult for many to not feel like ""less of a man"" because of it.


This is not a new concept in society:
Ezekiel 23:20 (a book written by the men with insecurity issues a few thousand years ago):
""She lusted after her paramous there, whose members were like those of donkeys and whose emissions was like that of stallion."" 
This is then painted as sinful and terrible and monogamy is reinforced because even back then, men suffered from big-dick envy and were intimidated. Men: thousands of years of irrational love for big peepees.

**Final Edit:** Thank you to those who took the time to read and understand my post, I really enjoyed reading everybody's comments. Those of you who get it know who you are, and I truly appreciate the conversation and sentiments. As for the rest of you, for some reason, it took a lot out of me to not defend myself against a good deal of these comments. Some were very sweet as per usual but simply did not understand what I was saying, and quite a few were very personally directed at me. This will be the last time I clarify this, and only because it diminishes my original post significantly if you simply saw it as a rant over my inability to feel secure in myself:
I AM IN A VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP. MY SEX IS GREAT, AND I HAVE ONLY RARELY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE ISSUES OUTLINED. In the same way that a lawyer for someone is not required to be associated with the crimes of his client, I see no reason to assume that this is ""a crippling problem of mine"" that you've just listened to me whine about, simply because I've addressed it. I am in many ways playing devil's advocate to the majority of the sentiments I've seen around lately, and ""representing"" feelings that a likely majority of us have had at some point or another. I did this because during moments when I *have* felt doubt or jealousy, it doesn't feel good to be told that you're okay for 'XYZ' reasons, when a lot of us are actually feeling them because of reasons 'ABC.'

Well, my boyfriend and I have been together about ten months now.  He's funny, smart, amazingly attractive, financially stable - everything I could have asked for. There was just one issue. He would  not go down on me.

Conversation after conversation would ensue, and sometimes even turn into an argument. Did I smell bad down there? Did he not like my clean-shavenness? Was he worried he was bad at cunnilingus? Was he afraid of messing up? Did he have a bad experience in the past? Question after question would arise and time after time I would get the same answer: ""It's just not my thing.""

Oh, I went down on him. Often, and with great pleasure. I love to suck cock and I've told him a million times how much I love it, the taste of his precum and the way he tangles his hands in my hair and his little moans. Turning him on turns ME on, and it was always a great way to heat things up really quick. And yet he never ventured down there on me. Before sex he would finger me, or rub himself on me, and once or twice he licked his finger and slid it in. But mouth never went below bellybutton. What on earth was I doing wrong?

I explained to him how much I enjoyed getting head, how it really gets me off and how I just know he'd be great at it (he has a very long, thick tongue and I love getting french kisses from him). And still he would stand firm.

Then, one day, it was about to be sexy time and I was straddling him, kissing him. He suddenly stopped me and said he wasn't in the mood, he had to go to work soon and he didn't want to get all sweaty before his shift. Okay, says I, cool as a cucumber. He looked at me and could see I was a little disappointed. ""I'll make it up to you tonight,"" he promised, a little mischief in his eye. Nice, I think. I am going to get railed later and it will be awesome.

That night, he came home and asked for a shower. Sure, says unsuspecting me. We take a long hot shower, touching each other teasingly, a stroke there, a kiss here. We get out and dry off. He takes me to our bedroom and lays me on the bed, naked, and we start kissing. First, little tiny kisses, that quickly turn into oh-god-I-want-you-now kisses. Just as I reach down and start directing his cock into me, he pushes my and away and starts moving down to my breasts. Okay, cool, a little teasing before entry, I can dig that. Fingers curled in his hair, I am twisting and moaning and doing all kinds of horizontal acrobatics. Then he starts kissing down my stomach. I literally almost panic. What is he doing. He never does this. Who the hell is this and what has he done with my beloved boyfriend. 

Then he moves to my inner thigh, kissing and sucking on it. He has literally NEVER done this and the feeling is electric. For some idiotic reason I try and stop him. ""What - what are you - ohhhh - "" He shuts me up with a bite. I love it. I love this. He doesn't even have to eat me out at this point. I feel ready to cum just from him being there. He finishes on my left thigh and moves his mouth slowly past my mound, and I feel his breath on my lips, and then he slides over to my right thigh and starts the work there. Today is the day I die. I am sure. I will die from how good this feels. Yep. Finally, he stops the wet kisses on my skin and just looks up at me with those gorgeous green eyes. He's grinning like an idiot and I probably have the dumbest look on my face - parts confusion and desire and need - and, meeting my gaze the entire time, he slowly drags his tongue from the bottom of my lips all the way to the clit. 

Sexxit.... I am not kidding... I almost blacked out. He was so amazing at it. As expected, his long tongue worked wonders - he could literally fuck me with his tongue. I came probably three or four times in fifteen minutes and they were the most satisfying orgasms I have ever had to date. When he finally couldn't take it anymore, he came up and kissed my and slid inside me. He finished in under a minute, from being so turned on he could barely stand it, and we just completely collapsed. I had a weird ringing in my ear. My legs were jello. And I love him.

He promised it wouldn't be a one-time thing, and I can't wait until next time. Sexxit, I am so so so happy and I really feel like if he is willing to do something like this for me (something he had never done for any other girl in the past, and there have been a few - not even his ex-wife) then he must really love me. Having sex with a girl is one thing, it could be any girl really. But willingly going outside your comfort zone to make a girl happy speaks volumes. 

Just wanted to share my happiness and thanks for reading :)) 

EDIT - A lot of people asked about my ""down-there"" hygiene. As I said I do practice good hygiene, I shave completely bare and I shower 1-2 times a day, always before work and usually after because I am a Marine and I get sweaty :( I always wear clean undies, etc etc. I have tasted myself before and I taste actually pretty decent, I've smelled/seen some nasty vaginas and mine is actually a very faint smell and just that slightly metallic-y scent. Sort of tangy tasting. Not particularly flavorful. So no, I don't think it was anything to do with my appearance or smell or taste. It was just his little issue - and now *our* accomplishment :D

No. 

I start giving him the hand job of his life as his gives me a look of ""What the fuck are you doing"". As he goes deeper into the conversation I take him into my mouth. At this point he doesn't know what's going on in his phone conversation. His hips jerk as I do my thing and I can see he is clenching his teeth. 

He's trying to cover up his laughter, he's pushing me away, trying to have a conversation with his friend, but can't. At one point his friend asks ""Are you with someone?"" after we both laugh uncontrollably. He calms himself down and gets back to his conversation and I get on him again. He pushes me off a few times, but I crawl right back up to him and carry on. I'm laughing my ass off while he's laughing and trying not to moan. He hurriedly hangs up and I collapse on the bed laughing my ass off, he starts laughing next to me.

I love when his jeans are pulled down just a little and the top of his pubes teases me above his boxers.  God that's delicious.  Makes me want to kiss them and make myself pull his pants down one inch at a time til I reach the prize.  One of my favorite things is his treasure trail.  The sexy, teasing, manly hair on his belly.  I wish I could sleep with my head there and my hand in his pants.

I love the way his body smells.  I could breathe it in for a lifetime and not get sick of it.  When he's gone for awhile I bury my face in his pillows, but it's not as good as when he's here and I put my nose against his arms or chest and inhale him.  The scent of eroticism, comfort, safety and love.

I don't relate to women who think cocks are gross.  I think they're fucking beautiful and amazing and one of my favorite things in this world.  I love everything about them.  How they look, how they feel.  I love when he gets hard holding me in bed and I can feel him pressed against me from behind.  I love watching him get hard, or feeling it in my mouth.  I love tasting the pearl of precum at the tip.

I love when he holds my hand over his cock while he jerks off and I can feel the force of his ejaculation against my hand.  I love when he comes on my body and it feels like molten lava on my skin and then I smell like his cum afterwards.  I liked when he licks it off my tits.

I love when we watch porn together and then end up so turned on we turn our chairs towards each other and he starts slipping his cock up and down the slit between my pussy lips until we both go crazy and I take him inside me.  I love the feeling of his cockhead starting to fill me up when we're still in that awkward position on our chairs so we just kind of tease each other, me full of just the head of his cock, until we have to get up and fuck for real.

I love when he licks my pussy til I come so fucking hard and completely that I fall down on top of him gasping and laughing and we're both so turned on and ready that I slide down onto his cock with no effort. I love blowing him before sex so that he's so turned on he can hardly hold back while I have him inside me.  I ride his cock and he keeps grabbing my hips to stop me, to let him last longer.  But I tease him right to the edge again and again.  Fuck, that's one of my favorite things.  Getting him so close inside me and so crazy he can hardly hold back.

I love when he cums inside me and there's the sudden burst of his hot, slippery wetness that fills me up and runs down his shaft and mixes completely between us.  I love when he pulls out and kisses my pussy full of his cum.  I love rolling over and going to sleep wet between my legs with him.

My boyfriend has always wanted to come on my face but I've always been hesitant to let him do it. I've always let him finish on my chest or mouth, something about him doing it on my face always seemed a little gross to me though.


Anyway, I really love him and we've been together for a few months now, so I figured I would make this valentine's day special and try it for once. Here are some of my questions though:

1.)What exactly am I supposed to do during this? Do I look at him while he's coming? Do I close my eyes? Do I open my mouth? 

2.) What is the best position to ""receive""? Should I be lying down, on top of him, on my knees?

3.) Do guys like it when you help them, or should I be completely hands off and let him do it himself? I guess it seems kind of weird to be directing a fire hose to spray water on myself.

4.) What am I supposed to do post-facial? Do I try to kiss him? I doubt he'd be into that. How long do I just stay there with his come on my face? What should I say to him? 

5.) Finally, how do I clean up afterwards? I feel like it would make my face sticky and crusty. Do you girls just take a shower immediately after? Also, for girls that have done it before, have you had any experience breaking out (e.g. - is getting come on your face bad for your skin?)


Sorry to ask so many questions but I really am curious and want to make this a special night.

Some of you stated that he just wasn't good for me, others insisted I find the root of the problem. After about a month of poking and prodding, he finally cracked. As it turns out, he did indeed have a terrible experience while receiving fellatio. The only other person he ever let go down on him did an absolutely horrid job. (Let's just say she thought teeth were good stimulants) so when he came, he became terribly sensitive and she just wouldn't stop. 
While he does enjoy post orgasm play, attacking his head with her teeth wasn't the most enjoyable experience. I suppose he was scared that I would do the same thing so he became reluctant to let me give him head for more than a few minutes. 
So about a week ago he and I went to a party together, we decided to go sleep in a different friend's house but we of course were way too intoxicated to drive, so we left his car there and planned to get it the next morning. He has a stash of condoms in his car, so he only carries a couple with him. While we were in bed, he realized we only had two, and we normally keep going and going and going so it was slightly disappointing. Then we crashed.
I opened my eyes and immediately started kissing his neck, soon we were rolling around getting all bothered and what not so I started unbuttoning his pants. I could see him getting a little tense so I took my time, and had him writhing and moaning in a couple of minutes. He told me he was about to cum so I deep throated him while he shot his load. I lift back up to see him breathing quite heavily, completely spent. He later told me how amazing it felt and how he can't believe he was ever reluctant to let me do it before.

I have no problem with this, but recently she has been staying at his place until the evening and sometimes comes home pretty late.

Last week she stayed at his place for a movie and came home at midnight, I greeted her and she was acting normally but this changed when I started to seduce her hoping to have sex with her. 

She told me that she was tired, not in the mood etc. but after a while of exchanging kisses she agreed to have sex with me. She tried to stop me from doing any foreplay but I insisted and started to give her oral sex.

This is where it gets weird: the smell and taste were pretty weird, in our 4 year relationship with at least 2 times of oral sex sessions per week I had never tasted or smelled that on her before. The taste was bitter and I could notice that she was uncomfortable as well, the smell was not her usual vagina smell, it smelled... Different... I stopped and had sex with her anyways.

Is this a sign that she had sex with the guy? What the hell should I do?

TL;DR After arriving from her friends house my girlfriend [28] had sex with me [25], I gave her oral sex and noticed she had a weird taste and smell to her vagina.

Edit: I'm going to confront her tomorrow. Just had a rough time right now and decided to drink something to calm my nerves. Might post a follow up tomorrow.

I'm from Europe so circumcision isn't overly common but I've slept with a few guys and I know the difference between cut and uncut. 


I've been seeing this really nice guy for a while and we are very open about everything. We were lying in bed a few days back and I noticed that he was circumcised. I'm always curious as to why people get snipped over here, when it's not a religious thing, so I asked him why his parents chose to have it done. He looked surprised and said that he hadn't been circumcised. I disagreed with him initially, without thinking, but then I saw the look on his face - sort of confused and shocked - so I stopped. I laughed it off and muttered something about being mistaken and him always having a hard on and didn't mention it again. 


I did however start paying a lot more attention to his penis and have concluded that he is definitely circumcised, there's even a faint scar. I'm not really sure what to do with this. Should I talk to him about it, I mean is it important that he knows? And should it even come from me? I know that if it were me I would want to know and I feel like I'm keeping something from him by not saying something. I know he's not lying either, the surprise was genuine. His mum died when he was young so it is possible that it just never came up. I've never been in this situation before so any advice would be great.


EDIT: Thanks everyone who responded. I've decided to have a chat with him about it. I think he will be ok with the whole thing eventually but it just might be a bit of a shock, especially coming from me. Feeling less worried now that I know there are others who were in the same position as him.

I'm sure you've all read a ton of ""my first time"" stories, but I'm super excited about mine and I figured you guys would be the perfect people to share it with!

When I was fifteen, I bought myself a purity ring and swore off all forms of sex until marriage. That was what both my church and my very Christian mother taught me was the right thing to do. Being a virgin on your wedding night was supposed to be the greatest gift you could give your husband. 

After I started college, I realized that never having any sex until marriage is a bit ridiculous and unreasonable. Maybe oral sex could be a possibility eventually (although at that point I had never done more than kiss a guy), but I still imagined saving my PIV virginity as something special for my wedding night.

Then (at 20), I met this amazing guy who made me feel great about myself and I trusted him when he said he wouldn't pressure me into having sex. Slowly he encouraged me to explore new things. He was the first guy that got me shirtless, first guy to finger my lady bits, first guy I experienced oral sex with. He made me realize that sex doesn't have to be actual intercourse to be meaningful.

I flew to his house to visit this weekend. After sharing so much and feeling so close to him already, I decided I wanted to experience this next big step with him, too. Friday night, we had sex for the first time. It was amazing. Everything about the timing felt perfect and I knew I was ready. We did it again that night and four more times that weekend, and every time was fantastic. I couldn't be happier with my decision to let go of what I thought was important in the past. I don't feel any shame or regret, and I can't wait to see him again to have more sexy times!

EDIT: Just to answer a few questions, I decided I was ready and wanted to have sex with him about a month ago, and I took the ring off then. Nothing dramatic, just personally symbolic of my decision. I started taking birth control then, to be prepared for my trip. We also used condoms every time, so it was definitely safe sex.

I approached her about sex this evening, she said no &amp; I lost it. What she doesn't understand is that physical intimacy is very important to me. I've tried to talk to her about it one on one, have suggested counseling, you name it. The lack of sex is causing serious issues for me, in how I view her &amp; our relationship. It has caused me to back away from her &amp; as a result we don't have the close relationship we once did.

I'm seriously considering divorce over this. Am I being an irrational ass about this, or is this a legitimate reason to end a marriage? We have no children, FWIW.

What's interesting is that even if we'd had sex right before going to the store, she would remark how she's still hot for me, or she just wants to leave and have sex in the car, things like that. Passionate kisses in the peanut butter aisle.

It's started to become a pattern now, which I'm enjoying, and she seems entertained by. When asked about what could be prompting her grocery-store-sex-drive, she just responds with ""I don't know, it might just be because the kids aren't here and I get to spend time with you, I really don't know.""

Not too long ago, we had some hour-long hotness in bed and then decided to go to IKEA. I start to pick out a lamp and she just quietly blurts out ""I'm such a slut"" because apparently even IKEA is a turn on.

I've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now, and it's come to light that she slept with somewhere between 20 and 30 other men. I had only slept with two girls before I dated her, and it feels very uncomfortable for me to know about her history. Knowing that she's slept with so many other men makes me feel like I might be inadequate compared to some of the other men that she's slept with. It makes me feel insecure about my penis size, my ability to perform, and my attractiveness. I also worry that her promiscuity in the past might mean that she would cheat on me in the future.

I was reading through the ""Girls, what are the best things about a having a vagina?"" thread and was pissed off that no-one knows guys can have multiple orgasms in one session just the same as women can. You just need to learn how to disassociate your orgasm from your ejaculation. After that you can start learning how to chain them, one after another for as long as you like. I've posted this before but it really annoys me that more people don't know this so I decided to share it here again, I consider it a biannual Public Service Announcement.

A year or so ago I found a book called the multi-orgasmic man while sifting through the torrents. A lot of it sounded like eastern religious claptrap but it also contained some very useful techniques invented by the Taoists, who used sexuality as part of their religion. This might take a few weeks before you can manage it properly by the way. Just be patient. If you can't manage it after a month then I recommend you torrent the book for further instruction: It has plenty of helpful exercises and techniques.

Now, the first thing you need to do is get to a point where you can last a decent time while masturbating, say 10-20 minutes. Keep a clock near where you normally jerk it and try to break your record each time. If you find yourself coming too quickly, slow down, breathe slower (lowers your heart rate), think of un-arousing things and be sure to keep your muscles relaxed. Also, stopping for a minute or less when you get close will help you stretch out the time and get your dick used to taking a long time to reach orgasm. Try to notice the different stages in your own arousal, especially when you near orgasm.

You will also need to become aware of your kegel muscles and strengthen them. To do this, when you are taking a piss try to completely shut off the flow of urine for a few seconds without using your hands or glutius maximus muscles. Try to do this about 10 times over the course of emptying your bladder. Now that you know what to tense you can exercise it one the commute to work of whilst checking e-mails or whenever. This should have the added benefit of making you able to last longer during sex.

Okay, once you can last 10-20 minutes it's time for the next part. Start stimulating your perineum while you go (the patch of skin between your balls and arse). You don't need to jam a finger up your butt, stimulating it through the skin near your ass works just as well. You only really need to throw in a couple of minutes of this near the middle of your run. When you get near orgasm, get as close as you can without actually ejaculating then stop for a few seconds before restarting slowly. Learn exactly how far you can go before you know you will ejaculate. Do this multiple times in a session, as many times as you can before losing control. At some point in one of these runs you will notice your prostate/kegel/perineum contracting rhythmically, like it does when you ejaculate except without anything coming out of your penis. Concentrate on that feeling, lay a finger lightly on your perineum, whatever to make sure you know when it is happening. What you have just done it disassociated your orgasm from your ejaculation. The first one won't feel like much. The second one in each session will be more intense. The third more intense still. Each successive orgasm within the same session will be more intense than the last and there is nothing stopping you - save physical exhaustion - from having as many as you like. My current record is nine in a row. You may also find that when you do finally ejaculate that your cock will stay hard allowing you to keep going should you wish, though may only happen about one time in ten.

There is also nothing stopping you from learning how to do this during sex, though it is more difficult to manage. Anyway, good luck. I never did finish reading The Multi-orgasmic Man, so there may well be other nuggets of wisdom in it. Do tell me if you find any.

I think nothing of it and keep thrusting away until the car creeps past the occupied houses and starts slowly coming down towards us.

That's when I see it.

Police lights.

Being the calm, collected, and rational gentleman that I am, I politely and promptly alerted my car companion of the potential danger by ejaculating ""SHIT IT'S THE POLICE GET YOUR PANTS ON"" as I fumbled around in the dark for my own. My boxers seemed to think this was an excellent time to play make-every-hole-not-the-hole-you-put-your-legs-in, so I kicked them under the front seat and pulled my shorts over my latex-armored warrior. Being the thoughtful chap I am, I immediately looked over to see how my comrade was getting along and if she required any assistance.

""I can't get my pants on"" she says looking at me with a face stricken with raw animalistic terror. The police car is now very clearly headed straight for us. ""GET YOUR FUCKING PANTS ON,"" I politely suggested. ""I CAN'T!!!"" she replied. I became astutely aware of how astronomically loud our breathing had become.

We were abruptly and shockingly washed in a wave of white light ten-thousand times brighter than the sun streaming in through the window. I see my girlfriend gazing wide-eyed into the light of death and give a half-hearted wave accompanied by a weaker smile.

The spotlight is gone.

I wouldn't realize it until later, but the officer was now pulling up behind us - he was giving us more time.

Sometime in the next fifteen seconds my girlfriend squeezed her torso through one of the leg holes of her shorts and stuck a leg through each of the remaining holes. From a distance, it could pass as normal. In the reflection of the rearview mirror I saw a smaller flashlight slowly bobbing towards us. ""WE WERE JUST TALKING"" I coach my soon-to-be prison mate, making sure we were prepared for any interrogation technique they had planned for us.

The police officer - cool as a cucumber - strolls up to the window and motions with his flashlight to open it. I smile and nod as I tried to remember how windows work.

""Good evening!"" he greeted joyfully.

""H-h-KAH."" I found my voice. ""Hello officer.""

""You guys just talking?"" he winked knowingly. 

""Y-yes sir"" I smoothly retorted.

""Good, good. I'm just running my routine neighborhood checks."" He flashed the light up to my girlfriend and smiled. ""You guys have a good night.""

""Thank you sir"" we replied in unison - our hearts beating fast enough to have become one continuous indistinguishable pounding.

We rolled up the window and sat in complete silence as we watched him hop back in his car and drive away.

The level of endorphins in my system at this point was probably enough to categorize me as legally high. We looked at each other and just burst out laughing and blurting out fragments of sentences about how we'd almost gotten caught. Which, of course, led to us kissing each other madly and then fucking again. Talk about incredible sex - try fucking in the backseat of a car after having Police Officer bro give you the A-okay.

No other way to say this. It's over.

We could go from casually talking about it to arguing about it and it always came back to same thing: he just doesn't have a sex drive. Someone in my first post suggested watching porn can kill libido, so when I asked him (gently, in a way I hope did not come off as accusatory), he said he did not do it often but had been doing it recently. I know this is normal, but it hurt. To me it seemed what little horniness he musters up, he turns to his computer rather than his own girlfriend.

I also brought up the future: if we were married, would his sex drive still be this low? After a long excruciating silence, he said yes. Nothing would change. We broke up right then and there.

I'm not gonna lie, I feel like I've been hit by a train. I hate throwing away every other aspect of our relationship, but I can't marry someone who will never want to make love to his wife.

Also, turns out the blister was from too much friction the first couple times we did have sex. That's the bright side, I guess.

1282655941.0,797,self.sex,d4tz6,Dirty Talk 101 - Talking Dirty to a Girl,1039,242,490,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d4tz6/dirty_talk_101_talking_dirty_to_a_girl/,"I wrote this lighthearted guide after reading MySexxitAcct's ""Failed Dirty Talking 101"" post.  Dirty talking was abruptly introduced to my sex life a few years ago, and it's been *incredible*.  This guide is based on what I've learned and what's worked for me.  But it would be awesome if everyone shared their own ideas and experience.
    
    
**Why talk dirty?**

In the years following my recovery from the awkwardness surrounding the loss of my virginity, I spent a great deal of time searching for that magic physical technique, the one that would transform me into a Sex God (or at least a minor deity).  Like many young men I figured there was some magic penetrative geometry, bodily arrangement, or a special set of places and timings to press or rub that would activate the orgasm cheat code.

A few years ago, failed by the internet and a small library of sex books, a very special girl taught me a very special lesson (though I do suffer from a very sexy learning disability).  I haven't seen her in a long time but her lesson has stayed with me through all of the lovers I've had since.

Dirty talk is the closest thing to the ""magic technique"" I've ever found.  Do it right and she'll come faster, harder, and maybe even more times.  And she'll leave your bed thinking you're a bit more of a stud then you actually are ;)

**But when I talk dirty I sound stupid!**

Yeah, you do.  But guess what?  You look stupid too.  We all do, have you seen the faces we make during sex?  Watched other people have sex outside of porn or the movies?  Sex looks like it was intended to be a practical joke on humanity... quivering sweaty meat bags shooting DNA at each other... but that hasn't stopped us from doing it.  Don't let self consciousness stop you from talking dirty because, after all, the only thing that sounds stupider than loud sex is silent sex.

**What do I need to know first?**

Her limits.  But, before that:

Most women want to be dominated and objectified... in the comfort of a safe consenting setting with a man they trust and care about to some degree.  This is a statistical law, not an absolute one, so exercise caution, but I've found it to be overwhelmingly true.

Additionally, she wants to see herself as a sexual creature, one that's so overpoweringly irresistable that you just *have* to have her right this fucking instant.  The things you say when you're talking dirty will reflect these two concepts.

**Ok, so where are her limits?**

All over the place, but that's the real key to success and we'll get to it in a moment.  

First, figure out some baseline limits.  Maybe she's down with being called degrading names, maybe she's not.  Maybe she hates the word ""cunt""... if so, don't use it (not for a while, at least).  These are simple things, when in doubt err slightly on the side of caution.  You can always escalate things tomorrow or next week.

**No, let's go back to the ""key to success"" part...**

Ok, so this is probably obvious by now, but let's just pretend like I'm clever and came up with something insightful.

The key to success is saying the right thing at the right time.  The limits of what is acceptable/appropriate will move all over the place during the course of a sexual encounter.  Telling a girl you're going to ""fuck her little pussy raw"" when you start snuggling up on the couch might be fine with some chicks.  With others it will break the mood, and still others it will get you slapped.  But telling her she smells good while you're pounding away and she's on the edge of a screaming orgasm will probably stagger the flow of things in its own way.

**Enough of your bullshit, just give me some stuff to say.**

Fine, fine.  

There's an old saying that dirty talk is just saying ""What I'm going to do to you, what I'm doing to you, and what I just did to you.""  This is a great starting point, but with a little thought we can be more engaging.

Let's break it up into three regions of the dirty-talk spectrum: tame, dirty, and filthy.  The following are just examples, be creative!

*Tame* - these warm things up during foreplay and as foreplay transitions into sex.  Be suggestive, be flirty.  Tease and taunt, push and pull.

* *God you smell/look good*
* *I've been thinking about you all day/I know you've been thinking about me all day*
* *Fuck, girl, that is a hot ass/stomach/waist*
* *I can taste you on my lips already (when you're about to go down on her)*
* *Fuck, you've got me all worked up*
* *Guess what?  You're mine tonight*
* *I can't even tell you the filthy things I've been thinking about all day/thinking about doing to you*
* Look how hard you've got me/Look how wet I've made you
* I'm gonna make you scream, you sexy girl/bitch/thing

*Dirty* - these are for while you're going at it, the slight awkwardness of foreplay is gone and the hormones have taken over

* *Oh yeah, take that cock baby/bitch*
* *Fuck, that feels incredible.  Yeah, you're my sexy little girl/bitch/whore/slut*
* *Who's my sexy little girl/bitch/whore/slut?*
* *You like that?  You like that cock in that tight little pussy?*
* *God, you're so sexy, you drive me fucking crazy*
* *Fuck girl, I know you've been thinking about getting fucked/fucking me all day*
* *You're a bad little girl/bitch/slut.  You know what happens to bad little girls like you?*
* *Yeah, work that pussy/ass.  Good girl, just like that.*
* *You like it when I fill up that hot wet little pussy?*

*Filthy/aggressive* - some girls want this the whole time, others not at all.  Most girls will like some amount of filthy, especially near climax.  It must be complemented by physical agression (spanking/slapping/hair pulling/rough handling/hard fucking) in order to not seem out of place.  If you want to test the waters my suggestion is to try some filthy talk while she's getting close to orgasm.  If it speeds her along... success!

* *I'm gonna fuck that tight little cunt till you come all over my cock*
* *You like that you filthy fucking whore/cunt/bitch?*
* *I'm gonna blow, I'm gonna fill that pussy up with cum!*
* *You dirty little bitch/whore/cunt, you're MY dirty little bitch/whore/cunt*
* *I'm gonna fuck you till you scream my fucking name*
* *I know you want that cum in you, you dirty little whore/bitch/cunt*
* *That little pussy's gonna explode all over my cock*
* *You wanna feel it?  You wanna feel me cum in that pussy?*

...and so on...

**Well I guess I can give it a try... any final thoughts?**

Yeah, two.  First, your voice is very important.  Talk in a low,  calm voice.  Remember, you are a fucking sex superstar, your voice should ooze supreme confidence.

Second, as you get used to talking dirty, get her involved.  Girls like to say dirty shit too, and they like being dominated.  Making her repeat things back to you fires on both cylinders.

You: God, you're such a dirty little bitch.  You know that?

Her: *Yes!*

You: Wrong, you're MY dirty little bitch.  Say it!

Her: *I'm your dirty little bitch!*

You: Louder!

Her: *I'M YOUR DIRTY LITTLE BITCH!*

Now, giving some credit to the whole black guy stereotype, he was very large. But I have a very shallow vagina because I am quite short, so that wasn't what caused me to finally orgasm.

When he thrusted he used circular motions. He would push in tilted to one side and pull out tilted to the other. Instead of just thrusting straight in and out like guys usually do, he changed where he was hitting inside of me and it made me go crazy. Don't know if you ladies have ever had an orgasm that made your legs continue to twitch for a few minutes after, but it was amazing.

I may just be bragging about getting laid, but honestly I think more guys need to thrust like this. The whole straight in and out thing gets boring.

Seems I need a TL;DR here... Everything went very well. we talked, and I told her that what she said hurt. She apologized, and we talked about how to make it better, and she told me about an experience she had when she was young that made her take emotion out of sex. We had a great night of sex following, and im confident that things will get better. All in all it became a huge turning point for both of us, in terms of sex and communication. 




The long part:

First of all, I just wanted to say thank you. I woke up this morning to over 100 replies, all of which were extremely understanding and helpful. You guys fucking rock. I never would have expected the kind of feedback that I got. So... Thank you all.


This certainly isn't the end of our growth, but with such a positive response, I felt I owed you guys an update. I know many of you were curious as to how it would turn out, and I wanted to give something to anyone who might find themselves in my position.


Last night was everything that I was scared it would be, and everything that I was hopeful that it could be. It was the most awkward, terrifying, embarrassing, and unsettling moment of my life. But it was also the most fulfilling, honest, open, comforting, and heartfelt discussion I think I've ever had with anyone. We already had plans to go to the bar to celebrate her new job, so the casual setting, and drinks made things a little easier (for me atleast). My self-esteem was at an all time low going into it, and I could barely look her in the eyes at first. I mustered my courage to explain to her how bad what she said hurt me, and she apologized sincerely. She explained that she never wanted to hurt me, and she was sorry for the way she put it. My only concern was that she apologized so much, that I felt like I was putting the blame on her. I did my best to not accuse her of anything, and just get to the bottom of it instead. We talked about what we could do to make me last longer, and what we could do to make her come faster. She admitted to me that she is incredibly submissive, and wants to be told what to do. And I told her that it makes me feel good to have my SO just want do things sometimes, as it makes me feel wanted. That I feel like if I tell someone to do something, they're doing it because I said so, not because they want it. We promised each other to work on things, communication being the most important. She said she would initiate, and give foreplay more for me. And I promised her that I would try to be more dominate for her, telling her what I wanted and what felt good. We also talked about me wanting to go for round 2, but me needing her to help. I explained that after I come, I need her to stay into it to get me going again. If she acts like she's done, then I won't be able to get it back up. She said she didn't know that, and thought I needed time so she always just stopped and hoped that I would be ready to go again on my own.


On a much more serious note, she told me of something that happened to her when she was 8 that traumatized her for life. She explained to me that every time she has sex now, she mentally checks out from all emotion, and just shuts her eyes and focuses on nothing but what it feels like. She told me that she thinks this is why she has such a difficult time reaching orgasm, and cried on my shoulder a bit. She told me that she does this because if she thinks about it, she can't help but to think about what happened to her when she was little, and it makes her have a nervous breakdown. She also explained that when she has sex, she doesn't feel anything when its slow. She said it ONLY feels good when its fast and hard. I asked her if she would be willing to work on not mentally checking out with me. I asked her to think about me, and look at me, and touch me, instead of just think about sex. She said she would try.


After the bar, we went back to my house and sat in bed for a little while talking about nothing. Just trying to get over the awkwardness, and getting to a place that we could laugh together again. We laid in bed and kissed/talked for a few hours (Way too late honestly, because now I'm falling asleep at work. But so totally worth it).


This is where a huge turning point for us (And me personally) came in. She initiated. She began sucking/licking on my ear and neck. Kissing down my chest, and rubbing on my body. Moaning slightly and kissing her way down stomach. She gave me the most amazing blowjob I have ever had, and I was confident enough to tell her what felt good, and tell her what I wanted her to do. Then... the most amazing thing, and the most awkward thing ever happened back-to-back. She had been sucking on me for a while, and she hit this spot with her tongue. She swirled her tongue around the head for a second, and then out of nowhere deep throated me. This immediately made me orgasm, but I didn't cum (Atleast I think I did. I've never experienced anything like it) My face and hands went numb, and my head started to spin. It felt like the most incredibly powerful orgasm that I've ever had, but nothing came out. The awkward part, is that when she sensed that, she tried to go deeper. Well... When she went deeper, she choked herself badly and had to stop. But it was okay. We laughed about it for a second, and I laid her down and kissed on her, and fingered her asking her what she liked. I found that the G-spot is definitely where its at with her, and had her going wild.


I guess it was a mixture of alcohol, relieved pressure of performance, and the fact that I had already had an orgasm of sorts. But I had no problems holding back from coming. I was 100% in the moment, and completely immersed in what we were doing. At one point, She seemed to check out like she says she does. I grabbed her hands, and put them on my chest, and told her to look at me. She opened her eyes, and looked me in the eyes for the first time since we've been seeing each other. It was an incredibly emotional experience for both of us, and she immediately seemed to get into it 100% more. She even went so far as to grab my hips, and slow me down. It felt like she was just caught up in the moment, staring into my eyes and enjoying the way I looked and felt. I still didn't bring her to orgasm, but she seemed absolutely satisfied when we were done, and said that is the first time she's ever enjoyed slow sex and that she could feel everything.


This has been a very long winded response, but I'm very excited about the way things turned out. I never would have believed it would have turned out the way it did, and I couldn't be happier. Hopefully I'll be able to last on round 1 like I did last night, although I doubt it. At very least, I see this being the beginning of a much more fulfilling sex life for both of us.

He said he was going to the bathroom when I asked his gf where he was going, I thought that was odd because we have an empty bathroom down stairs. So I just thought he was embarrassed and wanted to use the bathroom upstairs so I just left it alone. About 10-15 minutes later I spilled something on my shirt, I went up stairs to change and caught my friend in our bedroom rifling through our clothes hamper with a pair of my SO's used panties in his hand and a pair partly in his pocket. I didn't really know how to react so I asked him to get out of our room and go down stairs. He begged me not to say anything to his SO or anyone else at the party, I didn't want to embarrass him in front of everyone so I just let it go. I talked with my SO later and she said she has been missing panties for quite some time, it seems to happen whenever he is over. I asked  a few other friends and they have said the same thing about missing their panties. The friend that has been stealing the panties has a GF and they have been together for 3 years now so I don't want to ruin that, they are both great people. Any advice for this situation? Things are kind of awkward now, I am not sure what to do next. 

***UPDATE***

So his GF has been informed along with the other people I know of who have had missing undergarments. It is pretty clear he will not longer be hanging out with my social group, but he will still be coming over this weekend to talk. The friendship is definitely over and he said he will go to a therapist, it sounds like this fetish got out of control. His GF knew he had a panty fetish but did not realize how far he took it out of the bedroom. I got a lot of great advice and will update again after I talk to him this weekend but I was surprised by the amount of people who advocated violence against this man. I am not sure how many of you have had 14 year friendships but it is not something I take lightly. I did not feel physically threatened by my friend and did not have a reason to assault him, being a ""man"" does not mean you need to attack other people when something goes wrong. All of the PM's I got about my GF needing a real man to protect her was a little disappointing. This will be corrected he will not be in our circle of friends anymore and I hope he gets the help he needs to move past this. His GF will be staying with him to help him out. Thank you to the people who offered good advice. 

***FINAL UPDATE***

So me and a couple friends had a good talk with the guy yesterday afternoon. He will be going to therapy in a couple weeks and we will let him come and hang out with again when he feels he is up to it. We also think we found out what started this all, back when we were 15 we both dated the same girl in high school she used to like to make you wear her panties when she slept with you. It was an odd kink of hers but apparently it was his first time having sex and it seemed to stick with him. He has been doing this since he was about 15-16 years old and has a huge box of panties, I really don't know how he has hid this box from his SO for so long. We went with him to throw the box out and hopefully he can get the help he needs. We told him its fine for him to have a fetish but when he starts stealing from other people that is taking it to far.

It generally feels good, but he has been coming after only 5 minutes or so, whereas he used to last 15 or 20. It made me feel like he just wanted to get it over with.

The other night I allowed him to be rough. It was my birthday and and I enjoy roughness within reason. But I know that pushes his buttons too, and while I hoped it would help him last longer, he came after only 3 or 4 minutes. So, I decided to finally talk to him about it.

I prefaced by saying that it might hurt his feelings, but I had to say what I wanted to say. I asked him if something was wrong and told him how I felt. He said it was the exact opposite, he'd been coming so much faster because I was doing everything just the way he likes, and he had a hard time holding back.

Since he hadn't gotten me a birthday gift yet, I asked for a vibrator (which we will shop for this weekend). He joked that I was dissatisfied with his performance, which I told him I was not. I explained that our sex was usually focused on him, and every time I felt like I was getting close, he would be done. I told him we need an opening act for the main event, so maybe we could both get there again.

Overall it was a productive conversation, and since I've been hanging out here long enough, I knew what you would say if I came here first.

That said, lets get to the meat of the post (and hopefully my age comment will give more context).

While there are exceptions to all of this, and I fully understand that speaking in generalities can get dangerous, I was wondering about the how/when and why of some of the changes in sexual trends I have witnessed over the years.

1) When and why did no body hair become popular and almost de rigueur?

2) Pulling out and cumming all over things (especially facials)?  My wife and I do the pull out thing, but firstly its for ease of clean up for her, and secondly it does have some erotic benefit. Facials, however, are off the table.

3) Increase in anal (this could be just perceived and anecdotal).  It sure seems like everyone is doing it.  We have fun with it, but not with the regularity that *it appears* that those half our age do.

4) Changes in the preferred (again speaking in generalities based in current culture) male form.  It seems that we have gone from big burly men that looked like they could lay brick all day, chop down a few trees, hunt and gather, and then build a barn before bed, to men who have a more boyish/feminine appearance.

There are others out there, and if anyone else thinks of some of the trends that have changed, please post the up and lets discuss those too.

The td;dr: it was awesome!! Way better than what I thought it would be. Even though I was nervous, they both made sure to have me relaxed and they made it great.

Ok, the details. I have been casually seeing the first girl for about 2 months. It is a FwB relationship. She is bisexual. I told her I have always fantasized about a 3some, and she mentioned a friend of hers is also bisexual and she would love to bring her over some time. Yesterday, she did. They have had threesomes together with other guys, so they were way more experienced than me.

I was quite nervous. Specially it was my first time to meet the new girl. I didn't know if my friend would get jealous, and I was worried about paying too much attention to the new girl. I didn't know where I was supposed to come... etc. I told them both it was my first time ever doing this and I had no clue what to do basically. They both laughed and told me I was in good hands.

They started by both kissing me at the same time which honestly turned my knees into jelly and I fell into the bed. They both got on top of me and continued kissing me and each other. Things got hot and heavy from there on. We did lots of different things. I started by giving oral to the new girl, then to my friend. Then they both gave me oral at the same time (hot!). I gave oral to one while the other gave me oral, gave oral to one while the other was riding me... etc etc. It was really really great.

The best part... not the sex part, but the part afterwards. I got to cuddle with two beautiful girls at the same time. I like how when girls are talking, the dynamics are very different from how men are talking. They both talk at the same time, interrupt each other, don't wait for each other to finish sentences... etc. The energy level is just way higher. I was there in bed cuddling with both of them, and they were both talking at the same time, telling me stories, laughing, interrupting each other... etc. One girl would be talking to me, while the other is adjusting to cuddle closer. One girl would cuddle closer while the other touched me all over. This was heaven! I couldn't help but keep thinking how lucky I was. Definitely one of the best days of my life lol.

Hi so I'm typing this quickly because I don't want anyone to walk in on this and see, so excuse the typos. I'll just cut to the chase, the title says it all.

I'm 16 and Indian, if that provides any sort of insight. 

I've got some of the basics down pretty good, but on others I'm a dunce... I know that sex isn't bad, masturbation is healthy/okay/nothing to be ashamed of. I know about slut shaming and stuff. I have a friend who's like a big sis to me and we talk about this stuff sometimes. She helps a ton, but she's going away to college next year (she's a senior). So, into it then:

- **Random sex and hookups:** I know that STD's are prolific, but I'd rather not contract one (duh). How on earth am I supposed to bring this up during one night stands and hookups? Like, ""Hey baby you feel so good mmm I like that, btw do you have an STD?"" I'm assuming condoms protect against a lot of this...

- **Birth control:** Can I get on the pill without my parents knowing? Next time I have a regular doctor's appointment, when my parents leave the room so she can poke around in my vag, can I ask her about putting me on birth control? I think my mom would be okay with this anyway, but I want to make sure I have my options in case I'm totally wrong. 

- **Condoms:** how do I know what size to buy? Should I buy a couple and keep different sizes? Is it a one size fits all sort of deal? I can see men getting insulted if I wip out a condom and it's too small, or the awkwardness that will ensue if it's too big...

- **Masturbation:** right now I get off with a shower head or by fingering. I can't buy a sex toy, and even if I had one, it wouldn't stay hidden because privacy doesn't exist here. What discreet objects can I use? I'm pretty good on this one. 

- **My mysterious vagina:** How do I know if my vag smells? How should I clean it? How do I know if my hymen's broken? Where is my g-spot? If I stick my pointer finger straight in (maybe 4 inches) I hit this little walnut thing that has a dimple in the front, is that my cervix? Aforementioned girlfriend says it may be a g-spot, so I tried flicking it, but it felt really uncomfortable. When I flicked it I sort of felt it in my butt, if that makes any sense. This is kind of gross. 

- **Starting the convo:** So it's not like my parents are not sex positive. We just don't really talk about this stuff. My mom's a liberal counselor. I could see myself talking to her about this later on. We just got out of a big fight recently about other stuff, so now it's a little raw, but still. How do I start? 

- **Underwear:** How do I tell my mother/father that I want to wear cuter underwear? I haven't bought bras in ~2 years and I need new ones. All my panties are blood stained from my period and they're from the kids section or they're what you'd call ""granny panties"" You can see the panty lines through some pants. 

I hear someone coming, so that's all for now folks. Sorry if I grossed you out. 

[EDIT] False alarm, one more thing:

- I'm a squirter/gusher, and I freaking release a dam every time I go at it. Is this normal? It's not pee, I've checked. The first time I fingered myself, it felt like a water balloon had exploded or something. I freaked the f*** out because I thought I pissed myself. I cleaned up, ran to the bathroom and started frantically googling ""pee when sex"" on my phone. Then I hid in my room until morning, and did a load of laundry ""because I couldn't sleep"" (dad was like, what, okay, stop, go away. Safe). Now I just ignore the juices and use a towel, but then I thought it was pee, so I didn't want to leave it on my bed. 

- Random s/o to all the girls who post pictures of their vaginas here on reddit. I spent many an hour meticulously studying these vags on my phone and comparing them to my own to ascertain that I was not abnormal. 

- How do I get hair out of my buttcrack?

1362583364.0,771,self.sex,19s167,Ready to cheat on my wife. (X-post from /r/offmychest,1274,503,557,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/19s167/ready_to_cheat_on_my_wife_xpost_from_roffmychest/,"Been married for 7 years, have had sex with my wife maybe 7 times in the last 2 years, and have more or less given up on revivng our sex life. For our preschool-age son, financial reasons, and for the fact that I still do care for and love my wife and have an otherwise live-able, often even enjoyable, relationship, I'm unwilling/unable to consider divorce.

My wife's sex drive is gone, she admits, and has shown that she really has no interest in regaining it. My sex drive, on the other hand, is still very much alive and I've finally come to the place where I'm open to exploring the possibility of getting my sexual needs met extramaritally.
That pretty much sums it up. But the record-breaking mass of text below explains the details.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, and I've finally decided to put my story out there not so much in hopes of advice on how to improve my situation, but more just to get it off my chest, and maybe I'll find some people who can understand the way I feel, who are or were in a similar place... And just maybe some twisted bastard somewhere in the world will tell me I'm not a terrible person.

So, why have I given up on trying to improve things with my wife? Perhaps the biggest reason is simply that she doesn't want to have sex. At all. Everything else in her life is more of a priority. Even though she knows how badly I crave physical intimacy and sex. She has no sex drive any more, and no longer gets enjoyment from sex, although I've tried to make it enjoyable/ pleasurable for her. On the rare occasion we are in bed together, I try to spend time on foreplay, (although kissing is often forbidden because she's afraid either one of us might have a cold germ of some kind and might pass it on to the other--you can imagine that after oral, absolutely no kissing is aloud) I go down on her and try to give her pleasure so that it's not just about me (it also serves to lube her up since she has never had a very wet v, anyway) but she always ends up saying ""thank you, but that's enough"" and tells me politely to go ahead and get on with it. After which sex itself is often painful for her.

And she's not interested in trying to figure out what's wrong. Consulting a professional, seeing a counselor? That would be mortifying, according to her. Absolutely out of the question.

So, when the stars align and all the conditions that must be met before she will consider sex are actually met (both of us showered and thoroughly cleaned, neither one with the hint of a cold or illness of any kind, fresh sheets on the bed, etc.) and often after I've stooped to hinting that it's been over three months and I'm starting to go a little crazy, only then will she come to me when she's ready, tell me she's sorry to have kept me waiting with a shy smile on her face and let me have sex with her body for as short a time as possible--while I pray that it's not painful for her this time.

How the hell did this happen? Our sex life was nothing like this when we were going out. What brought about this fucked up situation?
As you can imagine, it's complicated.

I was a virgin till I was 25 due to a combination of hardcore christianity, the tendancy to fall for girls that weren't interested in me romantically (friend zone, anyone?), high standards and perhaps most of all, lack of opportunity. So I had sex for the first time (if you can call it that) when I was 25, but my girlfriend at the time (who was also in her 20s) had an extremely small/tight v and I was inexperienced and didn't know anything, could only get the tip of my d inside her, didn't want to hurt her, was still in the throes of christianity, thought pre-marital sex was wrong, did it anyway, didn't use a condom, felt guilty about it afterward... all in all not a good experience. Had a few more fumbling sex-like experiences with her, but nothing approaching normal...

And then I moved to Japan. Eventually christianity started to fade, but I was still not interested in casual sex (partly for fear of being terrible at it and embarassed), and bad luck and high standards kept me without sex for three whole years. How is that possible? Well, I didn't want to have sex with anyone I wasn't in a serious relationship with. I didn't want to lead anyone on, or break anyone's heart, either. But finally, at the end of my 3rd year in Japan, I managed to hook up with a girl I really liked.
As luck would have it, this girl turned out to have serious issues in bed. No oral, for one, and she was not helpful at all when I had trouble staying firm (remember, this is like the first real borderline normal sex I'd ever had and I was like 29!). But anything was better than nothing at that point, and after all, this was a girl I'd liked for a while and was genuinely attracted to, so I was willing to put up with almost anything. Turns out she wasn't. She dumped me after 5 or 6 weeks citing cultural differences and broke my heart.

A month and a half later, I met my wife. She was not only cute, fun, thoughtful, and caring in general, but in bed, too! It was mindblowing. Whenever I had trouble keeping it up, she would switch to oral till I was ready to go again. She was happy to try different positions that were new to me. Sex was fun! And what's more, she came easily, so I didn't need lots of stamina to satisfy her and we were able to enjoy simultaneous orgasms almost every time.

I couldn't imagine finding someone who fit me better sexually, and in other respects our relationship was extremely satisfying, and without going into everything else, ultimately after about a year and a half of going out I decided to ask her to marry me.

But before actually getting married, I made it very clear to her how important sex and physical intimacy were to me. Without religious convictions anymore I felt bitter about my sexless adolescense and 20's and needed assurance from her that our sex life wouldn't dry up after getting married and having kids. I'd had two close friends who ended up in sexless marriages and I talked with her about how I wouldn't be able to handle that. I'd talked to another American guy who'd married a Japanese girl and he, too, was bitter about the paucity of sex in his marriage. This guy told me that once Japanese girls have kids, they totally switch their focus onto their kids and sex is no longer important to them. I thought that this was probably an unfounded generalization, based soley on his own experience, but I was concerned enough about it to talk to my then-fiancée, and she again assured me that she understood how important sex and physical intimacy was to me and that it was important to her, too, and there was nothing to worry about.

She changed a lot after we got married. She became fearful of many different things, and easily emotionally distressed, and actually started yelling and screaming at me for making mistakes that set her off. At first I couldn't take this new side of her seriously. It was at such odds with the caring, cute, fun, outgoing girl I'd thought I'd married. But, I came to terms with it eventually, after crying like a baby and dying a little bit inside. I did my best to support her and care for her. I still do. Trying to ride the line between avoiding things that make her fearful or angry and letting her irrational and exaggerated fears overrun our lives completely. But perhaps my enthusiasm has waned over time, and I'm not always as fun and easy-going as I used to be. And again, she would never be open to seeing professional help. She doesn't trust counselors or other mental health professionals and would rather die than have anyone outside the family find out how messed up she is.

Infants in Japan don't usually get their own rooms. In fact, they often sleep in the same bed as their parents. My wife breastfed our son and woke up seval times a night to feed him. There was nothing for me to do to help, but I was being woken up, too, so when our son was about 4 months old my wife and I decided that the best solution was for me to sleep in the guest bedroom with the dog. Over time I became very attached to having my own space and my own bed. She was understandably not in the mood for sex anyway, and I was free to take care of myself just about every night alone in my own bed. And now that we have our own house, we have separate bedrooms. She sleeps with our 5 year old son who hasn't learned to sleep on his own (not really unusual in Japan) and I really really need my own space, not to mention the privacy to be able to masturbate whenever I need to.

We tried for a second child for about 2 years after our son turned 2, to no avail. Unsure of how good of an idea it was to try for number 2 given my wife's emotional instability, but we didn't want our son to be without siblings. We gave up in the end and it was probably for the best since some trouble (now gone) with our son's intestinal tract (resulting in small amounts of blood in his poop, chronic constipation and frequent abdominal pain) had exacerbated my wife's germ-phobia and emotional volatility, not to mention she was extremely stressed out about the OBGYN visits associated with infertility treatment.

While trying for number 2, sex was on a schedule, but as soon as we gave up on number 2, sex faded out almost completely. I've tried talking to her about it. I've tried reminding her of what we had talked about before getting married. About how I need physical intimacy including sex. I've gotten angry about it a couple of times. And sometimes she's apologetic and promises to make it more of a priority, but it never pans out. She often gets up at 2 or 3am to put another load in the washer/dryer, that's how important the laundry is. But sex? 10-15 minutes of physical intimacy without sex even? Not important.

So, she's not interested in sex. It hurts. It's dirty. She doesn't want to get help. She promises that we'll get around to having sex ""soon"". And when I head off to bed, she smiles, says good night, says how much she appreciates all my hard work for the family, then turns on the TV to watch a program she recorded earlier.

Now, I've looked around at /r/deadbedrooms and it seems like there are basically two approaches to rekindling the sexual flame with a low libido wife. Be a floor mat, get trampled on with a smile and bend to her every whim. Or be a caveman, and wow her with your testosterone. Neither approach holds any interest for me. I'm not a doormat, but I do my fair share already: cleaning the bathroom and shower, taking care of the dog, taking out the trash, spending time with my son, helping him get ready for preschool in the morning, taking him to preschool, helping with breakfast, helping with the dishes, helping with the laundry. Not to mention she's a stay at home mom. I work 2 jobs to support us with maybe one or two days off each month. I like my jobs, so I'm not complaining about that, but basically what I'm saying is that I do my part. And not like a begrudging asshole. I'm not always a happy prancing elf, either, but nobody is. And god knows the caveman method would never work, either, since cleanliness is of the highest priority for her so spontaneous touching/kissing is out (did you brush your teeth?), and trying to step up my manliness, be more assertive about my desires etc. has only made her angry in the past.

Don't get me wrong. Our relationship is often very pleasant. Usually, in fact. I may be a sething ball of sexual rage inside, but I dare say I'm pretty good at not letting it show. I'm not perfect, but I've learned to avoid a lot of the things that piss her off. And, there are times that I still get a glimpse of the wonderful person I decided to marry and start a family with. Sometimes more often than others, but still, it's something.

I've seen her at her worst and almost surprisingly I still find her attractive. And despite what I may have led you to believe, she does make very strong efforts to not let things bother her so much, to not get so angry, to be more cheerful, etc. I should add that she is usually a really good mom, as well.

So this may not be the marriage I signed up for, but it's not exactly a living hell, either.

Except that I want sex badly and she doesn't want it at all.

But she also doesn't want me to have sex with anyone else. And that just strikes me as kind of ridiculous. Natural, yes, but still ridiculous.

So, yeah, I've got my eyes open. Not that I expect to find anyone to cheat with. Me and my standards, I doubt I'll ever find someone I find attractive who would be happy with just some occasional clandestine sex that I wouldn't be worried about contracting an std from. It may be the most hypocritical thing in the world coming from someone talking about cheating on his wife, but I really don't want to hurt anybody. So, one thing I'm not going to do is lie about being married. I'm not gonna give anyone the false hope of a long-term relationship when like I said at the beginning, divorce is not an option for me.

There's always prostitution, right? Well, yes and no. My impression of the sex industry in Japan is that it's not as safe as it needs to be to be worth consideration. There are erotic massage places and blowjob bars where the girls don't use any kind of protection. And most sex workers don't service foreigners, anyway. So, yeah. Not an option.

So, anyway. That's where I'm at. Anyone else out there know these shoes?

1338640289.0,768,self.sex,uh3hl,How I suck a new partner's cock for the first time (detailed description of techniques you can try with your partner),1127,359,290,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/uh3hl/how_i_suck_a_new_partners_cock_for_the_first_time/,"I’ve been asked quite a few times to detail how I go down on guys. That’s an incredibly hard question to answer though, since it’s different every single time. I make a special effort to make sure I don’t just rely on the same thing every time I’m with my partner, as that can get boring for both of us. Obviously, I know what really feels great for him and what works the best (different for every guy), so I make sure I add that in by the end, but it’s fun to always experiment and try new things. That said, if I’m with a guy for the first time and just exploring to see what feels the best for him, I do tend to stick with a pretty general ‘format’ so to speak. So I’ll do my best to outline what I do here so you can maybe try it with your partner to help change things up and help learn some new things that he’ll absolutely love. And on another note- feel free to tie your partner up and/or blindfold him while doing this. One last warning- not every man likes to be teased like this. So if you find that he’s squirming too much or you can tell that he simply isn’t enjoying himself, then get to his penis a lot faster. It’s all about paying close attention to how he responds as well as feeling comfortable enough to actually ask questions and talk about it. 

So you start off with your usual making out and stripping off of the clothes. Once you’re both good and naked, you lie him down on his back (the bed tends to be the most comfortable) and straddle his body. Start by just kissing his lips and then move out to other areas of his face/ears and down his neck. I personally love the 2 steps forward, one step back ‘technique’, which should be pretty self-explanatory. So you move from his face, to his neck, to his chest, then you go back up to his neck before going back down to his chest then his nipples, then back up to his chest, etc etc. I honestly do this all over his body. I try to hit as many areas as possible. I also don’t totally stick with the same pattern, as that gets a bit too repetitive and predictable. So I’ll be at his navel and pop back up to his lips, for example. Some really great spots to hit on most guys are their obliques (the sides of his abs and almost around to his back), the hipbone area, pubic mound and inner thighs. As we all know, every guy is different though, so you may be surprised when you come to another part of his body and he starts to really moan. 

I keep doing this and come as close to his penis and balls as I can get without touching them and keep moving downward. Many men love it when you suck on their toes, but that totally depends on your own comfort as well as his. Inch your way back up, again, coming incredibly close to his package but then go up past it. Eventually you start circling in towards his penis.  When I finally get there, I give a ridiculously slow, long lick with the flat part of my tongue (like licking an ice cream cone) all the way up from the base of his shaft to his coronal ridge (I’m avoiding the glans at this point). I alternate those with super quick, sharp flicks of my tongue all over his shaft. I’ll then lick my hand to get it really wet (his shaft is already pretty wet, as I don’t swallow any of my spit... I let it all come out on his penis) and I start stroking his penis as I move my mouth back to his balls. Here I’ll either pop them straight into my mouth, while I swirl my tongue around and over them while moaning or I’ll start by just licking the balls and swirling my tongue around them while they’re outside of my mouth before popping them in.  Some guys hate ball play and it can actually be painful for them, so make sure you’ve asked beforehand. If you’re not comfortable with asking, then start really tentatively with light licks before putting his balls in your mouth and pay attention to how he responds.

I use my hands a lot while giving head. It’s all about playing with the speed, the grip strength and where you stroke the shaft. So experiment with ridiculously slow strokes to a more rapid speed, as well as using a tight grip and a grip that he can barely feel. Alternate between just stroking the shaft; just stroking the glans; and stroking right from the base of his shaft all the way up to the tip of his glans. While stroking, make sure you use a gentle twisting motion with your wrist. Once you’re happy with the amount of ball play (which you return to throughout the blow job), then move your head back to his shaft. Slowly lick from the base up to the glans while looking him in the eye and smiling. Many guys absolutely love eye contact during oral and that evil, naughty grin in your eyes makes it that much more fun. Remember, you need to be enjoying this too! 

This is when I stick my tongue out and circle/swirl it around the glans (still making eye contact with my partner) while wrapping one hand around the base of his shaft. I then bring his glans into my mouth while I keep swirling my tongue around and around on it. I gradually move my mouth lower and lower down his shaft while still maintaining that tongue movement. You’ll eventually reach a point where your tongue won’t physically move that way anymore, which is when I switch to just moving the tongue side to side while pressing it up against his shaft as I move my mouth down on it. If you have a bad gag reflex, only go as far down as you’re comfortable. There’s no need to try to force yourself to deepthroat. Once I’m all the way down though, I tend to stay there and just move my mouth up and down about an inch or so, starting slow and then building up pace. Then I very very slowly bring my mouth back up to the tip (where I tend to repeat everything I’ve said in this paragraph!). 

As I build momentum, I start to use my hands more. By now his penis tends to be totally soaked in my saliva, which means my hand(s) easily glide up and down. If you’re not able to give really wet blowjobs, definitely use lube that you enjoy the taste of. I tend to grasp his penis with one hand, attaching my thumb and forefinger to my lips so it feels like my mouth and hands are one unit as I slide down and up his shaft (still using the twisting motion with my hand). My other hand tends to reach down and play with his balls as well as putting pressure on his perineum (if your guy likes anal, then this is when you can pop a lubed-up finger in). Another thing I like to do is open my mouth and lips wide and try to make it down as far as I can on his shaft without really touching it. Once I’m all the way down, then I close my mouth/lips tightly around the shaft and pull up. I do that multiple times before surprising him with pursing my lips really tight and letting his glans enter my mouth like that, and go all the way down to the base of the shaft. At that point, I open my mouth really wide and pull right off him without him getting to feel it. I do that multiple times before allowing him to feel my lips staying tightly around him on the way down and up (and that’s when I return to the technique I discussed at the start of this paragraph). 

I also like to take breaks where I can sit up and just look at him and smile. While doing that, I use both my hands on his penis (which, again, is super wet) and stroke him up and down with both hands stacked on top of one another (although, that depends on the length of the guy’s penis). I gently twist my hands in opposite directions.... just enough so he gets the stimulation, but not hard enough so there’s any risk of actually pulling the skin and hurting him. I’ll then use one hand to stroke him while the other hand goes over top of the glans and uses a similar wrist-motion to squeezing out the juice of an orange on those old-school juicers (lightly though!). I’ll also take my palm and press it gently down over top of the glans before lightly stroking upwards, drawing my hand up with my fingertips down, right until my fingertips leave the glans. However, this can be too intense for some guys.

 Keep in mind that whenever my mouth is on his penis, my tongue is constantly moving and pressing up against his penis. I also make a special effort to hit his frenulum as much as possible, as that tends to be the most sensitive area on the penis. I also return to all these different techniques I’ve mentioned as the session continues, including returning to “ignoring” the penis and stimulating his other body parts before resuming the blow job. I tend to like edging guys, so once they’re about to orgasm, I back off and make the stimulation much less intense so they don’t end up cumming. I do that multiple times before finally allowing them to orgasm. Remember though- orgasm isn’t the goal here. The goal is to give him as much pleasurable stimulation as absolutely possible. Have fun with it, enjoy yourself and make sure that he reciprocates on you either in that session or in one soon after!

THROWAWAY TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT!

On Saturday we hosted a Halloween bash at my flat. I thought maybe I'd chat up a girl and get lucky as I've been going through a dry spell. I talked with a few girls, most of them were pretty but I wasn't exactly feeling it - until my mate's school friend walked in. 

This girl walks in the room and makes a beeline for me. She's amazing looking. She's dressed as a zombie but you can see she has beautiful features, caramel hair, big green eyes, fit body. She approaches me and jabs me in the chest with her finger, ""Say good-bye to your kneecaps chucklehead!"". At first I have no idea what she's talking about due to being bowled over by her directness until I remember it's a reference to my costume (A Scout from TF2). We spend the rest of the evening chatting about videogames. She turns out to be really funny and bright. By the end of the evening the liquor is starting to take hold of me. While she's speaking I try to make a smooth move to hold her hand, but she doesn't respond. I try again when I'm interrupted by her friend asking to go home. She quickly gets up and tells me that she might stop by sometime (my room-mate is her friend) I say that would be nice and expect never to see her again.

Fast forward to last night. I'm on the couch watching some movies when I hear a knock at the door. I'm a bit peeved, thinking it's a roomie who has forgotten their key again and open the door to find zombie girl. It takes me a moment to recognize her without the makeup, but she turns out to be even more stunning. So here she is, at my door, with a big bottle of rum in her hand. She pokes me in the chest again and says ""Hey Scout!"". I'm about to run my mouth, thinking she's come to visit me, when my roomie pops up from downstairs and greets her at the door. Apparently they've arranged a sleepover. I spend most of the evening in my room, doing everything I can think of to get her off of my mind. Eventually curiosity gets the best of me and I venture downstairs. Huddled around the television are the rest of my roomies and the zombie girl playing what appears to be a Star Wars drinking game. I make like I'm going to the kitchen when one of my drunken roomies invites me to sit and play with them. How could I say no?

For the rest of the movie zombie girl makes no attempt to interact with me. No eye contact, talking mostly to her friend, I figure the connection we had the other night was just the alcohol talking. Eventually she gets up and excuses herself from the room, saying she'll be right back, I assume to grab a smoke or hit the toilet. I go to pour myself another drink (rum and coke) when I fumble and the soda spills all over my hands and sleeves. My room-mates laugh and I make off swearing into the kitchen. When I get there I see zombie girl pulling a drink from the fridge. She looks at me concerned and asks what's wrong, I feel totally stupid and embarrassed and quickly make my way over to the sink. ""Oh you know, soda, all over myself."" With the same concern she makes her way over to me, ""No worries, let me help."" I naturally assume she intends to grab me a paper towel and am surprised when she grabs my wrist. She takes my hand and proceeds to take my entire ring finger into her mouth from the base and suck all the syrup off from the base up, as slow as possible. I'm shocked into silence and start to stiffen up. She reaches the end of my finger and gently strokes my index finger, ""Does this one need cleaning too?"". I think about a million things I could have said, ""The rest of me sure does"" or ""All of them do"" but all I did was nod like an idiot as she proceeded to suck off the rest of my fingers. At the end she smiles, ""All clean"".

She leaves me at the sink to return to the drinking game and I take a fe minutes to breathe and let my dick go soft again (believe me, it took a fucking while). The entire time I'm trying to rationalize the situation in my head. Why didn't I just kiss her? Or fuck her? Something! Finally I return to the game and it's the same situation, she makes no eye contact with me, no winks or sly smiles, keeps mostly to my roomie. I start to think that maybe it was all a dream, maybe I'm crazy, maybe finger sucking someone clean is perfectly normal to her for some reason and there was nothing sexual meant by it. 

By the end of Star Wars we've run out of rum and roomie suggests another run to the liquor store for more rum and more snacks. Being four of us (2 other roomies and zombie girl) my two room-mates decide to leave, one grabbing the snacks and the other paying for alcohol. My heart starts to beat faster at the idea of being left alone with her. After they leave she starts a very normal conversation with me about board gaming, no mention of what transpired earlier. I start to tell myself to forget about it and focus on the conversation we're having. Non-chalantly, as we're discussing our love of Scrabble she says, ""I know a great game to play"". The tone she says it in leads me to believe her next sentence is going to be ""Monopoly"" or ""Yahtzee"" but instead she quickly moves on top of me and presses herself against me so that her lips are grazing my ear.

""Let's play a game"" she whispers in my ear, and I'm instantly hard. ""It's a race..."" and she starts to dig her hands into mine as she grinds slowly but forcefully on top of me. She leans back, my arms still pinned and looks me dead in the eye, ""Do you want to have a race?"". I must have nodded because she smiled but honestly it felt like I just laid there. She let's go of my hands and starts to quickly un-do my belt. A small part of me is worried about our additional room-mate in the basement, but I'm way too turned on to give a shit. She shuffles back so she's sitting on the edge of my knees and slides her hand underneath wrapping it around my dick. ""Let's see if we can make you come before our friend get's back? Ready? Set, go.""

She drops her legs between mine and flips my dick out of the top of my pants. She looks straight at me and starts to lick slowly up the shaft of my dick. When she gets to the top she envelops it in her mouth and slides all the way down very slowly, so that the entirety of it reaches the back of her throat. She comes back up slowly and begins to work the shaft, all while tonguing at the head of my penis. She's staring right at me so intensely and starts a small moan each time my dick goes further and further into her mouth. I was terrified of coming too fast, I didn't want it to end. I was hoping she'd change her mind about the race and I could take her upstairs, it was driving me crazy. The moaning got louder and I had to look away or else I'd come. I put my head back on the couch so I was looking up at the ceiling and pressed my fingers to pinch the bridge of my nose (don't ask, it helps). She immediately sat up and mounted me again, one hand stayed on my dick, pumping it, and the other one grabbed the hand on my face and pinned it down again. She pressed herself against my ear again and started to talking to me while pumping me, ""Are you going to come for me? I really want it, I want to taste you."" At this point I'm going nuts and figure I might as well if she wants it so bad.

Before she can move back down I hear the front door open and close, I can hear my room-mates down the hall removing their shoes. Zombie girl slides off of me and tosses her feet up on the table like no big deal while I desperately try to do my pants back up and pray to God my boner isn't obvious.

They roomies come back in and it goes right back to the way it was before. She sticks to her friend, cracking jokes with her for the rest of the night. The second bottle of rum is done and we all say our goodnights to each other. I lay in bed knowing that she is right next to me in my roomie's bedroom and start dreaming up what could happen next. Maybe she'll sneak into my room and fuck me or something! I start getting really excited and wait and wait and wait....and nothing. I start thinking about how I just laid there before and didn't respond to anything she did (other  than going crazy in my mind and getting hard). I start to wonder if maybe I've turned her off and now she doesn't want me - maybe it was a misunderstanding?

I used to wax everything, and it's not that I don't like that look.  But, as a full time grad student now and trying to watch my finances, a $60/month expense for waxing is not something I can really afford.  I've tried shaving in the past, but my skin is sensitive and it just causes more irritation than it's worth, so that's out.  Instead, I use a beard trimmer to keep it shortly trimmed.  To be clear, I'm not unkempt down there with hair all over, I do routinely trim to keep it clean.

The other day he asks me why I don't wax, and I explain about the money and ask if it's a problem.  He says it is since he really hates hair, and it's a turn-off.  I ask why he never said anything before, which he had no response, and then he says that most guys would find it gross and I should ""take care of it.""  Now, I understand people have preferences, so I'm not mad he has a preference.  But, I'm hurt of how he chose to express it.  

Also, he hates giving oral and never does it (something he told me before he even saw me w/out clothes, so it's not that me having any hair is the issue), which has been fine since I prefer giving.  Instead, the only contact he has with my ""gross"" pubic hair is with his fingers (if he even uses those) or his dick during sex.  And, I'll note, he does no trimming at all, and is himself very hairy down there, but I still go down on him all the time.

I said I had to go and left, and now I'm wondering how to even respond to him.  Am I being unreasonable to be hurt by how he expressed this?  Is it that bad that I'm not fully waxed that it's gross if a woman has trimmed pubic hair?  I can see it being more of an issue if he gave oral, but he doesn't.  Honestly, I'm debating ending things already from all this, but I don't know if I'm being too sensitive.

TL/DR: Waxing too expensive as student now, so I trim it neatly. Guy I'm dating, who hates giving oral, tells me it's a turn-off and most guys would find it gross.

I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (27) for two and a half years.  He’s the most considerate man I have ever met and we get along swimmingly.  He makes me laugh and I think he’s brilliant and I see myself spending the rest of my life with him.  Everything is pretty picture perfect.  Except for sex.  He has never really been able to go for very long before coming.  On average, it had been about five minutes.  Lately, it's been pretty much immediate.

The first year or so, we did not have sex very often.  I was used to having sex four or five times a week with my previous boyfriend, but I never said anything.  When we would have sex, it would last for about five minutes and then he would come.  I started to realize that we didn't have sex often because he was embarrassed of this.  The embarrassment kept us from having sex a week or two at a time.  After about a year, I finally said something to him (about how often we had sex) because I was starting to think it was because of me.  It was then that he admitted his embarrassment.

After we finally talked about it, we bummed the amount of sex up to two or three times a week.  Everything except the actual sex is great.  He knows that he doesn't last long so the foreplay is usually about 20 minutes long.  He fingers and plays with my clit, he goes down on me, and I go down on him.  And for the little time that it happens, it's great.  He hits the spot.  Lately though, the actual intercourse part has been getting even shorter and shorter.  As of late, he's been getting more and more frustrated with his inability to last that he has pretty much been coming right when he gets inside of me.

I love my boyfriend to death.  And I intend for him to be the last man I have sex with.  But I am feeling seriously sexually frustrated.  When he goes to the bathroom to clean up, I secretly take out my clit vibe and make myself come a couple of times before he gets back.  But I need to have my boyfriend be the reason I come more often. 

When I try to get him to talk about it, he gets embarrassed and really upset with himself.  We don't really get anywhere with it.  Does anyone have any advice on how we can last longer or ways that I can suggest things to do to make himself last longer without offending him or hurting his pride?

TL;DR: I love my boyfriend and he satisfies me in every aspect of sex except for the actual intercourse part because he's only been lasting about 30 seconds before coming.

We had some great sex afterwards and theorized about what could possibly have turned her towards paeleophilia, and all we could think of was the pink Power Ranger and her pterodactyl.

The biggest downside I see in this, is there is no way to not be weird about it. Some people like to pinch each other's butts in public, subtly, to get the mood started for later. If I make a creepy roar at my wife in public, it'll draw too much attention. I don't often care what other people think, but I might have to draw the line at stalking her around the grocery store pretending I'm an extinct reptile.

* I want to try kinky/rough sex what should I do?
* I want my partner to shave/wax...
* How many partners is too many? Should I tell them my number?

All of these are things you should be discussing with your partner. I'm not by any means saying you should not also ask them here, it's important to get an outside perspective sometimes but just know that it will almost always come around to r/sex telling you that you need to be more open and more honest with the person you care about. The fact that you even think to ask shows us you care and that is about the best place you can be. 

For anyone asking questions please take the above as it's intended, not as a way to say: *""hey you should talk to your partner you dummy""* but as a way to say: *""we are always here to be your sounding board, you will hear 'talk to them' quite a bit, not because we are being lazy and it's easy to type but because it is the best tool you have when it comes to shaping your relationship to how you want it""*

It's a great place to work, and barring a few creeps, I enjoy helping people find exactly what they're looking for without making them feel uncomfortable or judged.

I find that a lot of people come into the store not really knowing what they're looking for, and a lot of women (and men, whether their purchase is for their lady or themselves) will often ask me which vibrator in the store is the best, or what novelty items I would suggest. It's no mystery to you fine folks that everyone is different and not everyone's body reacts the same way to stimulation, but I think that a lot of people get nervous in the store or feel like they can't ask questions because it's ""weird"" or makes them uncomfortable.

So, I just wanted to write up a little something about buying sex toys and other adult products in a store versus online. 

NUMBER ONE! Do not feel like the people behind the counter are going to judge you. The reason I work in the store is because I am very, very comfortable with sex and while I personally might not be into a particular fetish or have experience with whatever gets you off, I believe that if you enjoy it, if you're not harming anyone or yourself, and you're being safe about what you do, then you have every right to do whatever floats your boat. The worst thing I will ever say to someone asking me advice is that I'm not familiar with it. If you want to know how comfortable a certain strap-on is, or aren't sure which vibrator you want, go ahead and say ""Hey, could you help me?""

""What's your best toy?"" This is the hardest question for me to answer without knowing what kind of stimulation you're after. If you want a good vibrator, I need to know what you like or don't like. Categories at my store are as follows: G-Spot Stimulation, Hard Vibes, Soft Vibes, Clitoral, Bullets, Rabbits, Anal, Glass, ""All-Purpose Massagers"" (Like the Wahl or Hitachi Magic Wand), Dildos/Dongs, Fetish, and Mastubators (Fleshlights/Tenga/pocket pussies). And each section in my store has tons of products to choose from, with different intensities and functions. That's a lot to choose from and can be really overwhelming for some people. It's another reason why you shouldn't be scared to ask for some help. Once you narrow down what kind of stimulation you're looking for, be it the wall-shaking power of the Magic Wand or a gently buzzing bullet, it's a lot easier to find the right item for you. And if you find something you think you might like, or you're torn between several items, I'll put batteries in them or I can open the products up and let you check them out before you commit to buying them. If you were shopping for clothes and the store had a ""no returns"" policy (like adult stores generally do), you'd make sure you really liked those jeans and you'd try them on before purchasing, right? Unfortunately, you can't really ""try on"" most items in the store, but you'll at least get a good idea of whether or not a product is for you if you see it outside of its plastic packaging!

Sometimes I get a customer that's looking for DVDs and doesn't know where to start. We have hundreds and hundreds of titles on hand, and the racks are literally filled. If you're looking for a feature film, something with a story that you want to watch with someone else, let me know and I'll walk you to the ""couples friendly"" section and tell you what I can about certain titles. Or if you want gay or bisexual porn and you can't find it, don't be afraid to ask! I don't really watch it, but I can tell you where to find the DVDs and even tell you which ones sell better than others. 

Lubricants. So many lubricants... I don't think I could ever sample every lubricant out there, it's amazing how many different kinds there are and how different each of them are from the next. There are two main kinds, water and silicone. They each have their own benefits, and each brand varies from the next. If you don't know if a lubricant has glycerine in it or you don't know whether or not a particular silicone lubricant is going to be safe for your toys, pipe up! I'll find out for you. If you think Astro-Glide is gross and you're tired of using it but you don't know what you should try instead, I can make personal suggestions or I can hang out with you by the samples and try to guide you in the right direction.

It's really that simple. Just ask for some help! My store is very, very busy. But before anything else, the customer's needs come first, just like any other customer service job. I wish more people would ask questions or speak up when they're not sure about something. I hate to think someone is going to go home and be dissatisfied with their purchase or be turned off to the idea of coming to the store. It's such an open and safe environment, and we want you to take advantage of that and be comfortable shopping with us. That's all, folks.

1371217266.0,745,self.sex,1gc4z5,Have you ever subtly offered a view of your body?,1028,283,648,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1gc4z5/have_you_ever_subtly_offered_a_view_of_your_body/,"I am male and I have surprisingly often enjoyed the vicarious thrill of catching a peek up a skirt in a non sexual setting to see panties, or very rarely, no clothing down there at all. More common is seeing down a blouse or a loose pajama top to admire a naked breast or pair. Sometimes its see-through clothing or a partially open door set just right while she's showering or dressing. I really haven't gone out of my way to experience this. Whenever it has happened though, I've done my best not to get caught staring; just to appreciate the view for a long as I can, respect her privacy, and to consider myself lucky. It's awesome, it's exciting and it's sexy as hell. My question for those who suspect they have been admired in this manner, have you ever created this opportunity on purpose? Have you ever become aware that you're being seen and let it continue, pretending that you're still unaware? I know I wouldn't have the moxie to pull that off if roles were reversed, but I could swear that sometimes you girls know, ha ha! If so, what response were you looking for?

EDIT: I completely agree with the comments regarding 'respecting privacy' vs. staring and I want to offer some better, more accurate language (whilst still being straight-up honest).  A better way to have put that would have been, I appreciate the view for as long as it presents itself and no longer than I perceive that my noticing is innocuous and inconspicuous.  This is definitely NOT respecting privacy and those who called me out on that fact are right to point that out.  Just the same, leering and creeping has never been my intent, nor do I get off on making people uncomfortable.  My desire to avoid the possible ugliness of creating an objectifying experience for someone else far exceeds my desire to get an eyeful. All in, perhaps I am guilty as charged.  I do not avert my eyes in shame for the careless (or not so careless!) damsel-in-reveal, nor do I crane my neck on an escalator or ignore social boundaries. 

EDIT II: What a delicious thread!  Honestly, I learned so much more about a sex topic that I find intriguing. I completely appreciate your candor. Of course this collection of anecdotes and views is far from being a scientific survey... It's entirely possible that Reddit's famous 'hivemind' prevents those of opposing views from posting. Nevertheless, here's my take on a tidy summation~ 
TLDR: Many more women than I would have guessed (and a few men) ABSOLUTELY know that her nakedness has been discretely admired.  Depending on the situation, some are not only fine with that, but some have taken steps to allow for the opportunity in order to become informed by the response and possibly even to revel in it. Like I said... Delicious, intriguing humanity!  And I also learned that there are indeed others, not as many thankfully for me, who are probably now in the process of petitioning Dateline's Chris Hanson to pay me a visit for achieving creepiest guy on the Internets status.

Am I Missing Out?,1067,322,504,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/114y3w/ive_only_been_with_one_girl_my_future_wife_am_i/,"Okay, so I’m 22 and my fiancé is 23. We met (seriously) in Kindergarten. Our parents were best friends, we lived next to each other. She was kind of a troubled kid, though. Had a lot of boyfriends and a lot of sex. I was obsessed with grades and soccer and BMX as a kid, so I was pretty much a virgin, unless you count a handjob I got at 11 or making out.

We started dating when right before high school, and dated all the way through college. I lost my virginity to her. We lived together from 17 on. 

We both got out of school this summer. We’re both getting “real jobs” (done) and married (dated for Christmas, which is also her birthday and the day I lost my virginity blah blah etc).

I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and it’s something SHE brings up a lot. I’ve only been with her. Ever. I only know what *she* feels like, what she tastes like, what sleeping next to *her* feels like, etc. That’s not true for her. Aside from having boyfriends before me, she also had a problem with cheating in our freshman year of college. 

I toughed it out. She really HAS changed, by the way. Trust me.

I know a lot of people might tell me to experiment or move on. I can’t deny that I want to know what other girls are like. Not just the sex. What is it like to fight with someone else? To comfort someone else? 

I’ve never felt, I don’t know. *Passionate* about my fiancé, sexually. Passionate about protecting her, absolutely. About making her feel better and improving her life. About helping her through school. I was obsessed with that. But  I never felt butterflies or anything. Sometimes I would with other girls, and I fucking **ran** from anyone who made me feel something other than normal friendly affection. 

A lot of people probably won’t understand this, but we’ve been together so long that our relationship isn’t just love. We’re connected up in too many ways to ever untangle, and even though there are lots of things I wish were different, the idea of being away from her makes me sad or even nauseous.  

Okay. So she’s always telling me I need to get “fucking other girls” out of my system. I know she doesn’t really want me to sleep with someone else, but she’s always telling me that either a) I can do better than her, and b) I need to sleep with at least ONE other person.  

And now I just… I don’t know. I love her, deeply if not passionately. The sex is okay. She loves it, and I love that she loves it. (A minefield of implications, I know, but you can’t have everything.) 

Here’s where I started having a problem: I had to work on a project with a girl for a class right at the end of school. We had the kind of interactions that make me want to run away from someone. Butterflies, heart-thumping. Mutual discomfort. It was *horrible*. I stopped sleeping with my fiancé because I couldn’t get this girl out of my head and that came too close to cheating for me.
Anyway so when the project concluded and we got our A, this girl kissed me. Pushed me against the wall and rubbed her face on my face and got her tongue into my mouth before I managed to push her away. My fingertips buzzed I was so excited. I had an erection you could see from space. It HURT. I ran out of the empty lecture hall, got to a bathroom in time, puked. Then (sad I know) I cried. Like a little kid. I don’t know why. It just came out. Not like sad movie tears. Like full-body sobs. I wasn’t thinking about anything, it just *happened*.

And since then I’ve been wondering. Am I missing something? Is it ethical or normal or moral to want some momentary passionate sensation over a lifelong connection that goes beyond love? Am I kidding myself? 

I’ve been with this girl for 8 years, I’ve lived with her for 5. And I *believe* in loyalty and monogamy and being committed. So it’s not like I’m afraid I’ll crack and run away with some girl in a fit of passion.

I’m just wondering. Am I missing something?  
  
**TL;DR:** Lifetime relationship with fiancé, recentish passion attack with different girl (not my fault), wondering if I’m screwing my life up.

**Normal disclaimer: So first things first, PLEASE, PLEASE discuss with your SO before you play, make sure you define your boundaries, and STICK TO THEM. So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, you may not actually enjoy the reality of it once you experience it so it's always better to play safe than be sorry!), and please be respectful of these boundaries. These kinds of activity require a great deal of trust from your SO, so please, please do not violate this trust.**

**Also, please constantly be aware of yourself and your partner during such sessions. If they appear to hesitate, look anxious or uncomfortable in their behavior, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Ask them if anything is wrong, MAKE SURE NOTHING IS WRONG. If you have any doubt in your mind, just stop. If he/she uses the safeword, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Give them a second to relax and decompress. Talk to them about it, get them to communicate what went wrong. Please, please DO NOT continue, even if they says it is okay to get back into it. Just stop for the night. Cuddle instead. And please reassure and ENCOURAGE them to use the safeword.**

**Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL AND GUY IS DIFFERENT, this guide is not an guarantee crowd pleaser, it's from my personal experience, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. THIS WILL VARY FROM GIRL TO GIRL AND GUY TO GUY. So PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A GENERAL GUIDE FOR EVERYONE.**

Okay...for the last time, let's get to it:

- **Sounds:** Moan, whimper, gasp when your man is rough-handling you. Let him hear how turned on he's making you.

- **Beg for it.** Vocally: ""Oh *please*"" Him: ""Please *what?*"" You: ""Please, I want you inside me/I want you to fuck me."" Gasp/whimper out his name. Body language: show him how desperate you for him, move your hands across his back/chest, put your arms around his neck, press your body tight against his. When you feel his erection, glide your hand down the front of his pants and feel him through it, whisper in his ear: ""I want *this* so badly.""

- **Don't let him do all the work:** When he's on top, wrap your legs around his back to bring him deeper. If you're not restrained by him, keep your hands on him, run it across his back/chest, through his hair (use light fingernails if he likes that sort of thing). 

- **Shy kisses:** I like doing this when my guy is being particularly rough with me. I'll give him gentle kisses, on the mouth, on his cheek, along his neck and collarbone. This feels amazing when he gets more aggressive, it's like the more gentle I try to be with him, the more he'll assert his dominance as if saying ""none of that bullshit, I call the shots."" So I'll try to kiss him gently, but he'll just grab the back of my head and turn it into an aggressive kiss. Incredibly hot. It's very hard to explain the mentality behind this one, but it's like the more rough he is with me, the more I want to please as if to see if I can get him to be ""gentler"" when I really want the opposite ;) But it gets me into that nice submissive mindset that I really have no control.

- **Let him dominate you while YOU are on top:** Me and my guy like to do a lot of different positions during sex. Often times, he'll just say ""Get on top"" or ""Ride me"", and will shove me on him. He places his hands on my hips and controls me by thrusting upwards and shoving me down on his cock. Great position to lean over and moan/whimper in his ear while he's thrusting into you. Other times, he'll make me please him by being on top. ""Ride me"", then he puts his arms behind his head and smirks up at me, while I do all the work. At this point, show him how desperate you are to please him. This is the time when I really like doing the ""shy"" kisses cause I can lean over him and kiss him gently on the lips/neck. 

- **Being disobedient...on purpose:** Sometimes it's no fun being the perfectly obedient little slave...how else am I going to get punished? ;) So often times I will disobey on purpose...I do this by: 

1) In BDSM play: Taking too long to obey an order, outright refusing an order (""Please *no*""), purposely making a mistake (Him: ""You're nothing but a dirty little cum-loving slut whose only good for being used. Repeat it."" Me: ""I'm nothing but a little cum-loving slut whose only good for being used."" Him: ""You forgot ""dirty"" &lt;slap&gt; &lt;spank&gt; ""Try *again*.""), not refering to him appropriately (i.e. ""Master""). 

2) In ""rape"" play: Resisting - try to ""fight"" him off, struggle. Keep your legs closed tight, this will force him to FORCE them open. Use your hands to push him off - this will make him pin your wrists down. While I'm doing this, I like protesting: ""No, please *no*"". ""I don't want to, please *stop.*"" Him: ""Do you think I care what you want? Now shut up, you're here to do what *I* want.""

- **Blowjobs:** Suck him off as if there is nothing else you would rather do. Moan while you have his cock buried in your mouth (yes this may be difficult - but is possible when you're just playing with the tip). Use your hands (assuming they are not tied up) and pull his waist to you as if you are desperate to get more of him into your mouth. Do what your guy likes in terms of body language - i.e. if he likes your eyes lowered, keep them lowered, look up only to coyly ask him if you're satisfying him, or if there's anything else you can do to please him.

- **Beg to please *him*:** ""Please, I want to suck you off"", ""Please let me suck you off"", ""Please, will you cum in my mouth/face/chest/stomach/pussy/ass?"" 

- **Remind him that he controls your orgasms:** Again more begging. ""Please let/make me cum."" ""I need to cum so badly, please master."" ""I need you to make me cum, please I'll do anything."" While saying this, show how desperate you are, rub your wetness against his cock or fingers, spread your legs wide for him.

- **Apologize when you're disobedient:** Beg for forgiveness ""I'm sorry master. I didn't mean to. I'll do whatever you want, please forgive me."" ""I won't disobey/forget/struggle next time. Please don't be angry."" ""I'm sorry master. Please punish me for disobeying. I will be/do better next time.""

- **Thank him:** Thank him for giving you pleasure/reward. And for letting *you* please *him* ""Thank you for letting me suck your cock."" ""Thank you for letting me swallow your cum.""

**After care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your partner after - make sure she/he is okay, ask what things they DID NOT like (as well as things they did like), make sure you did not overstep your boundaries. Hug, kiss, hold, cuddle her/him, tell them you love them, etc, etc.**

Trust me, I totally get it. We're flooded with these questions of ""is my penis big enough"" and it's really frustrating telling them the same thing over and over again (that most people don't give a shit about penis size- learn how to use what you have and you're good). It's actually gotten to be such a big deal on /r/sex and I've read about and talked to so many men here who have had negative experiences with it that I'm incorporating penis size satisfaction into my thesis project. In doing my background research for it, I came across this in a journal article:

&gt; The penis, particularly in its erect state, is a symbol of masculinity. In many cultures it has come to symbolise attributes such as ‘largeness, strength, endurance, ability, courage, intelligence, knowledge, dominance over men, possession of women; a symbol of
loving and being loved’. A review is recommended which describes Indian SadhusIndian Sadhus using weights, Dayak men in Borneo piercing the glans and then inserting items in the resultant holes to stimulate the partner, and the Topinama of Brazil, who encourage poisonous snakes to bite their penis to make it enlarge (for 6 months!). Some of these concepts date back over many thousands of years, and there is evidence that prehistoric cave dwellers attributed the symbolic values of strength and power to penile size, as well as those of virility and fertility, a process also recommended in the Kama Sutra.

This isn't a worry that men only now have come to have. Penis size has been associated with masculinity throughout the ages. So while we get frustrated with guys who come here asking for reassurance and many of us don't even want to bother with discussing the issue with them, it's important to remember that the people posting about this are people that a) haven't seen all the previous /r/sex threads about it and b) really do need that reassurance that it's not all about penis size. Society and culture has trained us to believe that size is the most important thing. So being empathetic to their concerns and taking the time to tell them how they can be an amazing sexual partner can do wonders for them.

This doesn't make sense to me.

If two people have been together only a very short time, I can understand (to an extent). It's difficult to know someone to any real extent in the first month or so, and any information given in that time period generally gives a muted hint at what is to come of the relationship in the future.

If, however, two people have been together for years--which a lot of these people have--and are now developing problems of a sexual nature, I feel that the instantaneous knee jerk reaction of ""dump them"" is a bit over zealous.

And actual example from today; ""[What to do with a lazy lover...](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/t3zzc/what_to_do_with_a_lazy_lover/)""

    In the post, the man says that it's been four years, and now *his*
    tastes are changing, and his girlfriend, used to his previously low
    maintenance sexual habits, is a lazy lover. He understands that he
    had something to do with it.

    Sexysexthrowaway posted some good generic advice to sit down
    and have a non-threatening/accusatory chat with her, followed by,
    ""But if, after you explain this to her, she still dismisses your needs,
    then it's time to end things.""

That doesn't seem right to me. He has been with this woman for four years, so she is more than likely doing *something* right. I don't understand how someone can, from one post, decide that it's probably time to end a relationship that they know nothing about.

This happens constantly. In almost every /r/sex post in which I read the comments, one or more persons are suggesting that they break it off, and they usually have a fair bit of support in the form of upvotes.

I'm not saying that certain situations don't call for breaking up, and some of the situations on /r/sex might very well be those circumstances in which separating is the best policy. Be that as it may, that is heavy advice, and should *not* be given lightly, with minimal, highly superficial information.

I'm not saying that it should never be done, but perhaps a bit more sparingly, with some effort to understand the base of their relationship. Not everyone thinks that a relationship with bad sex is not worth having.

I (20f) am an attractive girl, but I have abnormally long inner labia. I know it's normal for them to protrude and be visible, but mine are beyond that. It's become a pretty serious impediment to everyday activities. For example, I can't ride a bike because it's too painful, I can't wear tight pants or underwear without it rubbing uncomfortably, I feel far too uncomfortable to wear a swimsuit in public because the outline is very visible and when I walk they have a tendency to ""slip out into the open"" Yikes. Sex is also made completely unpleasant by it. Of course it takes some manipulation to make room for a penis to enter, but then throughout they're constantly getting stretched and pulled inside, and I end up having to stop every ten seconds to readjust. I finally realized that it's just a wholly unpleasant experience for both parties, and so I've stopped having sex altogether.

But worse than the physical manifestations is the toll it takes on my confidence. The first guy to see it asked what was wrong with me, which was how I determined it wasn't normal. I started looking at pictures of vulvas and realized that there were none quite like mine. I've seen all the websites, videos, pictures, and blogs designed to make women more comfortable with their vulvas. There's nothing quite so painful as looking at the pictures with implications like ""even this girl can be confident"" or ""at least you're not this bad,""  because they're intended to represent the extremes of anatomy, and realizing mine are even worse. 

I keep telling myself it's not my fault, and I shouldn't have to feel embarrassed or apologetic about my body. I try to have the attitude ""if he doesn't like it, his loss."" But that's difficult when no one likes it. So far, every guy who's seen it has apologized and admitted they're simply not attracted. At first I tried to tell myself they're all shallow assholes, and that If someone likes me for who I am, they won't mind. But I've realized that's not fair. If the first time I was intimate with someone I noticed something extreme about his penis that was completely unappealing and repulsive to me, I'd probably be unable to engage in any sort of sexual activity with that person. You can't help it if you're simply not physically attracted to something/someone. 

I've been with a lot of men. Everyone has said something about it, so far nothing positive. The nicest comments are about how I have the ""biggest vagina"" (I assume they're referring to my labia and possibly clitoral hood- or just vulva in general, because my vagina itself is not loose or anything) they've ever seen. That alone is hard to hear over and over again, but usually it's followed by a failed attempt to deal with it and enjoy sex with me. All except a handful made sure it was a one time thing. Those who stuck it out for multiple occasions each finally admitted they simply were too turned off by my anatomy to continue. I've had one boyfriend, and I realized the only reason I was with him was because he put up with my anatomy and was still willing to touch me and have sex and whatnot. It was just so rare that I held onto him. He too finally admitted that he was truly unattracted to my vulva, but he wanted to make me happy so he just sucked it up and tried not to look too much.

Is this the best I can hope for? To find someone who is at least willing to suck it up despite being repulsed? And what are the chances that of the few men who can deal with it, I'll find one I actually like and who likes me? Do I have to just accept that I'll never be able to have casual sex, and generally never allow anyone to look at me? Do I  admit to myself that there's a part of me that's simply objectively unattractive and accept that I'll never be comfortable or confident with my body? Do I seek out people with fetishes for abnormal labia? I really don't want it to be something fetishized, but that might be my only chance to have sex with someone who actually enjoys it. Do I stop engaging in any sort of sexual activity? It's just so emotionally painful to hear the same thing it over and over. It's made me incredibly depressed and resigned to never being able to have a normal relationship and never feeling confident or sexy. I've thought about labiaplasty, but everyone has begged me not to do it. Surgery is a big deal, and not something I want to undergo if I don't have to. Plus, I assume my insurance won't cover it, and I don't have thousands of dollars to pay for it. I know it's a pretty hopeless situation, but any advice would be appreciated. I just don't know what to do, and I feel so horrible and trapped. Please help me.

(Sorry I've just taken up your time with one sad, whiny, drawn out complaint, but there's no one in real life I'd feel comfortable talking about this with, and it's been bottled up for quite some time. Help me r/sex. You're my only hope.)



Edit: Sorry, sorry, should have included this earlier- **TL;DR**: I have very long inner labia. This causes discomfort during certain everyday activities, and the comments I've gotten from men about them have been devastating to my confidence. I assume labiaplasty would not be covered by my insurance, and there's no way I can afford it if it isn't. It's causing me a ton of anxiety and depression, and I don't know what to do about it.

Finally I realized the worst advice was the ""come hither"" motion, while this is all over the web.  It does nothing.  It might stimulate the g spot/area but that is about it.  I discovered that instead of the come hither, you have to kind of hook your 1 or 2 fingers and aggressively press against the anterior wall of the vagina (behind the clit bascially).

I can orgasm during sex when I'm on top/grinding, but no other position, and I had never cum while masturbating, despite my best efforts (i even had a Hitachi magic wand--but it usually just felt too strong). 

I even tried watching as many porn videos of girls masturbating as I could, and copied all their different techniques. Nothing worked!

Then, when I posted here,  I got advice from Maxxters and a few other people saying it sounds like I just need PRESSURE in order to orgasm, and that I should try masturbating by laying on my stomach while grinding on a vibrator under me. I had never thought to do this! I'd masturbated lots of times in doggy-style positions, but never lying flat on my stomach. 

So I tried it, and...HOLY SHIT! I came within 60 seconds, three times in a row! I'm sure my face was hilarious the first time because I was so baffled- I had never made myself cum in 20 years and all I had to do was lay on my stomach and grind on something!!!

So, if there's anyone having trouble making themselves cum in ""conventional"" ways (read: the ways shown in porn), try doing it while laying on your stomach! It might work for you too!

Thanks so much for your help, r/sex, I never thought I'd make myself cum, and now I've been doing it about 6 times a day becuase I'm so excited about it.

It recently hit me after reading the story of a graduate of abstinence only education who was told ""Abstinence is the only way to completely avoid STI's""  that a lot of people have the same understanding of infections and virus's. And this understanding is wrong. While it's not a huge issue, this mus-information does hurt people, and it is a small factor in the rate of STI transmission.

I want everyone to know that Virgin does not equal Clean, and I want those in the know to pass this information on.

Saying ""We are both virgins so STI's are no concern"" is no excuse anymore, we know that many infections like chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV, Herpes and HIV can be transmitted through other means like [moist contact with an infected area](http://www.humanillnesses.com/Infectious-Diseases-Co-Ha/Gonorrhea.html), sharing needles, a mistreated injury, transmitted at birth, kissing with gum infections even something you are born with. There are of course dermal infections like Thrush and vaginitis that develop without any outside influence, that can then be passed on to others.

Even if only 1 people who already knew this reads this post, At least I made you think that this information is important, and you should share it with those who are unaware of the risks of trusting ""virginity"" to be the same as ""STI free""


* apologies for the use of the word ""clean"", as I know it gives negative connotations to those who do suffer some form of STI, I do not mean to imply that anybody is somehow ""dirty"" I just wanted to use a phrase that is well known and 'catchy'.

EDIT:  

1. [Scubaguybill](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/wjqtu/virgin_clean/c5e2ae5) has pointed out that contracting an STI from birth would not affect your sex life as an adolencent/adult due to screening and pre-natal/post-natal treatmentt for infacts born with infections

2. I would like to state that this post has not been written with the intention of discouraging people from having consensual sex, I simply want to inform people who may unknowingly fall into the ""risk group""

3. I also do not wish to insult anyone or impose on anyone's beliefs of virgnity, sexuality or otherwise. I just don't want to see people getting hurt by blindly following a system without knowing the facts.

4. I do not want to cause alarm, I just want to insert a seed in the back of your mind that asks ""are you sure"" before you take risks involving sex. The majority of people are in an incredibly low risk category for the issues I have brought up. But the more chances you take, the bigger the risk gets, and that's the thought I want people to have, rather than fear the disease, I want people to understand it.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1342345384.0,,,True,t3_wjqtu,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/wjqtu/virgin_clean/,

I just want to take some time to talk about the prostate play since I don't think there is an issue finding more information on strap on play in our little r/pegging corner of reddit.

The first thing you need to realize is that the prostate is not just a magical pleasure button (there are exceptions) to most men. It takes some time finding what you do and do not like. The first task is actually finding it for yourself.

The easiest way to do this, I find, is while sitting on the toilet. After making sure you are clean insert you middle finger as deep as you can get. For this using some saliva as lube is usually more than enough. Once you are in touch the wall of your anal canal in the direction of you penis. After a while you will find a slight deppression with a somewhat harder spherical thing on the other side. This is your prostate. Try pushing on it, rubbing it, squeezing it between atwo fingers. You will feel a hard to describe pressure deep inside you.

Now there seems to be some discussion as to what ""milking the prostate"" exactly means. The first one is a technique to produce a milky substance that looks like watery cum. This can be achieved by massaging the prostate itself like I described on top. Find out for yourself how you prefer this to be done as there are many ways to do so like I said a bit higher. The result will be the gradual discharge of actual semen without orgasm. In the end you will find yourself drained, horny but without the eagerness to orgasm.

The second way is to produce 'infinite precum'. To do this you focus on the little glands that lie a little deeper behind your prostate. These are responsible for producing precum. These constantly produce a low amount of precum but go in overdrive when you are aroused. High pressure in these are part of a possible trigger chain for orgasm. By applying pressure on these you can milk the precum through the prostate. The result is a stream of precum that theoretically can be continued indefinately, however, since you are constantly applying pressure on the glands, your urge to come will become increasinly insistant to the point you will come and there is no stopping it. This will take quite long, though, and your orgasme will be mindblowing, your cum very creamy since there is little liquid left to add to your semen.

I hope this helps some of you to discover these pleasures.

EDIT: Pain is NEVER a good thing when dealing with your prostate, build up slowly and STOP IMMEDIATLY when you feel pain.

When we first started dating we had sex all the time (6-7x per week).  As time went on it became less frequent.  Now she could go without sex for weeks when I would prefer at least 2-3x per week (minimum).  We settled on once per week but it's so damn difficult to get her to do it :(.  Whenever I try to have a conversation about it with her she gets super angry and that doesn't ever help anything.  Our conversation usually consists of me asking why she doesn't want to have sex and I ask her if she can just do it for me because she always enjoys it once we start the process.  But she is always is in a bad mood about it and she says she just doesn't want to do it or she isn't in the mood.  This is literally impossible for me to understand because I am always ready at the drop of a hat.  Question for People that have a lower libido::: Is it really difficult/painful for you to have sex with your partner when you're not in the mood?  Even if you actually enjoy it if you are eventually coerced into doing it?

 Anyone else in a similar situation?  Were you able to work it out?  I am able to deal with it, it's just frustrating and kinda stresses me out/angers me sometimes.

Also, recently we were talking about how she rarely wants to have sex and somehow it came up that she said that she wouldn't mind me sleeping with someone else just to get it out of my system so she wouldn't have to do it as often. I love my girlfriend very much and even with her saying that I would find it very difficult to actually bring myself to do that.  I can't believe that she would actually be ok with that but I don't really know.  Has anyone else ever been given this option?  Seems like what almost every boyfriend/husband wants to hear.

There are going to be some times when the guy you are with isn't interested in sex.  Much of the time he may get into it anyway if you initiate, but occasionally men just are not in the mood- and it's not because we aren't attracted to you!  We may be stressed, drunk, self conscious, or just wanting to be with you without needing to feel like we have to ""perform"".  These things happen.  

Quite frankly, we don't like being pressured or guilted/coerced any more than you do.  I know a lot of men (mostly younger men) will claim that they ALWAYS want it, but that's not true nor the case for someone who is older, or in an LTR (living together, for example), or any number of other reasons.  

Let me reiterate:  IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.  If you don't want to have sex with the guy you are seeing, is it because you don't love him, or are not attracted to him? Yes?  Dump him.  No?  Then you understand what I'm saying.  Testosterone can only carry us so far, then we are real people just like you!

I spent this past weekend with my boyfriend and I brought up the subject of oral sex. I told him that we were going to try out some different techniques that would make the experience easier for him and better for me. He was quite receptive to the idea, especially because I made it clear to him that oral sex is not deathly important to me, so I wouldn't be terribly upset if things didn't change with a new technique.

So, sexytime rolls around, and I decided to *really* motivate him to be experimental. While giving him a blowjob, I practised edging him for the first time. It was amazingly successful and it put him in such a good state of mind that he told me that he wanted to perform oral sex on me (which doesn't happen much; normally I ask him to do it). 

All I can say is WOW! The techniques that you fine people gave me were exactly what my boyfriend and I needed. He was able to go down on me for much, much longer than before. Not to mention that having him suck and flick my clit felt a million times better than his previous methods. I actually orgasmed from oral sex for the first time ever!

Sorry for complaining at everyone again, this is a follow up post to [this one!] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1gyw00/desperately_sad_about_sex_problem/)

Basically I was with my BF for about 10 years, we broke up for 2-3 years, we got back together, he complained that sex isn't enjoyable for him anymore. That I'm too big for him to feel enough friction to enjoy it. 

Specifically that I'm too big near my cervix and that the only time he gets enjoyment is when he's hammering my cervix and I'm almost passing out from the pain.

On Sunday he confessed that his bitterness about this issue was spilling over into the rest of our relationship, so that meant less affection and interest in me. More interest in pot and beer. We talked about it, cried, he reassured me that he wasn't comparing me to his two ex-girlfriends (who in his words were better than me). We had sex. I asked him after, since he had cum twice, if it was any better. He said no, there was just one position that felt any good for him.

On Monday night I decided to try my best to spice things up. I got dressed up, I greeted him after work with some passionate kisses. I guided him to a chair. I gave him a blowjob. He seemed to enjoy it. 

We then went out for dinner. We came back, had sex again, he cycled through every position never staying there for more than 5 seconds or so, I also added in a new one where I was facing down but using a pillow to lift my pelvis, he didn't like it. I used a towel to wipe up any extra wetness on my part that might be making it less frictionable for him. 

After sex I asked didn't outright quiz him on my performance but I tried to gauge if it had been any better for him. Nope, not that time either. I felt miserable, I was going all out and it was all for nothing.

Yesterday we had an argument, I told him he was making me unhappy, I didn't feel loved, that I needed more time and affection from him. He told me he couldn't give me that because he was getting nothing in return for affection (i.e it wasn't leading to good sex) and he was getting frustrated. He recommended I go to a gynecologist or buy some tightening cream. I told him I didn't think there was much I could do about it bar surgery, that he seemed to love sex with me before, that maybe his problem was mental.

And it seems like it is. He obviously found the heroin brand of vaginas while we were broken up and now nothing else compares.

What am I supposed to do now? I feel like it's pointless to even try to make things better. And why am I the one who has to try so hard? I'm really upset because it seems like it's all my fault.

And how can this even be true at all that he feels no enjoyment from sex? I tested the strength of my pelvic floor, I can place a finger inside and feel the walls on all sides. I even demonstrated this to him! And he said the problem was near the top near my cervix. I told him not to penetrate as deep them, and he said that was a ridiculous idea.

TL;DR: Boyfriend had sex with me for 10 years no complaint, after finding magical vagina of incredible sex can't go back to fucking me without being disappointed. 

EDIT&gt; Thank you so much for your responses, and your kindness and your reassurance that I'm not some kind of womanly freak. I was feeling very low and I'm feeling slightly better about myself now, so thank you everyone &lt;3

Also in the spirit of fairness, please be aware that I'm upset and that you're not getting a completely unbiased account of my boyfriend's words. I think it is very important that you are honest with your sexual partners/lovers/friends but if something is bothering you sexually think about how and what you are willing to change before you bring up a sensitive issue.

Sorry for the long wait for this update! This isn't my primary account and I got caught up with my studies over the past couple months.

So...the details:

We booked a hotel room, had dinner and drinks beforehand (I had one glass of merlot, he had no alcohol.) We held hands and kissed a little before we got to the room, and then ended up in bed, fully clothed, making out and grinding against each other. I was still pretty nervous about the entire thing, and he sensed that. We stopped for a bit to talk about what I wanted to do, and if I was sure. I reassured him, saying that I was definitely ready, and that I wasn't appreciating our states of un-nekkidness. He laughed and stood me between his legs, told me to turn around so he could unzip my skirt (and he took his sweet time...which was really fun...)

So after stripping, we went down on each other; I blew him first...and then he went to town on me, lots of foreplay which included a whole lot of breast and nipple play...and I think I got more pleasure out of that than anything. I didn't cum from any of the foreplay though, which wasn't unexpected, given the amount of sensory overload I was experiencing. 

We started off in missionary; we lubed up very liberally (there's an almost empty tube of KY in my underwear drawer) and tried insertion. IT HURT. And I bled, but not much. It hurt less and less over the entire session, as I got wetter and we used more lube before every insertion - we went through about 3-4 condoms. We tried different positions - doggy, I got on top as well but it still hurt, so that didn't do much for me at the time. We varied leg positions while in missionary, which felt better as the pain lessened. It wasn't until I was on the edge of the bed and he was standing,holding my legs on his shoulders that it started to feel really intense, good intense. I loved how he felt when he was completely inside of me. The pain was fading and there was a pressure down there, it felt amazing. We fucked in that position for a while and we both got really into it, I was out of breath and I scratched and bit him a few times...lots of kissing and he kept looking at my face and touching me. I told him that I needed to stop, it was too intense and I was beginning to feel sore. I stroked him and told him that I wanted him to  cum on my stomach, which he happily did. I did not cum, but I was satisfied with the experience so...all in all, zero regrets. I made sure to pee afterwards, I haven't had any UTI or STI issues, I was sore for a couple days though. 

He and I haven't had sex since then, mostly due to the fact that he's out of the country at the moment. We have kept in contact, messaging each other, and making some plans to meet up in the future when he's back. Afterwards I did feel some pangs of longing for closeness and intimacy with someone, but funnily enough, it wasn't for my partner at all. I think it was general feeling of loneliness and knowing that, for me, sex would be a million times better with someone I love and who loves me back. But for now...DM;HS :)

",1080,387,1153,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/oy2hb/my_wife_apparently_no_longer_wants_to_have_sex/,"My wife and I are recently married, within a year and the past 5 months or so have been increasingly difficult on our sex life. Not only has the frequency and length of sex decreased but the desire on her part has also diminished. 

I'm partly to blame. I was blessed/cursed with a large penis. Not a HUGE penis mind you, but I certainly don't have anything to be ashamed over. Through the years I've had a lot of girls who found it a blessing and for a while my wife was one of them, now she calls it ""Conan the Destroyer"" and avoids it at all costs. Over the past 5 months I have ""twisted her fallopian tube"" which required a trip to the ER, somehow damaged her vaginal wall which caused her to bleed profusely for 2 weeks, and I have also ""bottomed out"" which caused her to nearly throw up from the intense pain. These are just the things she has told me about, I'm sure there are more. I can assure you, none of these injuries have occurred due to extreme sex.

When we were dating she loved sex and actually wanted to have more of it than what I felt like. However, from the day we were married something apparently changed. Over the 12 days of our honeymoon we only had sex 5 times. 3 of those times I had to basically beg her in to. A further problem of this is that our sex life is quite boring and she doesn't want it any differently. She is a self described ""feminist"" who feels that sex demeans women in a way. She always make sure that she can see my face during sex and if she can't, I can't be in that position. While I love that she's a strong woman, this sort of thing does get in the way of ""relations"" and has occasionally stopped any sexual activity if I say the wrong thing, such as ""I want to fuck you so bad"". Apparently that's a no-no. Last Christmas when we were dating I purchased her a vibrator, her first. I spent the next week apologizing for ""such an insulting present"" but she has used it more since then. Any additional toys or ideas of things to do on my part are shot down with extreme prejudice.

All this I could handle because I was still masturbating. I've jerked off since I was 13 and if there's one thing I knew how to solve it was getting rid of my horniness. However, I have my own share of problems. One of which is that I cannot jerk off from memory. When I was younger I was Sanduskied by an older kid in the neighborhood. While I hate to admit it, one of the results is whenever I jerk off is that bad memory showing up.  The way I always got around this was porn. Eyes open, jerk off, and it was fine. This is no longer allowed. 

Despite my best efforts to be discreet and despite the fact that she knew I jerked off I ended up on the losing end of an argument regarding my habits. She discovered this by scouring my browser history. We spent 3 or 4 days fighting before it was resolved. In the resolution I promised to not look/jerk off to porn anymore.

Flash forward to this week. We haven't had sex in two weeks (which was just a quicky before going to meet her parents for dinner) and before that it was a month. I ask, I basically beg, to either have sex or to jerk off. She said it was fine if I jerked off, but I just can't look at anything (which will not work). She wanted to wait to see her lady-doctor again before having sex again. Her appointment isn't for another week or two.

First update: http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16rf2h/update_what_are_these_things_on_my_vagina/

Just to give you some lovely graphic details of what has happened 'down there' since my last post... The sores turned into what looked like mouth ulcers. They were white, quite hard to touch, and not painful or itchy at all. By Sunday they were completely gone... so they only lasted around 3 days. Which rules out MC..

I went back to the clinic today for my follow up appointment and to get my results. Everything came back negative from the clinic (herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia etc), and my herpes test from the doctors came back negative as well. Basically, neither the doctor or the two doctors who I saw at the clinic know what it was. It was suggested that they were cuts from some form of trauma which then got slightly infected, or they were a very strange side effect from me being so ill last week. 

It is slightly frustrating not knowing what they were. But I am incredibly relieved that they weren't herpes! I am going back again in a month to be checked again, just to be on the *incredibly* safe side. 

Thanks for all your nice comments on my last posts as well :) And practice safe sex! All the time! Having things appear on your nether regions and not knowing what they are is quite terrifying.

Sex should feel as natural as drinking water. 

It should not require confidence. 

Sex should *happen,* because the moment is ripe. 

Ripening lips, ripening labia, ripening cock, ripening pupils, ripening state of being. Ripe and augmented and brimming. Your energy goes to your pumping heart, then to every external nerve, then to theirs, on fire. 

You bask, roll, play in it. You sigh, moan, laugh. 

It’s not about being “good in bed.” 

It’s about being happy. 

One should never worry if they’re doing it “correctly.” Sex is not *factual.* I don’t want your cookie-cutter sex, I don’t want your meticulously crafted, calculated, fool-proof fuck. I don’t want a show. I want you. Let your instincts, urges and whims define that. It’s enough. 

What do most girls like? Forget about it. Statistics are meaningless when there’s only one. Hello, here’s me. Here’s you. 

Don’t worry about taking it too slow. We got time. We got infinite rhythms, combinations, possibilities. Explore each fuck. Take our time. We can do a different one later. 

Don’t worry about making me come. I’m here. Right where I want to be.

I am overwhelmed by wanting; you don’t have to convince me. I want you because I like you. So don’t put on a front. Don’t taint this. 

I’m frustrated--it’s just authenticity I want. 

It’s originality.

It’s passion. 

It’s joy. 

Don’t say that something I like is ugly. Don’t compare yourself to the rest. You will live and die with and within your experiences like everyone else. If someone thinks you are amazing, they are not wrong. Their universe is as real as any other; it is forged through perception.

I don’t care if you accidentally slammed my head into the wall, if you slipped out, if my arm cracked, if the delightful pressure of your wet lips on my anything made a silly sound. There is no right way and no wrong way.

“Good in bed,” what. 

You’re good in my bed. I’m pleased you’re there. I feel it suits you. 

Shove your technique. Let your memory swallow it. Fuck me like you’d fuck me, fuck me like you feel. 

This isn’t a test.

(NSFW language, obviously)",1120,439,257,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/um7ia/sexxit_i_just_had_my_first_ffm_threesome_with_my/,"Some background: I'm 27. I've been sexually active for about 10 years...obviously, when you're a 17-year-old guy, you're prone to ""accidentally"" letting porn fantasies get in the way of real life. For the most part, I was able to dispense of most of these unrealistic scenarios when I started having sex with people who weren't on my computer screen. But the one thing I could never shake was the threesome fantasy, like most humans with a penis and a heartbeat.

Over the past decade, I had a few opportunities. First girlfriend brought up the idea, then quickly retracted it and accused me of thinking of other girls (ENTRAPMENT!). Second time, a hookup of mine brought her ladyfriend over...turns out they only wanted to smoke my weed, and they quickly left. Third time, I had a GF who had been in relationships with other women. She was thinking of visiting an old hookup, but things fizzled out between us before it could happen.

Cut to now. My current girlfriend (also 27) brings up the idea. Her libido is through the roof. We do the deed at least twice a day. She's got a yoga-toned body and a bag of kinky tricks. On top of everything, we're madly in love. She's everything I've ever desired in a partner. So she brings up the idea of someone watching us while we have sex; I'm kind of a hidden exhibitionist, so I'm immediately into it. She hadn't hooked up with another female since she was 18 and wanted to try it again. She mentions a friend that she regularly flirts with her whenever she's in town. It slowly progresses from ""I want her to watch us"" to ""I want you to watch us"" to ""We'll all fool around but you can't fuck her"" to ""I want you to fuck us both"".

In the following order, I am a) turned on, b) skeptical from past failed attempts, c) scared shitless from fucking up my relationship, regardless that my GF and I are going into this together.

The big night arrives. We all chill out to some wine and music for about an hour before my girlfriend makes the first move and kisses her friend. It was all but 10 minutes before all the clothes came flying off. Mind you, I've never seen two women together (even kissing for attention---I had a sheltered college life), so I spent the first 15 minutes staring in awe at what was going on. Again, it had been nearly a decade since my girlfriend experimented with another woman, so she was THRILLED and all over her. 

And then I'm invited in. Over the course of six hours (three hours of sleep in between), we did almost everything imaginable. Fingering both at the same time, both of them giving me head simultaneously, one of them riding me while the other sat on my face...etc. The list goes on. We went two rounds before all going to sleep in our third's full-sized bed...then my girlfriend wakes both of us up and we have fun for another hour. There must've been around 20 orgasms between the three of us.

The next day, we all wake up (obviously exhausted and not wanting to go to work), she kisses us both goodbye, and my girlfriend and I are on our way. We're walking arm in arm, the entire time talking about how we couldn't believe what just happened, and already planning on doing it again at least once in the near-distant future.

It was pretty much the greatest night of my life---and honestly, with the amount of trust between all three parties, planning beforehand, caution exercised (protection was used and we frequently washed up in between sex acts), a rock-solid relationship with my girlfriend, and not to mention a shitload of patience on my end during the last decade---I felt entitled to share it :)

**OP TL;DR: GF and I hooked up with another couple and now she regrets it because she feels jealous after seeing me and the other woman enjoying one-another. What do?** 

First and foremost, thank you kindly for all of the advice and words of encouragement. She came over last night and we went for a walk before I took her out for dinner. We talked a lot. 

As it turns out, while we were with the switched partners, right after going down on my GF, the husband stuck it in her. This was news to me. This was also what jolted her back to reality and before he was all the way in caused her to freak out and stop. He did immediately, of course, and apparently she hadn't given him oral, just received it, so after that moment, she looked over and saw me and the wife going at it and everything hit her at once. 

She's not mad at them or at me, it was just further than she wanted to go. I'm not mad at him, either. Honestly, it sounds like the natural progression that I was probably moments from with his wife, and as none of us had ever discussed this before, an honest mistake. 

I explained that I was alright with the experience, that I found it spontaneous and kind of hot, and that I don't regret the switch, but I'm perfectly alright with avoiding this sort of encounter in the future.

My girlfriend said that she doesn't want to be with another man, and doesn't want me to be with another woman again, though she wouldn't mind making out with another girl herself. Not sure exactly how to interpret this, as I'm not sure how bringing another woman into the bedroom would progress.

After our talk/walk, we had sushi, returned home, watched True Blood, and then made love. Very passionate, lottttttts for foreplay, and I was even able to finish with a condom on (a rarity for me). 

Just wanted to provide you all with an update. Thanks again.

My wife and I have been married for almost 10 years now.  She is a very sensual person but also repressed at the same time. I’m extremely adventurous and perverted and I love it that way – I will literally try anything ONCE.  She appreciates it in me as well; I more than make up for her very conservative approach to sex.  I mean she loves sex but it’s always been very “normal” sex – nothing really adventurous or taboo when it comes to fantasies or fetishes. She's NEVER shown an interest in things taboo or slutty or skanky, that was usually my job.  WELL HOLY SHIT……



Over the past year I’ve had to travel a lot for work,  we would text to each other a lot and that’s when it happened – One night about a week ago, we’re texting each other  and as I always do I like to say really dirty things to her, it amuses me.  The thing is though I know it turns her on!  She usually says things like “I’m going to kiss your penis and stroke it until you cum.” Pretty normal sexting, eh?   Anyway, I said something like “I’m going to throw you up against the wall and fuck your ass like I own you.”  To which she responds - and this is the WELL HOLY SHIT moment – “After you fuck me up the ass I’m going to sit on your face and shit all over you, then I’m going to piss in your mouth and cum all over you.”  



At first I was completely blown away in a fog of WTF and HELLS YEAH and WTF.  I asked her about it a few minutes later and she just said it sounded good.  She went on to say that the idea of pooping on me turned her on – a lot.  Then she asked if I would be down with that.  I said yes because I’m supposed to be the adventurous one, I’m the fetish guy in our relationship and yet I found myself terrified.  I had never thought of being pooped on or pooping on someone, it did not appeal to me.  I returned home the next day, we were planning on doing it that night. 



Well, to be short, she did it.  She took a massive dump on my stomach and proceeded to sit on it and rub her shit covered ass all over my cock and balls.   I was horrified/extremely turned on by how much she was getting off on it.  She had an extremely hard orgasm and said it was one of the best she’s ever had.  



Fast forward to the NEXT DAY – Now it gets REALLY weird.  I told her I didn’t really like the smell, that was my main problem, but I LOVED that she felt like she could share her darkest fantasies with me.  I told her to bring up every dirty fantasy she could think of and I’ll do it.  So later that day she says she wants me to SIT ON HER LAP WHEN SHE TAKES A SHIT IN THE TOILET, which was even stranger to me.  I agreed and she did it.  


Picture this – I’m sitting on her lap and she’s giving me a reach around as she’s shitting in the toilet.  She is moaning and sighing like we’re having crazy wild monkey sex and has one of the longest and loudest orgasms I’ve ever heard.  So that is her new favorite thing to do and we both found out she only one fetish – POOPING and giving hand jobs at the same time.  



Feel free to ask me anything, this isn’t an AMA but I’ll answer your questions.  My head is still spinning, it seems I’ve awakened a monster…..And I kinda love it.  



**TL:DR – My wife found out she has a poop fetish and has orgasms while pooping.**  



**UPDATE - I asked my wife what is so hot about handling my junk while she dumps. Her exact response - ""It's kinda like there's a dick in my ass and one in my hand.""  A Dick made of POO?
I guess she possibly wants to get spit roasted and have anal sex, we tried it (anal) before and she did not like it.

1374940950.0,676,self.sex,1j5xzq,Worst sex you ever had?,911,235,787,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1j5xzq/worst_sex_you_ever_had/,"Before I begin, I want to say that I'm not trying to be mean with this thread. I just feel like some sexual experiences are just so bizarre and horrible that we can all get a good laugh out of them. As long as everything is kept anonymous, I don't see any harm in sharing some stories. ;) That being said...


I met this guy on OKCupid a couple of months ago and we dated for less than three weeks. Let's refer to him as Larry. So, Larry was only the third guy I was ever sexually active with, and the sex was so bad that I'm almost mad at myself for even sleeping with him in the first place. Call me traditional, but for some weird reason I like keeping my 'number' as low as possible. However, I was really horny after being single for a year and I figured, ""Hey, why not? *How bad could it be?*""


Larry often talked about how many girls he had been with before me, also commenting that he would love to be a porn star if he had the chance to do so. Sadly, what he failed to mention is how selfish he was in the bedroom. Before we had sex for the first time, I specified that I would need non-latex Skyn condoms because I had a latex allergy. He assured me that he would buy them so I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of getting them myself. When we were getting down to business and I was getting myself warmed up (he had no concept of foreplay), he slipped on a condom and we got started. I immediately felt a burning sensation and began to get the chills while sweating. I was legitimately shivering and told him to stop. Instead of stopping, Larry would merely slow down and tell me to ""just relax."" I couldn't take anymore and made him stop.


After apologizing and thinking it was all my fault (from not having sex for a while and being ""too tight"" or whatever else could have been my doing), I had a moment of clarity.
&gt;""Hey, did you get those condoms I had told you about?""

&gt;"".........""

&gt;""You know, the non-latex ones I told you about?""

&gt;""Oh. Uh. I couldn't find them.""

&gt;"".......they sell them EVERYWHERE. Any CVS or Walgreens would have them... so what brand did you buy anyway?""

&gt;""You know, those NYC ones.""

&gt;""Those are latex. And they're free. Did you even GO to a STORE to look for the ones you said you'd get for me?""

&gt;""................no......... I just grabbed whatever was in the bowl at the guidance office, I didn't think it was a big deal. *I never had this problem with any other girls.*""


So not only did this kid lie when he promised to get the right condoms, but he chose to wear a condom I was allergic to, all while comparing me to all the **other girls** he's ever been with--mind you--while I was naked in bed suffering in a cold sweat. I was outraged. I got dressed and left, hoping that he'd earn some points and maybe wouldn't fuck it up the next time we tried.


Even with the right condoms, you could tell Larry watched WAYYYYY too much porn. Don't get me wrong, I **love** porn and like to use it for ideas. But instead of paying attention to what I asked for in bed (I'm extremely direct about what feels good), he would ignore me, shove my knees behind my head, and fuck me like he had a plane to catch in 20 minutes. It was horrible. I tried making it better by switching to different positions, but doggie-style was even more mechanic and monotonous. I didn't feel a thing despite him ramming me like my naked ass owed him money. He would also finish in less than two minutes or lose his hard-on between changing positions, so I was starting to run out of ideas. I never flipped out or got bitchy with him because he would often experience some self-hatred when not being able to perform. Figured it'd be better not to make it worse.


I, being an optimist, figured, ""God, this shit is bleak so far. Maybe his oral is really good and I just haven't experienced it yet?""

Noooooooooooope.

You ever see pigs at a feeding trough? That's what it looked like when I looked down at my lady bits during this act. And not only was Larry messy with no technique whatsoever, he would do this weird growling thing while rubbing back and forth quickly and forcefully with his chin. His stubble was literally scratching my labia. It felt like I put on panties made from a burlap sack and went horseback-riding for five hours. He wouldn't use his hands at all, except to squeeze my non-dominant tit like a stress ball with one hand while using his other hand to jerk himself off. **I never had an orgasm within the time we dated.**


Anyway, does anyone else have stories of their worst sex ever? What made it so bad?

**EDIT - 7/28, 2:15AM -**

Answers to some frequently asked questions:


**Q.** *Why are you keeping count? ZOMG STOP SLUT SHAMING*

**A.** I wasn't try to slut-shame by saying that, so I'm sorry if I had offended anyone. It's just a personal preference of mine to really get to know someone before sleeping with them (I can't get into it otherwise), and the fact that I don't socialize much at all means I don't meet too many people. Hence, my number is pretty low and I find a weird satisfaction in keeping it that way. I like knowing that I can rub one out and not necessarily ""need"" to fuck someone to get off, but BY NO MEANS am I passing judgement on those who fuck casually. To be honest, I wish I was comfortable with doing that myself, but I'm just... not. Just a personal thing lol

**Q.** *Why didn't you just provide your own condoms since you needed special ones?*

**A.** I had offered to do so, but he seemed a lot more jazzed about fucking than I did (although I wanted to fuck, he was a lot less patient about it if that makes sense). In all his excitement, he was like, ""I'll make it perfect for you baby! Just tell me what you need."" I told him and he didn't follow through. That's why it sucked so much.

**Q.** *Why bother even giving him a second chance after he was such an asshole?*

**A.** I try to find the best in people, and it's rare that anyone's first sexual encounter with someone is perfect. You still have to learn each other's bodies and what each of you likes, so that's why I gave him another shot. He apologized about not getting the right condoms and everything so I figured we could just communicate better from then on. Alas, he still never listened to my needs in bed after that either (trying to mimic porn--not in the good way) even though I did everything he liked. He loved blowjobs because I actually PAID ATTENTION, but then I was never getting the pleasure I needed in return and it got old really fast. Turns out his impotence was a side-effect of the anti-depressants he was taking because he was so depressed after his ex. (I didn't learn about this until after we fucked and him being hung up on her and miserable was our real reason for breaking up.)

**Q.** *What in the fuck is a dominant tit?*

**A.** It's the one that feels better when fondled. Sorry for not making that totally clear, but some of the female commenters knew what I meant immediately haha

1373210958.0,676,self.sex,1hszim,my partner and I just had our first real group sex experience.,1053,377,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1hszim/my_partner_and_i_just_had_our_first_real_group/,"On vacation, we found a couple online in the city we were visiting. We all met up for dinner and a drink, and we all got along well. They were a great match for us--smart, sexy, our age (mid-20s) and secure in their own relationship. Their accents were pretty cute too.

They invited us over a few days later and after a lot of wine and beating around the bush, the girl kissed me (I'm the girl) and things took off from there. This was my second time kissing a girl and my first time actually making out, and I really enjoyed it. She was really pretty and had a lot of personality, and didn't seem shy at all. Both guys watched us making out and undressing each other on the couch and then after a while we moved to the bedroom. The guys watched a little longer and then one of them joined us. The guys took turns with us until we were all ready to start having intercourse, and then we each had sex with our usual partners while touching, kissing and otherwise enjoying everyone else. For the most part I think we did a good job of  letting ourselves just be in the moment, and not being too self-conscious. It was definitely mostly about the two girls (one girl or the other was the center of attention at all times). 

Although my partner and I had been nervous beforehand, things happened very naturally and it was a lot of fun, and very pleasurable. We had been afraid of destabilizing our relationship and messing up what we have, and afraid that we wouldn't be able to handle seeing each other with other people--but we came away from the experience feeling proud of ourselves, liberated, and closer than ever. I was surprised by how selfless I felt in the moment; I loved feeling like we were contributing to the other girl's pleasure, and was happy to share my guy for that purpose. It didn't feel like a threat to our relationship at all. I found myself feeling good and curious but not jealous. All in all, after all that caution and worry, we feel like it wasn't as big a deal as we had made it beforehand. For us this was basically a 100% positive experience and super hot and fun. The novelty of it and the physical feelings were overwhelming, thrilling.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who might be fantasizing about it! We made a dream come true and it was awesome. As of now we are down to do it again. If you are going to do it, know your boundaries and make them clear (be conservative about that and if you and your partner disagree, go with the more conservative one). Also be sure to communicate as much as possible both beforehand with each other and beforehand with the other people, and be all right with communicating during the encounter to make sure that everyone is comfortable and happy. Other than that, try not to be too shy, and be yourself. The wonderful thing about this kind of experience is discovering another person, and they are looking forward to discovering you, so let them get to know you for who you are.

I am basically just wondering, is this normal? Do other people feel a bit off emotionally when they're not having sex? I have a high libido in general and especially when I am in a relationship-again, don't know if that makes a difference or not.

And every time I read about one of those things, the person who comes to the internet feeling self-conscious or down on themselves (or even happy and in a sharing mood) gets nothing but reassurance and support and really good ideas about how to deal with their experience.

The wife and I had been going through a rough sex patch for the last year or so. Sex maybe once a week, if I was lucky. (Edit from wife: maybe twice a month. He's being generous.)

First thing that started improving things? We both lost a bunch of weight. I'm down 35lbs. I'm not sure how much she's down, but its at least 10 inches off her waist (edit from wife: 33lbs). She looks amazing. I can't keep my hands off her. Not that she wasn't beautiful before, but she's so much happier (and skinnier!) now.

Second, we've been slowly trying to be more open about sex, and talking about our wants and needs. Its a bit awkward at first saying things like ""uh...um...when I uh...finish...in you."" and now we can have a totally normal feeling conversation, but about the dirtiest, kinkiest things.

Third, last weekend we both drank enough to kill a small horse, and finally opened up to each other. She's always admitted to having some penis envy, and joked about wanting to fuck me with a strapon, but I never thought she was really serious.

She was.

What I never told her was, I wanted her to! I've always loved massaging my prostate while I jerk off. At first it was like ""that's kinda gay"". But after I thought about it (and a lot of liquor helped with courage) I said ""no. Its not gay if its a chick that's plowing you in the ass.""

So we went out and bought a double dildo. Again, it was a little awkward going to the sex toy shop. But now I feel like I could strut in there like I own the fucking place.

We had the best sex of our lives last weekend, and it lasted 10x longer than any other sex session we've had. And we did it again the next night! We've had to take a break the last few nights because we're both sore, but we're getting back on the horse tonight, and fucking each others brains out.

I feel so great that I can finally be completely open with her, and tell her what I really want. And she doesn't think I'm weird! I was SO afraid I'd tell her how I like playing with my ass, and she'd just get grossed out.

Instead, we looked at toys on amazon, and bought stuff that we both wanted. I now have a large Doc Johnson butt plug that feels amazing, and she got a set of Luna balls.

I just wanted to share how absolutely happy I am with myself and my relationship right now.

Anyway, my boyfriend knew about this. And I guess today he wanted to do something about it once and for all. When I got to his place he threw me on his bed and started making out with me, grabbing me. He tied my arms to the bedposts. He said I had been a bad girl and he had to punish me. He walks away and leaves me there, yearning for it. When he finally comes back it was with a blindfold. He covers my eyes and a few seconds later starts dripping water on me, rubbing my boobs and kissing me and touching me everywhere. I am super turned on a NEED him at this point. He tells me that he is going to let one of my arms untied and he wont fuck me until I get myself off.

So there I was, rubbing my clit while he is sucking my nipples, kissing me, telling me what a dirty girl i was for touching myself, and I came. HARD.

My wife and I are in our early 30s and we have been married for four years. We have two young kids and our sex life has really basically gone to shit over the past couple years.

I lost focus and enthusiasm as a partner when she was constantly not in the mood or just unexcited or unwilling to have sex. And eventually my eyes started to wander.

I ended the affair and was planning on just keeping it to myself and working on our marriage, because I do love my wife and I do love our family. This weekend, I was in a bad place emotionally and the guilt was eating at me and I confessed to her. I told her that I cheated and I expected her to yell at me, kick me out, threaten me with divorce. 

It wasn't good by any means, but we both broke down and cried and cried and realized we loved one another. And then we had sex. Probably two hours after I confessed and it might have been the best sex we have ever had. It was just so emotional and so perfect. And then we had sex like teenagers the rest of the weekend. Multiple times on Saturday and Sunday, and then I got a morning blowjob today. We probably had sex more in the past three days then we have had in the past year.

1354179023.0,654,self.sex,13zi3c,My boyfriend has made me hate giving blowjobs.,933,279,415,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13zi3c/my_boyfriend_has_made_me_hate_giving_blowjobs/,"Blowjobs are my boyfriend's favorite thing, but he (28m) has made me (24f) hate giving them.

I am pretty submissive in the bedroom and when I first started exploring my sexuality, I was actually surprised by how much I liked blowjobs. Past boyfriends were both encouraging and dominant when receiving - they'd face-fuck me, hold me down, grab my hair, moan, breathe differently, talk dirty, etc. I was usually sopping wet by the time they finished, and then they would take some time to please me, often getting themselves excited enough for P in V sex soon after. Win-win for me.

My current boyfriend is different. He is the equivalent of a ""dead fish"" while receiving. In fact, he's pretty quiet during most sexual encounters (I have been trying to change this; he doesn't seem willing) but for me, the audible effects of giving a guy head are a big part of the reward and the learning process. It's hot to hear someone enjoying sexual pleasure (even through sharp breaths or something, I'm not asking him to put on a bad porn-star-esque show) and it's a good way to figure out what someone likes. My boyfriend closes his eyes and remains pretty expressionless for the whole thing, doesn't like when I look up at him, and very rarely touches me.

To make matters worse, my bf lasts very long during oral. This is not a rare thing amongst guys, in my experience, but my boyfriend only lasts about 5-7 minutes tops during P in V. During oral, it's closer to 25-30 minutes of expressionless dead-fish syndrome, in which he refuses to give me feedback, insists that it feels really good, yet asks me to stop every once in a while because he's getting desensitized. Towards the end, I can feel his dick swell up, so I know he's close and I shouldn't stop what I'm doing, but until then, it's really not fun or rewarding for me.

Before you say ""communicate,"" I've tried. We've been together for a year and a half. We've had many talks about this. At first, I tried to give bjs anyway, but to be honest, I just can't anymore. He does not try to help me get off after he does (actually, after a few talks, he has started offering, but it is always very grudging, often accompanied by a heavy sigh) and he has such a long refractory period/low sex drive that a bj today means no sex for the whole day at least, and sometimes a few days beyond.

I have a very high sex drive; I want sex every day, and to me, it seems like a waste to spend so much time on a bj that I'll get nothing out of, for no attention in return.

And yet, I've seen the porn he watches when I'm not around. Blowjob after blowjob after blowjob scene. 

I know this isn't our only sex issue, but I really love this guy and I want to please him. I always suck on him before sex, even if he smells, but if I'm horny, I want action.

Today, after I'd been sucking on him, he seemed so upset that I asked for sex that I immediately lost all desire to do anything sexual. He started complaining that I ""never blow him,"" and I explained to him, once again, that I am happy to give him a bj, but he makes it difficult for the above reasons. He told me that it's fucked up that I need ""constant reassurance"" just to give a blowjob and he just isn't a vocal person, so he doesn't know what to tell me. Then, he took his wet, hard, saliva-covered penis, rolled over, and went to sleep.

I see threads in /r/sex a lot where guys say they wouldn't date someone who wasn't giving them a lot of oral, but guys - you really have to put some effort into it too!

Also, I find it pretty insulting that my guy refuses to kiss me if I have sucked on him at all. I used to say that was a deal-breaker, and now I have made an exception for him, but it's just another bj related thing to hesitate and be bitter about.

As I've said, this isn't our only sex issue, but we have been at least actively working in some of the others (such as frequency). The bj thing, though, is clearly something that bothers him yet he seems angry that I ask him to do anything differently himself. 

I really don't know what I expect to get out of this thread. Mostly just the therapeutic aspect of getting it off my chest - this isn't something I can just go talk to my friends about. If anyone cares to offer advice, though, I'm all ears.

I CAN'T be the only one who thinks this, and for those that do think these things and still ENJOY it... how? Would you make love to a pile of shit on the floor? There doesn't seem to be too much difference.


Before I get the talking to, she does know I'm a little put off by it, but I haven't outlined these concerns to her so graphically because I definitely don't want her to feel dirty. Because it's not her fault... it's how the human body works, and moreso, it appears to be MY problem. As I perused some of the anal discussions before posting, I don't see many people like me joining the conversation. What if you smell it? Do you smell it sometimes? Are you turned off by it or is it totally cool to have shit smell in the room during sexy time? 


I would like to please her, and she really enjoys it when we do it. I like the feeling during the moments of respite that my mind isn't taking over... This could be good for us (and for me, anal seems to by highly persued by most guys) HELP ME!

There was lots of drama at this party, and a guy who was hitting on me the entire time asked if I would like to go for a drive. So we drove around flirting and talking for a while, and he (of course) took me to his place. 

We laid in his bed and talked for a bit until he leans and kisses me. We start to make out, and he is soon on top on me, heavily kissing and touching. This is the first time I've done anything outside of my previous relationship, and I'm having a great time. 

The entire time, he never asks for a thing in return. He reaches down and unbuttons my shorts, and pulls them off. He licks his finger and slides one into me, and fingers me roughly. I've never felt it like that before, he's pressed up against my gspot constantly, I can't hold in my moans. I was pulling his hair and biting his ear. 

After that he smiles at me, and kisses me. He then pulls off my underwear and immediately goes down on me, fully eating me out. I gasp, and moan. After about a full minute he stops and tells me ""you taste so good"" and returns to licking me for another 20 minutes between kissing. Then we take a break, and cuddle, kissing and talking every so often. Soon he returns to licking and eating me out, and he can't seem to get enough. About 30 minutes later he stops and cuddles with me again, telling me how gorgeous, smart, and sexy I am. He repeats it every 2 minutes or so. I tell him I have to go home soon, he grabs me in his arms and says ""I want you to stay here and cuddle for the rest of the night. I want to take you anywhere you want tomorrow."" I of course don't want to leave. I agree to stay a little longer. 

Soon he begins to get horny again, so he hints that he could use some attention. I give him several blowjobs, and a handjob, the way he moans turned me on so much. The whole night and morning we didn't have sex, or orgasm, but it was simply amazing. After much convincing he drives me home. As we are leaving his apartment, he put his arm around my waist and pushes me against the wall gently and gives me a series of passionate kisses. When he gets to my house to drop me off, he kisses me goodbye, and gave me his number, saying I BETTER text him, he wants to see me again, and hang out. 

Tl;dr Met a guy at a party, he takes me home, and eats me out and fingers me for a full hour without asking for a thing in return. I gave him a blowjob and a handjob. He was amazingly sweet, easy to talk to and intelligent. He drops me off at home, and says he can't wait to see me again.

So! I talked to him about how I wasn't sure if I would be into it, but I was more than willing to explore/try it out with him. He was totally cool with it, he told me he wanted to do it more for himself than for me, which gave me a ton of relief. So we didn't get to it for a while until he gave me a present about 2 weeks ago. He bought me a gorgeous bra which I was so thrilled about, but he also bought one for himself. So the other day I ask if I can give him a makeover (I love putting makeup on people and I thought it would be a good way to wade into the role reversal thing so I can see what it's like) and he's thrilled. So I bring my kit over, and I do his makeup, he likes it and we move to the bedroom. 

He puts on some fishnets that I gave him and the aforementioned bra and we go at it. I notice that his moans are more feminine and he's moving his body in a way similar to mine when we have sex. I am not into it AT ALL. I love seeing him release and give over to pleasure when I peg him, but this felt fake and weird to me. I started worrying and getting upset because I felt terrible that I didn't like something he was into. But I put on a brave face and continue until he finishes. I'm picking up my bra from the floor and am about to start a conversation about what happened when he says, ""You can take my bra if you want it baby."" (meaning the bra he bought for himself). I object and say, ""no, it's yours! I'm not gonna take it silly."" and he pretty much tells me he doesn't want it. I think that he noticed that I wasn't into it and is trying to make me feel better, but then he tells me that he thinks the kink was to fill some sort of void that he had before he met me. He was single for a while before we met and he tells me that I am so feminine and awesome that he feels like he doesn't need/want to cross-dress anymore. This whole time I'm really happy, but at the same time worried that he's compromising for me. He keeps reassuring me that he would tell me if he was. Then he tells me that he loves me, for the first time. 

Thank you guys so much for your amazing advice and support, I couldn't ask for a better resource! &lt;3

A lot of you wanted me to keep you updated of any news, I didn't want the update to be lost in all the comments so here is the update.

Olivia called Jane to ask her exactly what happened. Apparently she went through it in detail and stressed that it wasn't my fault and that is was 100% her wrong doing. She admits that she knew it was me but had been fantasising about me all night and got herself worked up and when she woke up and realised I was laying next to her, she apparently couldn't resist and although she knew what she was doing was wrong, she was really turned on and said she couldn't resist.

Olivia has said she want's nothing to do with Jane ever again because she can never forgive her for what she has done. 

I've literally just got off the phone with Olivia. She told me that she had the above conversation with Jane and that she had told her everything that happened in detail. She told me that she realises I was only inside her for a matter of seconds and that Jane confirmed the second I realised it wasn't Olivia I pulled out and was very angry. Olivia told me that she loves me too much to throw our relationship away and although she is still very upset, she has realised that I didn't do anything wrong and all her anger and hurt should be directed at Jane and not me. She said that she is not going to get over in any time soon, but she doesn't want to be without me and want us to work through it slowly and take things one step at a time. I'm going over there in about an hour. Hopefully we can work things through and get back to normal. It's just a shame that we have lost two good friends.

But, I am so happy I can't even begin to explain. I just wanted to say Thank You again to everyone who gave me advice and offered support. There really are some genuinely nice and thoughtful, caring people on Reddit. **Thank you Redditors!**

1346738695.0,640,self.sex,zbnsn,PSA: How to have great sex in a marriage/long term relationship.,923,283,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zbnsn/psa_how_to_have_great_sex_in_a_marriagelong_term/,"Sexxit,

I've been married with kids for 15 years, here are some three tips for you to consider so you don't end up in a similar position though what works for me might not work for you.

First up, sex isn't something that should never be used as some sort of bargaining tool in a relationship. Your partner doesn't owe you sex and constantly demanding oral/more sex or saying 'hey I did this so you should have sex with me' is detrimental to any relationship. **DO NOT** do shit like not physically touch your wife for three months because she doesn't have sex with you or some other kind of object lesson. Your aim in any relationship or marriage should be to grow and mature in love together, not put the other partner down physically,  emotionally or sexually.

As a side not, I want to point out that it doesn't matter if your partner has a lower libido than you but what does matter is their willingness to accommodate you and also your ability to compromise. If you're thinking of marriage or getting into a long term relationship, I'd recommend you go to pre-marriage counselling and get all your shit sorted out there. People's sexual tastes and preferences may change but as long as there is communication and the ability to accommodate and support each other and the desire to try new things, most issues can be resolved.

Secondly, as you get older, you tend to work longer hours and with kids, you're going to have less time for yourself much less together. Having sex in a marriage is all about good time management and finding time together. Even simple things like setting aside a 'date night' where you can go and just spend non-sexual time together or waking up that hour early to get a quickie in before work. Don't come home after a long day and expect sex, especially if your partner is the one staying at home and watching your children. It's not like they haven't had shit to do either. Both my partner and I work 60-70 hour weeks in high pressure environments and while that doesn't mean sex every couple of days or even every week, the relationship is incredibly strong. You just have to learn to work around your time and energy constraints.

As another side note, once you have kids, your whole relationship changes and it will be some time for her body to adjust (a number of women also suffer from things like post natal depression) so you do need to adjust your expectations and work on improving the relationship as a whole, not just on your sex life.

Finally, get in a habit of reevaluating your whole relationship every couple of months or even years. Talk openly about what you're doing right but also on what you're doing wrong and if you do need help, go find a neutral third party. It's better to deal with any issues early than to have it fester and poison the relationship years later. Sex is important but your relationship with a long term partner should be much more important than that. What if one of you got into an accident and you were physically unable to ever have sex again? Would you leave them then and there? 

A long term relationship can't and shouldn't be based on just sex. Once you've worked that out, everything else will flow naturally.

Having great sex in a marriage with kids isn't easy but it's something you need to be proactive about and it's definitely doable.

***Edit:*** took out the bit about the other poster as I'm not trying to 'correct' him or save his marriage or whatever but I do wish him all the best. All I'm trying to say is great sex is possible in a marriage with kids but it involves a lot of communication, the right person and a metric fuckton of work. There's no magical formula or certain actions that you can take but it's more about building a healthy attitude and philosophy towards your relationship which should (and I think will) result in a better sex life.

I've had some PMs so I'm going to generalise some of the responses here.

About specific actions you could do as a married partner with kids and I'd suggest having a 'date night' where you drop the kids and focus on your partner (even if it simply means moving the tv to their room, putting on a Ice Age marathon and turning the volume up so you can spend some alone time). 

I'd also recommend you talk openly on a yearly or half yearly basis with your partner not just about sex but about everything in the relationship as well. A common example used is to think of a marriage like a business where both of you are the owners. It's not enough just to do your share and then sit back and complain about how your marriage is failing because your partner sucks. If they're not pulling their weight then it's your responsibility to pick up the slack.

There's no point in holding grudges or trying to find ways to hurt your partner especially if you have kids. Just because she did a shitty thing to you three months ago doesn't mean you should bring it up as leverage if she doesn't want to have sex with you tonight. Also don't get your kids involved in your fights. What the fuck man?

Telling your partner how sexually unfulfilled you are is not a good motivator. If both parties want to make it work, you need to make mutual sexual satisfaction a long term process as opposed to hoping that it'll magically result in sex the next night.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1346767549.0,,,True,t3_zbnsn,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zbnsn/psa_how_to_have_great_sex_in_a_marriagelong_term/,

Let's get a little love for it, so Reddit, what is your opinion/stories/tips on super intense make-outs?",844,213,327,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/10h50c/the_intensity_and_simple_joy_of_making_out_lets/,"I recently made out with a crush I had during a dry spell. I seriously thought my sex drive packed up and left on me. So here's a story, an opinion and some tips.

As I've gotten older (I'm 19, lost it at 15) sexual contact changed so much for me. When I was younger, making out was so new and enjoyable. I felt that it was enough.

Fast forward to now where my last hook-ups are about 5 minutes before we'd take our clothes off. Sure I enjoyed it, but I sometimes missed enjoying just making out. However, it just felt like a pre-tense.

Recently, after aformentioned dry spell I ended up making out with my crush for hours. We made out like kids in a parking lot. There was so much passion and I swear it lasted over half an hour. No below the waist touch, no clothes being removed. Unf. Led to sexy times later, but the forplay never seemed forced, just wonderful. And it's interesting because he was 9 years older than I, and I thought the older one gets the less makeouts occur. It was the sexiest thing I've experienced in what seems like forever.

Anyways, I think doing these things again would be nice. What's your opinion on just making out? Any sexy-time stories?

Pro-tip: Biting, necks (How to avoid hickies?), pulling hair = oh sweet jesus.

We became friends over those two years and were very comfortable with each other. We chatted a lot of things other than school work, like girls and other gossip. She's in her late thirties and still very attractive. She has a perfect figure, beautiful skin, and pleasant face.

One day I came over to her home for my usual tutoring session and could sense she was really upset. She told me her son (who's two years younger than me) was always in trouble, and since she and her husband were separated (read: NOT divorced), she always had to deal with him herself and was constantly stressed out. 

I held her in my arms as she cried into my shoulder. I rubbed her back and stroked her hair and told her that I hated to see her so sad because I liked her so much. She looked up at me, and the next thing you know, we start kissing passionately. 

I knew it was wrong, but because it was wrong, it felt so sexy. We made out passionately on the couch, and things quickly escalated. Pretty soon, we were in her bedroom, having the most passionate sex I've ever had. She told me she hadn't had sex for five years, and she was horny as hell. I got her off three times that first time we hooked up. 

We've been meeting more and more often now. I feel terrible about this sometimes when we're apart, but I just can't stop. The sex is too amazing and I'm living out every teenage boys' dream. Should I feel bad about this? Am I legally in the clear? I think my parents are starting to get suspicious. 

Edit: thanks for the input reddit. I like how I'm getting a range of comments from high-5 bro to ""be responsible"". 

Just wanted to clarify a few points. She's no longer my tutor. We stopped the academic sessions after we realized that there was no way we could do work because we could never stop touching each other. When I payed her for ""tutoring"" I usually bring cash in an envelope. We joked that it was too much like prostitution. 

Anyway, I'm still seeing her...just on our own time

However, we have an issue that I haven't seen addressed on here before.  My girlfriend has intense orgasms (she often squirts), but whenever she cums, she says her lady bits immediately get super sensitive, which causes her to ""lose interest"" in the moment (just like a guy).  So, if she ""finishes"" before I do, she makes me pull out.  

So, unless we both simultaneously orgasm (which is rare), one of us doesn't get to finish.  Moreover, neither of us are able to get off from oral/manual stimulation (I know it's weird, but I can't switch to a BJ after having sex and cum from that, and she's too self-conscious about her hooha to let me go down on her unless she's fresh out of the shower).    

Anyone else facing this situation?  Any advice?  I'm sick of playing the ""who gets to cum?"" game every time we have sex.

Are we perpetuating a (statistical) myth, and perhaps hurting people through unrealism?",861,240,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/18c0a6/is_a_reality_check_in_orderis_rsex_just_filled/,"Some thoughts, if I may.  I'm an older individual who has really struggled with a wife with a lower sex drive/adventurousness than I have.  Now, my case has additional background centering around some religious bullshit that made it harder on us and perhaps makes us atypical.  Between that and the fact that we're dealing with it decently, I'm not here to complain about me or personally troubleshoot anything.  But the reality is that having a loving relationship in my case has involved some sexual settling, in a way that I think is, frankly, pretty typical.  It's not my cluelessness, my delivery or lack of communication, or anything wrong with my wife.  We love each other; we're just different on this area.

I mention the above to admit that its colored my attention, but not so much that I think I'm making things up: when I go to the front page of r/sex, I see a lot posts about girls with sex drives too high for their situations, whilst males in the comments of these posts repeatedly remark about how this has ""given them hope"" that they'll find someone who can keep up with them, or similar such sentiments.

It makes me wonder whether we're telling a balanced story here.  So, I'd love to get r/sex's opinions, taking overall demographics into account, on what's reasonable to expect in a relationship.  Is the voting system just perpetuating a certain unreasonableness by people's (particularly guys') interests?  Are hornier girls just more drawn to this subreddit?  Something else?

I get it.  r/sex's denizens' optimism and ambitiousness is a part of what helps it be so frank and therefore so valuable.  And no one wants to rain on anyone's parade. But is the idea that everyone's going to find someone who is their sexual match a misleading fantasy, even if other things are good?  And if we're really into maximizing sexual relationship health here, should we have a frank discussion about what a ""normal"" libido (mis)match looks like, and how one manages it?  Would a way we can help cultivate sexual health in those who visit this subreddit be, you know, cultivating a realistic, evidence-based perspective on what men and women (heterosexually speaking) tend to want?  Should perhaps the FAQ include this sort of thing?  

I'd love to get people's thoughts.

When I started dating my girlfriend, she told me that, while she very much enjoyed sex, she wasn't very orgasmic. She only came about 6 or 7 times **a year**, and always through penetration. She didn't even think it was possible for her to orgasm from oral stimulation. Well, naturally, I had to prove her wrong on that one. I succeeded on the second try (the first was pretty half-assed as the moment was a bit more passionate and active and I moved on after a few minutes), though it took about 20 minutes. After that, the time involved has dropped considerably down to about 3-4 minutes. 

Then, last week something amazing happened. I hadn't realized she was already in the throes of orgasm when I changed things up a bit. It sent her into a new wave of pleasure. When I figured out what I had done (changing leading up to and during an orgasm is usually a no-no), I switched back to the original rhythm and technique and it did it again. So I started switching between the two, switching it up every ten seconds or so, or as it felt like the orgasm was subsiding. After about 45 seconds or so, she begged me to stop as her clitoris was getting too sensitive. Over the next couple of sessions, I kept trying that and was able to push it up to around two minutes. 

Then, last night, something even more amazing happened. After particularly sensual and passionate foreplay, we skipped oral (well, I did, anyway) and she climbed on top. After just a few minutes, she had an orgasm that lasted, more or less on its own, at least three minutes. I'm feeling like I have opened the floodgates to awesome here. 

**tl;dr** Through patience, hard work, and luck, I have somehow managed to turn my mostly non-orgasmic girlfriend into a woman whose orgasms go on and on.

Edit: added ""a year"" to the bit about how often she normally orgasms.
Edit 2: Wow! Thanks for all the love, Reddit! I have to say that tonight I tried something one of you suggested. I got her going in the usual way and when she was well into it (a minute to a minute and a half into the orgasm), I quickly switched to penetrative sex. When I was done, she said that the orgasm ""pretty much"" kept going the entire time I was fucking her. Sounds like it ebbed and flowed, but didn't completely go away. When I was done, she sat there for a good thirty seconds moaning and convulsing with aftershocks. Pretty awesome!

I'm a 21 year-old guy and I have been dating a girl (21 also) for a while. Our sex life is pretty good, although she usually doesn't orgasm through sex (it takes her between an hour and two hours to do so if at all). That's never really that much of a problem due to her enjoying the sexual experience and me getting her off in other ways.

The issue I'm having is that during sex, she is quite loud. I've never before been with a woman who vocalises during sex, and to be honest, it's a massive turn on for me. Therein lies the problem.

I find it extremely difficult to control myself when she really gets into the sex. I'm pretty good at delaying orgasm if I get over-excited (kegel exercises etc.), but sometimes we're having sex and her moaning simply pushes me over the edge, often far too soon for my liking.

Is there a way I can block it out? I've obviously tried the ""think about baseball"" tactic but sometimes she's so loud it's hard to ignore. I don't particularly want to ask her to be quiet during sex because she likes being loud and (evidently) so do I.

Does anyone else have this problem, or have any advice to stop it from sending me over the edge far too early in sex?

EDIT: Another issue is that I'm a one-and-done guy. I'm usually unable to get another erection for a few hours minimum, so although I'm more than willing to (and do) continue with her by using other methods (fingers, oral, toys etc.) so she orgasms, I'm kind of done for that session.

There was much rejoicing and sex but unfortunately there was not much getting off. I had no problem getting and staying hard but finishing didn't seem like it was in the cards. So with some reasearch, some purchases and some patience I was able to start getting off with my girlfriend. How?

I'd like to take a moment to preach the gospel of male sex toys. If you fap once a day every day since you're a teenager you're going to get really used to getting off with your hands deathgrip or not. /r/nofap would tell you that you need to stop fapping totally but in reality you just need to change how you fap and maybe fap a little less. A toy like a Fleshlight replicates the sensation of a pussy wonderfully and does wonders for helping you get off inside a woman.

There's a lot of stigma against dudes owning sex toys but Why should girls get to buy all the fun toys? It won't make you a neckbeard loser or a hopeless virgin. I had my doubts about it too and I had to have some drinks before I could push the ""submit order"" button. They're fun, easy and a pleasant step up from only using your hands. Not to mention that artificial vaginas can distribute pressure more evenly than your hands. 

And so now I'm happily making my girlfriend scream. Right now I can only get off in one position (doggystyle) but that's small potatoes compared to the much bigger problem I fixed.

I tried to defend them saying that its all part of foreplay but apparently that makes me like a porn-star. Yeah right, like porn-stars are the only ones that give blowjobs



Sometimes Im surprised there are such awesome communities like r/sex online. If only my reali life friends were so open. *Sigh*



There I said it: I love blowjobs. I love how good I am at it. I love the feeling in his eyes everytime I kneel down adn unzip his pants. I love his caress of my hair when Im going down on him. I love teasing him with my fingers. I love to see him get rock hard anytime anywhere no matter what hes doing after only 10 seconds of sucking him.

But they've been extremely helpful so far. I'm also glad that a lot of people got to see this because according to the comments, other people have similar issues. This is why r/sex exists! So we can all help each other out. I will most definitely keep reading all your wonderful comments and suggestions and working on this issue... maybe trying NoFap. And I will keep you guys updated of course. 

Upvotes for all of you, you guys are awesome. 


Posted this in r/askwomen, maybe you guys can help me out as well?


I'm a 19 year old female and I have this problem--the female version of death grip masturbation. I started masturbating at a rather young age--7 or 8--and have done it in a certain way ever since. I cross my legs and sort of squeeze my thighs together until I orgasm--usually doesn't take me more than 5 minutes.


This does lead to wonderful orgasms so I'm not complaining, but I am now in my first serious relationship and this has sort of become an issue for me when it comes to sex. I haven't orgasmed any other way before and as good as the sex is, I can't cum from it, or from manual stimulation. And yes, I know a lot of women can't orgasm from sex alone so we do incorporate clit play but I need so much pressure that it becomes impossible and tiring for both of us.


My SO is away this entire month so I want to try and solve this problem. I know I'm going to have to stop masturbating the way I do. I've tried before but it's really hard not to get impatient/frustrated so I just end up giving up and going back to my old ways.


What I'm asking is have any other ladies out there experienced this issue? If so, how did you get past it? 

What are some tips you can give me about masturbating? I've conditioned myself for all these years and I really want to break this cycle. Please help!",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1357837974.0,,,True,t3_16a1f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16a1f1/female_death_grip/,
1344518149.0,621,self.sex,xxr6g,*Update* I stopped viewing porn (again) two weeks ago to see how it effected my libido and sex life for a total of 3 weeks *Results*,962,341,359,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/xxr6g/update_i_stopped_viewing_porn_again_two_weeks_ago/,"I'll preface this by saying I have no problem with porn or masturbation. I think they're both healthy aspects of a healthy sex life. My only reason for doing this experiment was out of curiosity. I wanted to see how my consumption of porn effects my libido, performance, enjoyment of sex, and any other day to day things. Also, keep in mind that the results I'm posting are my own. I don't claim that what I felt throughout this will apply to anyone else, because we're all different.

I'll be doing this according to the scientific method.


**Question:** What effects does the consumption of pornography have on my libido, performance, sexual performance, and day to day life?


**Research:** [Research Indicates](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/x7khw/update_i_stopped_viewing_porn_a_week_ago_to_see/) that people who previously consumed porn and have abstained experience the following:

 * Moderate to extreme frustration ( ""putting an angry cat in a bag"" )
 * Increased Aggression
 * Mood Swings
 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality
 * Drop in libido, followed by a recovery of libido.
 * Higher stamina during sex
 * More fulfilling and easier to achieve orgasm
 * More energy


**Hypothesis:** I hypothesize a personal increase in frustration, increased libido, sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality, and I expect to see changes in my sex life. However, I will be testing the above mentioned claims as well.


**Testing**
The criteria for the experiment are simple, and are as follows: No pornographic images or videos of any kind allowed for the extent of the experiment. This includes nude pictures, videos or anything that would typically arouse me. Keep in mind that I'm a redditor, so clicked links in threads do indeed bring me to nudes once in a while. When this happens I just back out as fast as I can and don't linger. So yes, I did actually see some nudes during the course of the experiment, but not on purpose and not to sexually gratify myself.

An unfortunate consequence of this is that I don't really masturbate without porn. I'm 25, so when I started masturbating at 12 or 13, I had access to porn on the internet. In my teen years I could masturbate without porn of course, but now that I'm in my 20's I can't really do it without some kind of excitement or visual stimuli. So, basically I haven't been masturbating throughout the experiment. This is offset, however, by the fact that I'm married and very much sexually active with my wife.

**Analysis and conclusions:**

I started a sort of journal to document this, so here is how I felt each day of the experiment.

Days 1-2: Sex drive was bombed these two days after a discussion with my wife relating to the effects of last weeks 'porn fasting'. Without going into details, I was trying to explain how it made me feel, and she was doing her best to be OK with it. She tries not to make a big deal about it, but I can tell the concept that I crave seeing other women naked bothers her. I feel awful, so my sex drive is awful in relation.

I also want to note that I somewhat consider last week somewhat applies to the current experiment, considering I only viewed porn once.

Days 3-4: Frustration starting to creep in. Olympics doesn't help with all of the ass hanging out. Revealing clothing is much harder to not glimpse. Damn you women's diving, beach volleyball and swimming.

 * Moderate frustration **Confirmed**
 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality **Confirmed**

Day 5: Today I think it's really plateaued. I have the urge to look up pics or videos fairly often, and it takes effort to get my mind off of it. Sex is good and is easier to orgasm, but I didn't have much trouble before. 

 * Near extreme frustration **Confirmed**
 * Change in sex life **Confirmed**
 * Easier to Achieve Orgasm **Confirmed**

 * Increased Stamina **Debunked**

Day 6: What is this sport? Water Polo or something? It's like soccer or hockey in the water, and everyones swimsuit is a thong. Fucking. Thongs.

 * Extreme Frustration **Definitely Confirmed**

Day 7: Very confused by my addiction to novel nudity. I feel like I shouldn't crave it like I do, and I feel bad especially when trying to discuss the experiment with my wife. Can't help but feel like she doesn't understand, and it hurts her that I feel the need to look at other women. If I put myself in her place I think I wouldn't really care if she craved porn or seeing guys naked, although I guess that's irrelevant because it makes her feel bad and that's all that's important. I'll note that this is something that she is wanting to get past, and she has actually made a lot of progress in self-esteem. It's unwanted tension though, and it makes me really not want to discuss it with her any more. On the upside, the wife's libido has been up the past couple days and we've been active daily! This is awesome and helps a ton.

Day 8: The weekends are brutal. Wife has been working all day, so I'm home alone with the baby. Pretty ridiculously hard not to browse /r/gonewild while idle or when the baby is napping. Oddly, I wasn't very 'in the mood' this evening, but the wife definitely changed that. I'm not sure why I crave porn during the day but not sex.

 * Loss of libido **Plausible**

Day 9: I'm wondering that if this 'addiction' is not common amongst men and women (which I actually expect that it is common), then I may have this issue because my wife is the only sexual partner I've had in my life. My urges to 'spread my seed' are subdued by exposing myself to porn. What did people do before porn was accessible? Either people didn't crave nudity as much, or they were a lot more sexually mischievous or sneaky. Perhaps some research is in order.

Libido is back today in full force.

This sucks. I've been thinking about quitting the last couple days.

Day 10: Nothing all that new. Still thinking of quitting. I might just start grouping days together unless something eventful happens. I'm not an aggressive or moody person to begin with, but I'm going to throw these out the window today. Not gonna happen.

 * Increased Aggression **Debunked**
 * Mood Swings **Debunked**

Day 11: Last night kind of sucked. I was in the mood and tried to get something started (didn't progress because my wife wanted to shower first) but we fell asleep on the couch. Normally this wouldn't bother me, and I'm not mad or anything but I did have some pent up urges as we migrated to bed. Then the baby kept me up most of the night. I really need a coffee today but I quit about the same time (also, red meat) as restarting this experiment because I'm having a bout Ulcerative Proctitus (which sucks because I enjoy anal play). 

One nice thing is that my wife is indeed amazing and she texted me first thing this morning to say she was sorry because of the night before. Apparently I have a great blow job to look forward to tonight :)

Day 12: I feel good today. I got my gift from last night, and it was so good I actually had a second wind before bed! I usually can't get it up twice in one night but last night was no problem, so I was glad to get a blow job AND have sex in the same night. My urge to look up pics today still exists but it's not aggravating like before. My libido is still high. I think in the few weeks before this experiment I was beginning to have second winds more often, so I'm not positive last night was attributed to the experiment. It's more likely that my wifes performance is what triggers these, but I'll go ahead and say it's plausible.

Oh.. and the baby only woke up once last night, so I slept pretty well. It's a good day.

 * Change in Sex Life: Improved **Plausible**

Day 13: Was a bit frustrated last night because of Olympic beach volleyball, but the wife helped me with that. It seems the mornings are a bit easier now. Nothing else new to report!


**Results:**

 * Moderate frustration **Confirmed**

 * Sensitivity to revealing clothing and sexuality **Confirmed**

 * Near extreme frustration **Confirmed**

 * Change in sex life **Confirmed**

 * Easier to Achieve Orgasm **Confirmed**

 * Extreme Frustration **Definitely Confirmed**


 * Increased Stamina **Debunked**
 * Increased Aggression **Debunked**
 * Mood Swings **Debunked**


 * Loss of libido **Plausible**
 * Change in Sex Life: Improved **Plausible**

So there you have it. It was frustrating, but there were some good changes along with the bad. Overall, I don't think it improved my sex life enough (or at all) to warrant introducing frustration into every day life. For me, porn is healthy and keeps me happier day to day because it helps suppress my primal urges.

One more thing I'll note is the last couple days were a bit easier, but I still craved porn. It just wasn't as frustrating. I may keep going on my experiment but at this point I'm not really sure. It's been 3 weeks with only looking at porn once two weeks ago.. so I'm going to wuss out and say that's enough testing.

Hope you guys enjoyed this. If anyone has any other ideas as to testing they'd like me to do, let me know. Since I'm not eating red meat right now, I'm testing whether or not more fruit in my diet changes my semen taste.. but I haven't been documenting anything.

So here is a cautionary tale for all the young guys and gals out there reading this. As you get older you will become more comfortable having unprotected sex. It is just the way of the world. Your girlfriends/boyfriends will seem more and more wholesome. You will start to tell yourself that you are in a committed relationship and my girl/guy is disease free. It might take three or four months with the person in a committed relationship, but it will happen. You will have sex with them and you won't wear a condom. So to reinforce the importance of condoms, here is my story:

Two days ago, my girlfriend of seven months said she thinks she is getting an anal fissure and asks me to not play with her bum. Sex ensues. Today we sneak away at lunchtime and while we are making out on my bed, she says I have something to tell you. I forgot that I have herpes and that fissure is actually a blister. Seven months of close to daily sex and she only remembers today. Up to this point I was considering marrying her. I'm in my late thirties and she was the nicest sweetest person I have ever been with - in almost twenty years of sexual activity. I thought I would be having kids with her in a few years. My bachelor days of random sex over. Settled down in a happy committed relationship. Growing old together.

Then she dropped a second bombshell on me. She wants to patch things up with the guy before me. 

So no matter how well you know someone. No matter how nice they seem, it is important to protect yourself. Get the STI test together before you have sex with someone without protection. If you have doubts about their fidelity, use condoms. 

sincerely, 

A newly minted Forever Alone

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the replies everyone. There are too many for me to respond to so I just wanted to address a couple of the themes up here. Type 1 (the virus that causes cold sores, but that also infects genitals) causes much milder outbreaks. These outbreaks diminish substantially from the first outbreak. It totally possible to not realize that you have an outbreak especially if you only had minor symptoms when you were infected and there has been a long period of time in between. In that amount of time, I have completely forgotten equally important events in my life. I have forgotten whole friendships, good friendships. I have forgotten about things of equal gravity and importance. 

A lot of people have screamed for blood on this one, but having lived the life I have, I can tell you that revenge tends to leave you feeling empty inside instead of righteous. 

For the people who claim that condoms do nothing to protect you from herpes, this is completely false. It will significantly lower the transmission rate because it will lower the amount of virus you get exposed to. It also protects the part of your body that is most susceptible to the virus. This does not mean that it is safe you have sex with someone with a herpes outbreak. It also does not mean it is safe to have sex with someone with herpes in remission. It just means that the chance of you contracting the disease are much lower. Without lesions present the odds of contracting the disease is much lower, not zero, just much closer to zero.   

Websites like the CDC's are very helpful for becoming informed on STD's please check them out and read up on all the STDs out there and help stop the spread of false information on this subject.

My SO (now-ex) and I are pretty baked in the living room, watching some stand-up comedy on Netflix and just idly chatting. At some point, the conversation, she turns to me and gives me ""the look"". She takes off her glasses, setting them on the counter within arms reach. We start making out and I pull off her hoodie and toss it onto the floor next to the couch. She unbuttons my pants and pulls them down to my knees. She starts going down on me. (It's awesome). Then, she jumps on top of me and we start going at it. At this point, I'm fucking psyched. I have never really done anything like this before and having her take control was pretty sexy. So we're still going at it when the stand-up we were watching on Netflix ends. Still very focused on the situation, I click the next closest thing and go back to it. A few minutes later, I hear a knock on the door. (We have a secret knock for those who live in the apartment.) It's the secret knock. I know it's one of my housemates. My SO hops off, and heads downstairs to our room. I panic and start scrambling to pull my pants back up. I run downstairs and say, ""What do I do? Do I open the door?"" She says yes, so I run back up and unlock the door. At this point, it's been at least 2 minutes from when the knock happened. I'm sweaty, my hair is a mess, and I have a look of determination on my face. I say nothing but ""Hey"" and walk downstairs. My SO and I finish up and I walk back upstairs a little while later. 

Now here is where it gets good. I walk up to see a crime scene. No joke. The entire living room is blocked off by caution tape, there are signs with numbers on them next to ""evidence"". There's one on the bong, my SO's glasses, her hoodie, the projector on which we were watching the shows, and a mysterious spot on the couch (fuck). I look over to my roommates and they are wearing fucking flu masks, head and shoe coverings. They look like a CSI team. They are standing around stone-faced, taking pictures, like it's a real crime scene. They look at me and point to the projector. What's playing? DOGS. A DOCUMENTARY ON DOGS.

*(Pardon my shitty microsoft paint rendition, i'm a psychologist, not a graphic designer and it shows.)*

My SO and I found a way to switch things up a little. He really enjoyed it, more than I expected. By coming at a mouth sideways he said it was tighter, gave him more control, and allowed me to focus more on the head etc. By the same token he was able to reach down and entertain me that way. Both of us came in fairly short order, the view was hot, and it was definitely a different sensation for both of us. 

Also my neck didn't get tired because I didn't have to hold it at the usual awkard angle. I'm always happy to oblige, but it's nice to switch it up now and again, no? 

I just thought it might be good for couples with back issues, gag reflexes, big penis situations, PinV issues etc. We don't have these issues, I just thought it might be versatile. 

I also found myself able to relax and enjoy more, because i wasn't thinking ""uh this is all about me, he's gotta be bored, I'd better get off quickly!"". For me this is ironically, the quickest way to kill an orgasm. Silly brain.

As a dude, I totally understand those concerns. But I think many guys are stressing out over the wrong thing. 

Now, I admit: Any woman who requires a flesh-spear over a certain size in order to be fully satisfied...probably won't be satisfied by me. I don't really know how many of those women are out there: Data on this question are incomplete and contradictory. My best guess is that the number of these women is best described as ""some."" 

But I can accept that those women exist and are beyond my grasp. Because here's a short list of my other key traits: I can't sing. Can't really dance. Can't speak Spanish or Italian. Can't play bass or drums. I'm not much for team sports. I'm not skilled at small-engine repair. And I haven't accepted Christ as my personal savior. So any woman who requires those traits in a partner...*also* won't be satisfied by me.

So of course I'm going to face rejection from women, plenty of times. But at least I know that any woman who rejects me is also rejecting the things I'm *good* at: I'm a great cuddler. I love foreplay. I've received many compliments about my oral technique. I give backrubs without being asked. I can tell a joke, or just make people laugh. I love physical challenges. I can cook, quite a bit in fact. I'm a decent writer and storyteller. And my flesh-spear still has plenty of admirable qualities of its own.

So if any guy is concerned about his ability to satisfy a woman — well, I think that's a good thing to be concerned about: Satisfying a woman is an important goal in life, and there are a lot of obstacles in the way. But you have *so many different ways* to offer a woman satisfaction. My advice is to try to develop a bunch of those. As many as you can, really. So that when you do get rejected — as you inevitably will, many times — you don't automatically start blaming what's in your pants. Instead you'll just accept that none of your good qualities managed to appeal to that woman, on that occasion.

In fact, probably the best advice I can give to any dude is: Learn to cook. Seriously, it works.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1etznf,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1etznf/misconceptions_about_penis_size_a_dudes/,

I'm married to an absolutely spectacular woman, and I couldn't be happier about my decision.  We've been married two years.  We were engaged and living together for a year before that, and were dating for 4 years before that.

The sex is PHENOMENAL.  It gets better every year.  She's the only woman I've ever been with who can make me come so hard I shake.  There was no sudden, alarming change when we got married.  There hasn't been any kind of tapering off.  Neither of us have let ourselves go.  Our relationship ""contract"" includes the idea that we both have very real, physical sexual needs, and committing to each other for life involves taking responsibility for our partner's sexual satisfaction.  During the times that one of us hasn't been up for it for whatever reason (health, job stress, whatever) we always make the stretch to accommodate each other.  It really isn't that hard to get someone off once or twice, especially when it's someone you love, even if you aren't in the mood.  I can say, ""Hey, could a get a beej right quick?"" at pretty much any time and be met with an enthusiastic and immediate response.
 
I saw the thread on the front page about the unfortunate guy with the sexless marriage.  Someone in the comments said that marriage seemed to have more cons than pros, and that had a lot of upvotes.  It doesn't if you do it right.  Don't settle.  Don't get married because you feel pressured or because you feel like it's just the next thing to do.  Don't marry someone who doesn't share your attitudes about sexuality.  Don't expect marriage to fix any existing problems you have.  Marry someone who you love because you think they'll be a good companion for the rest of your life.  Talk beforehand about what you expect your marriage to look like, and realize that it'll probably look about the same as your relationship does right now.

If you marry a woman who only gives blowjobs reluctantly, you will end up with a wife who only gives blowjobs reluctantly, or not at all.  Marry a woman who loves sex and you'll get a wife who loves sex.

Also, a quick shout out for the promiscuous ladies: women who genuinely love sex will usually (not always!) have slept with quite a few people.  Don't let it bother you.  IT IS WORTH IT.  Go out and find you an honest, trustworthy slut and you'll be all set.

EDIT:  Thanks for the upvotes, guys!  The wifey is flattered.  I am totally going to leverage this into anal.  Yeeeaaaaaah.

LOOK OUT, IT'S ANOTHER EDIT:
""You've only been married two years, just wait a few more, then you'll be as sad and miserable as the rest of us.""
Maybe, maybe not.  I'll never regret the decision I've made, regardless, and I say this from experience, having seen some of my most serious relationships fall apart in the worst ways possible in the past.  It was the right choice at the time and I've been happy at least this long, and that's something I'll always have.  The point is, things did not turn to shit as soon as I put a ring on her finger.

When I was 16, out-of-shape 20-year-olds told me that things would change when I hit college.  When I turned 20, out-of-shape 30-year-olds told me everything would change when I hit 25.  Later, it was 30.  Now I'm almost 30 and I'm being told everything will change when I hit 40.  Haters gonna hate.  I like my marriage and you bastards can't take that away from me.

1. Talk to your SO: upfront and direct, tell them EXACTLY what you want or don't want, be prepared for them to do the same; do not expect them to read your mind; tell them how important the issue is, ie if it will cause you to leave the relationship.....be upfront about it

2. Deal with your own insecurities: especially if you are asking your partner to deal with theirs, and do what makes you happy regardless of what everyone else thinks about it

3. Be Open Minded: your SO sees the world completely differently than you do, and that is OK, it is a part of who they are, even if you don't like it

4. Be Yourself: if a relationship doesn't work out, find another one, the world is a much bigger place than your hometown, college, HS, church, etc.

However, every time she hasn't actually gone through with it. At least...until a few days ago. We were showering together and she gave me a blowjob, not an unusual event I'm pleased to say. At the end she finished me off over her face. Well, obviously I was ecstatic, and she looked incredibly beautiful and sexy. But here's the kicker. I got some in her eye, and it ended up bloodshot.

It turns out when some of her friends asked what happened, she told them EXACTLY what happened. These friends have since taken to making my life awkward as hell, basically taunting me for having this fetish.

I've tried talking to her about this and she seems to think it's funny, and that I'm making a big deal out of nothing, even calling me prudish.

Is she right when she says this? Or do I have a right to feel like I've had my trust betrayed. I like to think of myself as a respectful person, and I certainly wouldn't tell any of my friends about my sex life without my partners consent.

But then we were talking about it and he said I was really lucky because it was gross and most men wouldn't even think about doing it. I was actually kind of offended that he would say that, and it made me feel like I was gross. Especially since I give him head all the time with no issues and I enjoy it. I can tell when he's doing it to me, he doesn't like it which makes me not enjoy it as much. Is there a way I can bring this up to him without arguing, and should I tell him that what he said was kind of ridiculous? 

Edit one: thanks for all the positive reinforcement hahah, I don't want to dump him just because of this one thing, but I do want him to know how what he said is pretty wrong.

edit two: i guess I wasn't too clear but I just want you all to know that i would never ever pressure him to do it if he didn't want to! He did it on his own will and I was super happy. I'm not upset that he doesn't want to do it because I completely respect him and his limits, I'm upset that he chose to do it and then complained about it.

last edit i promise: I appreciate everyone giving me their input! but I think it would be super unfair to say that I'm not giving him head anymore just because he won't do it for me. I don't want to manipulate him and force him to do things. Also, i thoroughly enjoy giving him blow jobs so stopping would be bad for both of us :P I get where you're coming from and thank you for your input but I don't want to make him feel bad just because he doesn't love giving head.

I was so horny the other day that while I was masturbating in the shower, I tried sticking a finger in my butt. I was only able to insert up to the first knuckle of my middle finger because it was super tight. When it was in, I didn't feel much but when I tried wiggling my finger (while rubbing my clit), I came so hard that my knees almost buckled.

The next day I tried it again, but I couldn't really slide my finger in past the first knuckle. Farther than that and it starts to hurt a little. Also, I can't help contracting my muscles down there because when it feels good, I involuntarily start contracting my kegel muscles (and my butthole) so my finger gets stuck and I can't wiggle it anymore.

Also, sometimes when I push in deeper, it feels like I'm going to poop, so the good feeling just turns into a weird feeling. But I would really like to go deeper, so how do I stop myself from feeling like I'm about to poop? I tried doing it after doing number 2, so I'm sure there's nothing there.

1301900794.0,596,self.sex,gi5nv,Blow job tips from a girl that has made several men cum from BJs who said they couldn't.,978,382,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gi5nv/blow_job_tips_from_a_girl_that_has_made_several/,"I originally posted this as a comment in a post...but then was asked to make into an actual post. I waited a while, and now here it is. Enjoy!

Here are my tips (not in order):

1. Inhale it if you love it. Love that cock and show it. In other words, enthusiam. Even if you don't know what to do at first just experiment...I sucked like a vacuum my first time and he thought it was funny, but then he came really hard.

2. Learn about his cock. Every single cock has different thresholds for pleasure and pain. I've experienced extremes from men that are so sensitive I couldn't even touch their balls, to one man that wanted me to slap and bite them. The best blow jobs are tailored to each man. No great blow job is the same on every man.

3. For long pleasurable blow jobs mix it up. Example: Suck slowly for a while and take in as much as you can and hold it at the back of your throat (or however far back you can) and then go back to sucking just the head. Vary the speed, pressure...using hands, not using hands...touching the balls, touching under them etc etc...

4. Lips wrapped over the teeth is less tiring (you don't have to open your jaw as much to avoid teeth getting in the way) and gives the guy more pressure when sucking.

5. Lots and lots of saliva. If you don't produce enough, use lube!

6. If you have a gag reflex, remember tip #1. Then realize that you can still learn to deep throat and get face fucked if you want to. If you don't want to that's ok too as you can still give a great blowjob without that....but if you do want to then enthusiasm helps the most. Love the cock your sucking and tell him you need his patience and then proceed to take just enough in before you want to gag and then hold it there!! Then come back up and try it again, or if you feel like puking switch to a hand job for a while.

7. Keep exploring/experimenting if you don't know what he likes. If your man is comfortable with your fingers behind his balls, keep going back to his anus...Don't EVER put anything in man's ass without asking. That's wrong! But reassuring him that you will go slow and just touch the outside is usually ok (if it's not then just stop for now and go back to what you were doing before). Some men will slowly let you to the point of fingering his ass while sucking his cock and then giving him one of the best blow jobs ever...

8. If his cock is curved, then GO WITH THE CURVE. If he curves sideways then you can lay on your side and suck him from his side. If his cock curves up then you can try sucking him with your head over the edge of the bed. If his cock curves down then try him standing and you on your knees. Etc!

9. Combo of hands and mouth = great blowjob. You don't need to just use your mouth and that's it.

10. Says he can't cum from a blowjob? That usually means he needs a woman with lots of practice in the stamina department, but it's possible. He usually just needs a steady rhythm that never stops.

11. Some men need to face fuck in order to cum. That doesn't mean it has to be all the way down your throat. Sometimes all that means is just the head going in and out. You can actually use your tongue to make him stop going further than you want to and that gives him the feeling that he's bottomed out anyways!

12. Want to swallow for him but don't think you can? It's easier to swallow it when you can't taste it. So take him in as much as you can (which I know sounds counter intuitive) and you will feel warm stuff at the back of your throat, but not the taste as much. Also spitting it out is perfectly fine, because after he's cum he's done. It's not going to matter too much unless swallowing is his fetish. Either way, he should respect that you don't feel comfortable swallowing

13. Have fun with both blow jobs that are empowering (where you have control etc) and blow jobs that are sometimes seen as degrading. It's just sex and play. He doesn't view you as less of an equal just because he wants to cum on your face. He's just letting his animalistic side out.

14. Dirty talk and the eyes!! Give your mouth a break, use your hands and start talking to him. Look at him and then go back down...and then look at him again while you are sucking! This is so much more powerful than women realize.

15. Maybe this should be number one...but tease him. Don't just put your mouth on his cock straight away. Kiss around it, lick his balls etc etc...

16. Surprise. It's fun to do the same thing for a long time, and then use a technique that you know he'll love just out of the blue. Listen for his breathing and moaning...it's pretty cool when this makes him say, ""oh my god!!! yes!! wow!!""

17. For guys whose cock isn't too sensitive and can handle this: after he [cums], don't let go immediately. If you can, keep your mouth on there and hold his cock with your hand. It'll prolong the nice feeling. If you drop everything on the spot the sensations are POOF...gone.

*Edit: Added tip #17 from El Dude with my own precaution.* 

**Edit #2: Some guys just DON'T EVER cum from a blowjob. Cumming from a blowjob IS NOT always the point of the blowjob!!! I just said that in the title to show that I'm not some random girl, but have some skills to share.**

**Edit #3: I NEVER got tricked into giving a blowjob, because I fucking love giving head...but what it did (possibly lying and telling me that they couldn't cum from one) was alert me to the fact that I would have to work hard and long to please them. I always appreciate knowing that. I can adjust my technique and mindset accordingly....if he's lying then he's just going to cum really fast or ask me to tone it down so he can last longer.**

**Edit #4 (hopefully last one): If you lie and tell a girl you can't cum from blow jobs, she will either give up and expect to just move on...or she'll accept the challenge because she loves giving blowjobs. Essentially, you won't be tricking the girl who doesn't like them to not even try, and the girl that loves them to try just a little harder.

1352986242.0,597,self.sex,138l38,An old recipe for training yourself to last longer,829,232,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/138l38/an_old_recipe_for_training_yourself_to_last_longer/,"I searched around and did not find this particular one so I'm sharing.

I learned about this technique when I was dating a girl and couldn't last a minute with her. Too much physical and emotional attraction. I tried everything but to no avail. I even bought some weird mint gel that was supposed to numb the feeling but it left me literally without any feeling and was horrible.

After some months there was absolutely no improvement and it was beginning to be an issue for her. While I was at one of my dad's grill parties one of his friends (a specialist in gynecologic oncology) asked me if I'm having ""girl trouble"". To my surprise in my desperation I was completely sincere and told him about it. Told him I tried the most known stuff but it just didn't help. This was his advice.

He held trying to trick your brain with thinking about something else for very wrong as it degraded the act of sex. (a more extended version mixed with some of the experience I have now)

You have to be 100% concentrated to be able to enjoy, ""harvest"", and deliver great sex. First and foremost practice makes perfect. Like anything else in life you have to train yourself. Don't be lazy, training will make you whatever you want to be. Have as much sex as you can. Don't fight your libido, use it. If you finish way too early - forget about it and start again in 15 minutes. And again. And again. As long as she doesn't mind and helps you get hard again, stay on it.

Best way to learn control is trying to interrupt your orgasm building in the last possible moment. The more you do it the more you will extend (control) it and will be able to enjoy that building up longer. Right before an orgasm the penis also becomes harder and if you could hold that over longer periods you're going to unleash your potential. Interrupting sex all the time doesn't seem good but you can do it in a sexy way. Be creative you can interrupt to change a pose. You don't need to hide it - you could pull out and rumble in pleasure, girls will appreciate feedback on how much you like them. Sometimes you see guys in porn gently slapping their dick on her ass/thigh. That's a good technique to faster come down from the high build up. A much much better (and less weird to some women) technique is grabbing the top of your penis just before the tip and gently pushing the back of the head (direct on top of the urethral orifice) down with your thumb. That immediately releases pressure and you can start working up again before she loses her build up. Interrupting isn't great for the partner but it's better than awkward 90 seconds, and it gets better. After some time your body and mind will learn and you won't need to interrupt.

You can practice the thumb technique while masturbating. Masturbate and just before ejaculation push the tip around the urethral orifice down, as if you're using a mouth spray. You can do that a lot, 5-10 times a session. It's hard but I was able to extend sex to 15-20 minutes in just a few long interruption masturbation sessions. If you also not come after one of those sessions it will also get your testosterone boiling but that could also make you more aggressive. Experiment. 

I am glad I was told this technique at the time because I was able to not only have normal length sex but also get her to orgasm. Everything in just a couple of months. It was some of the most amazing exciting sex I've ever had!

tl;dr Interrupting right just before you orgasm will help you control and last longer. Read full text for detail.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_138l38,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/138l38/an_old_recipe_for_training_yourself_to_last_longer/,

I've been with my gf for quite some time now. We have a healthy relationship, and communicate well. 

Lately, my sex drive for her has gone down. I consider my sex drive to be at the medium-high range. I've communicated to her that if she wants to fool around, or have sex, to just go for it. Instead, she will do something like rub on my arm and not say a word. It's very passive and annoying.

Anyway, she has talked for the past 6 or so months that she'd like to start working out. She has gained some weight over time, and it doesn't seem to be letting up. She eats terribly, drinks quite a bit, smokes... lots of unhealthy things. I've gone to her and told her that things need to change because I care about her and want her to be healthy. I'm a skinny guy, but I've offered to workout with her. I'd like to get toned myself. 

She sees it as me pushing her. I've always been supportive of her. I've never said to her that she's overweight, or looks bad. She has a TON of inner and outer beauty. She's very pretty. Darn right beautiful. 

When we get in the bedroom, I unfortunately, do not find her body attractive. I struggle with orgasming or maintaining an erection because I'm not turned on. I do want to please her, and she gets off every time. But I just can't seem to get there. 

Am I shallow? Am I dirt? I love her a lot, but with her talking about getting thin, it's all I can think about. All I want to do is support her. How do I help her along with her quest, even though she shows no signs of wanting to actually get in shape? Better yet, how can I get past the physicality of her body? (I know that sounds really shallow. Please believe me when I say I love her very much and really want things to work.)

Sorry for being so long winded.

Edit: This got way bigger that I anticipated. I'd like to thank you all for your comments. Yes, I agree that it needs to be her doing. She has to want to change. Any time she has ever mentioned that she wants to lose weight, I tread lightly, and offer what I call ""persuasive support."" I support her fully, while trying to persuade/feed that mentality. I don't think that I could sit down with her and say, ""Your body isn't working for me."" (In so many words.)

That's too heavy of a blow, for anyone. Promoting good eating habits, proper dieting, and an overall healthy lifestyle is going to be a good route to take. It's going to take a lot of initiative on my part, but I do love her and what her to be healthy.

Been with my gf (F23) for 6 years. 

Her body has changed a lot. [This picture](http://www.weightlossphotos.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/73-weight-loss-before-after-women-bikini.png) is pretty accurate representation of the transformation she's undergone, only in reverse.

We used to have fantastic sex, usually at least once a day. Now we have penetrative sex twice month if I'm lucky. She refuses to do anything with the lights on now. Her vagina has gotten fatty and I actually have to peel skin/fat back to actually get to it. Most of the time there's an odour too. It was never like this before.

The only saving grace for me right now is she gives me oral a few times a week, but that was only after me telling her that I need to orgasm at least once a day - I don't think she likes the idea of me looking at porn to get off.

I feel like a shallow prick for considering ending the relationship but when my sex life is on the fritz the rest of my life seems to unravel as well. I get unhappy, stressed, etc. She's made no effort to lose the weight, even after I recently started dropping hints that she should get active and healthy. 

Any other redditors been through this? What did you do?

So yeah. Pretty quick turnaround. I posted the original text like, what, 14 hours ago? Here's what happened after I woke up.

At his work is a bus stop, which I take down to campus. So on the way to work, I was still pretty bothered about what happened last night and being rejected from hanky panky. He did notice at my mood change, but didn't really address it, because he thought it was silly (he later told me). So I went to class and felt better being around people and having conversations unrelated to my relationship.

Well, later, I ask him what he's up to and he says that he's going to his friend's house after work (he gets off at 9). I'm like, okay... guess we aren't spending the night with each other tonight. And I kinda make a fuss about it, which upsets him... aaaaaand he broke up with me.

I feel like this part should be in the relationship advice subreddit, but I figured I'd like to share with you guys what happened. I didn't even get to talk to him about the sex issue... he just sorta blew up and broke up with me. 

So, now, we know what the issue was. It wasn't that I'm unattractive, or that he's physically tired, or that I have a stronger sex drive than he does... it's that he's sick of being in a relationship with me because I'm never satisfied with him. 

Well fuck.

Okay, bye guys. Thanks for the advice and support.

Help please!,1188,598,812,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/y1def/literally_just_had_my_roommate_grab_my_cock_while/,"Hey r/sex, how is your evening going? Let me tell you about mine...It's a bit of a long read, but even me skimming over it again is causing my head to spin and making my underwear tighter...

First, a bit of background:
I rent a house with five other roommates, we're all very chummy, some of us have been friends for years and years. The newest roommate, let's call her Alice, has been living with us for about six months. She's funny, gorgeous, nerdy, and of course, already taken.

This evening I'm going about my usual routine, getting ready for bed and the like. Since there's no one home, and my room is very close to the bedroom, I'm brushing my teeth in my pyjamas which consist of a t-shirt and some hilariously patterned boxer-briefs. While brushing away I hear the door downstairs open and close. No problem, I think to myself, I'll just wait until they've passed into their room and jump into mine. A few moments later I hear a small knock on the door and Alice saying, ""Hello?"". I say that I'll be just a minute, and start having a mini freakout, trying to figure out how I may get back to my room without her seeing me in my underpants. Luckily I didn't have much time to ponder that because the door started to open and Alice slid in. 
Toothbrush in mouth I start waving my hands, urging her not to enter. There must be some mistake, I figure. She must not have heard me say I was in here, I think as she looks me dead in the eye. She enters smiling and it makes me embarrassed and flushed, blood rushes to my cheeks, and sadly, being of the lesser gender, my cock as well. All of this, the door opening, the hand waving, the smiling, the blushing, the hardening, happens both simultaneously and within the span of a few seconds. She slowly closes the door behind her while I mumble nonsense through my toothbrush.

Let me interject for a moment to point out that Alice has NEVER shown even the slightest interest in me. She's nice, yes, but typically accompanied by her boyfriend. In the six months that she has been living here the closest we've been physically was accidentally brushing hands while exchanging the tv remote.

Anyway, I've backed myself up against the sink, assuming the safest bet is to be as far away from her as humanly possible. She stares at me for a moment, cowering against the sink, mouth covered in toothpaste, cock desperately trying to escape my underpants, then steps forward and gingerly presses a cupped hand around my cock. The pressure gives it a bit of a jump. She slowly presses her entire body against me, I feel her breasts give against my chest and almost choke on my toothbrush. Her other hand starts to crawl up my spine like a spider and finally some to a rest at my neck, where she's grabbed a handful of hair and is holding on tight. She pulls my head down towards her and presses her lips into my ear, ""I can take care of that if you like.""

In a classier, sexier, bolder retelling of this (presumably when I tell my grandchildren) I will have said something incredibly charming like, ""Is that all you can do?"". Instead, dear reader, I gave more of a small high pitched mouse squeak and a bit of a jump as well. She starts to kiss the small of my neck while I snap back to reality and start trying to remove the toothbrush from my mouth while frothing, ""Boyfriend! Boyfriend, you have a boyfriend!"". Eventually my toothpaste accented message is understood and she leans back, hand still on my cock and gives me the most wonderful smile, ""We're open, didn't you know that?"".

Again, dear reader, I wish I could say I responded with, ""Are your legs open as well?"", but alas, as a mere mortal all I could muster was a long high pitched ""Hmmmmm?!"" accompanied with a slack jawed stare. 

Before I could figure out how I felt about the situation, a door somewhere in the bowels of the house opens and slams shut. Alice gives me a wink, and a quick cock squeeze, then prances out the door, on her merry way, leaving me with a stone statue in my pants in place of a cock.

That was two hours ago. One hour was spent taking care of my...affliction. The other was spent pacing around the room in a post-cum state, trying to sort out the events and if I should pursue her.

1372160127.0,589,self.sex,1h15ng,Urges for sex getting out of control.,834,245,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1h15ng/urges_for_sex_getting_out_of_control/,"Hi sexxit.  I have a problem.  I need outside input, and advice.

Allow me to preface this by saying this is a throwaway account.

How do I even start...

I'm a married man.  Been married for 11 years.  Typical story in regards to sex.  In the beginning, all the time, as the years have gone on far less frequent.  My sex drive is high... no, it is borderline insane.  As the years have progressed, it has only grown in intensity to the point where I am now degenerating because of it.  Degenerating how?  Depression, lack of sleep, constant state of arousal, unhealthy amounts of masturbation.  I try my hardest to avoid women, all women, every day now.  There is something inside of me that is driving me to consider not just paying for sex, but paying someone for the explicit purpose of being available to me at all points of the day for sex.

Have I told my wife this?  God no.

I have told her that my needs are not anywhere close to being met.  She has known for years now that the frequency of sex in our relationship will never be enough.  I regret every bringing it up, because it changed sex with me in her eyes.  I love my wife, we have a family together and I love it.  I don't want to not be married to her.  I don't _want_ to cheat.  I don't _want_ to think about raping my wife.  I don't _want_ to think about raping anonymous women that I interact with at the gas station, store, hospital, outside.  Most of all, I don't want to hurt her any more than I have by making her feel inadequate... the fact that she will never be enough has to be soul crushing as-is.  For her to know that if it weren't for our kids being here I would probably rape her on the hour, perhaps more, would seal her departure from my life and I cannot let that happen.

This is not an exaggeration.  To give another indication of the severity of my problem; I masturbate after sex.  Not once, not twice... up to ten times.  It's to the point where I won't even sleep in the same bed with my wife, because when I do and she falls asleep, I touch her and masturbate.

Don't confuse my earlier statements for me saying that I want to fuck all women.  I want my wife more than any person on this planet, but since that isn't going to happen my body is pushing me towards other options.  Those options are dangerous, some of them shock me.  I know the stereotype of the overactive sexual male but in my now permanent arousal I cannot... I just don't know what to do.

I've been to a behavioral health specialist, a therapist, my doctor and sought other counsel.  I've tried drugs, meditation, masturbation, other forms of non-sexual treatment but nothing is stopping this urge.  So why reddit?  There are a large number of people here.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, someone will have personal experience with this and can offer some kind of help.

Neither of us are into the one night stand thing so we've been holding out for something a bit more stable.  No we don't expect exclusivity.  We just want transparency.  If things fit, great.  If not, we can wait.  Moving on, a friend of mine from way back that I hadn't seen in a decade or so moved back into town.  We never hooked up back when, but I always wondered what might have happened.  I'd talked to her a few times, but we hadn't really kept up.

She ended up at our house the other night.  Nothing was planned.  She was just going to hang out and have drinks.  Things happened.  We all ended up in a cuddle pile on the couch.  Clothes started disappearing and, shortly, we were all in the bedroom.  I'd barely touched another woman in more than twelve years and here was the one I'd had floating around in the back of my head for years naked in bed making out with my wife.  What could possibly be better?  

The sex, to be completely blunt.  I can play my wife like a violin.  I know exactly how, where and what to do to make her scream.  With my friend, she faked everything...obviously.  Like porno fake.  When she went down on my wife, it looked (and felt according to my wife) like she was actually trying to eat her.  When she went down on me, it was more like she was trying to cause herself blunt force trauma with my dick.  Teeth.  Death grip.  More stuff straight out of a bad porno.

After she left, the wife and I compared notes.  First of all, we came to the immediate, mutual decision that we needed a new rule stating that future partners would be people we'd never met before.  Second, we realized just how damn good we are together.  Being with a ""2"" really proved that we can be perfectly satisfied with each other being an ""11.""  We haven't give up the hunt, but we're not in as much of a hurry as we were.  If nothing else, this made our relationship more solid.

So here's some advice from a recent squirter initiate for those of you looking to open the floodgates. ",794,214,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1akwlt/got_a_lot_of_pms_asking_for_tips_on_how_to_squirt/,"I recently posted about being embarrassed about my ability to squirt cups of fluid (thanks for the words of encouragement r/sex!), and got quite a few PM's asking for tips on how they too can get a seat in the splash zone. Let me just say that I'm no expert on female ejaculation and this is my own personal experience with squirting. It may not work for you/you might disagree/etc... 
I genuinely believe that all women are capable of this given the right stimuli and their ability to relax - and the sensation is so wonderful I can't help but want share with you to help you guys achieve it too! So good luck to you and yours in your sexy endeavors and let me know how it goes! 

**How it happens for me:** 
So far, it only happens for me through g-spot stimulation via fingering. my guy uses two middle fingers facing upward towards my stomach with his pinky and his index resting on either side. He holds his fingers upwards, almost like a 'hook', towards my belly button. (we either do this with me on my back, legs slightly apart, or on my stomach, legs also slightly apart but thighs still touching).  

**What your partner can do/what you're feeling around for:** 
He says he can feel a spongey, roughish mound of tissue on the ceiling of my vagina, not that far in, and that's what he massages.
The motions he uses are not gentle, and though it starts slow, (he begins with softer 'tapping' motions upwards) he quickly starts much more rapid movements with A LOT of force - enough force to move my hips off the bed. The key here is that your partner shouldn't be moving their fingers in and out, instead they should be using their whole hand in an upward motion, while their fingers are still 'hooked' at your G-spot. 

**What you can do:**
The main thing I'd say is that it won't happen unless you relax your muscles and even push outwards a bit, if you're having trouble relaxing. I often tense up when I'm about to cum, and this immediately stops it from happening.  
You'll know it's working because it will start to sound squishy, like there's fluid building up - it's a very distinctive noise that I immediately recognize now as a precursor to my squirting. 
When you start to hear that noise, you'll feel like you need to pee (I'm still not sure if I don't pee a little when this happens) but DON'T tense up, relax your muscles. At this point, the 'need to pee sensation' results in an overwhelming feeling like I need to push outwards (it's involuntary) and that's when the orgasm comes and the gushing begins. 

**What it feels like:** 
It's the most incredible feeling in the world, your ENTIRE body cums. G-spot orgasms are not localized like clitoral orgasms, but extend outwards all throughout my body. It's the ultimate release, totally out of my control.....and that's when the gushing happens. If you're like me, it's like fucking old faithful - you'll feel a lot of warmth and wetness and splashing....(The force/expulsion/amount I assume varies from person to person) BUT it doesn't end with the squirting! When I have these orgasms, after I've gushed, they continue - My whole body goes into contractions for minutes after it has happened - minutes!
It's ridiculous and it takes me a while to recover from it - I'm actually not able to walk for a bit afterwards. My legs turn into jello. 

**Some tips for your partner:**
The main thing I would say is that a lot depends on your partner hitting the right spot, so watch some vids (Both of these videos were really helpful for us in terms of the right technique) 
http://www.redtube.com//15878 http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=212403928

**As for what YOU can do, my soon-to-be squirter:**
First and foremost, you need to RELAX your muscles, just let loose - let your whole body relax from head to toe. And once you're close and not tensing up, push out when you feel the urge (My guy says that when this happens it feels like my vagina is actually pushing his fingers out of me). Don't tense up or get freaked at the need to pee feeling - pee beforehand if it makes you feel better. 
I think lube really helps it along as well, it just makes less work for both of you and more time to focus on the main event. Also, drink shit tons of water all day - I find that on days that I don't drink a lot of water I either can't get to the point where it happens, or the squirt is very very light. (You'll also need to drink a lot of water after it happens - you're going to lose A LOT of fluid) 

**If you're still trying:** 
Don't be discouraged if it doesn't happen the first, second, or twentieth time you try it. I was with my last boyfriend for five years and I never squirted. I've been dating my current guy for about 3 months, and it took quite a few times to get me to that point (now he can make me squirt in 60 seconds flat - over and over)

**Just a word of warning:**
The last thing I would tell you is that once it happens (and I really think every woman is capable), try not to be embarrassed about how messy it is, and if you don't want to soak through the bedding, put down LOTS of towels. 
I'm still shocked every time it happens (after I've recovered and look down at the bed and see a freaking lake of liquid), and I'm still trying not to feel embarrassed about the clean up. I don't know if this happens with all women, but I probably release a full cup worth of lady juices each time I squirt. It's still unbelievable to me that my body can even create that much fluid. 

**But seriously though, it's aaahmazing:** 
I'm really no expert, I'm not sure where it comes out of even or why it happens, but let me tell you that they are INCREDIBLE. Squirting orgasms are fucking life changing, mind altering, body-spasm inducing, continue long after you've actually squirted, and turn your legs to mush. 

**TL;DR:**
1. Drink lots of water/use lube/buy some towels 
2. Find a position and technique that allows the stimulation of your G-spot in that magical way (hook upwards with two fingers and use the whole hand, not just your fingers) 
3. RELAX RELAX RELAX and go with it (push outward if this helps)
4. Funny squishy noise 
5. ""Holy god oh my god oh my god holy shit nothing has ever felt so good please don't stop"" 
5. ""What the hell just happened? Did a goddamn pipe burst over the bed?""
6. Be warned that if it happens that it might be really messy and require some clean up/and open-minded parter who isn't fussed by lots of lady-liquids. ",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1akwlt,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1akwlt/got_a_lot_of_pms_asking_for_tips_on_how_to_squirt/,

The [thread from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13g9w5/had_my_girls_eyes_rolling_around_in_her_head/) gave me a couple ideas that I wanted to try. 

I started texting my gf yesterday afternoon, slyly inserting a couple cues here and there about me wanting to fuck her. I mentioned that I saw her walking to class with a sun dress on, and how I wanted to stick my head under there for 20 minutes. She responded back with, ""I shouldn't have worn panties today then"". I said, ""Don't worry, I'll eat you through them until they're soaking"". 

She stopped texting back for about 20 minutes, so I thought she was busy in class. Another 10 minutes later, I hear a knock on my apartment door and open to find her standing there, breathing through her mouth. She rushed at me without saying a word, locking lips with mine, and pushed me against the side wall. I flipped sides and pinned her against the wall with my entire body. She ran her hands over my erection, but I pinned them above her head and told her not to move, ""or else"". I teased for a little; releasing my lips from the embrace and watching her squirm against my body, still pinned against her body. I didn't let up, though. I moved down to her neck, slowly nibbling away to the beat of her whimpering sounds, until I got to the straps of her sun dress. Pulling each strap away with my teeth, I dropped her dress to the ground. She was wearing a black bra and pink panties. Still pinned against the wall, I flipped her over so her back was facing me. ""If you move away from this wall, it's 15 minutes of punishment. Got it?"". She nodded, and I proceeded to make my way down the length of her back; kissing, biting, licking, until I was done mapping every inch of her back with my tongue. I took off her panties, slowly, and licked, slowly, around her vagina. 

She was begging me to fuck her, but I didn't let up. I finally got around to licking her vagina, and she was shaking just 30 seconds into it. I stopped to make sure she wouldn't cum yet. I repeated it 3 times until her legs and moans were quivering. I took her to the bed and laid her on her back. Pinning her arms over her head, and said: ""If you move these, we're going to repeat what I just did"". She half nodded, half mumbled something, as I went back down the length of her stomach. Kissing, slowly, every inch of her stomach and navel. I got to her pussy and lightly kissed her clit. She gasped loudly and looked up at me. ""I told you not to move around... I guess it's back to the wall"". She said, ""No, please... I can't wait anymore"". *Then tell me what you want.* ""I want you to fuck me... Please"". *Say it louder. I want the neighbors to hear you scream.* ""I want-"". *Louder.* **""JUST FUCK ME!""** 

At this point, I couldn't resist either. I went up to her face and kissed her, hard. I unzipped my jeans and inserted my penis just slowly enough that she was squirming for the length of it. I kept it there for a minute until she begged me to fuck her again. I stroked back and forth, slowly at first, building up a rhythm. She started convulsing barely 20 seconds in, and came while I was still fucking her in and out. I stroked faster and faster, and she came again simultaneously. I didn't let up at this point. I kept fucking her. Fucking her until she was shaking for straight 5 minutes. I came right there inside her, and she let out another loud moan before passing out. I laid on top of her until she woke up while I was still inside her. I got hard again and fucked her until we both came again at the same time. She started mumbling incoherently for 10-15 minutes after that, crying/laughing at the same time. A couple hours later, she asked me I could have anything I wanted in return. I looked at her with intent, waited a couple minutes, and said, ""I need 'bout tree-fiddy"". She was really confused for a second, and was like, why? I replied, ""A man needs to do his laundry"" because I was out of change and needed to do laundry. She complied and went to sleep, and she's still asleep as we speak.

My partner[m24] and I[f24] have tried many different lubricants as I am very sensitive and have not found one that does not leave a sticky residue. I've always heard that using any sort of food product down there is a big no-no, but after reading the rave reviews and doing some research on my own I decided to give the coconut oil a try. WOW. He started off giving me a nice, sensual back massage with it. when he noticed I was really turned-on he rubbed some on himself and entered me from behind. It was amazing, it lasted a long time, was a pleasurable texture and just absorbed into the skin afterwards. There was no noticeable stains on the sheets either. The BEST part is, that you can go between PIV and oral sex and back with no problem, it does not taste bad at all. Normally we have to do any oral sex before applying the lube because it tastes so terrible. My partner loves it too, he says it feels natural, he loves that he can go down on me again in the middle of sex if he wants to (or vice versa) and likes to see it rubbed on my body.

So my boyfriend is a (Type 1) diabetic who likes to keep pretty tight control of his blood sugars, which has led to some pretty close calls in the past where he’s been low and this happens: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia . 
So we’re in bed asleep, and I happen to wake up and, after trying to get back to sleep for a while, become bored and notice that my boyfriend has rolled over onto his back and since this is unusual for him and gives me easy access, and since I’m pretty bored and can’t get back to sleep, I decide to play with him while he’s asleep (which we have decided in the past is totally not rape).  

I get some response, but not much beyond a semi, so then I decide a blowjob would definitely get him hard  and get to it, except now he’s gone totally limp. I decided that it would be good if there was an explanation or this which didn’t involve the admission that I give crap head, and then remembered that one of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia is being unable to get/maintain an erection (or so the boyfriend has informed me in the past). 
So I wake him up and tell him I had a dream that his sugars were low, so he should do a blood test on his nifty little diabetic blood testy thing (he’s usually grumpy about being asked to check his blood, so I figured being weird was the quickest way to get him to agree.)

Turns out he’s like 2.1* (which is quite low, I think anything below 3 is technically hypoglycaemia but I could be wrong). Putting this into context, it’s like 6am and he had taken insulin earlier so if I hadn’t woken up and decided to go down on him it’s almost certain that I would have at least had to call an ambulance for him when I woke up several hours later. 

Of course, now I’m thinking about all the scary ‘what if’ stuff, like, what if I hadn’t happened to wake up, or what if I’d managed to get back to sleep, or not been in the mood to give him a blowjob etc. On the other hand, I’ve finally got material worthy of making my first ever post to Reddit, and really that’s all that matters at the end of the day. Well, that and eliminating Katie Waissel from The X-Factor.

*I'm in Ireland, in case this scale looks funny.

**Edit:** Yes, I am a guy. I realised the ambiguity after I had posted but I figured my name would give it away and/or it didn't really matter anyway. Apologies for any killed boners. 

**Edit 2**: The reason I told him I had had a dream that he was low rather than the truth (which I told him once he was back to normal) was because he can be really stubborn about being made to check his blood and I didn't want to have to explain the whole story to him in his befuddled state.

We've been together about five months now with my girlfriend, and our sex have been absolutely amazing and frequent. 

Today I thought I was not in the mood any more after going for it twice already earlier, but after lying in bed for a while, the kissing growing more and more passionate and her hands travelling around my body, I noticed my boxers getting tighter and tighter... After a while she moves lower and uses her magic mouth to get me so hard I swear I could cut diamonds with my penis. 

I just couldn't wait longer, so I flipped her around and started to fuck her like a jackhammer stuck on high gear. She's always quite loud with her moans, which is a huge turn on for me, but this time it was even louder than usual. At some point she makes a weird sound which somehow resembled a horse neighing, which was incredibly funny, but I kept going and soon finished with the power of thousand suns. As soon  as I had finished I remembered the sound and couldn't help but laugh, so she asked what it was about. This was when my still ecstatic after-orgasm mind decided that it's a good idea to tell her she sounded like a horse...

Her immediate reflex was to slap me in the face few times (not very hard, she's the most sweetest girl with no aggressive tendencies) and after that she buried her face in her hands and starts sobbing miserably. 

I'm the kind of guy who never wants to hurt anybody's feelings, especially my special lady, so I instantly regretted opening my mouth and apologized profusely while comforting her. She soon went to the bathroom and I was sure she would just get her clothes and leave, but I was relieved to see her coming out after a while and in few minutes we were laughing our asses off for the whole incident.

I guess the lesson is that people are in very vulnerable state after sex and there are some things you just shouldn't share then, and maybe never...

I've largely stuck to monogamous, committed, birth-control-pilled relationships in the past so that condom use could be avoided, since sex with a condom on was usually bad sex. 

This weekend I've had the great fortune to play with two lovely girls (thanks internet dating) who are by far the most experienced partners I've ever had. The girls suggested that I try a larger condom- I'd never considered it, since I thought of Magnums as something you buy only if you have a pulsatingly tumescent horse cock that cannot be tamed by mortal latex. But they persuaded me to try them out and see if a less constricted penis was a happier penis, and the difference is incredible. Stayed hard, felt natural, condom didn't slide up toward the tip and have to be pulled down every ten thrusts... Trojan company, my cock would like to give you a high five.

UPDATE - Guys I didn't want to post a THIRD topic but I'm happy to tell you all that last night we had AMAZING sex. OH BOY. Seriously, I could not have had this amazing sex without you all haha I used every tip and trick I learnt. For those worried that my BF is a selfish ass he came home and the first thing he did was go down on me. He really was just stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts which created a self-fulfilling prophecy that the sex would be bad. But as soon as we had 'good' sex that was shattered. He couldn't stop declaring how happy he was last night. And he also made sure I knew I was loved.

You know what really really helped though, apart from the confidence and self-worth you wonderful people instilled into me? Good old fashioned communication. Once my BF realized I wasn't trying to blame him for our old bad sex he was open to everything I wanted to try. I explained to him how lady parts worked and then gave him a physical demonstration of which inside muscles I had control over. I showed him the most sensitive spot on his penis, ha, he loved that! I talked to him during sex instead of just staring at the ceiling worrying if he was enjoying it. I got him to tell me what he liked. I told him what I liked. My god. It. Was. Awesome. Just like old times.

Guys I think we're gonna make it!! :')

THANK YOU 

Edit&gt; Oh guys, you just, you are seriously awesome. It sucks to be away from friends and family and have an embarrassing problem like this and you have lifted my spirits, made me laugh, made me cry, given me a desperately needed boost of self-confidence and self-worth and enough sex tips to write a book. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I've got to clean my house and do a bit of work now but I will reply to as many of you as I can later. I hope some of your will be happy to know that today BF e-mailed me while at work to say that he loved me, he really wants to try to make this work and tonight he's gonna sex me good. Using your tips I hope we both enjoy it and it brings us closer together.

Firstly, I hope I'm allowed to post an update topic. I appreciate this is more about the relationship now than the sex. I'm sorry if that's not allowed in this subreddit.

Secondly, thank you very much for your replies in my other post. I spent the whole day reading them. They kept me sane. I've never experienced that kind of support before. It really meant a lot to me. So thank you, from the bottom of my heart (and my cavernous vagina).

Thirdly, hurt feelings + hurt heart + alcohol = Not a good time.

Summary of events prior to last night: After a couple of months of noticing that sex was drying up in my relationship and that BF was treating me like a human flesh light during sex I confronted BF to find out the problem. He told me that sex with me was not enjoyable because he could not feel any friction during penetration. He said sex with me was bad; sex with other vaginas was much better. He said his penis needed small girls, with smaller lady parts to be good for him. He said that he was bitter because the sex was so bad and it was bleeding over into other parts of our relationship, affection was drying up because it was just a cock-tease for him to make out with me and know only disappointing sex awaited. He replaced affection with pot and beer. This was a hard truth to hear but I appreciated his honesty. Somewhat.

After that conversation we went out to buy some bread, when we came back I started kissing him. I kissed him until he got hard and then kissed him some more. I started stroking him and then slowly undressed him. I undressed myself and bent over the couch and encouraged him to have his way with me. He had sex with me in that position for about 30 seconds before leading me to the bedroom. I made him lie on his back and started to give him a blowjob. He looked like he was almost going to cum, I then climbed on top of him and started having sex. He cycled through positions quickly, and finally found one where he could cum. We cuddled. I asked him if that was better for him. He said ''I liked that last position.. but um, no.''

The next day I dressed up, got sexy, gave him a blow job as he walked through the door and let him come on my boobs.We went out for dinner and had a pleasant time. We came back and had sex again. Same thing as before, cycle through positions and wait for him cum. I asked how it was, I didn't get much of a response.

The next day came the argument and the reddit post.

Then last night happened. He came home and kissed me hello, gave me a couple of chocolates he'd bought me. Feeling all jacked up on my reddit-inflated-sense-of-vagina-worth I told him to sit down so we could talk.

I laid it out for him, pot and beer are an issue, you might think that they're not and you're not smoking/drinking that much but when it becomes a problem in our relationship, it should be obvious that you're doing it too much. BF didn't agree, we argued a little ''I don't do it every day, you're twisting things!'' Me: ''Okay, you do it six times a week then.'' BF: ''That's not every day then is it.'' In the end he got angry but seemed to accept that he should at least try to cut them down for a week.

Secondly I mentioned that I'd posted here for advice. He badgered me until I told him 'exactly' what I posted. He said ''I never said you weren't tight enough, I never said you were too big, I said I was too small for you!!!!''. I told him it was heavily implied and that he had indicated that I was too large for him and other girls were better fits. He also had told me explicitly that he didn't get pleasure from my vagina. Communication right? It's hard. 

I told him I was really upset because I had made an effort to please him sexually the last two days and he had all but shrugged his shoulders at me. Now, this is difficult to convey, but in this part of the conversation he both denied ever saying that the sex was bad and he said he'd liked it and then later saying exactly ''the sex with you is bad and I didn't enjoy it''.

I went through some of the things we could try. Exercises, benwa balls, anal sex, more blow jobs, that he could look into penis sensitivity.

I encouraged him to tell me if he wasn't over his last girlfriend. I asked him if we had moved too fast. I asked him if he regretted moving me out here. I asked him if he was unhappy. He gave me all the right answers to these questions. I told him that I could leave in a month if that's what he wanted. He said it wasn't. He planned to spend his life with me.

And then. And then after saying to him ''If all this is true, why do you seem so unhappy'' and he said. ''Because I am unhappy. The thing I love doing most in the world does not feel good with you.""

And I asked him ''Do you find me sexually attractive, do I make you hard, if you see me naked do you get hard, do you just think of me as a friend?''

And he said ''I do find you sexually attractive, I think you're gorgeous, I think you're the most beautiful girl I know. I do get hard kissing you. I do get hard when I see you naked, it's just become a negative cycle for me because I know it will lead to bad sex.''

At this point I sat on his lap and looked in his eyes, I was being intimate. And he said; ''I know what the problem is. It's a mental one. You don't turn me on. But I had already accepted I wouldn't get what I need from you sexually. I still want to marry and have kids with you and live to be old and grey.''

So there we have it. My boyfriend can't think of me as a sexual being. I told him that meant he wasn't in love with me. And he said ''I am in love with you, I love the romance we have in our relationship. I'm just not turned on by you anymore.''

I got super sad. We went out. I got drunk. I made a huge ass out of myself. I had to e-mail him an apology this morning.

Is that something you can fix? I don't know. We would both like to fix it. Has anyone in a marriage ever gone through a period where you don't find your wife/husband sexual anymore? I did have a breakdown once because of the abuse and he had to train himself not to treat me sexually, could that have affected the way he views me? Has anyone been through counselling to help this kind of thing? Why does life suck?

TL;DR: Don't bother reading, just tell me I need to break up with him or say something nice because my heart is breaking right now. BF of ten years tells me he loves me deeply but I don't excite his cock despite being 'gorgeous'. He's just not into me that way.

The penis size isn't that big of a deal for me since my vagina is shallow and generally pretty small all around, but what worries me is the combination of physical traits he exhibits.  

He is 26 years old and very underweight, has no maxillofacial hair, no pubic hair that I have been able to detect, no chest hair, sparse axillary hair, and what seems to be an underdeveloped pectoral region (i.e. looks like a 10-year-old's chest).  Does this set of characteristics indicate some specific medical abnormality? 

I have tried to look up any medical condition that correlates micropenis with incomplete puberty but could only find congenital hypothyroidism.   It doesn't seem like this is what he has.  It is also noteworthy to add that he is a fraternal twin.

My girlfriend has always enjoyed some light spanking.  It was her birthday a couple of weeks ago (let’s say she turned 20).  Anyway, we both knew that we were going to be having sex on her birthday, so we were both pretty horny the morning of.  On my way off to work I spanked her (birthday spankings) and said, “that’s one.”  She giggled.
When we had sex later that night, I spanked her as we were making out and said, “that’s two.”  I kept spanking her as we were making out and then as we had sex and it just kept building things up for her.  She got closer and closer as I got to 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  Then when it hit 20, she had a killer orgasm.

Overall, GREAT experience.

I knew going into this that a countdown like that might be pretty awesome.  I’d tried the Isabella Valentine – Jackpot, hands-free orgasm hypnosis thing before and noticed that counting down like that got me pretty orgasmic, which is why I thought it might be a good idea to try it with the spankings.

Anyway, I’d like to step it up a notch or try things other than spankings.  Any ideas?

TLDR; Birthday spankings make my gf orgasm. 

Edit: I guess maybe I should be a little more clear.

This is true for some women.  *It is not true for all of us.*

I squirt.  It feels fine.  I don't hate it, my SO loves it, so that makes me want to do it.  However, it is NOT an orgasm for me.  There is no build up and release.  There is no breathless panting, dizzy feeling afterwards.  There is no ""Oh my god, don't touch me there anymore I'm too sensitive!!!""  There is only ""Oh, you're hitting that spot grab a towel!"" and then liquid gushing over my ass/thighs/stomach (and sometimes face).

The reason I feel compelled to share this is that if your lady squirts, *you should ask her how it feels for her before making this assumption.*  She may say, ""Oh my god that was the most intense orgasm I've ever had!"" or she may say, ""That was okay.""  If you are under the impression that you just gave her the most intense orgasm ever without actually doing so, you're going to feel less inclined to continue working towards really giving her the most intense orgasm ever, and we ALL deserve that from our sex partners.  Part of what is lovely about sex is that everyone is different and it's fun to explore and figure out what really gets your partner off.  You can't properly do that if you don't ask and communicate.  You know what they say about assumptions...

1336078967.0,561,self.sex,t5pjq,How I learned to resurrect a dead bedroom -or- the scrub sponge as sex toy (crossposted to /r/deadbedrooms),738,177,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/t5pjq/how_i_learned_to_resurrect_a_dead_bedroom_or_the/,"I had a dead bedroom.

Maybe not so dead as some of those in here, maybe worse than others. It didn't matter that others had it worse or better, this was my bedroom. What used to be the chamber of echoing primal screams was now a room dimly lit by a flickering TV with the accompanying soundtrack of the gentle snore of my beautiful wife.

It started as many deaths do, not with a skidding crash, but little bit by little bit. Passionate kisses on the way out the door gave way to pecks in the hallway as we made oatmeal for the kid and got her ready for school. Nights cuddled up on the couch with wandering hands gave way to checking homework, checking emails, flipping laundry and working out bills.

It was not my fault. It was not hers. Life simply changed. When we got together, we were teenagers and our to-do list for the day consisted of meeting our herb guy, going to blockbuster and if I was really trying to get something accomplished, getting a money order for rent. We fucked like rabbits and enjoyed it. We laid naked in bed until late in the afternoon if we wanted to, and we wanted to often.

Now, as thirty-somethings, on a given Saturday, our to-do list must be prioritized and divvied up between us so that we even had a chance of fitting in going to the kid's friends' birthday party, getting a new AC filter from Home Depot, fixing that downspout that keeps popping a seam every time it rains, making sure we get to the farmers market for the local honey that keeps our daughter's allergies at bay, and still try to leave time for the dishes, laundry and detritus that accumulates as if with a mind of it's own.

We were tired. No, tired is a luxury afforded to those who remember what it's like to not be tired. We were dead tired. The idea of sex, passion and tenderness seemed like an unimportant distant memory, like a that thingamajig that sits in the junk drawer in the kitchen.

We knew we were supposed to hang on to it, but for the life of us couldn't remember exactly what it was for. So it sat in the drawer, not forgotten but just unused.

Neither of us felt that the other was doing their part, only because we couldn't see everything the other person was doing to try to keep the boat afloat. We weren't even trying to fix the boat, just keep on bailing out water until our arms were limp.

It had to stop. I wasn't happy, she wasn't happy. We were both good, kind people. We deserved to be happy.

So I came up with a plan. A daring, throw-caution-to-the-wind plan. A Utah beach in Normandy on June 6th kind of plan.

I was going to become a superhuman cleaning machine. I would push my limits of domestic ability. When I came home tired, and all I wanted (and deserved) to do was sit down on the couch, collapse, open a diet coke and watch the antics of Paul and Jaime Buchman, I would resist.

I did dishes, flipped laundry, helped with math homework, swept, mopped, vacuumed, cleaned mirrors, scrubbed toilets. All with the reckless abandon of a crazy person. I'd listen to entire albums in my headphones while I put armies of cleaning crews to shame.

I'd bring her her tablet and a glass of wine and make sure she relaxed. Her smile was the reward. I wasn't looking for sex, or a blow job, or even a hand job. I was looking for her smile.

I got it.

Soon, my get-home-and-clean routine became second nature. It was just a part of the day. I got faster at it, and things improved. She saw that I was putting in the effort to make her life easier, and I saw her appreciation. Appreciation turned to affection, affection turned to attraction and before I knew it, we were spending time together.

Not just in the same room, but together. We talked about things that we hadn't talked about in years, discussing ideas and opening up to each other. We connected better. We wanted to be around each other, and we craved each other.

In conclusion, it turned out that all it took to revive the dead bedroom was persistence and a little elbow grease.

I used to have some serious problems having sex. Even with a lot of foreplay and lube it would still hurt to the extent I preferred anal sex over vaginal. First I thought it was just how things are in the beginning but as the problem didn't go away with time I decided to go to a gynecologist to find out what was wrong.

This was practically for no use at all. I got told that I probably was pressured to have sex, didn't really want it, wasn't aroused enough etc. All they could do was to recommend to use more lube and really want it. Sigh. Since sex was painful I started avoiding sex and this in the end killed any relationship I got myself into and made me think I'd probably be better off as a forever alone.

Luckily I got recruited for a gynecological study at our university which of course included a gynecological examination and some money as compensation. As a poor student who really could use some extra money I went for it - and that was definitely the best thing I've done when it comes to my sex life.

The doctor performing the study took a look at my vagina and asked if I had trouble with intercourse, tampons or gynecological examinations. My response was pretty much asking if he read my mind. He told me I had a longitudinal vaginal septum - sort of an extra wall in there, so instead of having one hole I had two. He said no one might have noticed it before since most gynecologists just insert the clamps to keep the vaginal walls apart and thus an extra wall wouldn't be visible. 

Solution: surgery. Doesn't sound too nice but it was a fairly easy procedure where they cut away the wall and I was good to go home the same day. There were a few days with a little bleeding but after that I haven't been having any problems. And now I've tried out my new, fixed vagina and sex is just awesome!

Apparently this is more common than people think and since it took me about 4 years to find out about this I figured I could share my experience.

As background, when she was my girlfriend, I cheated on her, and came clean about it. I have no drive to cheat on her now, even when another beautiful girl flirts with me on a business trip.

I can't promise we'll follow through on anything specific, but any and all help is appreciated, thanks guys.

EDIT:  Not really into the 'toilet activities.'  Maybe some good role playing ideas, we have sex toys a plenty.  We've done a MFF, finding another M could be problematic for multiple reasons.  Maybe even re-enact a good porn scene.

EDIT2:  Awesome response guys.  Not sure if I'm enjoying the comedy or suggestions more.  Tucking the kids in.  Details forthcoming...

EDIT3:  Well for those of you who pointed it out (or have kids) you're correct in that they can (almost) screw up a good night.  Nothing like finding out at 9:00 one of your kids has LICE.  Anyway, about 2:30 later we got going.  

We did some role playing where I was 'busy' working at the computer (porn) with my tie on, drinking scotch (a la Don Draper) and she was the wife in desperate need of attention.  She came in my office in lingerie and tried various methods of getting my attention including fingering and using her big dolphin toy, playing with my cock, pulling me by my tie and kissing my neck and ears.  Finally I gave in and insisted she sit on the desk and fuck herself with the toy (and coconut oil, awesome!) until she came (while I acted disinterested and drank), until I noticed she was close, then grabbed her by the neck and choked her until she came.

She begged to be allowed to suck my cock, so I had her tie me up and went back to watching while she gave me the ultimate oil rub and oral session.  Being ""The boss"" as she was referring to me as, I ordered her to get back on the desk, legs spread, while I went down on her (was thinking more oil, but that was completely unnecessary at this point) for a good duration.  This evolved into some 69ing on our massage mat we have (highly recommend) until she begged to fuck me.

She got on top and rode for a good 15 minutes and then switched to just taking the tip in and out until she came again (relief, I was worried she might not get there again).  Me being the boss and loving oral as much as I do, I ordered her to suck off her cum off my cock and finally it was my turn.

I told her to get in my desk chair, which was almost in the middle of the room at this time, and banged her until slammed into the desk.  I told her to choke me (first time!) and it works for guys too.  I think she was even more forceful than I was initially.  She came again and I told her to get on her knees and look up at me.  I came all over her mouth, chin, and down on her sexy corset.  I realized after we were done we had spilled scotch all over my desk and keyboard and knocked over various pictures, but hey it was worth it.

So it worked out well even with the kids delaying it.  She told me right before bed she was so hot she still wanted me.  I offered some oral but she said she'd save it for today.  She also said she really enjoys being ordered around and we'd have some more time to get more adventurous (tonight).  It was mildly tame, so we will definitely try something new but all in all it was a great night.

You never, *Never* see anyone posting ""Please help, my man doesn't cum!"" or ""I don't know how to touch my cock in a pleasurable way. What am I doing wrong!"" It doesn't happen because men have been teaching themselves since they were 12 or 13. Men practice for sex 3, 4, 20 times a week. When it comes time to actually have sex, they're able to move their bodies just so, with just this frequency and just this pressure that they feel great. And they can describe how they want to be touched.

There are an absurd number of posts that are either ""I want to be able to orgasm during sex"" or (even more frequently) ""I want to be able to make my girlfriend orgasm during sex"" Let's address the latter first.

Listen guy, this is not up to you. I'm not going to say you can't give your girlfriend her first orgasm, but it's extremely unlikely that you will. Quit making it an issue about your prowess in bed. I don't care how good your intentions seem. You say you're interested in her pleasure, but by making it about her orgasm, you're really just making it about your abilities. You're only adding stress to the situation and making it that much harder for her. (this is especially true for those guys who say ""She says she doesn't care, but I just really don't want her to miss out"") 

That was a bit harsh, so let me dial it back. I realize that you only feel this way from lack of perspective and ignorance. For men, sex is all about the orgasm. So naturally, pleasing your woman = giving her an orgasm. This is a fallacy. For orgasmic women, of course the orgasm is important, but it's not the all-encompassing goal of sex the way it is for men. For pre-orgasmic women, many of them truly don't understand what all the fuss is about. When you ask ""but don't you want to have an orgasm?"" and she shrugs, take that shrug as it is: an honest, complete answer. So if you really want to please your woman, focus your efforts on doing whatever things she enjoys, and stop trying to force an orgasm on her.


Now let me speak to the women who are truly interested in figuring out this whole climax business. You need to learn about your body. As I said above, your man has a huge head start on you. He's got himself mapped out to the centimeter. And all that practice has really paid off. Look at him: after the initial stage fright, he's been able to climax nearly every time you go near that thing! Find some alone time for yourself, shut the door, and get to work figuring out just exactly what feels good, what doesn't, and what makes you indifferent.

Don't expect your man to figure this out for you during sex. He is at a severe disadvantage. When he touches you, you know exactly whether it felt great, good, or painful. He has no clue until you shout or reflexively kick his head, and then it's way too late. When you touch yourself, you get an instant feedback loop. You'll stop the second something feels bad, and you'll keep going in exactly the same way once you've found just the right motion.

A quick comment about the ""urge to pee"" feeling. For those of you who don't know, this refers to the fact that stimulation, especially when it really starts to build up, can make a woman start to feel like she needs to use the bathroom. Naturally, she clenches down to prevent it, and in doing so prevents any possibility of climax. This is extremely common in pre-orgasmic women, even those who do not end up being ""squirters"" (is there a less graphic term for that?) You're going to need to learn how to get over it. This is yet another great reason to masturbate your way to your first orgasm, instead of sexing your way there. You'll be able to go at it without anxiety about whether or not you're about to urinate in front of someone.

That's all I have to say. I realize that in 4 days' time, this post will be buried and a fresh crop of the same questions will be back. Oh Well.  


Edit: some people seem to think that I'm saying masturbation will somehow prepare or teach you how to climax from penetrative sex alone. That is not the case. I'm fully aware that most women require at least some clitoral stimulation in order to climax.

My sex drive has never been stronger.",762,208,220,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/vxgvd/three_months_ago_i_gave_up_porn_and_masturbation/,"One night, I was hooking up with a regular FWB. We were engaged in foreplay, and while I was enjoying it, I didn't have an erection. I had to think about one of my favorite porn scenes while jerking myself off to get hard. Once hard I could have sex no problem, but this still bothered me. A beautiful, naked woman in front of me ready to have sex wasn't enough to get hard? I decided I needed to curb my porn/masturbation habits.

That was three months ago. Now my sex drive has completely flipped. Two weeks ago I hooked up with the same woman from before - was hard from the start, and had no problems maintaining the erection throughout foreplay leading up to intercourse. All the women I've hooked up with recently have commented on how quickly I get an erection, how easily I'm able to get another one after orgasm, and my overall stamina. I notice the difference myself of course, it's like night and day.

I didn't give up porn/masturbation completely. I allowed myself to masturbate with no porn whenever I wanted to, and with porn only once a week. I did masturbate sometimes without porn but I found myself just doing it less. Where before I might have done it out of boredom or just for a quick fix, now I just didn't bother. I did usually do the once a week with porn, although sometimes I missed a week or two. Before, I used to jack off at least once a day if not twice.

Aside from the constant masturbation draining my overall sex drive, I think the porn was starting to influence my sexual preferences as well. When I had to think about my favorite porn in order to get an erection to have sex with a woman, that just didn't sit right with me. 

I know the guys around here will fight tooth and nail to defend their porn habits. Four months ago I would have been on the same page. So this probably will go nowhere, but I've noticed a drastic difference in my sex drive, so I just thought I'd share.

1304007432.0,558,self.sex,gzehj,Can we put Herpes into perspective here?,894,336,467,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gzehj/can_we_put_herpes_into_perspective_here/,"In my experience browsing Reddit I have noticed a lot of fear and disgust when it comes to Herpes. I'm here to try to convince you guys to simmer down and think about what it is you are all freaked out about by throwing down some facts.

1.) You might already have herpes and not even know it. Yep, you read that correctly. About [80 percent](http://news.yahoo.com/s/prweb/20110404/bs_prweb/prweb8257847_1) of the population has oral herpes (HSV1) (which can be spread to genitals via oral sex) and roughly [1 in 6](http://global.unc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1466&amp;Itemid=105) Americans have genital herpes (HSV2). In some cases, the infection can spread without ever showing [symptoms](http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000901/tips/2.html). This circumstance is propagated by the fact that when you go to your sexual health center for a routine STI check you will not be tested for herpes for a few reasons: 

a.) If it's asymptomatic it's difficult to detect in the bloodstream 

b.) It requires a specific blood test, and blood tests don't grow on trees, y'know 

c.) The medical establishment is not concerned about HSV2 the way it is about other STI's because, for all intents and purposes, there are NO complications (other than the slim chance of meningitis type complications that can arise from the infection of *any* virus). Thus, if you have never had a cold sore of blister, there is no reason to assume that you are clean *unless* you go to your doctor and specifically ask to be tested for the disease (and even then the test may not find it in the bloodstream). 

2.) You will be exposed to herpes in your lifetime. Let's crunch some numbers. First, your average person has sex with [9 partners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuity) in their lifetime. As I've already mentioned, 1 in 6 Americans are estimated to be infected with HSV-2 (genital herpes). 9 is a bigger number than 6  - and I'm only referring to HSV2 here. 

Your chances of being exposed HSV1 herpes is way higher. Unless you are philematophobic, the number of people you kiss in your lifetime will be higher than the number of people you fuck, and, as we've seen, 80 percent of the population has oral herpes. Math!

3.) The worst part of HSV2 is the social stigma. I have herpes (obviously, or else I wouldn't care to write this little rant). And I can tell you from experience that it's NOT a big deal. I will break out with a small blister for about a five to seven days out of every couple years. Outside of those five to seven days I notice no discernible evidence of my infection whatsoever. 

Despite this, I fear and loathe the ""I have herpes"" conversation with any potential significant other because I know that there is a huge distortion of the disease in society. It doesn't help to visit message boards such as /r/sex or /r/STD and see the vitriol against people with herpes spewed by randoms who are clearly misinformed about the nature of the disease.

4.) Oral herpes and genital herpes are the same thing. The only difference is that one virus likes to live at the base of the spine and infect the genital area and the other likes to live in the nervous system nearer to the brain and infect the mouth. If you get cold sores, you probably have herpes. 

Also, here's a fun fact: While it's possible (albeit fairly unlikely) for a person infected with oral herpes to spread it to their sexual partner's genitals via oral sex, it is only hypothetically possible for the disease to spread from genital to oral. The last time I had a conversation with a doctor about this she told me that in her career she had never seen evidence of the latter.

Those of you who get cold sores (80 percent of you have it, so I know you're reading this!) I have question for you: Do you warn any prospective make-out partners of your condition before letting them kiss you? 

I ask because I feel the moral duty to tell any potential SO of my HSV-2 infection before we get it on, and if I'm going to have to go through that every time I decide to date somebody new, I feel it's only fair that you oral herpes kids do the same for us. 

4.) That [Alzheimer's-Herpes](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33191472/ns/health-alzheimers_disease/) connection is fully regarding HSV1, you guys. If you are concerned about developing Alzheimer's and the study I linked to worries you, it will do you no good to get worked up about fucking somebody who is infected with HSV2 when the real culprit is HSV1.  Please don't stigmatize those infected with genital herpes further by claiming it can lead to Alzheimer's.

Which in turn means: If this study is on the right track, the impetus on those with oral herpes to warn anybody they are going to kiss, share a glass, fork or chapstick with that they have the disease is actually quite serious considering they might be spreading not only the propensity for cold sores but the propensity to develop Alzheimer's later in life.

1337435192.0,559,self.sex,tuoql,How to last longer; tips for guys,755,196,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/tuoql/how_to_last_longer_tips_for_guys/,"I commented on a post about stamina the other day and it was fairly popular so I thought I should share with a wider audience my tactics for lasting longer in bed.

1. If you feel yourself coming close to orgasm, begin to focus on your breathing. Try to breath from your abdomen and make your breaths deep and calm. You can practice this one whilst masturbating and it really works wonders. Also heavy breathing can be a turn on for girls so it's win win. (I find counting '1' as I inhale and '2' as I exhale helps a lot for some reason).
2. Calm yourself down, when you get all worked up about coming too quickly it normally ends up working against you, causing you to come even faster.
3. Relax your PC muscles as you feel yourself getting closer to orgasm, tensing them up and trying to 'hold it back' is a bad move. Combining that with calm, regulated breathing is a really effective way of stopping yourself coming.
4. I also do my 13 times tables when things get drastic.
5. If you are literally just before the point of no return just stop moving completely. While you aren't moving just kiss her all over her body or hold her tight or whatever. A good one is to take her hand, suck her fingers to moisten them and place her hand on her clit and tell her how it would turn you on to see her get herself off; means she can continue as you recover. As long as you have some sort of motion chances are she won't mind and she'll certainly appreciate you prolonging the sex. Stopping to rest every now and then is a way better option than coming early.
6. Realise that coming early every now and then isn't a big deal. When I first started having sex I had this problem combined with troubles maintaining an erection and I worked myself up over it so much that it took three times as long to get over it. It isn't a big deal as long as you're working to improve upon yourself.
7. Change positions is an obvious one.
8. Vary your thrusting and realise that you don't always have to thrust. Sometimes I'll just push myself inside her slowly all the way in and then just rotate my hips in some fancy direction, then I'll start thrusting while rotating and if I feel like I'm going to come again I'll stop the thrusting and keep up the rotating. You've just got to mix it up.
9. Grandma
10. Don't forget to practice these things while masturbating. Most of us started wanking at home when our family members were in the next room. Our goal was to finish as fast and as stealthily as possible. Try to change that, take your time with your wanks; treat yourself. Keep it classy. Shove on some smooth jazz and go to town, remember to focus on the pleasure.

I honestly think the most essential thing to keep in mind is that it is NOT a big deal if you come early; it's a big deal if you aren't able to satisy your partner. So if you do come early do them the courtesy of finishing them off in other ways. Also you have to keep in mind that it isn't a big deal, finishing too quickly in bed is for most guys a very treatable thing and hopefully these tips will help out. Try to approach it light heartedly, avoid getting upset and stressed out if it doesn't work out right away; these things take time.

Tonight we managed intercourse for the first time. I dilated beforehand, we took it slowly and gently, used lots of lube and all the techniques we have learnt on our journey. We were surprised it worked tonight.

[I showed him this video afterwards.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o)

For all the other people suffering from vaginismus, I want to encourage you that it is possible to overcome, but it may take a lot of hard work and education.

I will continue to see my pelvic floor physiotherapist so it gets better and easier. And I want more practice with my husband too ;)

**Edit: Cheat sheet for vaginismus:**

The most helpful things for me were switching lubes, working through [""Heal Pelvic Pain"" by Amy Stein](http://www.healpelvicpain.com/) with my pelvic floor physiotherapist and using a tapered anal vibrator as a vaginal dilator, once I had worked up to its size using [this guide.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100815034221/http://www.vaginismus-awareness-network.org/guide.html)

I can understand that some guys take a long time to get off (I've heard 45-50 minutes, which blows my mind to this day), but can anyone explain the enjoyment of having intercourse for that long?

A couple of things I want to add to the discussion:

1.  Most people I know can barely run a mile, and I'm to believe that there are people out there having intercourse for an hour straight?

2.  I know plenty of girls who enjoy sex, and enjoy sex sessions, but I've never met a girl who is like ""We just had intercourse for 15 minutes, I could have gone for another 45"".  Invariably they are drying out, they are sore, they are tired, and they have cum at least once and are satisfied.  I also know very few if any guys who can sustain an erection inside a woman for 30 minutes, let alone 60. 

3.  To continue on with that, who can stay wet, for that long?  
  
4.  And who can feel pleasure from the experience for that long without it getting painful/uncomfortable?  Have you ever eaten something you LOVE, like a great burger, or a piece of your favorite pie?  Those first few bites are heaven, but after a while, you just aren't as satisfied, and in some cases, your tastebuds are just overwhelmed.  I feel like sex is the same way.

So what am I missing here?

Ladies! How can we expect our men to give us orgasms if we can't do it ourselves!?

There was a post a few weeks ago in this subreddit (http://redd.it/r4mbg) where the user stated that A LOT of the problems people post about on r/sex can be fixed if women only learned their own bodies better.  It is a kind of socially known thing that men from young ages play with their dicks and watch porn. Girls should be encouraged not to be ashamed of feeling good also. 

Let's start a new chapter in the revolution for female sexuality!

*Edited for grammar

Edit: So in response to a lot of users wanting to do something more about this I have done a few things to try and spread the message. 
First, I have emailed Cosmopolitan Magazine which is a great source of sex Q&amp;A for women to read and get insight on their sex lives, to suggest that they do an article based more on female pleasure. What toys or methods are most popular and things like that. 

I also emailed the Loveline show on KROQ to suggest that maybe it could be the topic of an open forum some night. I also plan on calling (hopefully i can get through!) and giving my own personal story and try to encourage women listening who don't masturbate to try it out and see if it can help improve their sex lives.

If any of you want to do the same or also try and find a different medium to talk about through be my guess and keep us all posted!

All throughout the night, one of us would pin the other to a wall for a few minutes, getting each of us worked up, and then back off suddenly and continue with whatever we were doing.  We enjoy creating lots of sexual tension.

Well, after we do one of our last tequila shots we're on our way to her bedroom to continue the housework.  As we head down the hall, I force her against a wall and pin her arms above her head. She really likes to be bitten, so I work up and down her neck, to her shoulders and then back to her ears, never hard enough to hurt, but firm enough to show how worked up I am.

This continues for about a minute when she decides to take advantage of my split attention.  She breaks the grip I have on her wrists and pushes me back against the opposite wall of the hallway.  She proceeds to do the same thing to my neck as I had to her, while working furiously to undo my belt.  Before I could even register what she was planning on doing, she was on her knees working my cock in and out of her mouth.

I caught motion out of the corner of my eye and looked to my right.  There at the end of the hallway was a mirror hanging on the wall, angled perfectly to show exactly what was going on.  Being able to watch her work her magic was one of the sexiest experiences I have had.

Thought I would give you guys an update after all the attention and help I got yesterday! It also might help any others who are worrying about sores on their nether regions.

So I went to my Doctor first thing this morning. She took some swabs and poked and prodded around my vagina. She said that it didn't look like the typical Herpes virus blisters, they were more like sores, but there is still a chance it could be Herpes. 

She then recommended I go to the specialist STI clinic. So off I went to be poked and prodded again. The specialist said again that it didnt look like herpes, and that they could be some form of ulcer, such as [molluscum contagiosum](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Molluscum-contagiosum/Pages/Introduction.aspx). I am also not experiencing any other symptoms typical of HSV (flu-like symptoms, swollen glands, itchy, sore). But again, it is still possible. 

I also had some bloods taken and am being tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphillis, HIV and even had a pap smear done.. 

So right now I have two lots of HSV tests being done, the first result should come through around Monday lunchtime. The second will be on Thursday during my follow up appointment at the STI clinic. I'm still **very** conscious that this could be Herpes. But there is no point me panicking like crazy until then. 

I will probably update you again next week to let you know what the final diagnosis is.

For example, I'm subscribed to GW+ and GWC but I never really visit the usual r/gonewild as I tend to find the girls there a little too small for my taste. When a bigger girl does come by our way and my friends criticize her size, I tend to be put on the spot when I mention that I find her very attractive. I was wondering if other men here have a similar issue, how they feel about talking about their preference to the larger lass and how they deal with their friend's slightly different tastes.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_1gkvfe,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1gkvfe/m_trouble_talking_about_bigger_women/,

We would both really like to get married, but I am having trouble committing because of our sex life, otherwise everything else is perfect.

We have sex about every two weeks, this has been going on for years -- with some dry spells as long at 6 months, but recently its been every 2 weeks. I would be fine with 2-3 times per week. I have sex maybe 1 for every 10 times I initiate. She never initiates. Worst of all, I feel like a lot of the time she is just too lazy to have sex, she would rather sleep. Also, when we have sex she doesn't orgasm -- she hasn't ever.

I can't help but looking at engagement like a commitment to jerking off in frustration 5 days a week, and never seeing a women orgasm again.

In the past she has given me excuses to her low lobido, one of which being that I was getting fat (I was 6' 185) -- so I've hit the gym and lost the weight (down to 160), which was hard for me because I didn't feel as though I needed to lose weight.

I know that a lot of people will say that I should be grateful that I'm in love, and have an otherwise fulfilling relationship, but sex is important to me. I've noticed my sex life affecting all aspects of my life. I work harder and accomplish more because I am not thinking about it. It makes me excel more socially and in my job, as my confidence is higher.


Anyways, this morning out of frustration (she was too tired to last night, but said she would in the morning... then didn't) I told her that this is the reason that we aren't engaged. Although true, a total fuck up. I want to be honest with her, but I shouldn't have told her like that. She thinks I've gone and messed everything up now, and she won't ever feel like doing it now. Awesome.

I don't care who is in the right or wrong. I want this to work.

**tl;dr**- 19 year old has no hopes of ever having an orgasm, then has a very sexy night with her boyfriend and finally has one after figuring out her anatomy and doing kegels while receiving oral. 

Some information about me is that I'm 19 years old, have been with 10 partners, and had never experienced an orgasm until very recently. 
I always thought I would be that woman in my 30's who had yet to experience an orgasm, up until very recently when my entire sexual world changed haha

**Some more background information**
I've been sexually active since I was 15, so for the next 4 years of my sexual life I felt like I wasn't completely satisfied with sex. I love sex and am ready to go at any time, but I felt like I had to have sex until I was just completely physically exhausted or too sore to continue because there was no point where I ever felt ""finished"". I did a lot of experimenting in those four years to find what I liked best, but after a while I stopped trying to make an orgasm my goal. Sex to me became an amazing connection to have with someone where we could both share our bodies together and make our partner feel amazing. It completely stopped bothering me that I couldn't orgasm, but that's definitely not the case with most of the men I had sex with. Many tried to tell me that they were going to be the one to change that, and yada yada yada. I was also never a fan of oral because it never did much for me. 

**How I got myself to orgasm**
I think the biggest change was that I started to really notice things about my anatomy that I had never actually thought played a part in the orgasm process. The shape of my vulva was a huge part of what set me back. I have outer lips that close everything else in, so you basically don't see any of my inner lips when i'm standing up or sitting down because everything is kind of tucked in. I never took the initiative to spread my lips when a guy was eating me out because I just felt too self conscious to do it myself. Well, this time was different. I spread my lips and pulled up my clit hood to completely expose it. My boyfriend was going down on me and slipped two fingers in while applying pressure on my g-spot. He wasn't moving his fingers, just pressing up on it. Since he wasn't moving his fingers I felt this urge like I needed to squeeze them for some reason, so I started doing kegels, all the while he is still licking my exposed clit. Oh my Jesus, Mary, and Holy Spirit. Doing kegels while getting oral is such an AMAZING feeling, I was in my own cosmic little world (that may or may not have been from the weed we previously smoked). I had my very first orgasm that night. When it happened I was extremely confused and had no idea what it was, so I stopped sexy times and looked it up on google. Not even kidding haha. I confirmed that it was an orgasm and asked him if he could do that again because it was so amazing. He was more than happy to oblige and gave me 3 more. 

Now I can give myself orgasms and I feel like my ENTIRE sexual life has completely changed because of this. I don't need the two fingers against my g-spot to orgasm anymore, I just keep doing those kegels while massaging my exposed clit with a little coconut oil, and I orgasm.

He was never the brightest bulb in the box - one time he couldn't spell the name of his own street (which is sad considering it was Spruce street). He was the type who always used the wrong words for everything and had a hard time understanding things. He dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade (but has since gotten his GED) and worked at a gas station, living with his parents for a few good years. Despite his intellectual shortcomings, he's one of the sweetest, most earnest guys you can imagine. He would never hurt a fly, even if you paid him. He was also fairly nice to females - wasn't into playing games or anything like that. Also, he's good-looking. What this goes to show is that,

1) Despite his shortcomings, he gets a fair amount of pussy, and

2) He totally didn't deserve this.

So back in 2009, he had met a girl at a concert at our local college. They talked on Facebook and texted for awhile before she finally came over, clearly with the intent of hooking up. After the initial make-out, she put the breaks on and told him that she was a virgin, and wasn't sure if she was ready to make that ""emotional"" jump with a guy she barely knew. Hilariously, he was ready to back down right there, until she suggested sticking it in her pooper. Good for you, girl!

I guess he figured because she so readily offered her rectum to him that she was some sort of anal veteran. Unfortunately, she wasn't. After the initial struggle to even get it in, she asked him to pull out because it hurt, and unceremoniously splattered shit all over his dick. Needless to say, he was freaked out and ran to clean off, while she ran out of his house, humiliated.

**But wait. It gets worse.**

Being the nice guy that he was, my friend assured her that it wasn't a big deal. They reconciled and she came over a few days later. Predictably, things once again became hot and heavy. He didn't pressure her to do anything, but she offered him oral sex. Really, it was the least she could do after shitting all over his dick. Unfortunately, it would seem that she wasn't the most experienced at giving head either, because the first thing she did was attempt to gobble his whole dick. It hit her gag reflex, and she puked all over the poor guy's pubic region.

**But wait, it still gets worse.**

In the piece du resistance, she (naturally) ran out of his house screaming *again.* He was just weirded out at this point. While he was showering the ickies away, he heard a knock on his door. He opened and saw his lady love with her car halfway down his driveway. She sheepishly asked, ""You don't have a cat, do you?""

Yes, she ran over his cat. After shitting on his dick and puking all over his balls.

I wish I could offer some kind of proof of this. All you have is my word that a twenty-one-year-old guy would *never* willingly lie about something like this.

Awesomely enough, he tried several times after that to call her, but she just totally ignored him. He also took the fall for her killing the cat and told his parents that he did it.

1358694058.0,537,self.sex,16xin2,"So, noisy sex might be better sex, but not according to our neighbours...",937,400,274,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/16xin2/so_noisy_sex_might_be_better_sex_but_not/,"So I had a horrible experience the other day, which really quite shocked me. A bit of background info: I live in a block of flats, with my boyfriend, and we have been living here for over a year. The majority of the surrounding flats are rented by groups of students, we are students ourselves, but I think we are the only couple living in the block. The block is private sector, nothing like uni accommodation, and to be honest, it's a very quiet area, not suitable for party students (although that does not stop our neighbours) and I think it is more suited for mature students or couples like ourselves. Most of our neighbours moved in with the start of this academic year, so we have been here a year longer than them.

Anyway, the other day, my SO initiated some morning shenanigans, which we never usually have the time/inclination for, so obviously I jumped at the chance. And it was really, really good and we both got very carried away in the moment, as you do. In the post-afterglow-afterglow, I pick up my phone and automatically click the Facebook tab (bad habit I know), and to my absolute horror, at the top of my news feed is a post from one of those 'spotted' pages, which is clearly about our love making. It was addressed to my SO, no names mentioned as they don't know us yet thankfully, but they mentioned the name of the block of flats. It was the most vile comment which sought to completely humiliate us, and the comments followed suit. The thing is, whilst we were reading it, we could hear people in the flat below mimicking sex noises etc, so we were in no doubt about who had posted it, and we later responded by asking for the moderators to take it down as it was turning into a manhunt to find out which flat it was and we knew that it was very unlikely there be would be many couples living around here. We also sent downstairs a note, asking that they come to us next time they had a complaint and also remarking about how childish and malicious their post was.

I have not been able to get this incident off my mind. I think it is awful that people think it is ok to shame others into being silent during sex. It wasn't at an unreasonable hour, it was mid-morning, and I think people living in flats should expect to put up with a bit of noise. We are not screamers, yes the bed does creak, but we can't really do anything about that, it came with the flat and we are not exactly in a position to buy a new one, as the poster so kindly remarked. There is only so much we can do, of course we are aware that people can hear us and we are very quiet and considerate in everything else that we do around the flat. We have to put up with shouting, slamming doors, loud music and we are often woken up in the night by drunken behaviour from them. We know they can hear us having sex, we can hear them pee, for crying out loud, but I am not going to stop having sex in my own home, and I'm certainly not going to sneak around. It has affected my boyfriend though, because he feels very self-conscious now, as do I to some extent, thanks to some sex-starved hypocrites!

Sorry to rant a bit, but I just wondered how other people felt about this type of reaction to sex. So /r/sex, do you think they were right to complain? Were we being inconsiderate? Do you think we should just say fuck em' or do we need to make extra effort to be quiet?

Tl; dr, neighbours posted 'anonymously' about our noisy sex whilst we were in the throes, boyfriend upset, were they wrong to complain?
Edit: spelling and tl; dr

Edit 2: Thank you for all your helpful responses so far. I just wanted to clarify one or two things. The complaint was not your typical noise complaint, it was deliberately demeaning and shaming of us having sex full stop, and I was surprised how many of those who commented on the post had negative attitudes towards sex- I live in the UK, and I know their are many jokes about the British and sex, but I was surprised to see it was to some extent, true, nonetheless.The post said that my SO was unrhythmned, obviously a moron and that it sounded like he was engaging in a scrum. It wasn't a complaint about the noise, rather, an opportunity to be cruel, and it made my very loving SO feel self-conscious. None of the above rang true for me, we have amazing sex, but he took it to heart.

A lot of you have said that we give too many fucks. You are absolutely correct, I have always struggled with this. I have always wanted to not give a fuck, but I do. This isn't due to immaturity as someone said, more to do with the fact that that is just my nature, I am too self-critical and I care what others think of me.
Anywho, you've really helped me get over it, and I love that there were some practical sound-proofing methods!  Like I said, we're not screamers, I think the fact that sound carries so well through the building means that we will be heard however quiet we think we're being.

Edit 3: To the people who have posted Avenue Q, thank you, we used to play/sing this when we first got together and were living in halls. Our flatmates (our best friends now) were very understanding, wonderful people and went about their daily lives as if they didn't know we constantly snuck off for sex... oh the early days!!

I was going down on her and used my tongue all around the clit and I think I have a good technique down now, I kept my hands busy around her body and did a little fingering, not too much and not too deep. Then I felt her body start trembling a bit. I found a good spot. I moved my tongue elsewhere and went to back to the same spot. Her legs shook a bit more. I kept at it. My mouth was getting tired but I couldn't stop now. I'm so close! I held onto her hands and we clasped fingers. Holding our hands so tightly while she was making more and more moaning noises. My mouth kept going even though my jaw was getting sore. And then her feet went up and she let out a little scream. I started licking slower and slower until she grabbed the top of my head. I got up and stared at her in the eyes while she still layed on her back. I wanted to ask her if she came. But we stared into each others eyes for what seemed like an eternity. She reached up and grabbed the back of my head and pulled me into her lips. We kissed for a little bit and that's when I asked ""Did you ...""  
She nodded and then held me in. Her hug was more of gratefulness than sensual

tldr: I'm a male with a fantasy about my girlfriend getting a strap-on and doing me, but I don't know how to ask and don't know how I feel about it. Thinking about it makes me feel strange.

Long version: For a long time, I've wanted to try strap-on anal with my girlfriend. We've tried minor anal play before, like plugs, etc; it was good, not something I'd want to do every time or even most times, but when I'm in the mood for it it can be pretty nice. But I want to try moving to something more... I don't know, serious?

Really, it's not even the actual anal play that I think is what's most interesting to me, it's really the role reversal... I'm pretty hyper masculine and my girlfriend is pretty passive, and I'd like to see basically how the other side lives. I think it'd be fun to be the ""passive"" partner, or the ""bottom,"" or whatever you want to call it.

I don't feel ""gay,"" I'm attracted to breasts, curves, smooth hairless bodies, you know... the traditional female. I'm not attracted to dudes. But, like the Louie C.K. joke, although I've never seen a cock I want to suck, I'm not conceptually opposed to it. To be completely honest, I don't really care what private parts a partner has. I feel like if my girlfriend was transgender, I wouldn't even care.

Maybe that doesn't make sense. I've never really discussed this before, with anyone, but there it is. Thinking about these things makes me feel strange, like it's not ""right"" or whatever. And I'm afraid that bringing it up with my girlfriend, she'll think I'm a ""sissy"" or not a real man and lose her attraction to me. So, I don't really know what to do.

1334492970.0,533,self.sex,sapqh,My girlfriend and I just had our first bisexual foursome. It was awesome. [update][crosspost from r/bisexual],779,246,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/sapqh/my_girlfriend_and_i_just_had_our_first_bisexual/,"I originally [posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/r8zng/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_planning_a_foursome_with/) about advice on planning our first bisexual foursome, and there were some asking for updates, so here I am to share.

After meeting the other couple a few times, and getting to know each other a bit we finally decided to invite them over for drinks tonight. We started the night by going out to eat. After dinner we came back to our place for drinks and games. We started the evening with something tame (apples to apples) and some booze. After we became a little more loose we brought out a [sexy game we found online](http://www.greatsexgames.com/tna.html). 

The game started slow by asking us about different sexual experiences we had and would like to have. After we went through all the survey and thought cards, and were able to open up to each other a bit more we finally made it to the action cards.

Since we were playing this game as a stripping game, it didn't take long for all of us to become completely nude. The action really started though when the other guy drew a card that asked him to go down on his girlfriend. As my girlfriend and I watched, we couldn't help ourselves and I decided to go down on her too. The girls' ecstasy became one, and they seemed to both be riding the same wave of pleasure ultimately culminating in their simultaneous orgasms.

Soon after this, the last card of the game was drawn. My girlfriend drew a card that allowed her to receive head from any player of her choice for 69 seconds. After encouragement from the guys, we got her to choose the other girl. This being her first experience with another girl, they ended up ignoring the timer, and continuing until she reached an earth shattering orgasm. They then switched out, and my girlfriend had her first experience going down on another girl. Everyone was in agreement that this was the hottest point of the night. My girlfriend seemed like a pro. She was using her mouth and hands in ways that surprised even her. Ultimately she was able to bring herself and the other girl to climax multiple times.

At this point we all agreed that we needed a break. We sat and chatted for a little bit, and talked about how hot everything had been. We also talked about how comfortable we were with each other and agreed that everything other than a full swap was fair game. At some point I got bored with the conversation and started eating my girlfriend out again. This apparently turned everyone on, because before long our friend was getting head from his girlfriend. My girlfriend and I paused to watch, and when they noticed the audience they had, they invited us over to help. When we crawled over there his girlfriend said ""let the bicurious fella' go first."" I then grabbed his eight inch dick, and started going to town. This being the first cock I ever sucked, I was surprised at how natural it seemed. I was making him moan while my girlfriend played with his balls, and his girlfriend sucked on his nipples. At some point my girlfriend had moved over and started giving her head while I was giving him head. Everyone was in pure bliss. At a moment when we both looked up we decided to switch out. I gave his girlfriend head while she sucked his dick. We then switched out once more until my girlfriend made his girlfriend cum yet again.

This time we took a longer break. Everyone decided to get something to drink and rest up for the final round. My girlfriend and I became impatient once again though and decided to just go ahead and start fucking. She was riding me hard when he walked back in the room and yelled for his girlfriend to come see this. They both came in and watched us fuck like rabbits. We told them they were welcome to join in if they wanted, and I pointed out that she has always wanted to be eaten out while she was being fucked. The other guy then obliged and started eating her out while she was riding me reverse cowgirl style. Every once in a while I would pull out and he would start sucking me off. God was it hot. His girlfriend couldn't stay out of it and started giving him head while this was going on. We continued like this until all parties were exhausted.

After all the fun had been had, we grabbed a snack and talked about how awesome our night had been. We agreed that we all felt very comfortable all night with each other and would look forward to doing this again. We set a date before heading off to bed.

So now here I am, my girlfriend passed out next to me, and the other couple in the guest room. I haven't been able to take mind yet off how hot this was, and the things I am looking forward to doing next time. My girlfriend and I talked a bit before she went to sleep, and we agreed that this ended up being a great decision for our relationship, and she too can't wait to do this again.

for me, ever since I hit puberty, I've fantasized exclusively about getting girls off. i always skip past bj scenes in porn, because it just doesn't do anything for me if the girl isn't being stimulated. whereas going down on her is just as good as sex to me. (girlfriends seem to like this. :P) often times it takes considerable effort to stop going down on a woman begging me to fuck her (edging ftw).


i get the impression this is a lot different from most guys, what with all the stories about women who have never had orgasms, dudes not knowing/caring how to satisfy their ladies, etc. when I mention that I love to make girls cum most of the time people either don't believe me (""fakin' it bro!"") or act like I'm some kind of mythical endangered species.

Whaaaat? This guy (and his number of upvotes) and the commenter who displayed some skepticism's number of downvotes makes it come off as if choking is the norm, at least in the reddit population. So much the norm that not asking if the girl likes to be choked has a pretty high success rate. I'm here to get some perspective.

I think most people would agree that asking is definitely best, and hopefully, that that guy is a dufus.

Now, I know /r/sex is a bad place to sample from when trying to determine an average that suits the general population, but I'd still like to hear from some people.

----

**Women**: how many of you like to be choked? If you *do* enjoy choking, but a guy chokes you without asking, how would you react?

**Men**: How many of you enjoy choking a girl? Have you ever not asked? And have you ever been on the receiving end of being choked? Elaborate!

----

I know plenty of people are into this and I don't judge if you enjoy it, I'm just curious as to how many! I feel like a freak!

Personally, goddamn would I be livid if some guy tried to choke me when we were getting it on.

Thing is, you're disappointed as it's a little dry, it could use some dressing but you don't want to say anything to him as you don't want to upset him and he's quite proud of his sandwiches. Actually, all his customers have told him how great they are. You still like to order his sandwiches but sometimes you put your own dressing on at home.  

Well you get tired of this so one day you decide to tell him that his sandwiches aren't as good as they could be. He understands and experiments a little and eventually he makes a sandwich just the way you like them.

My SO and I talked about it. The huge thing I got from talking to you guys is something that we both agreed on: we're more like best friends than we are a couple. We've both known it for a while, but we've been holding on because we don't want to lose our friendship. But we decided that it is best we go our separate ways. 

She admitted that she has been unfair to me sexually, but she can't compromise her beliefs. That's something that's completely fair, and I really do hope she finds someone who has those same beliefs as hers. We think remaining friends is a definite possibility, but for now it's best to keep some distance to stray from any residual feelings of attachment.

I just want to thank you guys again. In a way, you gave me the confidence to talk to her about our issues. Additionally, you've given me a lot to think about and use for my future relationships. Seriously, r/sex, you're awesome, and I hope I can help you guys in the future too. Stay sexy!

EDIT: When I came to r/sex, I knew that I would be hearing a lot of what I wanted to hear, so that's why I tried to stay conscientious about that. There's a lot of aspects of the relationship that were taken into consideration, and just because I posed a question about one part of it, doesn't mean anyone understands the entirety of it. This break up isn't solely for one reason, and certainty isn't due to just a lack of sex. But r/sex helped in making me analyse further into the relationship, and for that I'm grateful.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1370901491.0,,,True,t3_1g2jy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1g2jy6/update_my_20m_girlfriend_20f_is_waiting_until/,

As many saw, Retiredpornstar put up a great ""how-to"" for spicing up your sex life (for woman, but men should take note). After reading through the comments there was a small outcry for a male version and that is what I hope to bring you here. As a type of precursor, I want to make it known that this is not a step by step guide or a linear style of thinking. As Retiredpornstar said, these should be used to spice things up and not as a requirement or prerequisite to having a great time in bed. 

Now to the fun stuff. As men, I like to think we have a bit more depth than many women give us credit for. Sure, we all want to get off by blasting the shit out of her pussy, making her scream our name and showing her who the boss is. I mean, that's what women want right? Well, sort of. As is life in any relationship, its about checks and balances, giving and receiving  and the joys that come with that. Just as women want to pleasure men, we as men have a responsibility to show that we aren't just dense piles of meat with a stick. We want, excuse me, we NEED to show that we can provide the ecstasy and fulfillment that a women craves. 

I am going for chronological order but am also staying within the style that Retiredpornstar went with

1. Sending a text mid-day: This was pointed out for the women but is just as important for the men. We seem to have short term memory problems and sex is an indicator of that. We can go from 0 to 100 in a split second. Women can as well but warming them up before hand is much more satisfying and makes you feel accomplished. Texting about how sexy her curves are, how you can't stop daydreaming about her body, how you would pleasure her inside and out; these get the juices flowing and get imaginations running wild. Hell, make it good enough to get yourself hard. Remember, it is about HER, but feel free to throw in something to the tune of ""feeling your lips on my cock...."" as long as it is empowering to them. Make them feel confident in what they do and how much it really gets you off.

2. Be as cliche as possible: Here's where the cornball comes in. Do things she would normally do for you(for the love of god if you take this list as sexist then you clearly don't belong here, its an example) whether that be laundry, dishes, cloths, vacuuming  cleaning, taking the dog for a walk, making dinner, setting the table...etc. Whatever it is that she does for you that you know she would love for you to do, DO IT. Be romantic, be classy, be the James fucking Bond of dinner time. Imagine greeting her in a tux and bow tie with rendered duck breast with mango salsa, brocolini, roasted potatoes, a great bottle of wine, flowers and a table cloth. Even if you cant provide this level of class, show her that is what you are attempting. Just the mere idea that you would go out of your way to make her a queen is huge.

3. Rev those engines: Now lets really get those endorphin's firing. Be catty, be a prude, BE THE TEASE FOR ONCE. If there is one thing that can get her going it is by role reversing. Remember, we have goods too and it is a waste not to be as creative as they can be. Caress her, gently touch her shoulders and arms, lightly kiss her neck, move your hands down her sides and just above pussy, run down her breasts and over her nipples...before and after she takes her cloths off. Even once your in the buff, use that cock as a teasing tool and not just a ram rod. Glide it down her ass, rub it against her clit, just straight up tease the shit out of her with it.  This is a drawn out process but you have to feel it out as well. Do not jump the gun but don't take too long either, we want her to the point of begging but not giving up.

4. Getting her wet and ready: Now that you have claw marks up your back and she is visibly shaking in desire, lets show her what we can do...with our mouths and hands. Lick her pussy, and I don't mean just go and eat her out, I mean lick her pussy. Lightly lick the lips, penetrating only in the slightest. Suck her clit, play with it on the tip of your tongue  While you do this, use your hands all over her body, rub her tits, grab them, grab her hips, caress her sides, all while glancing up every now and then. Move your tongue around her entire crotch area. Lick her thighs  nibble on them, move up her body, suck her tits, kiss her neck, move back down and repeat. She will be ready to kill you to ride your cock at this point but don't give in. 

5. Lets eat out tonight: Now show her the size...of your tongue. Penetrate her pussy with your tongue, get your face wet, get that delicious wetness on your lips and in your mouth and enjoy it. Show her how much you enjoy it, if she tries to pull you up, pull back down, grab her legs and push them up so that they are above your shoulders. Eat her ass; now this is more a comfort thing between the two of you but in all honesty, you should at least try if you haven't. No need to go all out like you do on her pussy, but just sneak a lick here and there, get the whole pussy/taint/ass area wet, show her you know how to pleasure her and maybe even show her how much she can enjoy you pleasuring her. We want her to the point of no return, we want her to crave things she never has, we want that pussy red and wet and just opening up for your cock.

6. Enjoy some reciprocation: This is more a side note but if she wants to suck your cock after this, let her. Remember, just as much as you enjoy getting her going, she feels the same way with you. Let her display her skills, let her show you how much she loves and adores your cock. let her tease you just as bad because at this point, she may want to try and one up you which is a good thing. If not and she is just enjoying it, awesome as well.

7. Lets get this show on the road: Now lets show her the motion of your ocean. Come up from eating her out, start kissing her, nibble her neck, put her legs on your shoulders and slowly slide your cock deep inside her, as deep as you can go. You will feel how swollen and waiting her pussy is for your cock, but be gentle. Going all out will just lose all the anticipation you have built up. Move her pussy with her legs while you change angles of your cock, push her legs together, spread them wide apart, get that cock to rub against every wall inside her. I want you to be the man for once, not some teenager who just pounds one out. Show her you know her body, show her you love her body, show her how much your cock loves her pussy. 

8. It's a Team effort: Now you can show her the love pounding machine you can be and fuck her shit to next sunday, but have control. Show her you are the man and you know how to pound her pussy but let her express her desires as well. Let her get on top, be amazed how she slides up and down your cock. Grab her ass, suck and bite her tits, claw her back, show her how much she is getting you off and how fucking good it feels. Get in a rhythm with her, connect your minds and desires and put on a show for each other. Do what you love to do and throw in something exotic (ass play (and not just for her), pin each other down, grab her neck(widely varies and should only be done if you know she likes/is comfortable with it), fuck her over a couch, over a table, on the floor...) whatever is out of the norm for you guys. Introducing new things is a great way of finding pleasures you and her never knew about.

9. The Climax: The moment both of you have been waiting for, but make it hers. In my experience, women have a much more pleasurable orgasm than men (scientifically proven as well) and why shouldn't they, it takes a lot more to get her off than you so make that moment explosive. You will see it in her eyes, you will hear it and you can see it from her body, when she is just about there take her to the point by hitting her spot over and over, even if it isn't the best for you. Get that cock deep in there and make her cling on to you for dear life, we want her just about motionless when this is done. Once she is just about there, get yourself ready to bust as well. There is not a better feeling in the world than you and her cumming at the same time, in the same motion, in the same position. This is the moment you both have wanted for each other the entire time so make it happen. When you cum, thrust your cock into her, she will feel it, she will know the cues, and this will just help her get off just as her cumming will help you get off. Its all about timing and reading each other. Make each other feel like the man/woman, make it seem that both of you are perfect for each other, this short moment is one of the most concrete in any relationship (sounds dense but it's true) and honestly, you will both love each other that much more knowing you are that in tune.

10. The wrap-up: As dumb as this may seem, this is pretty crucial. As men, we naturally seek to get up, get a drink, take a bite of cold pizza, and feel accomplished and exhausted in what we did (its actually all biology, but that's for another day). Don't go anywhere, lay with her, kiss her, be gentle with her, show her you are the caring and loving man and not just a sex machine. If she wants water, go get her water, if she just wants you to hold her, do that too. She has just giving you her body to do what you want and you owe it too her to look in her eyes and say you love her. This step will bring you infinitely closer together and can really express the type of man you are.

11. Spice it up right (the footnote): As with Retiredpornstars guide, these things are to be added on a here and there basis to spice up your sex life. Keep it new, keep it changing, add things I wouldn't even think of doing. Be the man that knows how to give and receive. Must you make her dinner just to be this romantic? no, not at all. You know each other better than anyone else so use it to your advantage. Just be smart about it and do what you do. You guys are together for a reason, you obviously have been doing something right to be with her so don't lose that side, but adding a little zip here and there can go a long ways to adding some fun to the bedroom.

So, the title pretty much sums it up.....

 Last night we had romantic night in after a stressful day, had some Bob Marley playing, dinner was in the ovan, candles were on...we were having a little slow dance in the kitchen when he asked me '' what are you thinking'', at this point I could feel his hard cock against me and I said ''I really want to suck your cock'', so I got down on my knees and did my thing.....
 ''Great I thought to myself, gonna have some good loving tonight, haven't had sex in 2 weeks and we had a good convo about sex last week etc''.

So after the BJ, he takes me to the sofa and we go at it doggy style, after 2minutes he stops, I turn around a bit surprised and he tells me that he came...So I don't make a big deal, 
I say  ''No worries I'll just go and clean up in the toilet...''. I come out and he is serving up dinner, he makes some stupid joke about '' No more sex until August hardy har har!''.... so we eat dinner and relax.

 Then later we are sitting on the sofa and I give him my horny eyes, I tell him how much I love to suck his cock and I touch his hand to bring it between my legs, he stops me and tells me '' no not now, just let it happen''. So I said I was doing it now because Iknow he gets annoyed when I try it last minute befores sleeping. I tell him I am going to bed and give him a kiss goodnight. He comes to bed 15mins later and is spooning me, I take his hand and guide it between my legs again and he says to me '' I thought you were going to be in here taking care of yourself/touching yourself''..huffed and rolled over.

I was so horny I got myself off beside him as he snored away. Seconds after my orgasm the tears start to fall down my cheek and I feel completley used and unwanted. 



EDIT:
  Thanks for all the suggestions and advice you guys have given. A few things stood out to me:

1.He doesn't get embarressed when he comes quickly so I doubt that theres a problem with his ''ego''.

2.Our relationship is very loving in other ways, he tells me he loves me numerous times per day, tells me I am beautiful and loves me body, so I doubt it is about his lack of interest in the relationship.

3. I have had numerous talks with him about our sex, how I would prefer at least once a week and thats me compromising. I have told him how each time he rejects me I resent him a little bit more and I get frustrated to the point where we have arguments which is not healthy.

4. I have told him I even feel awkward around him when I am horny because I don't want to be the one who is always lusting after him.

5. After these talks, as recent as last Sunday he said he would change his way of thinking and he would try to be better about sex. Fast forward to last night and he completley ignored my advances twice and really hurt my feelings. The fact that he presumed I would be ''taking care of myself'' indicates that he wasn't in the least bit interested in helping me out.

6. I am going to sit him down and tell him how I feel and what needs to happen...Like he is a 5 year old
I will spell it out too him what I NEED and I will give him a chance to show me that he wants our sex the way it used to be. If after this talk nothing changes, regardless of exteriour stresses he may have, he cannot put our relationship first then I guess its curtain call for us. As much as that pains me to say, but I hope that it will get better with all the suggestions you guys have given me...Thank you ;)

This is pretty rare for me and let's just say I had a great time. When I came I looked at my finger and thought... ""oh what the hell I want to know"" so I took a tentative lick. And I was not happy. I only got a brief taste but it was a lot more flavorful than I was expecting, and, while not necessarily a *bad* taste, it was not what I would call *good*. It worried me. So I read up on how to get your ladyjuices to taste good and the general consensus was lots of fruit, specifically oranges and pineapple (which is a well known one for guys). Luckily there are a billion orange trees right outside my door so I picked a handful and started munching away. I probably had three oranges a day (delicious blood oranges and regular oranges) for 2 or 3 days. The other day I decided to see if there was a change, not knowing if it would work that quickly and kind of scared. I took a hesitant lick. It was still a very strong flavor, but... I took another taste. *HA! MY VAGINA TASTES LIKE ORANGES!* It was undeniable. It was tangy and sweet and straight-up ORANGEY. I thought it might improve the taste a little but I wasn't expecting it to be that noticeable or direct. You might say ""oh it's just in your head, it might taste good but I doubt it tastes like actual oranges."" All I can say is try it for yourself.

(Pre-Op Trans Woman)",1047,545,751,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/o5sxf/cute_boy_i_am_dating_has_issues_touching_me_down/,"He does it every now and then, but in general he won't touch or rub my genitalia, even with clothing on. I have given him several suggestions for ways to do it that may be less uncomfortable, but even if he does it, it's only for a few seconds. On a few occasions he has touched me enough to give me an orgasm, and it was an amazing experience that made me feel incredibly close to him. 

He really likes anal sex, which is fun, but I can't orgasm from anal sex alone. I can give myself a ""helping hand,"" but it also takes me a while to come. And even then, it's not the same. 

Worse, he almost always has an orgasm before I can, even if I am playing with myself, and after he isn't very into the act anymore, making it much more difficult for me. Whenever we have sex it seems like the entire point is for him to stick his penis in me and get off. After that, his interest wanes considerably. (Unless he decides to get off again.) It's becoming very frustrating.

I don't entirely understand because to me, I enjoy making him feel good in whatever way he enjoys. I really enjoy pleasing him, and he never fails to enjoy himself either. 

When I have talked to him about it, he complained that I was difficult to get off and that his ex-girlfriend would have 3 or 4 orgasms in the same span of time that we have penetrative sex, even from anal. 

I've at least talked him into playing with my breasts more, but he doesn't seem to be very into that either. It's like he is half asleep, and he just strums at my nipples like a guitar. From our talks about it, it seems like he feels pleasuring me with his penis should be enough. (Or at least that is what he wants to do.)

I want to have surgery, but that isn't going to happen anytime soon. And I have problems with my condition as well; it's no fun. The best I can do is just try to treat it like an oversized clit. But this is just making it worse. 

We have sex 2 - 3 times per week, and in 9 months together he has never failed to get hard or have at least 1 orgasm, even when he touched my genitalia. I wish I could have an orgasm through other means, but I haven't found one. 

I know it's a lot to ask when I know he doesn't feel comfortable with my lack of vagina, but at the same time I would do and have done things to make him feel good I didn't really want to do either. And the problem is obviously bigger than him not touching me. 

How can I approach this without causing more problems or demanding too much of him? Part of me feels like I should just be grateful he is interested at all, but I know I should have more self-respect than that as well. Does anyone have any suggestions for ways to improve the situation? Maybe other things to try? (Has anyone else been in this situation?) Help!

Thanks!

tl;dr: Boyfriend always has an orgasm, but won't help me have an orgasm. He comes and loses interest. 

Edit: Downvoting me before people can even see it? Not nice. This is a real issue in my relationship. :( I just want some good advice. And just to clarify, I'm a pre-op trans woman. That means I am a woman, but I don't have the right genitalia.

I'm not normally shy out of bed, but he is. He is so shy that he has only had a couple of sexual partners and that didn't go very well. When we first started trying sex, he would go soft the minute I paid attention to his penis. Then, the minute we got out a condom. We have worked up to the point where he stays hard for a few minutes of intercourse, but then he goes soft. As a result, I finish him off with a blowjob and using my hands, which he seems to really enjoy. 

The problem is that I'm not really getting mine. I'm pretty sensitive, so sometimes I orgasm during the few minutes of intercourse. Sometimes, he will touch my breasts for a bit and I can sometimes orgasm that way. Once, I got him to touch my labia for a while and it was so unexpectedly wonderful, I had an orgasm then. But, that's it. The rest of the time, I'm on my own. 

I asked him if he had ever gone down on a woman and he told me he tried it once and didn't much like it. I really want him to finger me, go down on me, touch me more! I have been dying to say something to him for months or guide his fingers with mine, but I just haven't been able to work up the courage. Now, I'm getting frustrated with both of us. 

I told him I wanted him to ""touch me more, down there."" But that just resulted in him kinda lightly touching the outside of my labia. I'm going to have to be explicit in what I want and that's the hard part. 

I don't think he's just lazy or selfish. He isn't that way with me outside the bedroom or in his life. And he is incredibly shy. I have to buy the condoms because he's too embarrassed to do it. He told me he has never talked about sex with anyone before. 

Does anyone have any good suggestions? I want to get more, but for some reason, I'm not able to make the words come out of my mouth. Help!

Guess what? He didn't like it. Or, rather to say, it didn't do anything for him. He's mentioned before that he likes a lot of enthusiasm from me, which I'm usually pretty good at. So I thought, by doing this, it would be so hot for him. Well after I did it, he just laughed and said ""What did you do that for?"". He explained that he'd rather just to finish in my mouth (which I've been doing for years), and that finishing on my face or butt doesn't do anything for him. No particular reason why, it just didn't.

I guess the moral of the story is: all guys are different. I shouldn't assume my guy will like something just because the majority does. He's happy already with the way I give blowjobs, and there's no real need for change. Anyway, just wanted to share.

My sexuality is tied to my failures with my ex and I don't know how to get it the fuck back.,732,234,257,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/19iqoa/i_feel_emasculated_beyond_explanation_my/,"**EDIT 3**: This really exploded with an unbelievably touching amount of emotional and practical support, suggestions, and truthful, varying perspectives.  I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, *thank you*.  This has been an issue I've not been able to share with anyone, really, that finally being able to be open about it and find others in similar situations physically or emotionally is incredibly uplifting.  Thank you for your responses, thank you for your messages, and thank you for being supportive and caring and truthful of a complete stranger with a seemingly textbook issue.  But when that textbook issue takes over a large portion of my life like it feels like it has, it makes gestures and words like all of yours incredibly meaningful.   So thank you, so much.

I have a small dick.  I'm well aware of what the averages are.  It's small.  Even when pressing as hard as possible into that little ""fat pad"" that I'm currently in the process of losing, I'm barely 4"" erect, and also barely 4"" in girth.  To make matters worse, that girth tapers off significantly toward my glans, which does not seem to hold much blood / firmness during an erection at all.  I'm mid-twenties, so what I've got is what I've got.  However, the numbers aren't the issue here.  The *usability* is the issue.

Was in a relationship for four years with my first love / best friend.  Lots of issues led to me having to end the relationship while not past my feelings.  The biggest thing that for some reason has just been *absolutely torturing me* for the past few weeks pretty much every single waking hour of every day has been my sexual inadequacy.

When we tried to have vaginal, penetrative sex, I physically couldn't.  I couldn't fuck my girlfriend.  Hearing the words, ""I don't feel anything"" when I *thought* I was inside of her was the most emasculating experience of my entire fucking life.

*Two years* after the break up, she made the careless, stupid decision to *excitedly* confide in me that something sexual had happened between her and some fellow she had been hanging out (I had very recently made it clear, several times in fact, that I was still dealing with residual feelings for her).  Everything finally hit me.  All of my inadequacy and my sexual failure and the fact that I tried so hard to be a satisfying lover in every other way I possibly could, yet she preferred to get from this guy after a few days what I invested myself in for four years and ultimately couldn't provide.

My inadequacy has become an obsession that I can't seem to control.  I hate it.  I've been looking into phalloplasty and the like, which makes the shame even worse with a tinge of guilt for feeling like I need to change myself.

My sexuality is tied to my failure with my ex and the image of her enjoying the physical intimacy (and the emotional intimacy that goes with it) I couldn't give her so casually now is burning the inside of my head every time I even try to enjoy *myself* and just masturbate.

She deserved to live her own life without my issues getting in the way, and I cut contact several months ago to try to move on, but only recently has this re-surfaced and begun to seriously start fucking with my day-to-day life.

I don't know how to get past this sense of worthlessness as a sexual individual or potential partner and I'm frankly exhausted of the back-and-forth of feeling like I'm moving on and then ten minutes later feeling absolutely debilitated by it.

I want my fucking sexuality back.  And most of all, I want to feel like I can actually fuck a woman.  I want to be able to take and have a girl and share that kind of intimacy and the idea that I can't because of something that I can't fucking control scares the absolute shit out of me.

**EDIT 2**: For those urging me to start working on myself and making changes, I wanted to let you know that I have been.  After cutting contact with my ex indefinitely, I kicked my diet and my exercise that I'd been toying with for a while into high gear, and I've since lost a *ton* of weight.  I have a lot more to go, but it has given me some seriously unexpected changes in perspective that have been both frightening and unbelievably exciting at the same time.  I kicked a gambling addiction a few years ago (well, I'm sober of it for over three years, anyway), and am in the process of kicking the ass of my compulsive eating disorder (also undiagnosed which is another reason I've wanted to see a therapist).  In general I've made greater efforts to monitor my health and have seen more doctors in the past few months than I have over the past ten years in order to actually check up on the things I thought were too small or too embarrassing to confront.

I'm not in as entirely bad a place as I likely came off in my original OP.  Mentally, there's a lot going on that I need to get checked out just as well as my body, and as intimidating as it is, I'm going to start looking into finding a therapist again.  I think, as this is the most pressing issue I can't seem to deal with, I'm going to try and find a sex therapist in particular, or at least one with experience there.

Thank you again.

**EDIT/UPDATE**: Thank you so much for your responses and suggestions and bluntness.  I've done my best to read through every response as I saw them, and I just wanted to take a moment to update with some clarifications.

Therapy is going to happen.  I am resolved to it.  I understand the pointed responses in saying, ""Why isn't it happening *now*?"" and I acknowledge the point.  I'm not excusing or arguing for why not doing it now is right for me.  After seeing all of these responses, I'm inspired to get back into trying to find one.  It's super intimidating and scary, but I acknowledge how helpful it will be to me.

As far as being a lover in other ways and alternatives to PiV, *I want nothing else*.  I loved giving oral, using my hands, holding, rubbing, and giving pleasure in any way I was able.  It's one of the things that I pride myself on—caring about being an attentive lover.  Toys and sleeves and extensions and rings and all of that are things I am more than open to.  It's something I actually suggested in my past relationship, but it was shot down pretty much instantly (to be fair, I think it was her way of trying to say that she was okay without those things because she was worried about my inadequacy, though I genuinely wanted to try them for *both* our sake rather than just hers).  I haven't let that get me to discount the possibility in the future with a partner who might be okay with that.  

In general, a lot of what everyone is saying here are things that I have never disagreed with, even before posting this.  Logically, I have reasoned things out fairly well, I think.  I know that size isn't everything to everyone and that not every woman *needs* PiV from the flesh itself (I actually posted in AskWomen a long time ago about this issue and was met with a bunch of women on both sides of that), and that vaginas come in just as many sizes as others.  I actually frequented this sub, as well as AskWomen and AskMen for a long time and have given a lot of this advice myself.  I guess it makes me a bit of a hypocrite to have so much difficulty taking it to heart, myself.  The issue that I am having so much trouble with is that logically reasoning this stuff out has little to no effect on the emotional side of these experiences.  I know it shouldn't and I know my options (as much as an inexperienced fellow can), but for whatever reason these memories and flashes of my inability and the idea of her with another fellow as well as my suspicion that there was some emotional cheating going on along the latter end of my relationship just show up *anyway* despite trying to reason it all out.

Someone suggested that this could be a mild form of PTSD or something.  I don't know how true that is, but I'm starting to realize that this is a lot more obtrusive than I thought.  Therapy will happen.  I can't say how soon, but it will.  It was always going to, but I'm realizing that it might be a bit more immediately necessary than I thought.

Thank you, all of you for sharing your perspectives and your own experiences and kind words (which include bluntness and truth).  While this is going to be an up-and-down struggle for a while, I'm sure, I certainly am feeling better today about all of this.

I laughed, and decided that it sounded interesting and hilarious. I should give this a try! At least it'll be something funny to tell my grandkids about... (epic dark foreshadowing setup)

Fast forward to this morning when I decided, it was time to do some manscaping for the first time in my life. I snipped off what hair I could, and then got my lighter and went for some light test runs... Nothing happened... so I get a little closer... and a liiiiittle- OMFG IT'S ON FIRE! IT'S ON FIRE! IT'S SPREADING! FUCK FUCK! PUT IT OUT!!

I gave the loudest involuntary yelp of my 23 years in that moment. I thrust my groin out and slapped it with the passion and fear of a thousand matadors.

OK... Calm down, calm down. Calm... I'm ok... it stung but it hasn't done any major damage... an it took off a decent sized patch... If I do this once more... I'll do it nice and slow- HOLY FUCKING SHIT ITS LIKE STRAW SOAKED IN PETROL!

I gave the the loudest involuntary yelp of my 23 years.

So I'm not one to turn my back on something I've decided to do just because it risks grievous bodily harm for little to no real benefit...

...

... 2 more terrified yelps and a stinging sack later I decided... This probably wasn't a good idea...

There may be no experience more unsettling than a single hair on fire exploding into a fire that sizzles its way down the hair of a large area towards your crotch... Just in case anyone had any doubts about this.

So I write this post in the hope that some helpful soul can link me to the original post I read about this which I can no longer find. I can't help but wonder if I was doing it wrong somehow...

But also to make sure people know that fine pubic hair can be very explosive when exposed to flame. While I know most people have probably spent a long time sitting and thinking that *their* genitalia are flame retardent, the simple truth is, they're not.

Tl:dr: I'm singed but there is still the possibility that I'll have grandkids someday, and I'll now have a hilarious story to tell them! That'll traumatise them as much as I've traumatised myself. Good times with r/sex! And where is that original post!?

Edit: Just clarifying for anyone thinking of that post, it wasn't a 1 flippant comment thing. It was a long hilarious post supported by someone who claimed to have been doing it for a long while.

She kept me in the dark about all the plans and being secretive, deceiving me with false clues about everything! And I decided to just trust her with all my being so I didn't try to investigate.

So a week before the wedding day she tells me that I should prepare for a ""nice dinner"" and ""dress fancy"", so we both did and I was nervous as hell! 

By her instructions I drove to a place outside town, it was a hidden place in the mountains. It was a big house she had rented for the night, We had an excellent dinner in the balcony, served by one of her friends as a waitress, the food was from our favorite restaurant, it was a nice feeling to just go with the flow and not have to worry about the little details. On the table there was a small box filled with card from the people we know full of happy wedding wishes for us. 

At the end of the meal she told me, ""Today I give you a threesome as a wedding present."" And a girl came down the stairs and took her clothes off in front of us and jumped into the pool, we followed her lead and got naked and into the pool as well.

Even if it was really cold we were burning hot with lust, We had a first awkward moment and then all of us started swimming because the water was so cold, then underneath the sky full of stars, they started kissing in front of me. I was stunned. Then my wife told me I should come closer, and the three of us started kissing and touching each other. The cold was so strong that my wife decided we should go to a room she had previously prepared. There was a fireplace that kept us warm while we took turns in the carpet, My wife was first, we kissed and touched every inch of her body while she moaned in pleasure. Then it was my turn, the feeling of being kissed by my wife while another girl gave me oral pleasure was amazing. 

Then they both started touching and enjoying each other while I fingered them both, each with one hand until I made them both cum.
Then we moved to the bed where my wife asked me to fuck the other girl while she watched and masturbated. I fucked her while watching my wife, the feeling was incredible, weird, unusual and overall very nice because I could feel my wife getting aroused by the sight of me fucking another woman. 

Then it was their turn to have sex while I watched, It was amazing watching their faces, their gestures and their moans. And in the moment my wife decided to eat her out I decided to place myself behind my wife and fuck her. 

I fucked her and made her keep eating out the other girl, the feeling of being able to fuck my wife while we both were touching the other girl was one of the best experiences I have had as a couple, we did this until the three of us came, and it was glorious.

After that my wife and I decided the other girl should leave, then we spend the night on the room with the fireplace. We talked about everything that had happened and had sex a couple more times.

We both agreed that it was an awesome experience and that some day we would have it again. 

What a great way to start a marriage.  

TL;DR: My wife planned a threesome as a wedding present for me. It was great to fuck two girls at the same time.

I was raped recently and I am currently in the process of prosecuting. It is one of the toughest things I have ever done and I just don't know if I should go forward with it.

I will tell you a little about what happened. I was drinking (and a decent amount for myself) and me and my friends decided to go out on a weekend night. We headed to a club that I had never been before. It was fun and I was having a good time. At some point I got separated from my friends and tried to find them. I thought they might be outside smoking so I went out to look for them. I went out there and they were not there so I called them. When they finally answered they said to come back inside to find them. When I tried, the bouncers would not let me back in because I was too drunk. I told my friend that I would just take a cab home. I walked to the curb, stepped off it, twisted my ankle and gashed my knee. At that point I was trying to compose myself when hands grabbed me. He said he would help me and take me home. I told him that I wanted to take a cab. He insisted and given the state of my ankle and my level of intoxication I wasn't able to fight him off. He put me in his car. I asked him to then take me home. He told me we had to make a pit stop first. He took me to what I believe was his apartment and raped me. I don't remember saying no but it hurt and I kept asking to go home. When it was over he took me home.

The next day I went to the hospital and filed a police report. 

I have sought legal guidance and counseling. 

It has all been very traumatic and hard. Today I was unable to id the guy in a photo line up. 

I have many people telling me to do what is best for me. I don't want to keep doing this and torturing myself, but if I don't keep pressing charges he gets away.

Some people just enjoy normal, straight sex, and don't enjoy experimentation. They're not inhibited, they're not denying themselves, they just see sex in a different way.

Don't break up a years-old, very loving relationship because the girl doesn't like to give head. She's just made that way.

Then, around christmas she started getting sore from sex, and about the only position that didn't ""stretch"" (her description of the pain) her vagina was missionary. 

After some time I asked her if it was ok for me to take a look around down there, and I soon discovered that she had a pretty big tear (1 cm+) close to the bottom of her vaginal opening. When we discovered this we decided to take a break from having sex to let it all heal. After three weeks it was all good, but the tears returned after having sex again.

I wasn't 100% committed the entire time, sure I had relapses, but I was on a year-long journey. 

I want provide a first-hand account for young men out there who are struggling to find this type of primary resource.


Here is what I was dealing with and needed to retrain my brain from:

* I have masturbated to porn and porn alone from age 12 to 24, my current age. The stimuli has always been plentiful and I ignorantly didn't realize or care it could be detrimental.
* I have had the same posture, grip, speed, etc for that entire time and have done so almost ritualistically so it became an extreme force of habit.
* My grip for those 12 years was punishingly strong. It as so extremely strong that it actually noticeably altered my musculature.
* I lost my virginity at 18 and lasted for 45 minutes with a beautiful girl before getting bored and calling it a night. That would turn out to be a typical experience up to present day.
* Despite being in great shape I occasionally suffered from erectile difficulty, making pursuing sex a risky decision with little payoff and a huge potential for long-term embarrassment. Was prescribed viagra but I don't like it, you can ask why if you want to. This would be fixed as well, which might be the most important thing. 
* Handjobs are a waste of time. Blowjobs too, although they felt okay I never even came close.


Okay, so that's the position I was in going into last summer. Not good! I'm not going to get into the gritty reasons what happened, but 1 year ago I had a huge kick in the ass and this is what I did:


* Stopped looking at porn for weeks and months at a time. Would stay away from porn which wasn't a huge strain on my willpower because I was so desperate to change my life and rewire my brain.
* Stopped fapping for weeks, sometimes a month at a time. R/nofap is a good place. When I did allow myself to I would use a light touch. Fapping protocol was to use the lightest touch I could will myself to apply, sometimes just 2 fingers. I didn't just sit, I tried lying down, standing up because variety is important. I don't think quitting cold turkey is effective, but in moderation like once a week on average with a light touch worked for me. 
* Greatly reduced fapping to porn. Cut it out completely for a long time. I used my imagination about my current girlfriends, and if that wasn't working then I wasn't progressing. Eventually it started to work better and better and that meant that I was closer to being able to have a normal sexual relationship.
* Although I still don't come close during most of intercourse, I found 2 ways to match the frenetic tempo I am used to which successfully gets me off p in v. Getting the position and technique right made all the difference in the world.
* Handjobs and blowjobs still don't get me off yet but I don't see why I couldn't continue my training system to get there if I wanted to.


And finally, as of last weekend, I believe I have finally retrained my plastic brain to fully appreciate the wonders of natural sex the way it was always meant to happen, and it's GLORIOUS. So there you have it. I know that I would have benefited from knowing all this a year ago, and I sincerely hope that publishing this rare first-hand account on the internet will help young men deal with their own issues of this nature.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_sfofd,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/sfofd/just_cured_death_grip_after_6_years_and_hundreds/,

However, I can make myself orgasm through masturbation in 10 seconds, flat. I used to think that maybe my partner wasn't skilled enough, endowed enough, or physically attractive, enough. I've heard countless stories of women and men telling me I just haven't found someone who could ""hit it right."" I've also heard, numerous times, that some women just can't orgasm through penetration because they aren't wired that way. 

I've put a lot of thought into what it is that turns me on during the act and why I can't ever seem to go over the edge. I might even go as far as to say that the only time I am turned on during sex, physically, is when my boyfriend first puts his penis in. After that, my body doesn't feel much of anything, even though the act is still very enjoyable. 

It all comes down to one basic aspect. How hot my boyfriend makes me feel. I am so subconsciously preoccupied with my own insecurities during sex, that I cannot for the life of me just relax and enjoy it. Are my fake tits not bouncing enough? Is he still hard? Am I making a weird face? I hope I smell good. I wonder if my ass looks good from that angle. Does he think I'm too skinny? 

Even if I try to tell myself to forget about all the shallow insecurities that I'm almost positive he is not even thinking about, I can't seem to free myself from them. Of course, my boyfriend has no idea I feel this way and I try my best to exude nothing but confidence when we are having sex.

I know many people will say that I should talk to my boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure letting him know my insecurities, no matter how ridiculous they are, is just going to make me feel worse about them. 

Just wondering if any other womenl feel this way, and if it inhibits their sex lives as much as it does mine. 

tl;dr: My own insecurities during sex inhibit the way I feel, physically. 

EDIT: I ended up talking to my boyfriend about it. I didn't say a word about my insecurities and just started the conversation  with ""why do you think i can't orgasm during sex?"" He immediately explained that no matter how confident I seemed, he could sense i wasn't 100% comfortable. I was so surprised he picked up on that. He then went on to explain how ""ridiculous I am"" and how I might need glasses for not seeing what he sees. Part of the reason I felt talking to him about it would be useless was because I knew he would just try to compliment me and make me feel like I was crazy for being insecure. I don't feel as if the conversation really helped. However, some of you insightful redditors suggested blindfolding him or having sex in a pitch black room which I really think would help to get me out of my head and focus on physical pleasures. Others suggested smoking a little weed before we have sex to help relax my invasive thoughts. These are awesome ideas and I am excited to try them, thanks reddit!

I was wondering if any of you have tips on breaking the news. Has anyone every told you this? Did it work out? How did they tell you? Was there anything they did right / wrong in the way the went about telling you?

I would really appreciate some help / stories.

So far, I plan to approach it this way :


""I really like you and I feel like I can be myself around you. There's something you should know about me that I've been a bit nervous to bring up, but I want to be totally honest with you. I have herpes. There's no reason you would contract it because I've got it under control, but I want to be up front about this. The reason I have to deal with this is because my ex-boyfriend had it and didn't tell me, and we were not being careful. 

As long as we are careful, the odds of passing it are extremely slim - even more so if I go on medication.

Now, I'm not *overly* intense so this is just a step further from my first guide. Again please feel free to add your own comments and suggestions on how you make things kinkier. Again I've added examples of ""dirty talk"" throughout as indicated by quotations.

Normal disclaimer: So first things first, PLEASE, PLEASE discuss with your SO before you play, make sure you define your boundaries, and STICK TO THEM. It's always better for her to ask you to take things further later on, than for you to take things too far without her permission and ruin the experience and make her reluctant for her to want to try again! So establish boundaries, come up with a safe word (even if you don't think you need one...fantasies are one thing, actual enactment of them is another, she may not actually enjoy the reality of it once she experiences it so it's always better to play safe than be sorry!), and please be respectful of these boundaries. These kinds of activity require a great deal of trust from your SO, so please, please do not violate this trust.

Also, please constantly be aware of yourself and your partner during such sessions. If she appears to hesitate, looks anxious or uncomfortable in her behavior, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Ask her if anything is wrong, MAKE SURE NOTHING IS WRONG. If you have any doubt in your mind, just stop. If she uses the safeword, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Give her a second to relax and decompress. Talk to her about it, get her to communicate what went wrong. Please, please DO NOT continue, even if she says she is okay to get back into it. Just stop for the night. Cuddle instead. And please reassure and ENCOURAGE her to use the safeword.

Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT, this guide is not an guarantee crowd pleaser, it's from my personal experience, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. But this will vary from girl to girl.

Another thing I cannot stress enough is that EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT, this guide is not an guarantee crowd pleaser, it's from my personal experience, and I'm hoping SOME people will find it helpful/interesting. **THIS WILL VARY FROM GIRL TO GIRL.**

Now let's get things started ;)

- **Take control of blowjobs.** When receiving a blowjob, instead of letting her do all the work, ""face fuck"" her. Grab the side of her head and push her down onto your cock. For beginners, don't push too far down. For more hardcore individuals, push her down until it reaches the back of her throat. Pull out, look her in the eye and smile while stroking her cheek. Then ram your cock back down her throat. Repeat until satisfied. ""You should see how hot/slutty you look with my cock down your throat."" For subs, make her do this on her knees. If she closes her eyes or looks down, tug at her hair or grab her chin so she's looking at you: ""Eyes open/Look up, I want to see that pretty face of yours as you suck me.""

- **Facials.** ""What a pretty face you have...I think I want to see it covered in my cum"". ""I'm going to cum all over that pretty face of yours."" Once you've proceeded to unleash your load all over her face, smear some cum over her lips and get some on your fingers. Make her lick it off. Take a picture.

- **Sex toys!** This could honestly be a thread in itself. Toys for bondage (i.e. rope, handcuffs, tape, blindfolds), spanking (i.e. whips, paddles - though you can easily substitute with household items, things like rulers, the back of a hair brush, a cooking spoon, a belt, etc), vibrators, anal toys, dildos.

- **Take control of her masturbation.** Force her to touch herself but make it clear that she is NOT allowed to bring herself to orgasm. Get a remote controlled vibrator. Tie her up and use it on her - control the settings: bring her to the brink, then stop it. ""How badly do you want to cum right now?"" ""Give me a good reason to let you come (let her stammer out some answer)...not good enough.""

- **Submission.** Make her wear a collar. Tell her she can only move on her hands and knees unless you give her permission. Command her in all aspects (i.e. ""I want your eyes lowered unless I say otherwise."" ""Look at me only when I speak to you."" ""I want you naked for the rest of the night, is that clear? Now strip"") Make her confirm your dominance: After each command: ""Do you understand me?"" ""Are you going to obey like a good little slave?"" Make her thank you after performing certain tasks, this is especially fun in terms of punishment: ""I want you to thank me every time I slap you, do you understand?"" Reinforce your punishments ""You know why you're being punished don't you?"" (Make her give you the reason) ""That's right, because you were a disobedient little bitch. Now are you going to do better next time?""

- **More intense ""rape"" play**: Shove her face down into a pillow while you take her from behind. Hold her down by firmly pressing your palm to her back, or twist her wrists behind her back. Pull on her hair (again while in doggy style). 

- **Slap her across the face** (this was previously in the Light BDSM but many redditors indicated that it's more medium/heavy): Slap her face with your hand (or cock), alternate with tender cheek cupping between slaps. My SO tends to use slaps as punishment (aside from the usual spanking): *slap* ""Don't disobey me again."" *slap*.

- **Choking** (again was in light - should be here): Place your hands around her neck and squeeze lightly - never squeeze for too long, and make sure to constantly monitor her to ensure that she can breathe properly!! Please NEVER put direct pressure on the front of the throat (trachea area). Use light pressure with your fingers or thumb along the side. PLEASE PLEASE research breath play if you are interested in this - I cannot stress the importance of safety, there are MAJOR risks engaging in this activity and it is not something that should be experimented with without knowing how to go about it!!

- **Make her clean you up after you cum:** If you cum on your stomach, make her lick it up. ""Make sure you lick it clean like a good slut, don't waste a single drop of cum."" Or if you cum in her mouth: ""Make sure you swallow every drop of cum I give you."" Reward her with a kiss or glide a finger against her lips once she's swallowed: ""Good girl."" ""You're such a cum-loving little whore."" Lastly, demand that she cleans your cock after she ""made a mess by dripping her pussy juices all over it."" (Not a good idea after anal play for obvious reasons - instead, wipe your cock across her breasts/stomach)

**Edit: Adding one thing to spice it up even when you're NOT in the bedroom.**

- **Leave some nice hickies on her body. ""I'm going to mark you so you remember who you/this body belongs to.""**

- **If you had sex with her panties on (refer to Part One), after you're done, pull up her panties tight into her crotch and run your fingers down the outline of her slit. Tell her she's going to wear the panties for the rest of the day so she can remember what a dirty/good little slut she's been. Tell her you WILL BE checking that she obeyed when you see her later tonight, and if you found out that she didn't keep them on, you will be punishing her. Make sure you do this when you/she gets home from work. Praise her for being such an obedient girl when you see that she still has them on.**

**Edit 2: Very, very important point from exilius in terms of after care. Many of these sessions can be mentally (not only physically) exhausting and draining. So please take care of your girl after - make sure she's okay, ask what things she DID NOT like (as well as things she did like), make sure you did not overstep your boundaries. Hug her, kiss her, hold her, cuddle her, tell her you love her, tell her how lucky you feel that she trusts you enough with taking control, etc, etc.**

1344007906.0,486,self.sex,xmfxb,From a Woman who just had a FFM Threesome Yesterday:  A How To Guide on Successful Group Sex and Group Sex within Committed Relationships,832,346,217,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/xmfxb/from_a_woman_who_just_had_a_ffm_threesome/,"So I constantly see questions on this site such as ""I want a threesome, how do I convince my partner?"", ""How do we find a woman/man/partner for a threesome?"".  It’s also a familiar sentiment that threesomes are a sure way to end a committed relationship and that you shouldn’t have one if you value your relationship with your primary partner.  I want to challenge these notions today by detailing my successful experience and sharing what I’ve learned to others so that more people can have successful and fulfilling group sex adventures without jeopardizing their primary relationships.

Some background on me and my partner:  I’m a pansexual woman in a relationship with a straight man and we are both in our early 20s in the later part of college (early part of grad school).  I had never even kissed a woman prior to last night and this was my first threesome and also my partner’s first.  We spend several months talking about threesomes and figuring out what we wanted as well as it taking about 3 months to find the right partner.  We’re both pretty kinky in our regular sex life with each other and we’re pretty knowledgeable about sex.  Many of you on r/sex are probably familiar with my username since I’m pretty active here.  We met our partner online a few weeks ago and spend time messaging online.  Yesterday, we took her out to dinner then went back to my place and spent a full 3 hours playing with each other.  My partner and I are closer than ever with each other after this experience.  Here are my tips for having similar results in opening up your own relationships for group sex:

**Talk to Your Partner:** Group sex requires a high level of sexual communication skills, COMPLETE honesty, a high level of trust, and the ability to set aside feelings of jealousy.  You have to think of group sex as a form of nonmonogamy.  Too many people downplay threesomes because they are such a common fantasy but having a threesome is akin to opening your relationship so you have to know that you and your partner can handle seeing each other fucking someone else.  Talk to them about what you want and have a discussion about it in a non-sexual environment.  You need to be able to discuss what you want and what your comfort levels are rationally and openly.  Entertain the ideas you come up with in fantasy and discuss it for a long time before you take any action to find someone else.  Do not go out and find someone without your partner’s consent, for this to work both partners in the relationship need to be on board and equally enthusiastic.  If you feel uncomfortable with anything about the threesome then you aren’t ready to go find another partner.

**Dealing with Jealousy/Insecurity:**  With all forms of non-monogamous relationships this is always a concern.  It takes some time to develop the trust and honesty in your relationship you need to be able to allow your partner to play with someone else.  The best way to think about it is that most people fundamentally desire variety and this is about giving your partner sexual variety.  Just because he/she likes the unique traits of another individual does not mean he/she doesn’t still love you and your traits.  Group sex, threesomes, swinging, and non-monogamy in general is about giving your partner the freedom to explore sexual variety that you may not be able to provide for them.  It’s a way of having your close committed relationship but still allowing some freedom to explore other traits and individuals.  Being able to attain joy and pleasure from watching your partner obtain pleasure from someone other than you, the feeling of compersion, is a necessary prerequisite for successful group sex.  In most cases if your relationship is strong going into group sex allowing your partner to explore sex with another person is going to make them more trusting and appreciative of you.

**How Do I Know if I’m Ready?**  You are not ready for a threesome, open relationship, swinging, etc. if you:
  
* Experience visceral feelings of hurt, jealousy or insecurity thinking about your partner playing with someone else.

* You can’t discuss your wants, needs and sexual desires openly and honestly.

* You are having problems in your primary relationship with trust communication or compatibility.

* You want to use a threesome to “fix” your relationship.

* You aren’t really interested in your partner so you are using the excuse of a threesome to get a chance to fuck another person (just break it off with your primary if this is the case).

**What are you Looking for?**  Once you know your relationship is sound its important to decide exactly what you are looking for.  Do you want all partners to play together?  Do you just want two of the partners to put all their attention on one?  Do you want a man, a woman, a couple?  Do you want to include this as some sort of Dom/sub play? 

**Boundaries:**  Despite the fact that you should be able to have a decent level of trust going into this it is understandable that everyone will have some boundaries so it is important to establish where the hard lines are.  A common one for heterosexual couples is that only the primary couple gets to have penetrative sex.  It’s a good boundary for many because it gives you one act to keep special in your primary relationship and it also takes away the risk of getting pregnant with a secondary partner.  Not all couples need this boundary and some may want additional boundaries.  Be sure to communicate them up front with your secondary partner/s and honor the boundaries he/she has as well. 

**Finding a Partner:**  If you do feel your relationship is ready and both partners are equally enthusiastic then you can now start looking for a third partner.  There are lots of ways to do this but for the most part you can pick a friend or go online to find potential partners.  If you want to ask your friends I guess the best way to do this is to first be honest about your interests.  If you have a sex-positive community of friends just letting them know you and your partner are interested in group sex may help get solicitations from others.  If you want to ask a friend I would just be direct and honest and ask upfront and then drop it, if they never respond don’t bring it up again, if they respond you can go from there.  If you aren’t lucky to have friends you can trust for this going online is a great way to meet people.  I’m friends with a polyamorous couple who has found a few partners on OkCupid.  My partner and I tried OkCupid without much success despite being on there for three months and sending out a lot of messages.  Fetlife.com worked for us.  Fetlife is basically Facebook for kinky people and it tends to be much more welcoming and positive towards people who want to fulfill kinky fantasies.  

**Choosing a Partner:**  Now that you know your options on how to find a partner its important to know how to find the RIGHT partner.  It isn’t always easy to get someone who is willing to play with a couple so it’s often tempting for couples to pick the first person they find who is interested.  I would recommend that you get to know your partner a bit and see if they are the right fit.  You want someone you can trust, who is smart about STI protection and getting tested regularly, is respectful of your relationship with your primary, and can communicate well with you and respect boundaries.  One of the biggest things I want to point out is to NEVER treat your third as a toy to just be used.  He/she is an individual and they deserve your respect.  Treat them as a person and make every effort to make sure they enjoy the experience as much as you wish to.  In messaging most people can pick up on if you intend to treat him/her well and they will be hesitant to respond if your messages are objectifying and disrespectful.

**Final Words on How to Seal the Deal:** When you have found a partner either online or in real life I would take time to get to know them before you jump to having a threesome (if it’s a friend you may not need this step).  Message back and forth if it’s an online person or you can also talk in person.  Share fantasizes if you can; this is a great way to know if you can trust each other.  I would take your partner out on a date as a couple with the viewpoint that you guys can get to know each other in person.  Anyone involved should be able to call the whole thing off at any time.  

**The Event:** Be able to laugh and have a good time, there will be awkward moments, you may struggle to fit everyone on the same bed, you of course will be learning a new person sexually (which is always fun and leads to funny awkward moments), don’t take things too seriously.  Honestly from my experience yesterday one of the best moments involved my partner making Go Go Gadget jokes while I had my face buried in our third’s cunt.  Just remember sex is fun, its called “play” for a reason.

**Aftercare:**  After you guys play talk and cuddle some as a group and make sure everyone is okay emotionally and happy with what happened.  Check in with both your partner and your third.  Discuss if you want to do this again with your third.  When you are alone with your primary make sure they are okay and tell them how much you care about them and reaffirm your attraction and desire for them.  Reclaimation sex is a great idea (having sex alone with your primary to “reaffirm” your sexual desire for them) and in my experience it’s hot as fuck.

Good luck to all of r/sex in your group sex adventures, I’ll be happy to clarify in comments about anything written here or to give specific advice.  You can always PM me as well.

1283862962.0,485,self.sex,dal5i,Opened up completely to my wife - now we're at it all the time,719,234,352,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dal5i/opened_up_completely_to_my_wife_now_were_at_it/,"I just wanted to share this with you (via an anon account, of course). It wouldn't have been possible without r/sex, after all. Sorry it's so long.

A little background - I've been married for 10 years, we dated for 4 before that. My wife and I are both in our late 30s, our sex life has been pretty much non-existant since we had kids (about 6 years ago). We'd have mediocre sex occasionally, I masturbated alone pretty much every night. I assumed things weren't going to improve, and generally felt kind of bummed out when I'd read about all the fun things you young kids (well, 18+) were doing.

I was also kind of messed up about sex. I've had a fascination about women's clothes for as long as I can remember, and used to masturbate while wearing them at times. I'd always hate myself for doing it afterwards, no-one else in the world knew about this and I assumed that I'd take that secret to my grave. I think I had some idea of what a man should do / feel with regards to sex, and was digusted that I sometimes was turned on by other things. I'm not attracted to men at all, but I do feel I have a feminine side that I've been keeping supressed (I've not indulged in crossdressing for at least 10 years).

Anyway, I've been reading up on various aspects of sexuality (like autogynephilia, which I first discovered here and appear to have some aspects of). Last week I broke down to my wife in bed and finally told her how I felt inside. She was understandably freaked out, and agreed with me that I should see a psychiatrist (we've seen one as a couple before).

Since then things have been amazing between us. My wife has been so understanding and is even getting into it - she sees how hot it can make me at times. We can barely keep our hands off each other during the day, and as soon as the kids are asleep we do nothing but fuck and talk. The sex is amazing, the intimacy is more so - this is the only thing I'd ever kept from her, and it's a huge weight off my mind that she now knows. I won't go in to huge details, but we've been communicating like never before, and experimenting with so many new things. We've ordered her very first vibrator (I can't believe she's never had one before), and are perhaps looking at a feeldoe for the near future (it seems that we might both like a little anal play).

I went to the psychiatrist wanting to be 'cured', but that's completely changed. I think there's still benefit in seeing him, but it's more to make sure that I'm ok with myself than wanting this to go away. My wonderful wife is so accepting, and it seems that I might have finally sexually matured. I hope this inspires some hope for people in a similar lull in their sex life. And keep posting the fun things you're up to - as long as it doesn't require too much flexibility we might just give it a try (no pics, I promise).

 * If you don't like your sex life, talk about it with your SO. You might be very pleasantly surprised.
 * Experimenting isn't just for the young 'uns
 * If you and your SO enjoy it and it doesn't hurt anyone, go for it



TL;DR - Had deep sex secrets that I kept from my wife. Finally shared them, now we're at it like we were 15 years ago (but with a lot more experimentation).

Edit: Thanks for all the good wishes :)

Edit2: Thanks for such a wonderful response. To clarify, [autogynephilia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogynephilia) is basically a man getting turned on by imagining himself as a woman.

Edit3: As vitty pointed out, the feeldoe is *a big fucking multi-pronged dildo. Don't search for it on google and then have the page open when your Dad walks in.*

I was always teased that I would be some kind of sex fiend. Being pretty petite, I was always considered the cute one. I was innocent. But lately... I'm not sure.

I like getting my boyfriend off, and giving oral. I just do. I don't care about receiving so much, which might be a bit odd, but I feel like I'm more of a giver in some aspects. My boyfriend also seems to finish fairly quickly once actual penetration starts, which... for me is what finally gets me going.

And once I'm going, I don't want to stop. Don't get me wrong. Our sex is intimate and filled with love... But dammit, I kinda don't always want that. Even if I never orgasm, I want to feel exhausted like he does, at least physically. I want to be thrown against shit, have my hair pulled, feel as though he's done some damage to my insides. I want to ache, to feel worn out. I want my hands held down, whether by him, or with fabric. I want to be blindfolded. I want to be bitten more and scratched.

I feel like I should enjoy the romantic sex, the eye contact and intimacy. But afterwards, all I can think of is how I wish it hadn't been neatly taken care of with a condom and wiped up. I wish I was gasping on the bed, preferably with his fresh cum spilled on my body. I want to be used, and dominated. 

Of course.. then there is the other side of me, when not turned on that gets completely embarrassed by the idea of telling him these things. It's like I'm two different people sometimes. The person shy about it all, and then the person who can't get enough.

It's frustrating. I don't know how to bring it up. I don't want him to feel bad, either for cumming quickly and/or not satisfying me completely, but I also have a case of nerves. I am still new to this, but... is it really as easy as saying, ""I want you to cum all over me?""

After we're done or whatever, he's always really tired. He gets sleepy,and I try to lightly suggest another round, but he thinks I must be joking. He always chuckles and goes, ""What have I turned you into?"" [Insert grin and a kiss] ""I need to rest!"" [Pretends to pass out, before laughing and cuddling me happily.]

And then, all I can think is, ""Why won't you just fuck me senseless? Please?"" There's always this undeniable longing inside me, like I just had a sample and I know I won't get the main course.

Is there anyway I might be able to bring this up? Or help him last longer? 

Edit: Some of you guys have this notion that I'm 15 or something. I am most definitely 18+. Think... 18-28. 
Also, I am appreciating a lot of the advice I'm receiving. It's definitely helping me, and if I can get around to talking to my bf, I'll let you guys know what happens.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1367811042.0,,,True,t3_1belio,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1belio/i_want_to_ache_afterwards/,

I(M29) have been seeing this woman (F26) for a few months now. We've been on about 7 dates. A week ago, I decided to move things along with some hand play down below and I noticed she was very tight. 

This Wednesday she called over to mine and after some fooling around she asked if I had a condom. So I start to undress her and notice shes looking away the entire time. No eye  contact what so ever. I m kissing her all over but she is just lying there. I put it down to nerves. 

So we re now both naked, I get condom on and in missionary go to put it in and it just wont go it. She so tight it just wont. Now I m getting nervous as to whats happening, I keep trying but nothing, She starts to get nervous to and says ""This has never happened before"" and ""your just to wide for me"". I am by no means more than average in lenght or gurt. I ask her to get on top try that way, she really skittish about it but evetually agrees but same thing. It just wont go in. 

Finally I suggest we use some lube and eventually I get it in. The entire time we re having sex, if we are not kissing she looking at the wall. Just lying there. I try to change positions or just make eye contact but no. I have slept with women like this before and to be honest its really disappointing that they dont seem to lie sex just lie there so I put it down to that.

Eventually I finish and again just akward silence from her.

As I m getting off her I notice something on the sheets. A kind of bloody slime. I say nothing as I dont want to make a big deal out of nothing. The rest of our time is spent lying there until she goes home. 

Now as I said I'm not sure if she was, maybe I just een stupid but to me it really does seem like that was hymen on the sheets and her comment of ""This has never happened before"" was just her way of playing it off. 

What do you think?

Should I say anything or just leave it alone?

I doesnt make any difference to me and I m not sure if knowing would have just extra pressure on but I guess if I had known I would have liked to have tried to make it a little more special than a quick romp.

EDIT: I cant believe this is necessary but I guess I have to get this across. 
We are both consenting adults. 
She initiated sex. I put no pressure on her to do this, she made her own decision. 
At any point she want to stop all she had to do was say so.

I did not force myself on her. 

The point of this post was to get advice on how to approach this with her and hopefully improve our relationship.

1329410505.0,482,self.sex,psgwt,Slut-shamed and now kinda repulsed by my husband,903,421,407,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/psgwt/slutshamed_and_now_kinda_repulsed_by_my_husband/,"My husband and I have only been married for three years, together for five. He came into our relationship shortly after his first marriage crumbled apart, his wife having cheated and been forgiven via marriage counseling twice before finally leaving him and marrying the last of her string of boyfriends.

I came into the relationship at the end of my rockin’ single 20s, having always been free or boyfriended, and having always lived alone and happily independent. My husband’s first marriage began when he was still in college, and he only had two sexual partners before his wife – whereas my number of partners is well into the double digits.

So my husband has apparently never been with a woman who acted on her own sexual feelings before. His wife acted like she hated sex because of a traumatic adolescence, but then acted out her sexuality behind his back, and his earlier partners were inexperienced early-college-aged girls.

In the beginning of our relationship, back in the days when I thought the sex was “good,” we always ended up in an argument after it was over. I was accustomed to doing whatever felt right – different positions, rough sometimes, oral, touching myself in order to finish if he wasn’t able to make me orgasm, etc. Pretty tame stuff, actually. It never occurred to me that this might make him uncomfortable, as he was obviously enjoying it, but it slowly became obvious from the talks we would have afterward that something wasn’t sitting right with him.

He would need constant reassurance from me after sex that I hadn’t been molested as a child, or hadn’t been overtly promiscuous, that I was SURE there was nothing wrong with me and I was SURE I didn’t want to be with other guys. He was [slut-shaming](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/what-is-slut-shaming/) me, though he wasn’t doing it deliberately and I’m sure he’d be horrified if he knew that’s how I saw it. As the arguments became more frequent, I became more angry and uncomfortable, and now we rarely have sex at all.

I don’t know how to enjoy sex anymore because I don’t know what is appropriate in his mind for a girl to do or not do in bed. And I minored in women’s studies so I am hyper-aware of how icky and oppressive this double standard is, which makes me absolutely cringe when he comes near me. He swears he’s “over it now,” that it just had to do with his first marriage ending in infidelity, and he wishes like hell I would go back to being his super-sexy girl. But I’m afraid it’s too late. I don’t initiate and I’m scared I never will again. Here are the reasons I can’t imagine initiating sex with him:

* Raging discomfort. No idea what is or is not permitted for me in his narrow idea of female sexuality.
* Loss of respect for him. I know he still wants sex because he complains about the lack of it a lot, but mostly he just passively remarks that he needs “things” and I’m clearly expected to take the lead. When I don’t, because of the discomfort, he will approach me on occasion, whereupon I freeze and have to repeat over and over to myself to relax, and eventually we do it and it’s fine, but I’m just getting it over with and he has to know that. We used to have real sex, that we both enjoyed, and now we don’t and he’s just fine with it?! Eww.
* Loss of attraction to him. Related to the point above, but goes further. He gets turned on too easily. I learned early on that flirting and kissing is not fun to him unless we’re going to go all the way, which is hard because we have kids now. He can’t even handle a footrub, or me stretching my back in front of him, without getting sexually frustrated. It’s creepy as hell. And he’s a minute man. He can’t rub me or play with me too much because he’ll come, and when we do have sex he comes within 10-20 strokes no matter how slow and boring he’s going.

I don't know how to fix this. We've had conversations about it from time to time, but they don't seem to help, probably because I'm so afraid of hurting his feelings and making this even more awkward. Any advice would be helpful. We have a pretty great marriage otherwise, and I want to make this better.

TL;DR Husband inexperienced, hurt by past infidelity, and intimidated by my experience. Now we're going nowhere fast and need help.

I looked at when it was created and it said only a few months ago but we've been together for longer than that (only married for four months though).     
I didn't get too upset as it's just a story, and he is a writer, and fantasies are okay. Then later that night I asked if he knew any girls by the name of ""the name from the story"". He said yes, and that a girl he had been with before me was called that (a girl who he has had inappropriate contact with while we were together also which tore my fucking heart out). So I was kind of upset. I didn't make a fuss, I just told him I read the story and he went up and deleted it and assured me that it was from ages ago, the file was just new because it was transferred from his old laptop.    
This started a discussion on why he wrote such dirty explicit things about this girl, whereas we have a totally vanilla sex life. In fact, he seems pretty uninterested in my body in general. He said that he is really attracted to me, but because I'm his wife and he loves me so much he doesn't want to do really dirty filthy things with me. That.. kind of hurt my feelings. That he had these feelings for someone else but I'm just some non-sexual ""wife"" to him. I asked if he thought he would think of me differently if we did do nasty things and he said he doesn't know, but doesn't want to try and he needs to take things slow.    
I find this weird. I have the opposite feelings to him, I feel like BECAUSE he's my husband I can be totally open and honest with him about sexual things, why would he think he needs to hide things from me? Also, it makes me really worry if we do have children will I become even more desexualized in his mind? I think it's likely although if I ask he is sure to say that it's not the case.

I have repeatedly asked him what is wrong, and he replies with, ""work stress.""  I want to respect that and be as supportive as I can, but it's gotten to a point I really miss being touched.  I miss being wanted and pined after.  I miss the intimacy and the romance and being ravaged.  I miss driving home from a date and being so hot for each other, we barely make it to the bed room.

This is how I got her to try.,820,352,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/lfvps/my_girlfriend_had_never_had_anal_sex_before_last/,"*EDIT:* There's been a lot of questions as to why we don't have intercourse while she's on her period. It isn't my issue- it's hers. She's not comfortable with the mess, I guess, and sometimes feels crampy or uncomfortable. Maybe I should make a post asking how to work through this because I have no qualms about period sex.




I asked!  All it took was a discussion for her to go from uncomfortable with the idea to saying we could ""do it in the butt"" during her period.

One night in bed, we got to talking about our sex life, and I very frankly said I wanted to try anal sex if she was comfortable with it. She had never done it before. She was skeptical and seemed wary, so I did not push the issue further that night. I let the discussion end with her knowing I wanted to try, but I was not in any rush and was very clear that it was only something that would be done if/when she wanted to try.


She tried teasing me once about it, almost in a belittling fashion- ""Well you're the one who wants to do it in the butt"" (like it was a bad thing) and I responded simply by saying that I was only being honest with her and she should appreciate the fact that I was being open about my desires.

Patience. I did not bring it up again. She did. First, about a week later, she asked if I had anal sex with an ex and she was not providing me with something I was used to getting normally (No, anal was not normal, ever).  She asked about how it works, and I emphasized gradual introduction- taking it slow and making it clear that she was the one in control of everything at all times. Her curiosity was satisfied after that, and I let it rest.


This past Friday, she came home with a 1.5 L bottle of Margarita mix. We started drinking and relaxing by watching some TV and during dinner she mentioned that her period had come (IE no intercourse) and added ""But we could do it in the butt.""  I was dumbfounded.  She was serious.

We went to bed later, and I was expecting to take it slow, like maybe using my fingers.  That's where it started. I used gentle pressure and gradually, with lube, worked my finger inside of her. We made out with my finger inside of her for a few minutes before she told me to grab the lube and go for it.  I went slow, but she was so relaxed I slid right in. I kept asking her how she felt and if she was okay (she was) and before I knew it we were really going at it. I used my fingers to rub her clit and it didn't take long before we both got off.

She was all smiles afterwards- couldn't believe we had anal and was excited to try something new! She also kept saying that she couldn't believe she lost her anal virginity, and how good it felt.

**TL;DR**  Suggested Anal Sex to GF. Did not pressure her, let her decide pace of learning and talking about it. Was patient. She let me 'put it in the butt' and she loved it.

1286124767.0,468,self.sex,dm93o,For girls slaving away at a hot cock. [A guide to good head] ,755,287,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dm93o/for_girls_slaving_away_at_a_hot_cock_a_guide_to/,"**Hopefully these will be some helpful tips, tricks and ideas that might be new, different or just interesting to read about for those wanting to go a little further than basic blowing.**


To begin with, I want to tell you the best thing I’ve learnt about blowjobs and that is that it’s not all about what you do - it’s the attitude you do it with. The more enthusiastic you are, the more he’ll be enjoying it. From experience (and I’m sure many of you will agree), a smile on your face and a little bit of a laugh is perfect for making both you and him more comfortable and relaxed.


Now there’s more than one way of getting into a blowjob for your man, the first is just to get stuck in and we’ll come to that in more detail later; however my favourite way to start is by being as much of a tease as possible. 


**Teasing:**


Blowing can be an exploration and about getting comfortable with him. I have most fun by drawing it out as much as possible but that doesn’t mean you’ll be the same. Now when I say ‘drawing it out’, I don’t mean half an hour of your softest kisses – but at least a good five minutes pleasuring him through kissing, licking, stroking, but not quite sucking.  Be playful by nibbling, kissing and softly biting his skin - vary between this and lightly licking him up and down his shaft. Don’t feel like you have to go in quickly, mix it up a bit, almost like you’re giving him a preview of what’s to come. He won’t know what to expect and that will build the intensity and excitement. Engrossing yourself in him can be lots of fun – just really get involved, get close to him and stay there.


Get his penis nice and wet with your kisses and begin massaging him with your hands or even in between your breasts, either way getting him as wet as you can. If you try using your breasts he’ll love that its not your hands and the sensations will make him feel really close to you. After plenty of teasing, take him into your mouth and as deep as you can go with him. Slowly begin to lick and suck your way up and down his shaft. When you’re ready (always remember everything you do is your choice and not his), try to experiment similarly whilst moving your hands around his balls and shaft, keeping your movements smooth and wet at all times.


**Straight In:**


Not all blowjobs have to be long and drawn out, sometimes it can be great fun to tear off his trousers and just go straight for it. If teasing isn’t for you then this might be: some believe that the best blowjobs are unexpected blowjobs, and taking charge of a guy in this situation is no mission. The feeling of domination can give you a bit of an ego boost, especially when he’s moaning in pleasure because he didn’t expect you to do something.  Moaning because of the psychological element that’s added. Know that if he’s moaning then whatever you’re doing is good and you should repeat it as often as you like. If your guy isn’t very vocal, encourage him to give you more feedback. So forget about your hands at first and concentrate on getting everything immediately wet. If you’re not afraid of deepthroating, this is a great time to get straight to it. And if it’s something new for you then I have a few handy techniques to soften the blow...


**Deepthroating:**


Learning to deepthroat isn’t a necessity, but it’s a pretty spectacular ability in the oral repertoire. It’s good to use on occasion simply because it gives men all round sensation, it may even become central to your routine if that satisfies you both. 


Relax your mouth completely making sure you are in a position where your throat can be as open as possible. You want to start slowly, keeping your tongue down until you are comfortable with your new surroundings. Engulf him slowly, being careful to not catch him with your teeth and take it to the furthest most comfortable point. Stay here for a few seconds to get used to the feeling and then little by little take more of him in, remembering to stop and get used to how this feels – this will make deepthroating at a faster pace when you are more confident much easier as well. Don’t forget to breathe! … don’t rush, the experience is meant to be a slow, luxurious thing for both of you and there’s not a right or wrong way of doing it, especially in a loving relationship where you can laugh it off and get right back to it with no pressure.


Getting past the gag reflex is simply down to practice and it is as simple as that - there are some good guides online which aided me when I had that issue.


1)     Slowly taking in as much of him as you can – going a little further each time so he really feels the difference of how deep you can go.

2)	Suck and hold onto him with the pressure of your lips before quickly pulling off - and repeat. This will involve coming off him completely before going back to him and changing the speed of this will make him feel good.

3)	Movement of the tongue is more limited the deeper you go. Don’t be worried if you can’t move much with your tongue but enjoy the movement you can make on the areas of his shaft you can reach. This will vary depending on how versatile your tongue is so light flicks and massaging him slowly will feel amazing – keeping eye contact if you can.

4)	Temperature changes by either softly blowing cool air or breathing on him. This can be something to do before you start deepthroating, just around his shaft. However, another way of exciting him is to as you go deeper keep your mouth as open as possible breathing heavily as you move. It works as the same vibrations would – so talking or humming would also work. The different shapes and noises you make with your mouth give various awesome feelings to your guy.

5)	Change in movement: whilst deepthroating clamp your lips around him at his base and suck slowly as you retreat up towards his tip.

6)	Let him know you’re enjoying it by looking up and smiling as you release the tight suction you have applied with a light ‘popping’ sound.

7)	Don’t be afraid to mix up going deep with paying attention to his tip and other areas. As much as he may like you going deep, make a big deal about coming completely off him before you go down again. You can do this by opening your mouth wide on the way down and then sucking tightly with your lips pressed against him and suck your lips all the way back up to the top. It draws out the pleasure for him and gives you time to think about your next move.

8)	Gulping while you’re very deep: throat vibrations do a lot of good and it will affect all of him because he is so far inside of you.


**Other techniques**


**Hands:**


Bring in your hands to add something different into the mix and work with what your lips and tongue are doing - your hands should keep busy.

These are three enjoyable tried and tested positions for a blowjob with hands:

1) Not using hands at all from a kneeling position.

2) Wrapping your hands around the base of his shaft – best when he’s lying down or sitting back in a chair where you can position him towards you. Good for deepthroating.

3) With one hand around his balls, slightly pulling them closer to you and your other hand holding the shaft. This can help if he’s finding it difficult to come and can be done in many positions.


Hands are a great for supporting and continuing pleasure when your mouth is taking a two second break and with the correct pressure can add the perfect amount of intensity to a blowjob.


Lightly, massage his balls with your fingertips or cup them in your hands and he’ll feel held, safe and adored by you. You know the feeling when your man holds you and you feel completely and utterly safe – well this is the same, but for men. Place your hands at the bottom of his shaft and gently massage in a circular motion.


**Positions:**


The best positions for most individuals greatly depend on the couple, however a few work well for the majority of women. But positions can really give you more flexibility when going down on a man and depends on what you feel comfortable with. Test out the furniture; chairs, tables, use the bed to your advantage. You could:


1)	Get him to sit on a chair and kneel in between his legs on a pillow. Good for all over action, getting your hands to his balls and deepthroating

2)	Him lying down (bed or floor most likely), this is good for feeling relaxed. With him lying on the bed and you on your knees (or as you wish) in between his open legs at the bottom of the bed. Good for faster blowjobs as you have more leverage, also a good lazy position if you want to curl around him.

3)	Him standing up – you could be kneeling/sitting/lying on the bed as he stands next to you – this is probably best for deepthroating. If you are confident and can get the right height.

4)	Him putting one leg raised on the bed whilst standing as you’re on all fours/on your side at the correct height/bed. (Good for a change of position from lying down on the bed).

5)	Lying down in what would be the 69 position but to the side of him on the bed. Great for him to get to you too and he’ll be able to see everything you’re doing which is a massive turn on.

6)	If you’re looking for something specifically good for deepthroating (also try on a chair) then him standing next to the bed whilst you lie on your back with your head just off the bed/table/object of decent height, supported by a pillow can give you lots of room for him to thrust as your mouth and throat are at their most open. Make sure you are happy with the amount of pressure he is applying, as this is a trusting position where you both need to feel comfortable. This is fun and safe done sensibly and you can use your hands to stop him thrusting as necessary (also works with no. 3)

7)	Not to mention, playing in the 69 position is always fun and you can battle it out ‘til the end.

So my girlfriend (20f) has always been turned on by me (19m) being rough and dominant when we have sex. It's never been my thing, and I always felt a bit guilty doing it, but I wanted to make her happy and so I always played along.

Well, recently she wanted to escalate things and basically told me to get increasingly rough and actually try to make her say our safe word.I didn't want to disappoint her, so I thought before hand about some of the things I could do. The result was probably still very tame in comparison to what some people are into, but for us it was pretty huge. 

I pinned her down, spat on her, pulled her hair, slapped her, pinned her arms behind her in doggy style to the point of pain and did that thing where you hold on inside her mouth during doggy like the reins of a horse, really hard. 

My insults went from generic (worthless slut) to pretty much the worst I could come up with, that I didn't love her, that I was only using her for sex, that I was more attracted to her friends, and how stupid she was not to realize this.

Despite my best efforts, we both came a couple of times and then stopped, exhausted, without her having said the safe word. We cuddled, I told her I loved her and that I hadn't meant any of what I said and everything seemed fine. Until about 20 minutes later, I noticed she was shivering, even shaking violently, and when I turned her around tears were streaming down her face. I immediately tried to console her and asked her what was wrong, she tried to say she was fine but couldn't stop sobbing and shaking.

I have never felt so guilty in my life. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom after a while to puke my guts out and now I'm crying in my room and don't know what to do. I know the advice is going to be talk it through with her, but I'm scared and I feel guilty and afraid that I hurt the girl that I love. Please someone just, i dunno, tell me what to do or that its alright. God, I hate myself right now.

**EDIT:** Writing this quickly because I'm gonna spend some more time with her (probably a lot) to finish talking this through. I just wanted to thank all of you so much! The whole thing went far better than I could  have hoped for.

I held her more tightly than ever before probably and repeated to her that I loved her, that I hadn't meant any of what I said and that I was sorry until she managed to fully calm down.

She told me then to stop apologizing, that she had enjoyed it, and had just been completely taken by surprise by really strong emotions when we finished. My greatest regret, and also my greatest fear, were the insults I had thrown at her towards the end, and several people in the thread seem to agree that those were way over the line. She dismissed my fears, saying that she knew I didn't mean any of it (thank fuck, yes, i don't even deserve to be this lucky) and that it even turned her on.

Taking some advice from the thread, I made us both pancakes and we watched the latest episodes of Community together. After that, we started to really discuss what had happened, and the STRANGEST damn thing happened. Discussing every part of what had happened with her, how she reacted and felt towards everything I did, we both got incredibly turned on, and I really started to get what people find so hot about rough and dominant / submissive sex.

Having said all of this, I definitely realize I made some pretty bad mistakes approaching this whole thing, and if we do something like this again, we're gonna clearly discuss what we're both comfortable with and what to do and move in the tiniest baby steps.

1327255315.0,468,self.sex,ormwv,"Deep throat technique - I hear a lot of guys say their girl can't do it, so I'm gonna tell you the secret. Take it from a girl who can...",703,235,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ormwv/deep_throat_technique_i_hear_a_lot_of_guys_say/,"First of all, cocks come in all shapes, sizes, and angles when erect. This will impact the angle at which you can best deep throat it. You will figure this out on your own and will be specific to the individual. 

Some guys cocks are really wide in girth, so if you have a small mouth, not much you can do if he's too fat for you. 

That said... Let's talk anatomy: your throat naturally slopes back and downward. If his cock is long enough to deep throat (some may not get long enough, and, therefore, this post is irrelevant to you), then you are going to have to relax your throat and swallow at some point. This will take practice and is best practiced in a position where you have control over how far down your throat the cock goes. Start slow, because your gag reflex will probably be an issue at first. (I will do another post in general blow job tips, but this one focuses on deep throat techniques.) 

Example of how an erect cock's angle affects performance of this technique: My favorite position with guys who have a cock that curves slightly upward or straight out when erect is me on top, him on bottom in the 69 position. OR, I also like to lay on the bed with my head slightly tilted on the edge of the bed. Have to trust your man not to gag you when he is ""fucking"" your mouth, though. This latter position is best after you have been successful at deep throating it a few times already.   

The basic secret is swallowing. Make sure your mouth is not dry when uou start out. After the first swallow and ""retreat"", your mouth will become much more salivated, or lubricated if you will. This makes the next deep throat attempts in the process much easier. 

Lastly, this takes practice. Don't force it, because your reflexes will make it harder in the future. Also, you have to relax. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly unless your man has a vomit fettish (hey, there's a fettish for everything), do not eat beforehand. Give your food time to digest first. If you plan to eat dinner on your date, surprise him with a before dinner quickie blow job or take a walk after dinner, because walking helps digestion. If you feel your stomach gurgle, stop deep throating until your stomach feel it can handle another attempt.

Manscaping has a real risk:,827,367,285,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/la45i/warning_manscaping_has_a_real_risk/,"Turns out my weekly trim with the #2 clippers of the twig and berries has a pretty real risk.  A couple months back I got a swelling under my sac, eventually filled to about the size of a marble.  Seemed I got it pinched riding the mountain bike, but by the time my doc appointment came, it was receding so I let it go. But it never went away, just shrank to about like a dime under the surface.  Except a week ago, it started swelling again.  Now it is bigger than a third ball in the bottom of my sac, taint-adjacent, and hurts when my legs constantly rub it. Makes it hard to sleep, and I am constantly doing a Michael Jackson in public to put them in a comfortable place and keep from pinching it.  



So I finally got in to the doctor today, and found out it is not from being pinched by the bike seat, abused during motocross, or tight fitting pantaloons.  It is actually an abscess, an internal infection from a slight nick. Even a little nick, like getting some extra wrinkly ball skin jammed betwixt the beard trimmer guard, is VERY prone to infection, since it is a (Slightly)Moist environment.  I got some antibotics to start today, so no need to open it and drain, which might lead to further infections.   



I am not going to stop trimming Big Jim &amp; the Twins, but now I am going to be VERY careful, clean the trimmer blades much better, and slap some peroxide on them bad boys if they get a razor burn.  I have never tried a real razor for fear of ending up worse than Something About Mary, but I had assumed a beard trimmer with a guard would be enough.   And for that, I have to deal with a throbbing crotch and expect another week or so until the South of France is ""presentation grade"" again and not going to frighten the horse when unleashed on your mom.



Upvote this to spread the word, the ball you save may be your own.





TL;DR  :    Be careful trimming the boys, a nick can give you a painful 3rd nut.

She is a wriggler. It takes some doing to get her in place.  

I lay on my side and push her outside hip down so that she lays flat on her back.  My leg loops over her leg nearest me, and wraps around it to lock her in place.  I slide one arm under her neck and behind her head, pinning her nearest arm beneath me in the process.  With her arm and leg locked up we are close, intimate.  It is a familiar position, but not 100% secure.  My free hand runs along her body.  I can tease her breasts, carress her neck, hold her backside.  It's all open to me.  My mouth can reach her forehead, her collarbone, her nipple.  The options and combinations are limitless.

In a minute, she begins to tremble.  That's how it starts.  I push her outside hip back down to keep her in place.  Another minute, and her sex is soaked.  Her swollen clit is there to be teased, if I can hold onto it.  Her outside leg flails, her arm grabs at anything in range.  She flings her deceptively strong body in any direction.  Holding on with my leg, holding on with my arm I can keep her in place.  A further minute, and now her whole body begins to sweat as well.  She will cum so easily like this, if you can hold her in place.

She starts to beg for it.  She hates being teased like this.  To her, she's ready for me the second we lie down.  The second her clothes come off.  I can't do it soon enough.  ""Please"" she says ""I need you inside of me.""  To sate her, I guide her free hand to my cock.  She squeezes it absentmindedly--not trying to pleasure me, just trying to hold on for support.

She's really going now.  I have to rise up and use my weight to hold her in place.  My god, she can't be more than 105 pounds, how can her hips have so much power?  It doesn't matter though.  I'm stronger, and she knows it.

""Please....I....it needs to be now.""

Another minute and she's desperate, and even I'm having trouble holding on.  If she gets free, she'll roll to her hands and knees, and then it's game over.  Her legs spread, her slit pointed at the air.  Covered in sweat and her juices.  The scent of it alone is enough to push me to the brink on most nights.  The sight of it....a man has no control at that point, and can only grab a woman like that by the roots of her hair and her breast and guide himself in.

But for now I've got her, and the game continues.  For a change, I try and put her on the spot.

""Do you want me?""

""Yes.""

""You want me now?""

""Yes.""

""Fine.  I want you to say the dirtiest, sluttiest thing that comes to your mind.  If it's good enough, I'll end this, and we can fuck.""

A beat passes.  Sweating, naked, rock hard and dripping wet, the earth pauses as she collects her thoughts.

""All I can think of is...""

""Say it""

""I can't""

""Say it!""

""All I can think of is...'Smutty Pumpkin'""

1346689943.0,461,self.sex,zaaws,How Do I Get Over 20+ Years Of Sexual Neglect After Marriage? (Long Story),678,217,511,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zaaws/how_do_i_get_over_20_years_of_sexual_neglect/,"I am a male, mid forties, recently divorced. My marriage was mostly sexless and I am now realizing the damage done from 20+ years of a sexually dysfuctional relationship.

Back Story: We stopped having sex right after my wife got pregnant with our fist child, we were both twenty years old.   

That was it, something happened with my wife internally and she no longer had any interest in sex. 

This started a problem that existed right though to the end of our marriage. We would often go 2 - 4 months with out any sex at all and then I was allowed (this is how it felt to me) to make love to her. After 2 years of rarely having sex with my wife at the incredibly horny age of twenty-two I would often sleep on the couch so I could masterbate and go to sleep.

Willing to do anything I started counseling for sex addiction, as this is how I was portrayed by my wife. After a few months of ridiculous analyzing and spending two months on Paxil (not sure why?) I realized I was a normal, red-blooded, horny, (24 year old now) male, and that was it.
My sexual appetite was not over the top or excessive, it was simply not being fed so I was upset and frustrated. Although the therapist (female) and my wife agreed, I was the problem.

We only ever ""made love"" with her participating as little as possible for the first seven years of our marriage. 
No oral sex for me at all, (once in a while she would let me perform for her and I was always willing becuase I love to do it) and when she did give oral sex it most of her time was spent smiling up at me, making half hearted teasing gestures to minimize the time she actually had to spend Doing it. She would spend 30 seconds to maybe a minute and a half. If I asked her to do it more I was met with rolling eyes, sighs and objections. ""I just sucked it!"" she would complain. After hearing her complain I would go flaccid and this would piss her off. 
Several times I just stopped the session and got dressed. She would get angry and not understand why hearing her complain and roll her eyes left me ""out of the mood"". Eventually she told me how much she disiked it and hated it and didn't want to do it. 

Have you ever gotten a blow job from a woman who told you how much she hated doing it for you? It does make it hard to enjoy. Many times she would throw it in my face that she had given me head. Often she would yell things at me like, ""I was gonna give you head, but not now!"", but of course she wasn't ever going to.

At one point, drunk and frustated I convinced her to let us try some bondage. I have always been kinky and I always wanted to try dominating her. I tied her up on the bed and then I took her quite angrily, I definitely took advantage of the situation and we had a long rough session, I took photographs (No, I don't have them, she does) and I was very humilating towards her. 

She loved it, from that day we actually started having great sex although she still avoided oral but we were now having sex in different positions and getting more wild. Awesome, but short lived. She soon fell into this pattern again where we didn't really have sex together. 
She was letting me have sex with her and she didn't really participate, it was the same at the end of the marriage as well.

I found a sexual spark in her and it helped quite a bit so I was trying to find more. 

We tried swapping (we had 3 encounters with others seperately),like I said I am kinky so it sounded cool. Maybe sex with some strange men she would find some excitement, maybe even some new experience she could bring back home.
It was fun and exciting and we both handled the events with no jealousy. We even had sex afterwards while we described the encounters to each other in detail.

My only problem was she gave each one of them oral sex, something she would not do for me. 
At a later time I asked her about that and she said wanted to impress them and she thought it was expected. So why not try to impress your husband and why don't you think it's an expectation for me?
""Because we are married, I don't have to impress you"" was her answer. This was very painful and made me feel sexually worthless to her.
 
At this point in my marriage I still wanted to make it work and started working on compromises. All I wanted was for her to actively have sex with me. Sure I had a lof of kinks and fantasies I wanted to experience with her, but mostly I just wanted my wife to want to have sex with me.
When discussed she would always say  different things she neeeded that prevented her from having sex with me. Like a dumbass I followed this rabbit hole hoping for improvement of the situation.

Note: What I know now, she has a sexual dysfuntion and me falling all overmyself trying to accept responibility and thinking I could help the problem by meeting some need of hers was false. She needs to take responsibility for her own issues and solve them as do we all.

So, she needed more romance, or I needed to do more housework or spend more time with the kids so she could be more relaxed, or we needed to go out more and have more fun. It was always something I needed to do or change to make her happy, and I ignorantly went along with it hoping for the best.

Every compromise was the same, 2, 3, 5, weeks would go by and she would do nothing. I would follow through by being Mr. Enrique Suave or I would do more housework and be Mr. Mom. Keep in mind she was a stay at home mom and I was working full time in construction (60 hours, often over 70) and we still split the chores. Cooking, laundry, shopping, etc. 

My sexual advances were usually rebutted with a spattering of random success and never any oral. She would often come on to me kiss and touch and then turn me down. ""Just because we kiss doesn't mean I want to have sex"". When I would protest a phrase I heard a thousand time was, ""If I don't want to I shouldn't  have to!""

Funny, I would think she would want to since I was her husband. On the other hand, I didn't want to work 70 hours a week for a woman who ignores me so I shouldn't have to? She found this train of logic flawed and biased. I had the duties and responsibilities of the husband but non existed for the wife. I was always well employed, I was home every night to be with my wife and kids. I didn't run around, hang our in bars or chase women. I was dedicated and committed to my marriage and kids. 

After a few weeks I would bring up the fact that we had a compromise and though I was meeting her requests she had not acted upon mine.
She has a pattern she follows. Lie, Deny, Trivialize/Dismiss, change topic. It is most dizzying to try and have a discussion with her.
The fight that would ensue would leave us at a stalemate for 2 -4 weeks of rare conversaton and interaction, eventually we would have ""make up"" sex.
This would last 2 - 3 days of generally great sex (no oral) and then she would start to turn me down again. We would go weeks, months with out sex, we would fight, come to a compromise and start the whole cycle over again.

When we had sex, she seemed to enjoy it but it many ways it still seemed obligatory. She would end our sex as soon as I came and she would not continue or even try. I wanted to stay and touch, kiss, more oral, hell give me a minute, I will be back in action.
We could be having great sex and as soon as I finished, she would get up, clean up, get dressed and go back about her day. Now after I cum, I get this horrible feeling of inadequacy. The thought now of a woman wanting to continue having sex after I orgasm scares me to death.

This lasted until we were married for 18 years. The cycles would last anywhere between 3 - 6 months, getting longer in between as the marriage progressed. Many years we had sex 2 - 3 times in the whole year. 

Once I went 3 months that I didn't hold her hand, kiss her good-bye, flirt with her, nothing. Finally she asked ""Hey, you have not tried to have sex with me, is something wrong?"" How long would it take you to say something if your S.O. stopped touching you physically?

She refused to be on top or take a leading role in any sex we had. I rolled her over on top of me once and she sat there waiting for me to do something. She got angry and stormed out of the room when told her to move, on my cock, Ride it, put forth some effort, you do some of the work and participate.  

After 18 years I told her I wanted a divorce but I didn't want to be away from my kids. Growing up in a single parent home (with my mother on welfare) I didn't want to give my kids the disadvantages that come from being in a single parent home.
I didn't want strange men roaming in and out of their lives and I wanted  consisent strong father figure for them, that was me.

I told my wife I would stay and we could be amicable and get along for the kids. We had already been together for 18 years, another four was no problem. If it works great, if not we knew what to do, we would honor our responsibility to our kids and go on our way. 

I told her explicitly I had tried hard enough  and if she wanted to save this marriage she knew how to do it, put out! When I saw her trying I would jump in and we could stay together, be married, and move along like nothing ever happened. She did not try. In her own words I should be thankful for what I have and forget about what I want.

I had been planning all along to grow old and die with this woman. But you cannot force a man to go his entire life with out sex, that is just bullshit and it has fucked with my head. I feel neglected and abused and I am convinced my wife is a sociopath based on her consistent patterns of behavior.

So, now here I am in my forties and I feel brow beaten sexually. My perspective of how men and woman relate to each other sexually is really fucked up.  I am so messed up I am picturing every woman acting just like my wife and this leaves me very anxious.

My wife loved sex when we met, and as we moved in together, her libido dropped.  Marriage, it got worse.  

In the last few months I noticed that if I made *any* indication that i would like to have sex, she would cool off.  This last weekend our kids were away, which i thought was a great opportunity to light some candles, get out the massage oil... and she ended up wanting to watch movies. I remembered though, a time not too long ago, where our kids were away for the night, and I had thought that she was tired and not feeling well, so I never said anything about sex at all.  10pm rolls around, and I notice she is acting oddly, her body language is just... odd.  I don't know how I knew, but i realized she wanted to have sex.  It is extremely hard to get her to just come out and say she wants sex, and she will not say anythinga bout what she wants out of sex.  

I also realized she would back off any time i talked about wanting more in the bedroom, so last night I mentioned something very, very simple, and i asked her if I could write down 3 things that were very simple and she could pick one, or none of them, and then at any point she felt like doing that, even if it took months, we could do it, when SHE was ready, and wanted it.  While talking to her I tried to think of something very very easy, so I said 'what if i used my hand to get you to orgasm, and just when you had an orgasm, you said 'i love you'.  That would be very sexy.'  Her response was to ask if it would take the rush and fun out of it, by having me ask her for it.  My thinking is... yeah, ideally, in a perfect world, id love for her to just do everything i would like, and not have to ask her.  But life is not perfect, so why not ask the other one for things we like?  Then she said that she didn't know why, but if she did something because I asked her to, she didn't like it.  

This same woman, 10 years ago, rode me cowgirl while masturbating herself, al though admittedly she was drunk.  I have pointed out to her that being drunk doesnt make her do things she doesnt want to do, it lets her do things she would like to do, but otherwise wont, for whatever reason.  So i feel she has a wild side in her, like we all do, but she will not say what she wants, but she also will not do things if I ask for them.  A perfect recipe for disaster.  I recently found out that i made a mistake early on in our relationship.  I asked her one night if she 'liked it slow', and she said yes.  We ended up just having sex in a more slow and passionate way for the rest of our relationship, but recently i told her that someetimes I would like to just get a little wild, more energetic.  When I asked if she sometimes liked that, she said yes.  But... she never said anything, over 11 years.  She will not say anything she likes.  When i asked her how I should find out if she is in the mood for more 'energetic' sex, she said i should ask her.  But it appears if I just DID it, which would probably more MORE of a turn on for most women, and she feels that I am just being selfish, she will be turned off.  So she wont say what she wants on her own, and i doubt she would be much more open by me asking (she wont discuss fantasies and gets embarrassed by any sex talk), but if I take the lead and be a typical man, she balks and doesnt want sex.  I personally think this is tied to her problems with her dad, they used to physically fight when she was younger, and even now, at almost 40, she isnt comfortable being around him very much.  

She also doesnt want to see a counselor, because she isnt open to talking about herself.  We have made a lot of headway in the last 6 months, but I feel this issue, where she feels pressured, is what has caused our sexual problems.  She has told me that every relationship she ever had, she was into sex at first, but then as the relationship went on, her interest dropped.  She thought it just had to do with things being more fun when realtionships are new, I think there is something else going on here.  At 38 years old, she cant communicate about ANYTHING she wants in the bedroom, and if i make one statement asking if she will have her period on a saturday, because i would like to give her a massage... she ends up completely not wanting sex that night.  

Any women out there that can give insight into this?

However, I can make myself cum from clitoral stimulation very fast, while applying a lot of pressure to the clit. As I was lurking /r/sex, I read about guys that had struggled with death grip and how they overcame it. I started wondering if this pertained to me, but decided probably not since I'm a girl and don't masturbate that often (maybe once a week), and ruled it out. Then, I ended up going on vacation and figured since I'd be away from my SO anyway, I might as well not masturbate for the month and a half I would be there, and see how it goes when I come back. Well I came back yesterday, he came over to my apartment, yada yada yada, and we ended up having sex. At the first penetration, I felt heightened sensitivity, but nothing I thought would lead me to orgasm. Then, he put his finger on my clit as he was batter dipping the corn dog, and I swear I have never felt so great. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like I was flying through space or something. I'm not very good with words but trust me... It was good...

Anyways, for any women out there that may enjoy self clitoral stimulation, if you stimulate really fast, probably faster than a partner could, especially only in that certain way you like it, and you're struggling to reach that good spot with your partner, I suggest you try going a while without masturbating. I've read a lot about male death grip on this sub, but wanted to share my experience and advise women to experiment with the same things that help men who have death grip.

She has Cerebral Palsy, is partially deaf, and has developmental/learning/mental disabilities. She was in special education in high school but she is very high functioning socially. 

Recently she got engaged to her boyfriend of about one year. She lives in a group home with a bunch of other girls and staff. Her fiance also lives in a separate group home. There are logistics for how this will be dealt with later on.

The last time we hung out my best friend and I took her around town to some shops. We went to a thrift store and she told us she wanted to look at some books. We soon realized that she was looking for books about sex. I asked her some more questions and she said ""I'm not ready for like, *actual* sex. I just want to know how to like...turn a guy on."" We went to Barnes and Noble and there is literally nothing relevant to someone in her situation. They are either about puberty in the young adult section or about hardcore sex in the adult section. I asked every employee in the store.

As a background; She said that their relationship counselor has had them watch DVDs and videos about sexuality, and her and her fiance have taken an intimacy assessment, although I never heard about the results. They go to counseling with other similar couples and talk about relationships as well. From what I can tell they are all handling the issue of their sexuality very well, and there are actually meetings in place to see how they will handle them both having ""alone time.""

With that said, there are a lot of things she says she wants to study and find out ""on her own."" She doesn't want to go and ask her mother or advisors (who are all amazing) about blowjobs and kissing and she doesn't want to watch DVDs—I don't think anyone would at 27 years old. She said she would rather read about it. 

I completely understand where she is coming from, and she does ask me some questions from time to time. She asks me if my boyfriend and I have ever had sex or if we have done certain things. Very simple questions. I answer them honestly but without great detail.

Yesterday she said she wanted to call me today to chat about something. I'm almost positive its about something sexual. I just want to be prepared with things to say or not to say when we chat. Does anyone else have experience with this? Also if anyone has any book recommendations that would be amazing.

I have been with my SO for about 5, almost 6 years. I am very open to things so when I found out he was into furies, it was no big deal. But a few months ago he brought up that he had a scat (poop) fetish that he was really ashamed off, and how he felt bad for keeping it to himself. I fully believe in not judging for sexuality if it harms no one, so I kinda comforted him about it but it but, deep down it grossed me out. a few weeks passed and one night I got really drunk and...yeah. 

The day after I didn't feel anything about it, It was like I made him cum, and he REALLY liked it so I was glad, but the fact I did what I did was almost null. 

Well after that sex gets strange, he doesn't really put any effort in other than the basic hump and sleep. He wont even take the time to respond to me really unless it has anything to do with my butt. He puts a lock on his phone and it becomes REALLY obvious hes hiding something, soon I got a view of his pictures and saw some furry images and asked to see them. He kinda knew he was caught so he let me see them. 

My reaction was very unexpected, I don't mind furry, but it was drawings of horses...and scat...I kinda freaked out. I didn't say anything to him, just dropped the phone and kinda walked away. I am so angry all of a sudden. I don't get it why isn't normal sex ok for him!!! what the fuck does he want from me.!!! I am just breaking down and I don't understand why I am suddenly so angry and hurt. 

can someone please just give me some incite on what I should do? 

**TDLR;** I did something kinda gross , and I am just now feeling the severity of it all.

The overwhelming amount of support, advice and empathy I received blew me away. (Not to mention Maxxters commented herself - fangirl squee!)

Some of the advice was to talk to him and explain how I was feeling - I wasn't really comfortable with that, so I ended up just letting him read through the thread on my phone (there were only twenty or so comments at that stage). He was very grateful to everyone for their comments; he felt that you all summed up exactly how he was feeling as a result of my insecurities. Through that I was able to understand how he felt, as well as deal with a number of the things that were worrying me.

Fast forward ten hours, and we're at a park near a beach, with my 'drive-in movies' bed made up in the back of my car. I end up completely naked, and lie there in front of him without shame. This is a huge deal for me, and if it weren't for everyone's help yesterday, I wouldn't have been able to do it. 

Anyway, we ended up having sex for the first (and second and third) time, and it was amazing, and we're now closer than before, to the point that he asked me out. We're dating now, reddit, and it's entirely thanks to you. 

So thankyou again, so much. You faceless people over the internet, you have helped changed my life for the better. I want to reach out and hug each of you for your kindness. Neither of us can thank you enough.

**TL;DR** The people of r/sex helped me deal with insecurities, and I'm now dating an incredibly amazing guy as a result.

It’s pretty astounding how many posts we get in /r/sex from men who are super stressed out about the size of their penis. The average penis length is between 5 and 5.5 inches. That means the *majority of men* have penises that are that size. If you’re a bit smaller or bigger than that, you’re still in the range where it’s very, very common. MUCH bigger or smaller than that, and you’re getting into territory that’s more rare. Most of the men coming to /r/sex have penises right in that average range. In no way is average a bad thing. Average tends to be average because that’s the way penises have evolved, usually in conjunction with the size of a vagina. Vaginas are, on average, 3-5 inches when the woman is unaroused, and 5-8 inches long/deep when the woman is sexually aroused. But perhaps the most important part- it’s only the first couple of inches that are very sensitive on most women. This is where many many nerves are as well as where the g-spot is. Above that, the tissue only has stretch and pressure sensors. And those of you engaging in same sex play, the prostate tends to be within 2 inches of the anal opening.  No need to go deeper (and if your partner really likes it deep, then use toys for that). 

We’re big advocates her e for learning how to use what you have. It's all about positioning, angling, speed/depth/power of thrusting and paying attention to what works for your partner. If your partner is female-bodied, do they need clitoral, g-spot, anterior fornix, rectouterine pouch or some other erogenous zone to be stimulated? It's about not just trying one thing and expecting it to work on them- you need to try a range of things and really explore their entire body and learn how you can move so that your penis gives your partner as much pleasure as possible. You figure out what positions work best for your penis. And you always have your hands, mouth and toys. Sure, some people feel they need a partner with a big penis. Others prefer average sized. Others prefer smaller size. Most, however, don’t give a shit about size as long as their partner works with them to figure out how to make the sexual experience as good as possible.

*Overall body*

When we talk about body image issues, we usually think of women. But everyone, no matter what gender they are, can have body image issues. In the society we live in, it’s no wonder that negative body images are on the rise. For most people, they believe they’re too fat and that it’s all their partner is thinking about when they see them naked. That their partner must be judging them and thinking about how gross they look. Sorry, but for the vast majority of people, this is not the way it works. Your partner knows *exactly* what you look like. And guess what? They still want to be sexual with you. They still want to see you fully naked, with the lights on, and are totally turned on and aroused by what they see. It turns out that not every person out there wants the media’s image of “beauty”. And it also turns out that most people aren’t only attracted to one kind of beauty. So if you see your significant other looking at porn that has people with totally different body types than you, in no way does that mean they’re not attracted to yours. They’re simply attracted to a range, and you’re included in that range (or they wouldn’t still be with you).

We get lots of questions about stretch marks, cellulite, acne, ingrown hairs and other sorts of skin issues. There are very very few people out there who don’t have these. Almost every woman over 20 has cellulite and/or stretch marks somewhere. We just don’t see it in magazines because they’re airbrushed out. And models/actresses are constantly using tricks for smoothing their skin out and covering up their stretch marks, etc when they’re on camera. And there’s also the beauty of editing. So this means it’s rare for people to see just how common this stuff is. Either way, we’re all our own worst critics and in no way is our partner paying attention to that stuff. They’re just happy to be having “sex” with you! And if your partner is being critical in a really harsh way and making you feel bad about yourself, then it may be time to leave them and find someone who appreciates you as you are and who makes you feel good about yourself. Make sure you’re eating healthy (which does NOT mean totally restricting yourself) and being physically active in a healthy, enjoyable way. We promote health here, not unrealistic standards of beauty.

Now what?",766,315,262,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/kg6br/so_i_broke_a_mans_dick_now_what/,"I have been dating this guy for a couple of weeks and decided to take him home after a lovely date.  After a few hours of messing around, we ended up having sex.  We decided to loaf on the couch for a bit and start another movie.  But as usual with new couples, we got a little distracted and Round Two begins.  I'm on top and he shifts his weight underneath me.  I didn't anticipate his movement, he slips out and gets jabbed into my pelvis.  All of the sudden, I'm flying through the air and he is running into the bathroom screaming.  Given this was our first evening having sex, it got pretty awkward quickly.  Once he is finally comfortable showing me what happened, it looks like he has a golf ball sized injury to his penis.  After a moment, deciding what to do, trying to calm him down, realizing his pain isn't going away, and googling, [""Broken Penis""](http://www.google.com/search?q=Broken+Penis&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a), we decide to take a trip to the ER.  The doctors describe to him that he has a penile fracture.  He ended up needing surgery (they pull the skin off the shaft to suture the tear) and about ten stitches.  He has been out of work for the last week, on pain meds, and in addition to his physical trauma, is probably mentally traumatized as well.  His friend told me I'm the first person he has had sex with in about six years.  Really?  What?  Why me?!?

For the last week, he seems to have mixed feelings regarding my presence around him.  Since we have only been seeing each other for such a short time I wasn't sure to go out of my way to see him at home or to stay away because he is upset/embarrassed/doped up on pain meds.  He invited me over to his place a couple of times, we hung out while he literally had ice packs on his dick.  I texted and called him yesterday, I haven't heard from him.

I am honestly really concerned for him, I do like him a lot, and I feel terrible that I did this to him.  This is one hell of a way to start a relationship, which I'm not sure either one of us really want anything serious right now.  Where do I go from here?  I've basically backed way off and I'm assuming that if he really wants to talk to me he will find a way.  

None of my friends (Of course!  Who the hell breaks a dick?!?) have been through this, and I have no idea what is going through his head.  It should be mentioned that we work together, so of course everyone knows.  It has been an interesting week.  My new throwaway account is a current nickname they have been tossing around.  My female coworkers think I should, ""Own that shit and be proud,"" while my male coworkers are either A) terrified of me, B) intrigued by me, or C) just upset that I put someone out of work for a week.  There does seem to be an agreement that we both must be kinky as hell (although what we were doing was pretty normal, if you ask me).  

All in all, I'm still in the wake of an aftermath of a sexually traumatic experience and I'm not sure where to go from here.  Not only do I feel sort of sexually inadequate (although I know this is silly, but it still is a feeling), I'm more concerned what to do with this new guy that I snapped in half.  His mom (yeah, I was with her while waiting in the ER) and coworkers have told me that he really likes me, even after all of this.  Oh boy. 

I know I am not the only one who has dealt with this....

This is the hottest thing I've ever had. I add a single drop per ramen to get it spicy, for my friends. I'm into spicy so I decided to add 3 drops.

Then, my girlfriend initiates some pretty awesome sex. We're both drunk, so neither of us is getting off, and I decide to lend a hand, since she's doing most of the work on top.

Cue yell, as she jumps off. I've been rubbing her clit with ghost pepper.

After her calming down, she says ""I think you forgot to wash your hands.""

I don't get it. She calmly says through gritted teeth

""Boyfriend. Please go get me some milk from downstairs""

Then it clicks. And I can't stop laughing. I run downstairs, laughing, pour milk, come back upstairs to the death ಠ_ಠ of my girlfriend writhing in agony as I am needlessly cracking up and say ""I think you might need this.""

She grabs the cup, throws her hand in, and starts touching herself (which I thought was hot, but for some reason she thought that was annoying) with the milk sodden hand.

She's all better now, but remember men: wash your hands after dealing with pepper. You might think it's funny, but I doubt I'm getting laid for a month.

I was pretty surprised to see that none of the other researchers there had heard of it. Anyways, I got to talking to the people running the booth, since I really think it's a great product for people who have a really hard time with the taste of semen. I asked them if they were going to make a product that works for going down on women and it turns out that the strips work for that too! 

But here's the thing- I talked to some of my female colleagues about it and right away they gasped, saying ""there's no way I would let my partner use that with me! How insulting!!"". Needless to say I was taken aback and pretty surprised to hear this from sex-positive women who are extremely comfortable with sex/sexuality. Why is it insulting to know that there are some times in our cycle that no matter how great our diet is, we're not going to taste the greatest? What's so bad about helping your partner out and using a strip that dissolves on their tongue to block their bitter and salty taste-receptors so it tastes good for them (or tastes like nothing at all)? 

Long story short- what do you think? Regardless of your gender, would you be okay with your partner using Masque when they go down on you? And please be honest here! I'm really curious to hear why you would or wouldn't be okay with this. And /r/sex, please don't downvote the people who say they wouldn't be comfortable with it.

",651,205,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/12kqds/after_11_years_of_sex_and_15_partners_my_bf_made/,"So, I have been with my boyfriend for 5 months now. Long distance. He had no experience in oral sex before me. I'm 24f, he is 27m. 
I am sharing this story here in order to hear if anyone else has a similar story, and to encourage those who might be in the same situation.

I have been able to make myself come with clitoral stimulation since I was quite young (12 perhaps), but only in one position (on my back, legs bent, feet stretched out). No partners have been able to make me come. I have had two long relationships (3 years and 4.5 years) and a total of 15 sexual partners, some with lots of experience, and some with very little.


When I met my current bf, I had given up on getting an orgasm from anyone, and we just took it easy, experimented and enjoyed sex in other ways. I have always enjoyed sex, and an orgasm has never felt like a necessity for me. He would usually just watch me get off if I felt like it.


Then he found my g-spot, and we found a way for him to help me orgasm, by stimulating my g-spot while I made myself come. Before, any fingering had always made me confused (it felt like two different kinds of stimuli that didn't help each other). I discovered that if he didn't move his finger out (just stayed inside and touched my g-spot) while I stimulated my clitoris in my usual way and position, I would get intense orgasms. 


Then, he decided to try licking my clitoris while moving his finger in the same way. I did not expect it to work at first, but it did, and it felt absolutely amazing. He did it twice, but now we are more than 8000 km from each other again, so it will be a while before we get to try out more. I hope this can help encourage other people who thought it might never happen :-)


I think the fact that I had given up, so that there was no pressure on him, along with incredibly good communication and feeling relaxed, helped just as much as the technique. I am not sure, I am still feeling ecstatic, and can't believe it happened :-)

When we first got together sex was amazing, we were at it constantly and both up for trying pretty much anything. However as time as gone on both the quantity and quality of our sex has decline. Quantity I can understand once the honeymoon period is over and we aren't anywhere near r/deadbedrooms level but its the quality bit I don't get. It just really feels like she puts no effort in at all. Sex has become limited to two positions, missionary and spooning, she's still happy with her receiving foreplay but she never reciprocates. For example if I go down on her and she comes then she tightens up and we can't have sex but her idea of helping me get off is asking if I want to masturbate over her whilst she lays there looking bored.

How can I tell her that I don't want to continue like this without sounding like the worst person on earth? She still enjoys sex its just like she's there to get her orgasm with the minimal amount of effort and then roll over and go to sleep. Aside from the sex our relationship is brilliant, we both have jobs that we love and are well paid with 5 minute walking commutes, no kids, nice place together and I do about 90% of the chores.

Tl;dr: Sex used to be amazeballs now she puts no effort in and its making me feel used.

I think the title of this post is self explanatory. Last night, my girlfriend and I were really turned on. We kissed and cuddled for a while and I ended up giving her oral. After I made her cum, she decided to thank me by giving me oral as well, which we didn't do often. Most of the time, she would suck me off for a while and then we'd have sex.

However, she challenged herself to making me cum from a blowjob. Where we live, people aren't circumcised and usually she is pretty good at giving oral. I'm a cut guy and even though she tried for 20 minutes, I never managed to reach an orgasm. Because my sensitivity is really low or something. 
I knew she was getting bored and I knew that after that she would be turned off, which really frustrated me. She then told me she felt like she wasn't good because she didn't manage to make me cum. This was so untrue considering the technique she had. It felt really good. I'm pretty sure a ""normal (uncut)"" guy would cum in no time. 

The fact that I was affecting her confidence was another blow in my face. I got really pissed and we ended up not having sex afterwards that night. 

We had sex this morning, and, of course, I lasted about 5 minutes, which really bothers me. Why can't I cum from a good BJ when after 5 minutes of sex I have to hold back already?

Is there a way I could put a fix to that question?

Thank you very much.

Long story short, in the heat of passion one night, my girlfriend asked me to fist her but I was too scared of hurting her. I asked for some advice on sexxit because I didn't even realize fisting was possible. I got some great tips, and armed with lots of lube and some latex gloves I set about fisting her.

It went OKAY.

Seriously, I've never seen her enjoy ANYTHING this much. She came and came and came, over and over again, and even passed out twice from the pleasure. We had sex for about 2 hours, and about an hour and a half of that was spent with my hand inside her, cumming every 5 minutes or so. I tried to count her orgasms but lost count after 13 - before now, the most I've ever seen her have in one session is three.

I'm absolutely stunned by how stretchy she is - I always thought she had a very tight pussy but she was able to take my whole hand almost up to the elbow, plus four fingers of my other hand. At one point I was able to get my cock in alongside my hand and jack myself off inside her. She has apparently been double-fisted by a previous partner so that's next on our list of things to try...

Best part is, towards the end of the session she even let me try anal (we'd tried before with little luck) and she was so relaxed I managed to get balls-deep inside her for the first time ever. I then slid my hand into her pussy again and gave her the most extreme DP ever (I've never even seen that in porn!!)

I have just recently (within the last year(?) or so) come to the realization that I have a fetish for feet and legs.

I am insanely attracted to my fiance.  Her entire body is absolutely spectacular...and her legs and feet are just PERFECT.  It started out with me just noticing myself getting more and more aroused by pictures of her wearing shorts and flip flops or similar attire.

Flash forward a whole year in Afghanistan to being back home with her and really getting to be up close and personal.

I love regular 'ol peen in the v sex, but I couldn't stop focusing on how HOT her legs and feet were.  It was driving me insane because I just felt like I was so weird.

This most recent time I've had to take leave (~12 hrs ago now) I was with her and during some rather fun foreplay, I finally decided to bring it up to her...  While we were messing around I kind of jokingly put one of her feet onto my cock and moved it back and forth.  She responded in turn with a few joking rubs back and forth on my shaft.

Then, in the most insanely seductive and hottest tone ever said, ""mmm...you like that?"" and moved her other foot on the opposite side and went to town on me.

I came buckets.  She enjoyed it because she loved having that much power over me.  It was amazing.

We were having some pillow talk afterward and she basically told me that she had known for a while that I had a ""thing"" for her legs and feet.

I'm a 20-year-old female exhibitionist/voyeur (E/V) fetishist. It's very much a fetish and not just a casual interest or a kink: this is something I *need* to get off. When I'm masturbating or having sex, imagining that someone is watching me sends me over the edge pretty much immediately. Watching porn is awesome, because the entire thing is an exercise in voyeurism! My fetish has been pretty easy to manage throughout my life (I first discovered it quite young, maybe 10 or 11): it's easy to fantasize about, and I've had a lot of partners willing to indulge it. 

My question is about ""hidden camera"" sites. I think we can all agree that filming someone without their consent is pretty damn unethical. I wish it didn't turn me on so much. I do my best to stay away from sites like that, because I don't want to give them pageviews, but occasionally I'll be so aroused I'll end up there. And get off really, really hard, I might add. I don't want to feel like a terrible person, so I have two specific questions: 

* Are these sites for real? I realize that most fetish porn is staged, so I'm hoping this is too: that the ""hidden"" cameras aren't really hidden and it's just an elaborate fantasy.
* If they are real, how much damage am I doing by visiting them? Technically, I'm supporting the sites by giving them pageviews, but the material is already out there. I'm not creating or distributing it. Where's the fine line?

I'm a guy in a stable, long term relationship and over the last year have found myself getting more and more interested in anal.

What is wrong with me?!",601,170,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/wt6s2/update_my_gf_cheated_on_me_and_its_making_me/,"Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/vppn2/my_gf_cheated_on_me_and_its_making_me_question_my/

First of all, thanks so much to everyone who posted. Every comment helped me gain perspective in some way and I'm really floored by how much of a response I got back.

tl;dr I'm better now, no more weird urges, and no more confusing episodes. Just recovering now. Both relationships ended amicably, and a new relationship starts.

The update: Its been 3 weeks since the event, and I've recovered a lot. The weird sexual thing that I got from the whole bed sheet episode has passed, and I'm now able to look back and think back on the whole event with a clear mind. There's a pang of hurt and pain inside when I think about it but there's no more sexual urge or excitement.
To the fellow redditors who shared their experiences with these ""urges"", (deftlydexterous) I am so sorry that you had to go through it cus it sucks so much. But thank you for telling me that it does pass because I was so scared that there was something wrong with me. I'm happy to say I'm back to normal.
I've also read a bit of sex at dawn and it does help. The whole sperm competitive nature thing did help me rationalize it a bit. That and the Dan Savage notion of ""Making sexual lemons into Bonerade"" really did come together in the end for me.

As for the gf, I was very surprised at how split the reddit crowd was about keeping her or dumping her. I know reddit is usually no tolerance for cheaters but there was a lot of sympathy here for her. I was pretty dead set on leaving her because that's how I've always dealt with cheaters in my relationship history (the post was more about the sexual urges thing than the relationship aspect, hence why i posted on r/sex). 

For those who want to know, this is the development with the gf and the other guy (and it is quite interesting):
After the reddit post that night, I actually called the gf of the other guy. Since we were all good friends, I wanted to see how she was doing. Surprisingly, she was hiding out in the same motel I was at (what are the chances?). She came to my room, and we cried with one another that night. We discussed how we would deal with it, and how our friendship could continue, and decided that we needed to talk about all this together.

We all met a few days later to talk and put it all out there. It gets kinda weird, but basically they both agreed that a) they do have feelings for one another, but care far more about us, and b) that they were willing to break of all ties forever for a chance at redemption. They both were saying they'd do all kinds of things to earn our trust back (give us their passwords to e-mails and facebooks, their cell phones, call records, etc.). But the more they spoke the more it dawned on me; they really are a great match. They way they think, the way they talk, even gestures, how they interacted and everything. I don't know why I never saw it before when we all hung out, but the more I think about it, and the more I look back on it, even I admit that she was far more suited to be with him than with me.

I wish I could have taken a picture of everyone's faces when I said they were perfect for each other. But as I explained it, his gf agreed with me. She slowly saw it too. It was long and confusing but by the end of it we both told them that we forgave them, and that they had our best wishes if they choose to be together. Last week, my exgf moved all her stuff out and went to live at his place. His exgf, (who was from out of town and moved back here with him) having no place to go, is now rooming with me and we've been sorta helping each other through the whole thing. And before you ask, no there's nothing between us, a thing right now after all this is the last thing on either of our minds.

But that's the gist of it. i am getting over it slowly, but am happy that the roughest part is over. Writing it out here, and hearing everyone's suggestions and so forth has really helped me a lot. Thanks everyone.

1335735418.0,432,self.sex,syomy,Whoa... That was new!,613,181,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/syomy/whoa_that_was_new/,"Throw away account, as my friends know my standard account. I just had a fairly mind-blowing experience and I felt compelled to share - guys, I think we've really been missing out.

Let me preface this by saying: I'm married, happily for 10 years. I'm an average guy, not crazy perverted or anything like that. Anyway, here goes: 

My wife is out of town, going on day four now, and I'm completely bored/horny/whathaveyou. We usually have sex three to four times a week, but whenever she's gone I masturbate at least 2-3 times per day. Self-diddling never tides me over as long as a great fuck does.

Anyway, I pulled out the fleshlights this afternoon for a quick ""round two"" for the day and happen to glance at my wife's toy bin. For some reason one of her toys flashes in my mind. She's got this clear butt plug that, whenever we use it, drives her absolutely crazy. I mean she comes completely unhinged when she cums with either me or the plug in her ass. 

I pull her bin down and dig out the butt plug. This thing looks huge, and feels huge in my hand. I've never had anything up my ass before and I'm thinking - this is fricking insane. But I've seen lots of porn, and seen many tiny girls get huge monster cocks up their asses - plus my wife is petite, and if she can take it why couldn't I?

I figure anything is worth a shot if it feels good right? As a quick size comparison, I get myself hard and pinch off my base (simulating the about to cum state) and measure my head - surprisingly my head is a bit larger in diameter than this toy is. Again my wife takes my cock up her ass, and I'm a lot larger of a person than she is. 

What the hell, what's good for the goose is good for the gander right?  

I get out the lube and grease the butt plug up with what I thought was more than the surface area could even handle. I rub a bit on my ass and think ""ok - here goes"". For distraction I put on some internet porn, position myself over the butt plug (that I'm holding with my right hand), and sit on top of a wooden stool. Using the stool as a lever to push against.

I slowly start easing it in, not so bad (I even wondered at first if I was on target or not), but then about 1/2 way on I can really start to feel it (it's tapered). At 3/4 of the way on, not quite to the largest part of the plug, it FUCKING HURTS! It felt like I'd split myself in half! I quickly pull it out and go check myself in a mirror to see if I'd torn anything.  I hadn't, so far my ass seems ok. Undeterred, I give it another shot. Same deal, I get about 3/4 of the way on and damn it feels like I'm being ripped apart. So I tried another tactic, and just try to frig myself with the end of the plug - but it's really not doing anything for me whatsoever. At this point I decide fuck it, I'm not going to do this. 

I zone into the porn for a few minutes, and then get my fleshlight lubed up and going. Feels good, but they always strike me as kind of ""hollow"". Anyway, after a bit I start actually getting into it and can feel the first sensation of that ""Oh... I'm going to cum"" feeling. It's at this point that I unthinkingly grab the butt plug, reapply a TON of lube, position it on the stool under me, and slowly but steadily sit on it. This time the thing hits home. No pain, no feeling of stretching my lips over my head, I even had a moment of ""For real? That just happened? Is it really in?"". I feel oddly full, but not in an uncomfortable way. I turn the dial at the base of the butt plug and the thing starts whirring in my ass. Holy shit. I've never experienced anything like this before. 

My body went stiff, my legs spasmed together and I fell off of the stool and onto the bed. My entire body is convulsing uncontrollably, I'm pretty sure that I let out a number of loud moans (something I've never done as a solo act before). I'm still fucking the fleshlight, but that's pretty much secondary at this point. My mind was totally blank - it was crazy, I had fully lost control of my entire body. There was nothing I could do, no way to stop it, I was going to cum right that instant. I pull out of the fleshlight and cum harder than I ever have in my life. A the same time, my body stiffens and the butt plug shoots out of my ass across the room. 

For a few minutes afterward I just laid there, kind of shaking. Still trying to wrap my head around what had just happened.  I had cum everywhere! All over the bed, all over myself.  

That was the most amazing orgasm of my life. Guys seriously, this culturally ingrained stigma against ass play thing is ridiculous. I think we've seriously been duped (at least I have) for most of my life into thinking this was ""wrong"" or not manly, or whatever.

Don't get me wrong I love a good pounding like any girl out there but just couldn't convert it to solo play.

Anyways, here's what I was told:

* Condoms almost never work.  They only test .01% (1/1,000) and if it's messed up they just ignore it

* condoms need to be kept at a certain temperature to work, but *every* company ships them in non-climate controlled trucks, so even if they were working before, they were defective by the time they get to you
* any boy wo truly loves you would never even consider having sex with you before marriage
* Birth control can hide signs of pregnancy and doesn't work as well as they say, so you can be pregnant for several months and not know
* They did this presentation, with tape.  First, they had 3 boys and 3 girls line up.  They had 2 pieces of packaging tape, one for the boys and one for the girls.  They put the tape on the first people (one boy, one girl) in line, and it represented sex.  The. Tey moved the tape to the second, then third person, representing break ups and sex with a new person.  Then they had the tape, who were soul mates, meet and fall in love.  When the tape got married they had sex, but we're easiert to pull apart because they didn't have the same solid foundation (or, because most of the fucking adhesion was already removed).  Then she took 2 newbie self tape, and stuck them together, and showed how they were much stronger because they waited until they were married to have sex.  I. Raised my hand and asked why that was different if the tape had sex with each other before they were married, because they would be just as stuck.  She just said ""it doesn't work that way"" and refused to call on me the rest of the week.






What I was taught at an overly conservative bible camp

* if a man wants to have sex with you, he's planning on leaving you
* no man who *really* loves you would ever want to have premarital sex
* if you agree to have sex with a man, he will use you until he's ready to get married.  Then he'll leave you for being impure, so he can marry a virgin.  If you lost your virginity to him, he'll still leave you but now no man will ever want to be with you
* Sex before marriage is wrong.  It's not ok to have dirty sex even in marriage.  Dirty sex is anything other than missionary, and you should only have sex if you are open to the idea of and actively wanting children.





My fiancé and I were together for 11 months before having sex, but this was never a problem and it's something I am really appreciative of, because I feel like we really got to enjoy each others company, and even before these classes I had always wanted to take things slow.  The problem, is that we rarely used condoms, and I would often forget the pill because ""they don't really work anyways, so why bother"".  We felt guilty, all the time.  Every new step we would take sexually I would feel more and more guilty about.  I knew I loved him, even early on, and he never pressuredme pastmy comfort zone, but at home at night and at church on Sundays I would feel dirty.  We finally got over it, and went on to really enjoy our sex life guilt free.







The thing is, my mom always had the talk with me.  She was never a fan of me going to church camp, but I would beg and plead and accuse her of hating god for not letting me go, so she would let me go.  She tried explaining the truth about condoms and birth control to me but I told her she was wrong, because I believed that the school would make sure we got correct information, and that she was obviously misinformed.  She tried telling me sex was not dirty or anything to be ashamed of, so long as I was an adult and ready for it.  None of this stuck, because I got this talk after my first abstinence Ed class and first trip to camp (8th grade/summer before 9th grade) and she had the talk with me a few weeks before I started high school.






I've come a long way, and I actually work as an independent consultant for a company thats mission is to enhance the sexual relationships of couples everywhere, and to inform women about sex the right way.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gvt0j/this_was_posted_in_my_dorm_dont_think_i_need_help/). 

I got [Anna Kay](http://i.imgur.com/YbNyt.jpg), who designed the [flyer](http://i.imgur.com/K7kSG.jpg), to take a [picture with me](http://i.imgur.com/aoK47.jpg).

The workshop was led by two female NYU students. 9 people attended, and one of them was a guy (what a brave man). It lasted about an hour, and was not nearly as awkward or interesting as I thought it would be. Regardless, I will share my experience.

The goal of the workshop was to promote masturbation as a form of safer sex. 
We had to fill in an [anonymous form](http://i.imgur.com/ms6Mb.jpg) about our experience with orgasms. There wasn’t anything too surprising there.

We played masturbation jeopardy where we learned the following things (again, nothing groundbreaking):

**MYTH:**

* Some women are incapable of having an orgasm
* If you masturbate, intercourse with a partner is not as satisfying
* The inner lips of a woman's vulva are always smaller than the outter lips
* Masturbation is secondplace to partnered sex
* Researchers have found a definite existence the G-spot 

**FACT:**

* Masturbation is a free sleep aid and destresser
* Some women are capable of ejaculating fluid
* The average penis is 5 to 7 inches when aroused (and 3 to 4 when flacid)
* The typical length of the vaginal canal is 4 to 5 inches
* You can still masturbate if you have a partner

My team won (1800 to 1100). I won a stress-release ball.

Then we played [pin the tail](http://i.imgur.com/1F8CU.jpg) on the [sexual organ](http://i.imgur.com/OE8wk.jpg)... which was not too exciting.

They gave us a few tips on how to “get to know yourself” better:

* Relax
* Kegel exercises (using [vibratone balls](http://i.imgur.com/reaoD.jpg) for example)
* Sex toys: [helmet hugger](http://i.imgur.com/UUHLA.jpg) (masturbation sleeve for men), rabbit habbit, [g-spotter](http://i.imgur.com/SKp95.jpg)
* Communication is important
* Remember to be patient 

I had to explain what Reddit is to get Anna to take a picture with me and someone said ""it's like Digg!"" -_-

Also, I looked like a total weirdo furiously taking notes and pictures of everything, so these people probably don't want to socialize with me ever again. *Forever alone*...

Trouble with my parents finding out I'm sexually active,601,174,357,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1jvkde/16_f_trouble_with_my_parents_finding_out_im/,"I am a 16 year old female with really conservative and strict parents. I have been with my boyfriend (17) for two years and having sex for one. I would never tell my parents unless I was asking to be disowned after being grounded for life and lose all contact with civilization (half kidding). They would be so upset mad and disappointed in me since they've stressed abstinence for as long as I can remember. 

I had to do a lot of my learning through sites that's offer sex education because all my doctors always make it very clear I shouldn't be having sex until marriage and my mom refuses to let me go to a doctor visit alone so I have to lie to my doctor and I can never ask questions I have. Thank goodness for you guys! Otherwise I would be clueless. 

So here is the problem: I just got my second UTI in 6 months because I forgot to pee after sex. Shoot! I know it's an easy fix but it slipped my mind. I also masturbate a fair amount so that probably didn't help either. I asked my mom for a refill of my UTI prescription and she tried to get me to tell her I am sexually active. That's asking to get myself in deeeeep trouble so I told her that I hadn't showered in two days and I masterbate. She said its impossible to get a UTI in two days because she knows since she's had it. 

I'm afraid she's going to take me to a gyno and then she'll find out because she'll stay in the room and now I'm kind of stressed. Can a gyno tell of you're sexually active? Can I pass it off as masterbation, although it's ill advised, I will not risk telling either of my parents since my doctors always seem to be as conservative as they are about sex. They're not bad people at all, they're just crazy when it comes to that stuff. I'm Thor first child so they don't really know how to handle very thing very well when it comes to me. 

Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone! 

TL;DR: I have second UTI in six months, my parents suspect I'm having sex and they cannot know if I want to avoid extreme reprocussions. I may have a gyno visit which my mom will make herself present for no matter how uncomfortable that would be. Help!

Edit: Thor's first child? I'm going to leave it because it's funny. I meant their! 

Edit 2: I'd also like to add that we are not religious. I have only been to church once in my life and it was with my friend. I think for my parents it's more of a moral and safety thing.

* Huge plastic tarp to cover the floor and anything else important
* Large, high quality canvas to paint on
* Little booties to put on afterwards so you can make it to the shower without leaving a trail
* A sponge to help get the paint off
* Body safe paint. 

Set-up was super easy. I used masking tape to hold the corners of the canvas to the plastic tarp, that way it wouldn't move around too much when we were moving on it. The paint was a good consistency and dried quickly. It says body safe, but for the most part we kept it away from genital areas. It's impossible to keep it totally away, but the coconut oil caused it to come right off. The rest of our bodies was totally covered though, and it was amazing. Seeing my girlfriend's face streaked with black paint was like being attacked by an Amazonian woman. It was primal and sexy. We had fun hiding prints too. She made a couple boob/nipple prints that we can giggle about. Hand prints are more apparent, lol. The shower afterwards was a lot of fun too. Paint washed off without too much effort, but anytime we get to scrub each other down in the shower is a good time.

After one of those endless trans-Pacific flights, on a plane that answered the question ""If the Marquis de Sade had been an aeronautical engineer, what sort of seat would he have selected for coach class?"", I desperately needed a massage.

Although the city I was in *wasn't* famous for the skin trade, like Manila or Bangkok, a lot of massage places in Tulsa are whorehouses and away from home, I'd be even less equipped to pick out a legitimate therapeutic place.

But next to the hotel there was a very legitimate *looking* shop.  The signs showed legitimate massage techniques, they had professional-looking brochures, an extensive price list.  And my back ached like I was 90 years old.

The masseuse seemed like a very nice girl, dressed casually but not provocatively in a short-sleeved shirt and shorts.  The table was the standard model with a hole for your face.  I settled in, and tried to relax.

She actually did a pretty good job. She did my back and shoulders, then had me turn over and rubbed my face and oddly, my ears.   Then, just as I was mocking my own apprehensions about the place, poked me in the groin.  ""You want that massaged too?""

""Uh, no, that's OK.""  I paid -- $6 for the massage, plus a $4 tip -- and went back to my hotel.

Where I began to think about it.  Why not get the rest of me massaged?  It was a new experience and how bad could it be?   And the money was nothing.

So the next day, despite my now completely quiescent back, I returned to the professional-looking parlor next to the hotel.  Got the same masseuse, lay my face in the same hole in the same table.  Again I turned over to have my front worked on, and again she prodded me in the groin. ""You want that massaged too?""

This time, I said, ""Sure, why not?""

$20.  No problem.  She had me stand up, take off my pants, and strangely, lie down on the other bed in the room.  That bed wasn't as easily seen from the corridor, so maybe she wasn't supposed to be doing what she was doing.

And she set to it.  For someone who worked with her hands all day, her grip was surprisingly slack.  So slack, in fact, that it didn't feel like much.  But a pretty girl was giving me a hand-job, that didn't happen to me every day.  And it occurred to me: maybe she'd let me touch her back.

So, casually of course, I reached up in the general direction of her chest.  She reached up and and I expected her to brush my hand away, but instead she unbuttoned her shirt for better access, and I reached inside.  Nice breast, but it isn't really exciting touching a boob of someone you don't know and isn't interested in you one way or another.

Well, try the shorts.  Again, I reached, and again she instantly loosened her belt and unzipped her shorts for my convenience.  Nice girl, honestly.

She had a fair patch of woolly pubic hair, which surprised me, both the wooliness, in contrast to the sleek, glossy hair on her head, and the fact that she had it at all.  My only previous experience with sex workers was watching porn, and the performers there are always hairless as lizards from the neck down.  This was a distinct improvement.

But that was really it.  I'd never touched *unaroused* female genitalia before.  A woman's labia, in my experience, were like the lips of her mouth, slightly moist, tender to the touch, sensitive.  This girl's vulva was as cool and smooth as her hands, and as impersonal.

I should have just left.  I felt bad for the girl, being groped by a stranger twice her age.  It wasn't erotic for me, just depressing.  If I had a good excuse, I would have left, but just hopping up and exiting would cast aspersions on both her and me.  Just ejaculate already!

OK, fantasize, that should work, right?  Imagine it's, oh, Katy Perry giving you the hand job, or Jewel.  And it's a blow job!  Mmmmm, no, that's not working.

Then of course, I realized what I had to do.  The only way I was just going have an orgasm, however seedy, and get out of this place, before I gave this poor girl carpal-tunnel syndrome or she gave me penile calluses.  Pathetic as it was, I ended up fantasizing I was being jerked off by my wife.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,False,,,True,t3_spr62,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/spr62/the_beauty_of_asian_massage_parlors_a_second/,

She and I normally evenly split the rent for our apartment, which is about $800 per month. Today she asked me if I would be willing to pay 75% of the rent in exchange for one blowjob to orgasm six days a week, for one month. This would be completely independent of our ordinary sex life (i.e. I wouldn't be expected to reciprocate, or not also have PIV sex that day).

Some background: we've been married about six months, have lived together about two years, and have been together for a long time before that (6+ years). We ordinarily have sex two or three times a week, with blowjobs happening maybe once or twice a month and we're both happy with our sex life.

(Also, it's interesting that so many people are interested in our financial situation. Our marriage and cohabitation is still fairly new, but splitting the rent and utilities and so on has just worked so far, for the reasons that some people have mentioned below.

I love women. I love their curves, whether soft or sinewy. I love when a strap peeks out on a shoulder or a hip or I catch a glimpse of colour or lace under a pair of jeans. When a shirt lifts up just a bit to reveal a belly or a pair of dimples of Venus. I love the natural smell of a woman. I'll inhale while running my lips over her legs, her stomach, her breasts, her shoulders, her neck, her hair. I love when it's clear she did some trimming or shaving that day in anticipation of what is about to happen.

I love when a woman openly communicates her lust to me. When she melts me with a smile, a look, or a brush of her lips against my neck or my ear. When she runs her hands over my muscles and through my hair while we're making out. God that's delicious. When she invites me to her bed and she is the one who undoes my pants, telling me how much she wants me. When she looks deep in to my eyes as she cups and fondles my balls while I grab a condom and roll it on.

I don't relate to guys who don't like going down on a woman. I love exploring. I love running my tongue through all the grooves, sliding my hand over her mound, sliding a finger in and pressing up against her g-spot while my outer hand gently pushes down. I love watching and feeling her reaction to everything I do. There's nothing better than seeing her face contort in ecstasy---her mouth open and neck taut as my tongue and lips and fingers work, her upper body writhing as she tugs at my hair, her thighs quivering and squeezing against my ears and face. Her eyes closed or looking down at me. Even better if she straddles my head with her hands on the wall, slowly grinding herself against my face as my tongue snakes in and out and around. Bonus points for covering my face in splooshiness and/or making out with me right after.

I love when a woman lets me take control. I love stripping a woman down to her underwear and then picking her up, tossing her on the bed, and jumping between her spread legs to kiss her deeply. Or pressing her up against the wall with her legs wrapped around me. I love straddling her chest and cradling her head and stroking her hair as she sucks me, or standing and watching her as she kneels in front of me. I love to put her in the position I want and then have my way with her, then drag her to the next position and repeat. I love holding her wrists over her head during missionary and taking a deep handful of hair during doggy style and leaving a handprint on a luscious ass. I love waking her up the next morning with a hand between her legs while spooning, anxious for her to wake up and receive me again.

I love when a woman takes control. When she is *enthusiastic* and helps me, both verbally and physically, to better pleasure her. When I'm on top and she holds my waist to control the tempo as she arches her back and moves her hips to get the right angle and squeezes her muscles to maximize her enjoyment. When she rolls us over and places her hands on my chest and stomach and her hair drapes over my face and her pussy slowly envelopes and releases me as she moves back and forth. When she doesn't stifle her moans and screams because she doesn't care if (or does hope that) the neighbours hear. That unabashed loudness is my reward for working hard and making her shake and come.

Sex adds colour to my world. I love pussy. I love women. I love sex. I am single.

I recently graduated from film school.  I have no job yet and want to shoot a few things for myself (to build my reel) this summer.  I have access to a lot of really good equipment for free.  I am from the Philadelphia area, so anyone in driving distance can apply.


I need the following:

* Actors and Actresses Nude [Paid upon completion]
* Actor and Actresses Non-nude [Unpaid]
* Extras[Unpaid]
* Writers (can be done online) [Unpaid]
* Grips and Production Assistants (No film experience needed) [Negotiable]
* Executive producers (This means u give me paypal money and get this credit) [If we turn a profit, you will get money back]

I am making this with or without funding from reddit, I have enough money to make it right now.  I dont want to seem like I am begging for money.  I only offer the exec producer credit if you WANT to be.

There will be 3-5 scenes.  Each scene will have a different theme/motif/etc.  Here is what I was thinking:

* Girl/Guy
* Girl/Girl
* Girl/Girl/Guy
* Guy/Guy/Girl
* Big finale TBD
* I would do a Guy/Guy if there was enough interest and 2 gents willing to do it.

I am going to distribute this on reddit (DVD, Blu-Ray, Digi-download).  DVD and Blu-Ray require you to pay shipping, Digi-download is free.  I might make it streamable, gotta look into it.  I will be asking for donations once it is done.  If you like it, donate whatever you want.

Any questions?

EDIT: If you are interested in a position, email: RedditThePorno@gmail.com     If you want to be an actor/actress send me a picture of yourself (doesnt need to be professional)

EDIT 2:  I am trying against having any one person do everything, solely because I want to jam as much reddit into this thing as possible.  That being said if interest is low, then I would let someone do every scene.

EDIT 3: Someone brought up a legal issue, this is not a REDDIT porno, its a porno by redditors.

His newly appointed manager has been saying some inappropriate stuff during work. It could be called flirting, but could you call this sexual harassment too? A few weeks ago she made a comment to some customers that they had a lot of kids and that she could hardly handled her one kid. My boyfriend jokingly said that he had five kids. She replied, ""Want more?"" and winked. My boyfriend blames himself because he made a comment, but this wasn't the last time she ""flirted"". She has often said that she would be dating him if he wasn't dating me, and today another one of her flirtatious comments arose. She told him to clean the bottom drawers and that once he was done with that to come see her so that she could keep him busy. Everyone laughed, so my boyfriend just went along with it. Remember, I'm not there when these things happen. So I don't really know what to make of it. It really upsets me to hear these stories, but I don't know if I'm overreacting. I wanna know what the people of sexxit think of my situation. 

**Edit:** We discussed this issue last night. He is indifferent to the comments that she has made so according to the comments y'all have made this wouldn't be sexual harassment. He really doesn't want to make such a big deal about it at work, but he plans on talking to his manager about toning down her inappropriate comments. Thanks to all the different responses. I've personally never worked at a restaurant and never thought this kind of behavior was the norm, but seeing that this happens often everywhere sort of puts my mind at ease. 

**Edit:** So apparently it does bother him. . . [text](http://i.imgur.com/P1cI2Nf.png)

During sex my boyfriend just rubs too hard or he starts pounding away at me early.  I have guided his hands away from rubbing directly on my clit.  I have tried to explain and show him how much harder he is rubbing me than what would feel good.  I likened the pressure to me jerking him off with a crescent wrench.  I know he watches a lot of porn and I have told him that I just can't take what some of those girls can.

It has turned into a huge point of contention because he feels like I'm attacking or insulting him and he swears he's rubbing as soft as he can but I keep feeling like he is going for a deep tissue massage constantly (especially on my clit).  Then he doesn't want to have sex because I'm not just ready for him as instantly as he can be (due at least partially to the difference between men and women):  

I am his first sexual partner and I know he watches a lot of porn.  I've suggested that porn has warped his idea of sex but that is met with a lot of defense.   i casually brought up softcore (as cheesy as it is....there is still a lot more female foreplay than in hardcore) in hopes we could watch some of that together and maybe he could catch on without me being direct and causing him to put up a wall.

He's also a bit obsessed with me not being a virgin and wants to take my anal virginity so he ""has something"".

I should also mention that when we first became sexually active but before he cashed in his V card with me, the foreplay was amazing.  He was the first person I was with that was able to make me orgasm.  So I don't know if I can write it off as porn or inexperience since it has gotten worse with more experience.  

I want to be with him but sex is becoming a hassle unless I just grin and pretend everything he is doing is just great.  Is this something we can overcome or is this an incompatibility?  What is within my means to make this better?

EDIT:  I admit he's immature but I don't want to break up with him.  His opposition is less ""I won't fix the problem"" and more ""I'm trying!"" but just not grasping why what he's doing is wrong.  It's like he can't control himself when he gets too worked up and doesn't understand why the stuff in porn isn't true to life.  I'm looking to show him why....not just tell him (since I've tried that and he feels cornered) that we both need to enjoy sex and for that to happen he has to take care.

Especially given the usual attitude on this sub.

I'm talking about [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1a2z1d/penis_goes_wrong_direction/), specifically what followed [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1a2z1d/penis_goes_wrong_direction/). To sum it up for anyone who doesn't want to read the OP, a young man came on explaining that he'd recently realized his erect penis bent slightly down, rather than the usual slight upward bend. This led to some pain, inconvenience, etc. and he and his girlfriend, his ""first real sexual partner"", were having trouble finding working positions and other solutions.

Kaliyugaa offered [this suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1a2z1d/penis_goes_wrong_direction/c8tmqca), which I think is very good advice. Those were the two positions that came to mind for me and he added who would be in control in each position. OP then responded that doggy style wasn't an option and said not to ask. He then moved on in the same comment and asked clarification about the cowgirl/reverse cowgirl suggestion.

""Don't ask"" is something most people don't like hearing because it's momentarily frustrating and can sound a bit antagonistic or pretentious. In this case, however, given that it was a sexual context in which someone was mentioning something they can't do, the intention was pretty clearly not to antagonize or condescend. I understand the natural instinct to immediately want to know what someone says you can't know, but most mature people get over that instinct quickly in situations when it isn't appropriate. I don't mean that as a personal attack on the commenters in that thread but I truly am stunned that adults (probably) would act this way. Anyway, OP was downvoted heavily (I don't have RES; I'd be curious about the ratio) and the highest upvoted response to him was ""Well of course we're going to ask.""

OP responds ""very serious. can't talk about it. please."" and is downvoted even more heavily. Maybe I should care less about things on the internet but that made me sad and angry. Maybe he was downvoted for sounding a little melodramatic? Maybe it's that everyone still really wanted to know his secret? I don't know, but I don't understand how you downvote someone who, discussing something sexual, a private, intimate subject, says he can't do something and can't say why, then asks to move on and *ends his post with ""please""*. I just don't get it.

The responses to that further dismissed his request and were largely immature. He explains ""that detail is unimportant and has to do with a mental trauma. and unrelated to my penis."" Even this response is downvoted to -5. A few responses to it, one respectful but that I disagree with, one a joke referencing Colby (the whole Reddit dog thing; I thought it was in really poor taste considering he and his girlfriend are clearly struggling with this), and a couple others.

Had it been a detail that was really relevant to the thread, I would understand the desire for more information. However, why doggy style isn't an option is relevant but not important. He said it wasn't an option and discussed further recommendations. People didn't let him move on, despite there being a range of other advice that could have been offered outside of doggy style. I understand that most people on here aren't shy. They're very willing to discuss sex and sexuality in graphic terms and be forthcoming and descriptive. And that's a good thing. But not everyone is like that. And you can't expect everyone coming into the sub to be like that, at least not when the thing they aren't willing to talk about isn't important. I think it was teenage curiosity and nosiness that for some reason just wasn't checked at all. I understand wanting to know what someone says you can't know, but most people don't get stubborn about it.

Please consider this. I don't mean this to stir debate but if you have a counter-argument go for it. I would say regardless of your argument you should still respect people's feelings on what they're willing to discuss, but I won't stop you.

I'm explaining it here because it has to do sexual psychology, but it's a weird situation so it's not a perfect fit. Just bear with me.

First, I'm a guy in my later 20s, and I'm pretty attractive and in good shape. I have a step daughter who is 13, and who hit puberty 4 years ago, and has lately been really interested in sex, as any 13 year old child would be.

There are two issues going on. 

First, I began to suspect that she had a crush on me about 5 months ago, but it's very subtle hints, nothing definite and I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. But she's upped the ante lately, and will do things like wear skimpy clothing and drape herself across me, or come into my office and start just massaging my shoulders or my scalp (like I do to her mom). The other night she hugged me goodnight and wrapped her legs around me and wouldn't let go (like ""haha, it's not sexual, so it's just silly and playful."" Right. Also bear in mind when picturing this that she has an extremely mature body and is often wolf whistled in public because she looks like a young adult.) When we're alone she'll ask random questions about what constitutes incest.

I think the signs are there and I think I'm not just seeing things. 

Here's the second problem though, and this is where it gets scarier. I've never been remotely sexually interested in younger women. Even when I was a kid I was into women much older. The youngest woman I've ever been with, at age 17, was 32. It's just how I'm wired. All that having been said, once I started dealing with this months ago, I began having involuntary and intrusive sexual thoughts about my step daughter. They are extremely distressing, and I DO NOT WANT THEM. I would never, ever, ever, ever cross that line, even if she were a legal adult, for more reasons than I can articulate in this post. 

But I'm seeing this perfect storm of sexual interest brewing, and I want to nip it straight in the bud. I want to shut my step daughter down in any thoughts that anything like that is possible, and I want the intrusive and unusual (for me) thoughts to totally fucking stop.

I feel really trapped. Even writing this makes me nervous, I do not want to be labeled a pedophile or an ephebophile, and I don't feel I can talk to my wife about this because I think she would be horrified that her daughter is thinking that way, and beyond horrified that I'm having the thoughts I'm having. I also don't want to humiliate my step daughter by calling it out directly, and there remains a chance that I really am just misinterpreting innocent actions and questions, and if I were to call it out, I'd be in deep shit. 

I have no fucking idea what to do. I want step daughter to stop thinking this way if she is, I want to stop having the intrusive and unwelcome thoughts I'm having, and I want to do it subtly. 

Help!

truth be told, i don't know what i need to be doing. i have instructed them to contact law enforcement (i used to be in law enforcement so i was able to walk them through what would happen) and they did follow through.

i don't know if it is just in my state, but in cases of rape you have until the 20th week to have an abortion; however, you have to convince a judge that you were raped. statutory rape does not necessarily count as ""rape""; it is at the judge's discretion. (and yes, 20 weeks is the halfway point, so it's 1/2 way through the second trimester. the fetus is considered viable [able to take a breath] at the 21st week.)

now, was my niece forcefully raped? that is still a little up in the air. i think she is afraid to tell her mom or the counselor everything. she has abandonment issues (~~i forget the exact diagnosis~~ [disinhibited RAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_attachment_disorder), aka DAD) that cause her to be instantly comfortable with men, to the point of lap sitting and inappropriate hugging/touching. (her biological mother abandoned her. it is not believed that she was sexually abused as a child... well, she's still a child, but you know what i mean. she was most probably mentally and/or physically abused.) she made me very uncomfortable when we first met. she and i have had talks about appropriate behavior at my sister-in-law's request. i also got used to some of it.

i ""can see"" how some of her actions could be misinterpreted by some men. (she only does this with older men. she is not even interested in boys her own age.) **but he is a grown man and she is 13-years-old!!**

okay, i need someone to tell me **not** to go find this fucker and make him swallow every tooth in his mouth and then literally shove my boot up his ass. beyond that, i need to know what the uncle can do without overstepping any boundaries. i want to help her. i love her so very much. she is a sweet, innocent kid who tries to do well in school and to please the parental figures in her life. she helps take care of her younger siblings and cooks diner for the whole family most nights, especially when my sister-i-law is working late... which is why there was a ""family friend"" sitting with them. 

i don't think she is mentally able to deal with an abortion; then again, i know she isn't ready to be a mommy. what should i do? is there anything i should do ""behind the scenes"" to help her?

**OY!!**

edit: she is my brother-in-law's biological daughter who has lived with my wife's sister since she was 3-years-old when she was found alone in her home without supervision and full custody was granted to her father. so just to cleat up any confusion, she is my wife's sister's husband's daughter who was adopted by my wife's sister. yeah, it's a little confusing. 

second edit [8 hours later]: i do not mean make this sound like it is in any way, shape or form about me. i do not intend to ""hurt"" the criminal who hurt my niece. i am off of that ledge. my niece has scheduled an abortion for next thursday with prep on wednesday. however, after making the appointment and long talks with several relatives, she is heavily leaning towards adoption. she does not think she can live with herself knowing that she took a life. this was her wording. we all agreed to help her weigh the decision without judgment or personal feelings about abortion. beyond that, most of the family is pro choice, and so this is her **choice**. my wife and i also had a very long talk tonight. part of the discussion was about the possibility of us adopting the child. we would talk to my niece first to ask if that would bother her. if she has any issue, we will drop that idea. but we have decided that **a)** since she puts so much on herself to take of her little brother and little sister and mom too (my sister-in-law has not been the most responsible person since her and my brother-in-law separated and he moved 2 hours away) and **b)** her mom would be unable to get her to school (all expectant mothers are sent to a ""special circumstances school"" and it is on the way to my son's middle school) and **c)** we have a spare room... our niece will most probably be living with us for the duration of her pregnancy. we will discuss it further with all involved tomorrow. also, as i am a stay-at-home dad for the moment, i will be home with her on days she is not up to attending school... something her mom could not do. right now, we all (my wife, sister-in-law, and myself) agree that she does not need to be alone. also, it is now 3:40am and i cannot sleep for all the shit stew floating around in my brain.",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1351755679.0,,,True,t3_12f98l,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/12f98l/my_13yearold_niece_was_raped_by_a_30yearold/,

I start fantasizing about whatever turned me on, if I'm sitting down I cross my legs and clench them as hard as I can. I start feeling pressure and BOOM! It's as easy as that. After the first one, it gets a little addictive so I have to have at least 6-8 more orgasms, sometimes even more than that. It doesn't happen that often, perhaps once every 2 or 3 months. I don't do this every week, I've found that it drains my energy more so than actual exercise. I'm not posting this to brag or karma. I'm posting to see if there is anyone else out there who is able to do this. I know some women who have trouble with orgasms, some have never even felt one before.

The planning and permitting process has proceeded slowly, so we have this functioning but empty house that isn’t too far from where we live and from where I work.  Little did we know that having such a place would bring some very nice side benefits…

About once or twice a month, we’ve used the place for semi-secret hookups.  It feels almost like we’re having an affair with one another when we steal off to the house with the explicit purpose of having some sexy fun.

The first time was last fall, on the 10th anniversary of our first date.  We went to the restaurant where we had our first date ten years prior, and we planned after to go to the house for fun.  We had a sex swing that we’d not used for lack of a place to hang it.  Well, since we’re tearing this place down, there’s no problem installing an eye bolt in the living room ceiling!  Swing-fucking her in front of the fireplace was incredible.

Then there was the time after a mid-day appointment where we snuck off to the house for a quick blowjob and cuddle.  A couple of other times, we have gone by to fuck before coming home to relieve the babysitter.  It always feels edgy and fun, like we’re having a secret affair to go to a place where the only purpose is to fuck clandestinely.

The best was a couple of nights ago… she dressed up like a schoolgirl and we role played, something we have not done in many years.  I made her tell me about her sexual history in detail, spanked her, paddled her, and finished with fucking her, both vaginally and anally, on an air mattress in front of the fire.  It was awesome on so many levels.

Having this spot has added a great spark to an already strong marriage.  The feeling that we’re having an affair with one another is incredible: we both look forward to the encounters at this old house.  I’ll definitely feel some loss when it gets torn down!  We’ll need to find some other way to keep this concept going.

I was reading a submission a while ago (can't find the link, unfortunately) about who you've always wanted to have sex with but couldn't because of an SO. It was an interesting topic, and I really enjoyed reading it. Most of it was pretty standard, like ""uptight boss"" or ""girlfriend's best friend"", and some of it was pretty out-there and fun to hear. It was great to see people being so candid, and was also very reassuring that it was understood ""of course, I love my SO enough to keep from doing it.""

But then I began thinking about who I would have sex with, and I drew a blank. I realized that the thought of having sex with someone other than my SO, even someone who I am ridiculously attracted to, makes me feel sick. The thought of putting a not-my-boyfriend's-penis inside of me is such a huge turnoff. Just the thought of lying in bed with someone who is not my boyfriend, pre- or post-coitus, makes me cringe.

I am curious as to whether this is unusual. I know that humans are sexual creatures, and it doesn't strike me as odd that people would want to sleep with someone other than their SO. But I'm just not feeling it for anyone else.

TL;DR - I don't want to have sex with anyone other than my SO. Does anyone else feel the same way?

My husband has high functioning autism / aspergers...
He is super smart and caring and compassionate.  He loves me very much.
We were dating for 4 years and everything was pretty normal.  It took a lot of effort for me to explain my emotions to him, and he would nod and listen and I honestly believed he would acknowledge my feelings and me as a person.  (Now I wonder if he was acting...)

During this time we had sex really regularly, like 1-2 times a week. Then, circumstances conspired and we got engaged and then married.  Immediately after we got married, he stopped having sex with me.  When I ask him about it, he said that it got boring. When I ask him, is there anything I can do about it he says that there is nothing I can do because he wants to have sex with a different body type.  He says that he needs sexual variety.  When I suggest role playing or doing things different, he says it is all boring.  It has been 6 months, and I feel used, I feel abandoned, I feel like I wasted my time marrying this guy.  

Now he has come to me with the idea that he should be able to have sex with prostitutes while married to me.  I try to explain to him that, while it might help his sexual variety issues, I would be hurt emotionally if he does this.  He is very confused by my response.  He thinks that I should feel special just because he married me.  He sees it as he gave me a special ring, therefore I should feel special all the time.  I am really struggling to communicate my feelings and how he is hurting my feelings.  It is really doing a number on my ability to trust this person because I thought that he was having sex with me regularly as a way to express his affection for me. 

He feels that I am not doing enough to address the sexual variety problem. He thinks that I am not taking it seriously enough.

Was seeing a girl she was lovely. Anyway we are lying on my bed and she's giving me a handjob (my god she had skills) and after a reasonable amount of time I come. I'm going to attribute the girls skill to the rather impressive arc, I mean a good 2 meters in the air and straight smack into my eye. 

Now for those of you fortunate enough to never have some man lava erupt into your eye let me tell you this shit burns. It burns like a bitch. I was freaking out she was freaking outand I'm running around my room one eye glued shut looking for something take the pain away. If you have ever seen a man with an erection running around in circles freaking out looking for a towel you don't need me to tell you that as this point the girls in stitches laughing her ass off at my plight. 

When I was all finished being a pussy she said ""remember that next time you ask a girl to come on her face.""

EDIT: Thanks for all the wonderful comments. My thinking is that making at least a couple people laugh is worth revisiting the horrors of that day. The girl is the one who called it the angry pirate hence the user name. For those who think its weird i was getting a hand job this girl is makes em better than most blowjobs. Go me.

EDIT 2: Wow guys this got a hell of a lot more views than I was expecting. A rather large amount of downvotes so I think I must have brought up some bad memories for a few people.

We are both incredibly attracted to her, and my friend and I are cool with trying a MFM threesome.

But she lives with us, and most advice about housemates is DON'T SHIT WHERE YOU EAT, which I have always agreed with, and our new housemate agrees with too.

The problem is that now there is this intense sexual tension, and we need to get rid of that tension. Should we just ignore the tension and go on with life? The issue there is that something could so easily happen again, damn primal brain. She is a really cool housemate and we don't want to kick her out or move out.

Has anybody been in a similar situation? How did it play out?",,False,self,t5_2qh3p,1345606454.0,,,True,t3_yma5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/yma5p/new_housemate_is_dtf_with_us_we_know_its_a_bad/,

A friendly tip. Let me tell all you adventurous ladies out there how to get be able to acheive this.


It all started with us trying to see who would cum first from 69. As I turned out too good for him we decided to up the ante and I allowed him access to a vibrator, to tease me while I was giving him head.


Fast-forward a few weeks and I tried to get myself very close to an orgasm before I started blowing him. I took a psych class in college and obviously everyone knows about Pavlov's experiment so I thought why not. For about two or three months (yes, months, this stuff takes time people) I only gave him blowjobs when I was super aroused and had already played with myself. I even tried using the vib on myself all the time.


Now, with enough concentration, just the smell, feel, texture and motion of fellatio is enough to get me almost to the brink of orgasm. We're nearly getting there! Also note, this sometimes happens subconsciously. Just thinking about it and writing this down has already got me too excited.

My boyfriend had a hard time reaching orgasm during sex it took a while to get the right technique but this is how I get my guy to blow in 5 minutes flat:

* The easiest arrangement is laying side by side in a 69 position.
* The top and bottom parts of the glans where the ridge is are the most sensitive parts for most.
* Move only about one inch in and build up rhythm.
* Use the your tongue to push the glans into your palate.
* Pressure and friction from your tongue and palate will make him cum.
* Keep your lips very hard as teeth are distracting.
* Keep up a good speed and stop as little as possible (be relentless).
* Keep your mouth on it, licking balls/shaft are foreplay and are distracting.
* Suction doesn't help and makes loud noises.
* When he gets stiffer it means he is getting there, time for the final assault.
* When he shoots keep going until after the first two pulses then stop moving but keep pressure.
* Swish it around, savour it then swallow.

Now if your neck hurts, if your lips are sore, if your jaw muscles are painful you are probably doing a damn good job!

Edit: my french is coming through gland = glans
