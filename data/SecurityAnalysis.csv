1375801417.0,26,self.SecurityAnalysis,1jtbyt,Quick and Dirty Washington Post Valuation,27,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1jtbyt/quick_and_dirty_washington_post_valuation/,"Some people may wonder why so many M&amp;A transactions are posted in this sub. M&amp;A transactions often have interesting wrinkles that expose undervalued securities. I particularly focus on divestitures as they can materially change the balance sheet and earnings/cash flow profile of a company. Many times I'll do a quick and dirty valuation to see if anything obvious jumps out at me. Some interesting things were there and at first there was nothing to see. Now I'll put this on my watch list until I get more information.

As posted yesterday, [Jeff Bezos purchased the Washington Post for $250M](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html). This was interesting as I knew that WPO is a holding company with many different businesses. Let's examine what's left over after Bezos takes the Washington Post (all of the information was found reading the most recent [10-Q](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000010488913000018/d10q.htm), [10-K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000010488913000009/d10k.htm), and the [letter agreement](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000095015713000294/ex2-1.htm)):

Operating Assets:

* Education Business - Consists of Kaplan's Higher Ed (For Profit Education), Test Prep and International businesses (2012: ~$2.2B Rev, ~$125M EBITDA)

* Cable Television - Owns Cable ONE business that has ~600k subs in 19 midwestern states (2012: ~$285M EBITDA)

* Television Broadcasting - Owns Post-Newsweek Stations that has 6 TV stations in Houston, Detroit, Miami, Orlando, San Antonio, and Jacksonville. (2012: ~$200M EBITDA, 2011:~$130M EBITDA)

* Remaining Publishing Businesses - Slate, Slate V, The Root, Foreign Policy

* Other Businesses - WaPo Labs, Social Code, Celtic Healthcare

Non Operating Assets/Liabilities:

* Cash, Marketable Securities, Investments in Affiliates (Cars.com/Apartments.com), Real Estate, **Net Pension Assets**, Debt

Quick and Dirty Valuation:

I'm going to use comps for this valuation as it is quick and dirty. There have been numerous issues across for-profit education: drops in enrollment, regulatory scrutiny, accreditation scares, and the sector is in general turmoil. Companies trade at 2X-5X EBITDA based on how quickly earnings are falling. APOL's revenue and EBIT is falling faster than DV's so APOL trades around 2X EBITDA and DV trades around 5X EBITDA. Kaplan's revenue and EBITDA are falling relatively slowly so I'll give it a 4X multiple.

WPO's other businesses are in areas where there have been recent M&amp;A activity.  Charter recently acquired [Cablevision's Systems Bresan Broadband Holdings for 1.625B (8X-9X EBITDA)](http://www.deadline.com/2013/02/charter-buys-cablevision-western-systems/). Also, [Tribune recently purchased 19 Local TV stations for 2.7B (7-8X average 2011/2012 EBITDA)](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/tribune-to-buy-19-tv-stations-for-2-7-billion/). I'll use these multiples for those respective divisions. The other businesses are small and I'll value them at $0.

I'll value the cash as cash (restricted cash isn't counted) and debt as debt. Marketable securities will be adjusted as they hold 2,214 shares of BRK.A and 424,250 shares of BRK.B (Most recent 10-K). The stock has gone up about 8.8% in the past 3 months so this adds about $37M to the marketable securities balance of $470M.

The company holds a 16.5% interest in Classified Ventures and they own Cars.com and Apartments.com.  These companies are web 1.0 darlings are in danger of being disrupted by other products. Rent.com was bought by eBay in 2004 for $415M and sold to Primedia last year for an undisclosed price. These assets are worth something, but not as much as they used to be. Let's assume that Rent.com is worth 25% (~$100M) of what is was in 2004. Apartments.com and Cars.com have similar traffic to Rent.com according to Compete.com (I know, not the best proxy for traffic). Then WPO's interest in these businesses is worth $33M.

Their remaining publishing businesses could be worth $75M. You can use the HuffPo sale to AOL as a comp for Slate. At that point in time, they had about 25M visitors and Slate currently has 5M according to compete. Either way, this estimate is more of a quick guess than anything for the rest of the properties.

Real Estate not included in the sale of the Washington Post includes, properties at 1150 15th St NW, 1515 L St NW, 1523 L St NW, 1100 15th St NW, and wharves and warehouses on the Alexandria, VA waterfront owned by Robinson Terminal Warehouse. [You can look up the DC Properties here](https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Search.jsp?search_type=Assessment) and [the Alexandria Property here](http://realestate.alexandriava.gov/index.php?action=address) to get their tax assessed values. This should give you a lower bound on what the properties are worth. The DC Properties are assessed at about $80M in total and the Alexandria property is assessed at $16.3M.

The pension is the most interesting piece to me. I'm assuming that this is not sold to Bezos for two reasons that may or may not be justified:

1. When they sold Newsweek in 2010, they kept the pensions at the company.

2. The pension is over funded and they have a $560M asset on their balance sheet.

&gt;The Company assumed a 6.5% expected return on plan assets for fiscal year 2012, which is consistent with the expected return assumption for fiscal years 2011 and 2010. The Company’s actual return on plan assets was 18.5% in 2012, 14.7% in 2011 and 20.3% in 2010. The 10-year and 20-year actual returns on plan assets were 8.5% and 11.4%, respectively.

WPO's pension managers have beaten the market over the past 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 10-year, and  20-year periods (I'm sure with a large dash of Warren Buffett). This is something that is very rarely seen and their overfunded pension is the result.

* Education Business - $125M x 4X = $500M
* Cable Television - $285M x 8.5X = $2423M
* Television Broadcasting - $165M x 7.5X = $1238M
* Remaining Publishing Businesses - $75M
* Other Businesses - $0
* Washington Post Consideration - $250M
* Cash - $300M
* Marketable Securities - $470M + 37M = $507M
* Investments in Affiliates - $33M
* Real Estate - $96M
* Pension Assets - +$589M
* Debt - -$533M

Total Value = ~$5.5B

Current Market Cap = $4.42B

I revised this as I had forgotten some assets that moved the value up 10%. There's alot of uncertainty around how much the remaining publishing businesses make, how much working capital the separated Washington Post will have, and how much of the pension and debt will be shifted to the new company (I erroneously assumed that everything would stay at the old Washington Post). This took me about an 1.5 hours of reading this morning. You'll have to wait for the purchase agreement to come out to see how everything falls.

There are bright hedge funds on both sides of this name and so the way I look at this is we should read and learn as much as we can about the company over the course of the month and then I'll set up a new topic for discussion in **September**.

Your contribution to the discussion should really be simple. You should be able to articulate why this is a buy/sell/or hold. It's best to have supporting evidence for how you make your argument. You should have primary data on your side. This can come from a variety of sources. Market share data which shows the company is sliding. Financial ratios which show it's deteriorating. Industry data which shows the supply/demand situation is skewed towards one side or another. Not really looking for full blown write ups here, just informed opinions.

**Let's shoot for a discussion the weekend of the 13th in September.**

Notes to book “Security Analysis” 6th edition
Written by: Benjamin Graham and David Dodd


I thought these quotes from Security Analysis Sixth Edition Hardcover might be food for thought.  

Benjamin Graham and David Dodd first wrote security Analysis in 1934.  The first edition was described by Graham as a “book that is intended for all those who have a serious interest in securities values.”  The book was not designed for the investment novice.  One must have an intermediate to advanced understanding of financial statements, accounting and finance for the book to be understood.  The book emphasizes logical reasoning.  Graham wrote, “It is the conservative investor who will need most of all to be reminded constantly of the lessons of 1931 –1933 and of previous collapses.”


On Page [xiv] Seth Klarman wrote: 

”Losing money, as Graham noted, can also be psychologically unsettling.  Anxiety from the financial damage caused by recently experienced loss or the fear of further loss can significantly impede our ability to take advantage of the next opportunity that comes along.  If an undervalued stock falls by half while the fundamentals – after checking and rechecking – are confirmed to be unchanged, we should relish the opportunity to buy significantly more “on sale.”  But if our net worth has tumbled along with the share price, it may be psychologically difficult to add to the position.”

On Page [xviii] Klarman wrote: 

”Skepticism and judgment are always required.”

“Because the value of a business depends on numerous variables, it can typically be assessed only within a range.”

“In the end, the most successful value investors combine detailed business research and valuation work with endless discipline and patience, a well-considered sensitivity analysis, intellectual honesty, and years of analytical and investment experience.”
 
On Page [xx] Klarman wrote: 

”Even in the worst of markets, Graham and Dodd remained faithful to their principles, including their view that the economy and markets sometimes go through painful cycles, which must simply be endured.  They expressed confidence, in those dark days, the economy and stock market would eventually rebound: “While we were writing, we had to combat a widespread conviction that financial debacle was to be the permanent order.”

“It is always difficult to take a contrarian approach.  Even highly capable investors can wither under the relentless message from the market that they are wrong.”

On Page [xxii] Klarman wrote: 

”Of course, for those value investors who are truly long term oriented, it is a wonderful thing that many potential competitors are thrown off course by constraints that render them unable or unwilling to effectively compete.”

On Page [xxiv] Klarman wrote: 

”When bargains are scarce, value investors must be patient; compromising standards is a slippery slope to disaster.  New opportunities will emerge, even if we don’t know when or where.”

“Still value investors are bottom-up analysts, good at assessing securities one at a time based on the fundamentals.  They don’t need the entire market to be bargained priced, just 20 or 25 unrelated securities – a number sufficient for diversification of risk.  Even in an expensive market, value investors must keep analyzing securities and assessing businesses, gaining knowledge and experience that will be useful in the future.”

On Page [xxvi] Klarman wrote: 

”In a bad real estate climate, tighter lending standards can cause even healthy properties to sell at distressed prices.  Graham and Dodd’s principles – such as the stability of cash flow, sufficiency of return, and analysis of downside risk – allow us to identify real estate investments with a margin of safety in any market environment.”

On Page [xxxix] Klarman wrote: 

”In a rising market, everyone makes money and a value philosophy is unnecessary.  But because there is no certain way to predict what the market will do, one must follow a value philosophy at all times.  By controlling risk and limiting loss through extensive fundamental analysis, strict discipline, and endless patience, value investors can expect good results with limited downside.”

On Page [xl] Klarman wrote: 

”The real secret to investing is that there is no secret to investing.”
On Pages 22 and 23 there is an interesting table on Economic Data from 1911-1913, 1923-1925 and 1936-1938. 

 
On Page 57 Roger Lownestein wrote: 

”As a rule of thumb, investors should spend the bulk of their time on the disclosures of the security under study, and they should spend significant time on the reports of their competitors.  The point is not just to memorize the numbers but to understand them; as we have seen, both the balance sheet and the statement of cash flow will throw significant light on the number that Wall Street pays the most attention to, the reported earnings.”

On Page 138 Howard S. Marks wrote: 

”Importantly, Graham and Dodd highlight the importance of cash flow stability in a company’s ability to service its debts in an adverse environment. “Once it is admitted – as it always must be – that the industry can suffer some reduction in profits, then the investor is compelled to estimate the possible le extent of the shrinkage and compare it with eh surplus above the interest requirements.  He thus finds himself…vitally concerned with the ability of the company to meet the vicissitudes of the future (p. 155 2nd ed.)  This consideration contributed to the fact that, in its infancy in the mid – 1970’s, the leveraged buyout industry restricted its purchases to noncyclical companies.  Of course, like all important investment principles, this one is often ignored in bullish periods; enthusiasm and optimism gain sway and the stable –cash-flow rule can be easily forgotten.”

On Page 140 Marks reminded us of a Graham quote from page 185 of 2nd ed.: 

“During the great and disastrous development of the real estate mortgage-bond business between 1923 and 1929, the only datum customarily presented to support the usual bond offering—aside from an estimate of future earnings—was a statement of
The appraised value of the property, which almost invariably amounted to some 662/3% in excess of the mortgage issue. If these appraisals had corresponded to the market values which experienced buyers of or lenders on real estate would place upon the properties, they would have been of real utility in the selection of sound real estate bonds. But unfortunately they were purely artificial valuations, to which the appraisers were willing to attach their names for a fee, and whose only function was to deceive
the investor as to the protection which he was receiving.”

“This whole scheme of real estate financing was honeycombed with the most glaring weaknesses, and it is sad commentary on the lack of principle, penetration, and ordinary common sense on the part of all parties concerned that it was permitted to reach such gigantic proportions before the inevitable collapse.”


Here is a Graham quote from page 43 of 2nd ed.:

“Now let us consider a similar judgment based primarily upon the trend. In 1929 nearly all public-utility systems showed a continued growth of earnings, but the fixed charges of many were so heavy—by reason of pyramidal capital structures—that they consumed nearly all the net income. Investors bought bonds of these systems freely on the theory
that the small margin of safety was no drawback, since earnings were certain to continue to increase. They were thus making a clear-cut prediction as to the future, upon the correctness of which depended the justification of their investment. If their prediction were wrong—as proved to be the case—they were bound to suffer serious loss.”



Ezra Merkin (an alleged Madoff feeder) on page 288 wrote in an essay titled ""Blood and Judgment.""

""Still if Graham and Dodd's bible cannot be understood today without commentary, the attitude embodied in this work is timeless. As long as investors remain human, and thus subject to greed, fear, pressure, doubt and the entire range of human emotions, there will be money to be made by those who steel themselves to overcome emotion. As long as the human tendency to march in herds persists, there will be opportunity for contrarians who are unafraid to stand alone.""

Glenn H. Greenberg wrote on page 399 and 400,

""Accounting has always presented management with opportunities to misrepresent results.  In 1934, companies ran nonrecurring gains through the profit-and-loss statement and stretched out depreciation schedules to make earnings look better than they were.”

 ""The second challenge to rational investing is to maintain one's logical convictions in the face of excess gloom or euphoria as reflected in stock prices. I doubt many owners of private companies are preoccupied with the value of their business on a short-term basis - how different from the public markets, where a rising stock price makes us feel smart and a falling on makes us feel dumb.""

""Obviously it requires strength of character in order to think and act in opposite fashion from the crowd and also patience to wait for opportunities that may be spaced years apart.""

On Page 405 Greenberg discussed the 3 main challenges of Value Investing: 

A.	“Careful research takes time and seldom results in a clear case of taking a large position.  It is tedious to always review and seldom uncover an opportunity.”

B.	“It is difficult to maintain ones logical convictions in the face of excess gloom or euphoria as reflected in stock prices.”  He discusses something we occasionally ponder.  The concern that our analysis is incorrect as a company’s stock price gets pounded.  Greenberg writes, “Our self-doubts and fears of failure cause us to glimpse catastrophe where we once envisioned opportunity.  Graham and Dodd wrote, “Obviously it requires strength of character in order to think and to act in opposite fashion from the crowd and also patience to wait for opportunities that may be spaced years apart.”

C.	He discusses the presence of greed and how that is now exaggerated in 2008 by the proliferation of hedge funds.


On Page 406 Greenberg wrote:  

“A recurring theme of Security Analysis is the importance of gathering as much information as possible, but then making judgments, which are subject to being wildly of the mark.”  

On Page 482 Graham wrote: 

”In the absence of indications to the contrary we accept the past record as a basis for judging the future. But the analyst must be on the lookout for any such indications to the contrary. Here we must distinguish between vision or intuition on the one hand, and ordinary sound reasoning on the other. The ability to see what is coming is of inestimable value, but it cannot be expected to be part of the analyst's stock in trade.

On Page 642 Graham wrote: 

“The relaxation of investment bankers’ standards in the late 1920’s, and their use of ingenious means to enlarge their compensation, had unwholesome repercussions
in the field of corporate management. Operating officials felt themselves entitled not only to handsome salaries but also to a substantial participation in the profits of the enterprise. In this respect the investment- trust arrangements, devised by the banking houses for their own benefit, set a stimulating example to the world of “big business.”

On Page 653 Graham wrote: 

“The industrial field never offered the same romantic possibilities for high finance as were found among the rails and utilities, but it may well be that the ingenious talents of promoters and financial wizards will be directed towards the industrials in the future. The investor and the analyst should be on their guard against such new dazzlements.”

On Page 654 Graham wrote about analyzing companies using some fundamental methods.  This makes an excellent source to revisit and study.

On page 687 Graham discussed the apparent nationalization of, and then future privatization of the railroads.  This is eerily similar to me in relation to Banks as I write this in February 2009.

“In the years following 1932 a large part of the country’s railroad mileage went into the hands of trustees. At the close of 1938 a total of 111 railway companies operating 78,016 miles (31% of the total railway mileage in the United States) were in the hands of receivers or trustees. This is the greatest mileage ever in the hands of the courts at any one time. Reorganization in every case has been long delayed, owing on the one hand to the complicated capital structures to be dealt with and on the other to the uncertainty as to future normal earnings. As a result the price of a great many issues fell to extremely low levels—which would undoubtedly have presented excellent opportunities for the shrewd investor, had it not been that the earnings of the railroads as a whole continued for some years to make disappointing showings as compared with general business.”

On Page 708 Graham wrote: 

”Purchase of securities selling well below intrinsic value.  Intrinsic Value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values but also future earning power, conservatively estimated – in other words, qualitative as well as quantitative elements.  We think that since a large percentage of all issues nowadays are relatively unpopular, there must be many cases in which the market goes clearly and crassly astray, thus creating real opportunities for the discriminating student.”

I took a look over this weekend, and I think this is why.

DVA is a pretty good company--profitable, growing, etc. Good, but not too exciting. Then I read their final prospectus on their merger with HealthCare Partners. And everything made sense.

HealthCare Partners is a private medical services company, with about $400M in net earnings. They are very profitable, and growing. DVA is buying them for $5.7B, using $4.7B long term debt, $1B in new stock issue. 

As a combined company, DVA will have doubled their earnings to $800~~B~~M, while increasing their outstanding shares by 10%. Now, they are not going to report $800~~B~~M in combined earnings this year, because there is a special payout to HCP in form of $315M cash, reducing their earnings to ~$500M. So in 2012, their net earnings will go up only about 15%. Next year, they should fully realize their combined earnings.

So why didn't HCP just go IPO instead? They would be worth maybe $10B, but it may take a lot of work to realize it. Because the insiders own 70%+ of the company, it may have made more sense for them to sell. And the CEO's are friends.

So there you go. Double the earnings with little share dilution, realized in about 12 months. Arbitrage with margin of safety. Classic Warren.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,1349907288.0,,,True,t3_119gw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/119gw2/why_berkshire_bought_nysedva_an_analysis/,

I just simply looked at the numbers and compared TSLA (Tesla) with F (Ford).

According to today's stock price of $97.08 for TSLA, and $16.91 for F.

* TSLA market capitalization = $17.82B
* F market capitalization      = $66.46B    

This means that Ford is only worth 3.73 times as much as Tesla. I find that very had to believe. Especially when you dig a bit deeper and come by the stockholder equity numbers. 

* TSLA stockholder equity = $168.58M 
* F stock holder quity       = $19.22B 

Not to mention that Q2 earnings also show 

* TSLA net income = -11.25M
* F net income      = + 1.23B 

So I was wondering why when Ford has 30 times the stockholder equity of Tesla and when Ford has many times more the profits of Tesla, people have valued Ford to only be worth 3.73 times the value of Tesla. I am not trying to say that TSLA should be priced lower or that F should be priced higher, I am just trying to figure out why the prices are what they are.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_1jymeb,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1jymeb/tsla_stock_price_need_for_justification/,
1371732671.0,20,self.SecurityAnalysis,1gq2l0,Value Investing Rant/Book Recommendations?,22,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1gq2l0/value_investing_rantbook_recommendations/,"Value investing works. It's always worked and will always work (in the long run) because cash = cash. Stock prices will reflect the cash that they produce. I don't think anyone here would argue with that.

But am I the only one who's kinda sick of the value investing culture? It's like the same things -the same concepts- explained over and over and over again. I saw someone commented on the Doug Barnett video: ""There's nothing new to learn here."" Yeah, well when was the last time anyone gave a presentation on value investing where there was something new to learn? At least the Barnett video has some examples.

If you've read one or two value investing books, you've read them all. The marginal utility of reading another is pretty much zero. Of course there are books every once in a while that are different and somewhat revolutionary (Greenblatt's You Can be a Stock Market Genius comes to mind) but the vast majority are just regurgitation. When I see another book has come out, I think to myself: exactly what the world doesn't need - another value investing book. Or take the lecture series available from the Ben Graham Centre (http://www.bengrahaminvesting.ca/Resources/videos.htm). How many of these lectures say anything besides 'We buy good companies when they're out of favor blah blah blah'? I'd recommend Klarman's video but the rest are more or less useless if you're already familiar with VI.

While I'm ranting away I might as well mention what I see as a big drawback of most VI books: a lack of examples and detailed analysis of the examples. This is where Greenblatt's book excels but few others do. In my opinion, going through real world examples and real world valuations is possibly the most important part of becoming a good investor. It's the reason that youtube video of Van Den Burg's on CSCO is worth your time and Greenwald's squawking Columbia lectures probably aren't. 

Am I the only one that feels this way? At some point an investor needs to shift his focus from value investing to business in general. I wish I had shifted mine earlier- I'd be a better investor now if I had. I also think that most people should make the shift way earlier than they do. That being said, does anyone have any good book recommendations that deal with specific industries? I'd like to begin widening my circle of competence and understanding of business. Not my understanding of value investing.

I've read Graham. I've read Lynch. I read the Fool weekly. I read countless posts and essays and god knows what.

And I *still* don't know how to do this.

I know I need to start ""evaluating companies"". But I still don't understand where to start? What data to choose? Which filters to set on stock screeners?

1. Just to be clear, I don't mean *literally* everything, but a lot.
1. I think it all really boils down to the simple question: out of the, say, 3,000 or so stocks that are available on a random screener after basic filtering - how do I choose my first 10? my first 5? my first **1**?

As a refresher, each competitor manages a $100,000 portfolio and their performance is judged after three years. This simulation is meant to be deliberate practice, so invest as you would in real life. Although simulations are imperfect and there is no substitute to investing with real money, this will be a starting point in investing for many and a growth point for others that want to try new techniques.

41 people have registered for this competition, but only 23 people made trades. The current leader is still itsmedog with a 28% gain YTD. He was ahead about the same in the last update.  Most of his profits have come from positions in AAPL, AAPL call options, OCLR, PRXI, and BREW. While I am no longer almost in last, I'm still below average.  I have not sold any of my positions since the last update and only initiated one Merger Arb position.  SVU is currently down 14% and is still the biggest dog in my portfolio. I pursued a very concentrated strategy for the simulation and I'm interested in seeing how this turns out.

Only 4 of 23 people that made trades (itsmedog, nmelluzzo, Drited, and egoodwin) are currently beating the S&amp;P500's return YTD of 9.26%. I expect this trend to continue as most active managers don't beat broad based indexes.

For those interested in joining this simulation, you can [sign up for the competition using this link](http://simulator.investopedia.com/Game/ListGames.aspx?type=Search&amp;item=SecurityAnalysis%202015&amp;sc=1&amp;scur=USD##axzz1zUyfE4xY) after you sign up for Investopedia.

It's been around for decades. It has fat margins on its products, and the overall market has been growing for more than 10 years.

Except this company's stock price crashed around may.

So what happened? The senior executives of NexGen, which is the most profitable and fastest growing division, left the company. One of the board members made a stink about it, and tried a proxy fight. In fact, he's tried several proxy fights over the years. Then he sold half of his stake in his company, which was more than 10% of the outstanding stock. He claims his broker did this without his knowledge. His opponents on the board says he had his shares in a margin account which forced a sale when the stock price declined. Whatever the reason, when someone holding 20% of the company sells half, stock prices usually go down.

Why I think QSII has potential:
Despite the board muckety muck, the business is still sound. Perhaps the executives who left were really talented and irreplaceable. But considering their competitors grew just as well tells me that management talent isn't the only (or primary) factor in their growth. Even without growth, their existing revenue stream will continue, because it's hard for hospitals to switch to a competitor's system. 

I think eventually QSII's stock price will recover. They are still growing, and generating a lot of cash. If they stop growing, then they become a very juicy buyout target, because of their low price (their competitors are trading like 30x earnings), and because of the existing customer base.

thanks for all of the input on my last thread, it was really helpful. In this one, I would like your input on metrics for screening for good undervalued equities (that are, preferably also applicable to non-US markets). So far I have found that:
# 1. EV / EBITDA. (EV=Market Cap - Cash - Marketable Securities + Interest paying debt)
# 2. Price per Share / Book Value per Share
# 3. EBIAT/(Market Value of Debt+Market Value of Equity-Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents) [from Sonkin]

Any input on whether these methods make sense to you, and of course any additional screening tests would be very much appreciated.

1359326333.0,14,self.SecurityAnalysis,17e43v,Let's shatter some widely held notions in investing as it is normally taught.,21,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/17e43v/lets_shatter_some_widely_held_notions_in/,"This is a bit of a philosophical post as I would like it to be based mainly on pure reflection and logical inference rather than statistics and data. Of course relying on statistics will improve your decisions, but by, firstly, applying some pure thought, we can greatly improve our results and ignore a good deal of pervasive nonsense. 

What I'd like to do here is to do away with commonly held notions that, unfortunately, to this day, are taught in business schools and widely spread in investing newspapers, blogs, analysis, etc.

--------

I think a very powerful idea in investing is the use of heuristics:

By using certain heuristics you can completely wipe out entire categories of errors. As an example, let's say ""technical analysis"" works in some instances. If we act *as if* technical analysis doesn't work at all, our overall results will be better over time simply by wiping out the multiple errors that we can make by using it.

To start with, I want to tackle a concept that *almost* seems to make sense: the **target price**, defined as ""A projected price level as stated by an investment analyst or advisor"".

If I were to model the price of a stock I think I couldn't even use a statistical variable following a probability distribution, much less a specific price, so why hold on to this concept?

The way I value a stock is not by a specific number (although this is how it is trade in the stock market), and not even by a statistical distribution, but maybe by using a small set of rules. 

As an example, let's take business 'A'. Let's say that in 10 years from now the nature of the business will remain largely the same, it will retain pricing power, it won't need large amounts of capital expenditure, it can expand to such and such countries, it has this kind of economics, etc... and it sells at 10 times earnings. Using a historical 15 times earnings in the US as a yardstick (admitedly belonging to a a bygone era of higher returns) this is probably a great investment. Thus we can decide to allocate a big portion of our portfolio on it. The key thing is to realise that this kind of situation not only happens frequently enough to guarantee a good investment record on the long run, but that you probably **can't** be any more accurate than this.

As well as ""target price"" another notion of very little usefulness is calculating the **DCF** value. 

Thus a very powerful heuristic in investing would be to altogether **avoid** attempting to calculate DFC valuation for a more robust track record over time.

Simple enough, but maybe not easy. 

What are your thoughts / techniques on fighting our simplistic hunter-gatherer, jump-to-conclussions, brain?


EDIT: in the interest of full disclosure... I must admit I cheated a little. Although I had this kind of thoughts for a while I didn't become completely convinced until I could read the same from Charlie Munger, Joel Greenblatt or Warren Buffett among others. It's hard to believe that some vastly widespread ideas simply don't make sense.

1350415453.0,13,self.SecurityAnalysis,11l2xi,Here's my value based idea. Aircastle Ltd (AYR),14,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/11l2xi/heres_my_value_based_idea_aircastle_ltd_ayr/,"Aircastle acquires, leases and sell high-utility passenger and cargo jets. As of Dec 31, 2011, their portfolio consisted of 144 jets leased to 65 lessees. 

Aircastle, and its peers, have been beaten down since the financial crisis as the market has lumped them in with the broader set of financial stocks. Aircastle traded at 1.5 – 2.0x book value and 15 – 20x earnings pre-financial crisis. Currently, it trades at 0.7x book value and 7.5x earnings. 

Based on the stated financial statements, Aircastle has a tangible book value per share of ~$16.50. However, the replacement value of the aircraft fleet is actually above the book value. Better yet, management has shown they are willing to opportunistically divest these jets in order to create value (the gain on sale of these assets proves that replacement value is greater than book value). To remain extremely conservative (as promised), I assume they could divest their fleet at a 10% discount and still, tangible book value per share comes to $13.40. This gives a margin of safety of 15%. 

Earnings power for Aircastle is strong (and resilient) – liquidation value of the portfolio only provides a price floor. 

The market has (unfairly) beaten up aircraft leasing companies post-financial crisis, as these stocks have been lumped in with the broader set of financial companies. They are definitely out-of-favor, as demonstrated by the number of downgrades and sell ratings by sell-side analysts. Contrary to this sentiment, Aircastle has shown resilience during the economic down-turn. Since 2006,Aircastle has grown operating cash flow from $135m to $359m. Although one might argue that this is because management has expanded the balance sheet over this period (through debt financing), I will add that management has maintained an ROE of ~9% and grown ROIC from 5% to 9%. 

Earnings, adjusted for one-time items, have averaged ~$100m since 2006, including ~$200m of D&amp;A expenses. Adjusting these earnings for D&amp;A and subtracting a conservative maintenance capex of $100m (double the average maintenance capex as % of PPE since 2006) gives us levered free cash flow of $200m. This gives us an equity value per share of $17 – 27 per share, assuming a cost of equity of 10 – 16%. 

Earnings power of this company gives us a margin of safety of 50 – 140%, depending on the cost of equity assumptions (I’d like to make clear this assumes a conservative zero growth rate).

These earnings have not been impaired and are unlikely to be in the future. Barriers to entry include several billion dollars of financing and a relationship with an aircraft manufacturer in order to assemble a fleet of jets. Although there is tough competition in this industry, Aircastle has been able to successfully compete against existing competition for several years, and threat of new competition is low.

Catalyst: Aircastle can continue to grow its dividend which is yielding 5%. In the next 3 to 5 years, the aircraft leasing industry will continue to outperform analyst estimates and will return to favour. All the while, any improvements to the global economy will be positive for this stock. Finally, management could liquidate the portfolio and payout investors.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_11l2xi,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/11l2xi/heres_my_value_based_idea_aircastle_ltd_ayr/,
1348329297.0,12,self.SecurityAnalysis,10atyy,Business Analysts: Come explain the source of a *durable* competitive advantage you've found. (GEICO explained),15,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10atyy/business_analysts_come_explain_the_source_of_a/,"I look for a great business first - ideally, a monopoly. I worry about purchasing an investment later, and only do it when it's obviously cheap, because I'm not smart enough to do a DCF or utilize common tools. I drop my IQ 20 points when investing.

I'll explain GEICO. It is often said that GEICO is a low cost provider, which makes it a great insurer. This is true, but *no one* discusses *why* they are a low cost provider. As it turns out, about 20% of our insurance costs are used to pay for agent compensation. GEICO eliminated this 20% and passes the savings onto the consumer.

**Why is this durable?** Because most other personal lines insurers were built around proprietary distribution, through exclusive/captive agents that can only primarily sell their own company's products, any competitive response was limited. Let's imagine an insurer who is bringing in $2B of premium every year from exclusive agents. If they want to launch a direct to consumer business, their exclusive agents will be angered and before the direct business can be launched, their agents will complain and threaten to stop bringing in premium. Because of this very reason, any change for the incumbents was very limited, and gives GEICO not only a competitive advantage, but a *durable* one that has last since 1937 and still allows them to pump out combined ratios as low as 88 just a few years ago on a simple product - standard auto.

I want to hear what others have to say about an industry they follow. Specifically, I'd LOVE to hear someone explain the auto sales industry and why Carmax is putting out great margins. **I am not looking for valuations... just sources of competitive advantage**",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_10atyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10atyy/business_analysts_come_explain_the_source_of_a/,

In this competition, each competitor manages a $100,000 portfolio and their performance is judged after three years.  I decided to host this competition after seeing many week, month, or quartely long stock pick and investment games on Reddit.  That time period is much too short to get real insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your investment philosophy.

Our game begins January 2nd, 2012 and ends January 2nd, 2015.  This simulation is meant to be deliberate practice, so invest as you would in real life.  Although simulations are imperfect and there is no substitute to investing with real money, this will be a starting point in investing for many and a growth point for others that want to try new techniques.

To join the game you must [sign up for Investopedia](http://accounts.investopedia.com/signupmember.aspx?site=simulator&amp;RegLink=Simulator_Header#axzz1gVrtke9C).  Afterwards, you can [click this link to join the game](http://simulator.investopedia.com/Home.aspx#axzz1gVrqQBNt).  The game can also be joined manually using the game name and password information below.

Game Name: **SecurityAnalysis 2015**
Password: **BerenWasFirst**

I hope to see many of you join the competition.  Good Luck Investing!

No charts because I'm on my phone, but I can follow up later if this sparks discussion.

I believe one of the greatest problems the current generation will face is the rising demand for energy for the world's population. Not only is the world population growing exponentially, but energy demand per capita is growing  exponentially. There is a lot of money to be made by servicing this demand worldwide.

I also believe, but with less conviction, that we have passed peak oil. *Whichever of the oil companies and drillers that can maintain output with new, long lasting sources should provide outsized gains over the next 10-20 years.*

Alternative energy will be the way this energy demand is fulfilled in the long term. The catch is, this is NOT because alternative energy is ready for the big show now, but because  there is no way to meet future demand with declining fossil fuel finds. I personally believe Solar has the best chance of achieving the cost and efficiency structure to deliver on these needs. However, the current state of solar is bleak, and *the big winner will be the company that can deliver costs low enough to not require government subsidy, while improving efficiency such that the costs can compete with fossil fuel energy sources*. This will become easier over time as energy becomes more expensive for everyone.

The way I am proposing to play this climate:

Oil stocks are still cheap in a P/E sense. The winner in my mind will be the company with the most stable backlog of oil sources to drill, and with the most cost-effective supply chains to bring that oil to market. Especially to the oil-hungry BRICs. Can anyone make this case for an oil stock today?

Solar stocks are all going at low valuations. The catch is, these crap valuations are deserved for most of the at best, all of them at worst. Can anyone make the 10+ year case for any solar stock?

Programming Note: I'd love for this to produce a lively discussion, as this subreddit seems to have a lot of value investing minds, but not a lot of discussion. If this is successful, I'll  work on more of these.

It should go unsaid that the adoption of these big ideas (namely the methods of problem solving attributable to the different disciplines) can help all of us become more dynamic thinkers--and by extension, investors. With that said, I've always loved reading history and this seems as good of a discipline as any to diversify our default Graham-derived reading list (and subsequently Graham-derived model of thinking) in the sidebar. I would love to know what history books you guys have on your bookshelves. It doesn't need to be obscure or unique, I think many of the best selling classics are popular for good reasons and would be more the worthwhile to mention here.

The long term ramifications of this are relevant to classical value investment since this is internally consistent with a market-wide shift to capital allocation in proprietary developments. I understand that one of the first assumptions of value investing contradicts large-scale market mechanics but:    
    
Specific technology (and biotechnology) companies are producing inherently ""valuable"" services (genomics, personalized healthcare) that are based heavily in data analysis and algorithm development.     
    

I've been evaluating tech companies based on the profitability of their consumer service and the growth rate of the company (along with other basic Graham principles ie book value, dividend payout)...I'm reaching a conclusion that these companies are incredibly over-valued. Even mature companies. Ultimately, assessing the health of the companies' operational activities isn't enough--I have to dive into the core of the technology that they're developing and really beg for information that companies are not exactly willing to reveal. It makes screening for companies more difficult, but what is even more troublesome is that my technical approach in stock selection is changing and digressing from the standards of a defensive investor as outlined by Graham. Although, philosophically I'm operating by traditional, albeit abstracted principles--I'm railing against his quantitative tactics.       
    
Of course the observations I've made may be a result of confirmation bias, and/or selective evidence since my approach is inductive vs. empirical but I think I need some personal guidance/input to check myself.

So over the past few months I've been teaching myself about value investing and trying to learn as much as possible. I had a question about what level of quantitative analysis you guys use in picking your investments. Do you guys mainly look at a company's financial statements and interpret its value by assessing assets, liabilities, expenses revenue etc to gain an insight into whether  a company is undervalued and its likely future performance? (obviously coupled with other forms of qualitative fundamental analysis) Or do you take it further and actually develop a DCF model and actually determine a specific price for a company's stock?

http://rbcpa.com/companies/NWLI_Notes.pdf

This is not a solicitation of any sort.  This is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NWLI.  This post is intended merely as a sharing of information which I have collected.

March 19, 2013 (187.00) Updated Thesis

National Western Life Insurance Company is a life insurance and annuity company. They sell their products both domestically and internationally. Most of their annuities are sold domestically, and are typically equity indexed based annuities. In 2012, 37% of their life insurance premiums were domestic, 23% in 2011 ( I previously reported this as 32%) and 19% in 2010. National Western Life Insurance Company has been around since 1956. Their investment portfolio is reported to be of primarily investment quality bonds and matched to their insurance and annuity policies future commitments. Robert Moody owns 34% of Class A, and nearly 100% of Class B. 

Price to Book Value as of March 19, 2013 (price of $187.00) is ~49%. The balance sheet as reported, remains strong and secure, as it has since 1956. AM Best has reaffirmed NWLI’s ‘A’ rating on May 26, 2011. I like the apparent conservatism of the company, and that is the primarily reason for our owning National Western Life.

I think book value is the most important metric in valuing NWLI. Book Value at December 31, 2012 was reported at $382.88 per share, up from $351.27 at December 31, 2011. If NWLI was to trade at 70% of book value reported as of March 19, 2013, the price would be ~$268 per share. Book value has grown consistently since 1991. Book Value has grown in a fairly consistent manner, at an annualized rate of 9.61% since 1991. My preference is a strong balance sheet, even if the sacrifice is some ROIC.

I think NWLI should trade at at least 55% of book value (probably closer to 65% or 70 %+). You can impute a growth rate of book value of say 5%. Currently book is $382.88. If one was to adjust to 55% of reported book value, the share price would become $210.58.

I do not see great portfolio risk for the long term holder of NWLI. Yet, I could be wrong. When one is buying at less than 50% of book value I think they have a lot of cushion built in. This cushion leaves room for potential balance sheet impairment of certain assets. Yet, NWLI was trading at less than 40% of book value a year ago.

Robert Moody (77) owns 34% of the company. As stated in the 2011 DEF 14A he is “Chairman of the Board &amp; Chief Executive Officer from 1963-1968, 1971-1980, and 1981-Present; Chief Executive Officer of American National Insurance Company since 1991 and Chairman of the Board since 1982; Director of American National Insurance Company since 1960; Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Moody National Bank (banking services); and Trustee of The Moody Foundation (charitable and educational foundation) since 1955. Mr. Moody’s tenure as Chief Executive Officer affords him extensive insight into the Company’s operations and qualifies him to serve as Chairman of our Board of Directors.”

Ross Moody (50) is the son of Robert Moody. He has been President and COO since 1992.

Management has depth in the industry and longevity with the company. I think the long term growth of the company both operationally; balance sheet, earnings quality, and earnings retention has been exceptional. Moody's appear to be focused on good business, strength of balance sheet, and perhaps not caring of the stock price. I am cool with that. I am patient, and don't mind waiting.

I think Moody, father and son, major holders of NWLI, will continue to make sure the balance sheet remains strong. To me this is evident via AM Bests rating of the company, as well as an upgrade right after the credit crisis, during a time when most companies were being downgraded for risk. 

There is a small amount of Level 3 assets on their balance sheet. Hence, the presentation to the shareholder gives greater assurances that the balance sheet is liquid and stable. 

Total Investments on December 31, 2012 were $9,101,169. $5,962,120 of their total investments of $9,101,169 is reported at amortized cost. Likewise, $2,826,001 of their total investments is reported at fair value. If amortized assets were reported at fair value, total assets would increase by $284,018. This would add $78.13 to the book value of $382.88, totaling $461.01. To put this into perspective, the current market capitalization of the company is ~$680M. Hence, when adjusting book value to Net Fair Value, the price to Net Fair Value would be 40.56% ($187/$461.01).

I have discussed our goal with management considering a stock buy back of some type. Management commented on this in the 2011 10-K and in their annual report. The following were our thoughts on management discussing in the 2011 Annual Report, there will be no impending buy back of common stock by the company. The 2012 Annual Report has not been issued as of this writing.

“In regards to stock buy-back, I still can’t fathom how this can be ignored by the company. I realize they are mentioning it and pondering it, yet at 36 cents on the dollar, it seems as though NWLI has no reason not to announce a buyback, or tender shares, or allocate some type of resources to this cause. It almost seems ignoring it by the company is a lack of fiduciary responsibility to minority shareholders. Of course this is based on the premise that operationally and financially there are no issues or skeletons in the closet at National Western Life. I understand the history and the goal of the continuity of a fortress balance sheet, as well as continued positive ratings by AM Best and Standard and Poor’s. I can’t imagine that an announcement as to buy back shares continually for say less than 50 cents on the dollar would negatively affect the company’s ratings. I think if the company announced the purchase, offer or intent for say 300,000 shares, several things could happen. The company would be buying at a bargain, and at worst, they would be unsuccessful in shares purchased, as the share price might increase too much for the buyout to have occurred.” Ronald Redfield 5/25/12 

""The Company relies on stockholders' equity for its capital resources as there is no long-term debt outstanding and the Company does not anticipate the need for any long-term debt in the near future. As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had no commitments beyond its normal operating and investment activities. The Company has declared and paid an annual dividend on its common shares since 2005 although its practice remains to substantially reinvest earnings internally to finance the development of new business. Despite the fact the Company's market price of its Class A common shares has been trading at a substantial discount to the book value for several years, there are no imminent plans for the Company to repurchase its shares as the Board of Directors has adopted a strategic policy of building a strong capital base to maintain high financial strength ratings and the ability to take competitive advantages as they arise. The capacity to pay dividends is limited by law in the state of Colorado to earned profits (statutory unassigned surplus). At December 31, 2011 , the maximum amount legally available for distribution without further regulatory approval is $91.9 million."" NWLI 2011, Form 10-K

Risks:
 1.
Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) - are $858M, or 62% of Shareholder’s Equity. Management claims that DAC’s are being reported conservatively by the company. DAC as a % of Stockholder’s Equity has been consistent for many years. The current levels of DAC as a % of Stockholders Equity is near or at its lowest levels since 1992. I do not have data prior to that.

 2.
Fraud - I think this is a standard risk with any financial company. There are related party situations such as Moody National Bank and American National Insurance

 3.
Brazil - “On October 26, 2011 the Brazilian Superintendence of Private Insurance (“SUSEP”) attempted to serve the Company with a subpoena regarding an administrative proceeding initiated by SUSEP in which it alleged that the Company was operating as an insurance company in Brazil without due authorization. The Company has been informed that SUSEP is attempting to impose a penal fine of approximately $6 billion on the Company. SUSEP has unsuccessfully attempted to serve the Company with notice regarding this matter. The Company does not transact business in Brazil and has no officers, employees, property, or assets in Brazil. The Company and its legal advisors believe that SUSEP has no jurisdiction over the Company, that SUSEP's attempts at service of process have been invalid, and that any penal fine would be unenforceable. For the reasons described above, the Company does not believe that this matter meets the definition of a material pending legal proceeding as such term is defined in Item 103 of Regulation S-K but has included the foregoing description solely due to the purported amount of the fine sought.

 
Although there can be no assurances, at the present time, the Company does not anticipate that the ultimate liability arising from such other potential, pending, or threatened legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operating results of the Company.

Catalysts:
 1.
An activist investor in theory could start rattling the cage of the company. 

2.
An alleged goal of Robert Moody is that he would like NWLI to be as large as American National Insurance (Moody is Chairman and CEO). American National Insurance has Stockholder’s Equity of $3.7B as of December 31, 2011.

 3.
Greater understanding of the company by the investment community, could compress the discount to book value to a more normalized level for a company with the financial strength that National Western Life has.

1357481712.0,9,self.SecurityAnalysis,162759,What type of value investor are you?,11,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/162759/what_type_of_value_investor_are_you/,"I was interested in taking an informal poll of this sub to find out what kind of value investor the overall readership considers himself/herself.  Using [Professor Damodaran's definitions](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/value-investing-identity-crisis.html), would you consider yourself:

a. [Passive value investor](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/passive-value-investing-screening-for.html): The oldest strand of value investing traces its lineage back to Ben Graham and his use of screens to find cheap stocks. Reviewing those screens, which combine market and accounting data, from Graham's book on security analysis, you are looking at stocks that trade at low multiples of earnings, pay a high proportion of these earnings as dividends and have a high proportion of assets that can be liquidated for close to their book value. In the years since, investors have added other screens (good management, stable earnings, strong competitive advantages etc.) that are all designed to reduce the potential for downside on the investment.

b. [Contrarian value investor](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/contrarian-investing-going-against-flow.html): In contrarian value investing, you adopt a different tack. You look for companies whose stock prices have collapsed for one reason on another. In its least sophisticated variant, you just buy the biggest losers (at least in terms of stock price), on the assumption that markets generally over react and that the portfolio of these losers will bounce back over time. In its more refined forms, you add other criteria to the mix. Thus, you may buy stocks that have gone down but only if they have a strong brand name and/or little debt.

c. [Activist value investor](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2012/06/activist-value-investing-be-your-own.html): In activist value investing, you focus on poorly performing companies and look at the value of its assets in place, with better management in place. You then try to change the way the company is run by either acquiring control of the firm or putting pressure on existing management. Activist investing requires far more resources than either passive or contrarian value investing.

Target Price: $7.18
Recent Price: $5.60
Potential Gain: 28%

TCC is a technology company that operates in the highly competitive market for communications security devices. Government contracts make up the majority of their revenue and with the Afghan war drawing down and defense spending cuts possibly around the corner, this revenue will be gone. Because of this, low trading volume, and their highly unpredictable earnings, the stock has been severely beaten down.

The company currently has $4.83/sh in cash and marketable securities on their balance sheet with no debt. They also have $1.50/sh in inventory. When a 25% discount is assumed for writedowns, this comes out to $1.13/sh.

Cash/Securities: $4.83
Inventory (75%): $1.13
Conservative Target: $5.96

This is assuming future earnings are worth nothing and future losses won’t burn through cash. Over the past two years, the company has been increasing their spending on R&amp;D, marketing, and sales. If the company can capture just a small piece of the growing market for communications security in both the corporate and government worlds, then the value of their future earnings will spike dramatically. Over the last 8 years, if their best year is removed, the company has averaged an eps of $0.47. If a 20% discount rate is applied, the value of this earning stream continuing is roughly $2.35.

Cash/Securities: $4.83
Discounted Earnings: $2.35
Target Price: $7.18

I feel there is a significant margin of safety to a buyer at any price below $5.80 with the possibility of asymmetric returns if the company can secure any meaningful future contracts. If the illiquidity of the stock hinders the realization of value, management has been proven to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends. Insiders own 21% of the company.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_11eopj,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/11eopj/microcap_idea_tcco/,

Can anybody please clear this up? thx",12,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/lytrj/graham_and_dodd_security_analysis_question_from/,"Graham and Dodd's nomenclature, to my mind at least can be somewhat confusing. the pertinent passage in security analysis, 6th edition, bottom of pg 63 and going on to pg 64 is as below:


""A third kind of analytical conclusion may be illustrated by a comparison of Interborough Rapid Transit Company First and Refunding 5s with the same company’s Collateral 7% Notes, when both issues were selling at the same price (say 62) in 1933. The 7% notes were clearly worth considerably more than the 5s. Each $1,000 note was secured by deposit of $1,736 face amount of 5s; the principal of the notes had matured; they were entitled either to be paid off in full or to a sale of the collateral for their benefit. The annual interest received on the collateral was equal to about $87 on each 7% note (which amount was actually being distributed to the note holders), so that the current income on the 7s was considerably greater than that on the 5s. Whatever technicalities might be invoked to prevent the note holders from asserting their contractual rights promptly and completely, it was difficult to imagine conditions under which the 7s would not be intrinsically worth considerably
more than the 5s.


In short I don't understand the passage.


What does this mean:

* ""Each $1,000 note was secured by deposit of $1,736 face amount of 5s"" (does it mean that the collateral for each note was the face value of the 5 s??? i.e. if there was a default on the note, the noteholders would receive the 5s face value immediately??)

* ""the principal of the notes had matured; they were entitled either to be paid off in full or to a sale of the collateral for their benefit"" (ok so the note holders have a choice: either get the $1000 that they put down initially, or they can elect to receive the collateral instead? or rather, do they receive the money from the sale of the collateral?)

* if the collateral were sold, they would receive the present value of the 5s, which is the present value of $1,736??

* what does ""5 s"" mean?

Am I understanding this correctly? thx for your help.

Excerpt:
""In an empirical study of Graham-styled defensive investor portfolios, Dr. Henry R. Oppenheimer of Purdue University simulated the purchase-sell activities of a defensive investor over the period of 20 years. He created and maintained four distinct portfolios of 60 securities each in an identical manner. The relevant financial figures were compared annually until 60 securities were selected that met all of Graham’s criteria. In comparison with performance against corporate investors, and typical investors, the aggregate results of his study indicated that in the 20 year period, significant excess returns were available to the Graham investor. The average yearly return was 13.6%, less than 17% of the securities had an average annual return that was negative, and over 31% of the securities at least doubled in value during their holding period. He concluded that “during the 1954-1976 period Graham’s advice to the defensive investor was clearly useful from a profitability perspective”.

[Here's a link to Oppenheimer's publication on my Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B_TIE18SejF4ZGQxYmFkOGQtMTAwZi00NjEwLWE1NjQtNmYzZDc5MjQzMWMx&amp;hl=en_US).

I'm new to Value Investing and I'm looking to purchase INTC and would like to hear someone else's opinion. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/WHzCE.png) is the historical EPS/PE/Dividends information for the last ~16 years with estimates for the next few years from Value Line. From '03 to '09 their PE was on average 20 and right now it's closer to 10.5. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8BG4X.png) is the daily technical analysis, it shows that we're right in the middle of the Bollinger band and the force index &amp; RSI look even, meaning it's not over/under it's EMA by much.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/xKWZp.png) are my calculations on EPS growth as a function of time and expected return for each case assuming a future PE value of 12 (the picture is much better obviously if you believe that it'll get back to the ~20 that it's been for the last 6-7 years.)

So, judging by the low PE, good EPS growth, strong financials, and good outlook for them for the next 2-3 years I think it's a good investment. So, what does someone else think?

Thanks!

I got the idea after reading [FundamentalHedgie's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1cmofr/harvard_business_review_the_making_of_an_expert/) article on the making of an expert and criticizing the [Hertz](http://sumzero.com/sp/htz-psquare) valuation.

I'm particularly interested in the modeling and though it would be fun to make it difficult. Something along the lines of finding a non-developed market company which could be a potential M&amp;A target and finding an acquirer from another county. That way there'd be a mix of corporate finance and valuation.

I'm not set on this scenario though. So, any ideas for an interesting case?

While operating at a loss, it's revenues are growing steadily, has a managable amout of debt and a P/S ratio of 0.1.

So I decided to do some due diligence and check out what it's up to. It's a medical company, with distributors in many countries. Main source of revenue is it's dietary supplements. I have no medical or biological expertise whatsoever, but I do have a sizable amout of general scepticism. And as I was reading the product descriptions featuring intelligent molecules that apply natural intelligence, my alarms went off. It sounds pretty bad, but I write it off as marketing BS, and start to look up some published papers on the active ingredients. It seems their medical applications are not well researched, but I did find a few independent studies claiming health benefits (in pigs). Also found non-medical papers investigating chemical properties. I can imagine someone heavily dosed with psychedelics could translate these properties into a blurb about the natural intelligence of molecules.

So, as it stands, I do think their claims of benefits may have some basis, but I did not find enough research on health effects to regard it as confirmed. Also, the papers I read did not cover side effects. Unlike some forums i found, where consumers complained about them. They also complained about water fluoridation, chemtrails and vaccinations, so there's that.

Conclusion:
Company sells some dubious products. Main target demographic are the crazy people around the world. I personally would advise anyone to stay away from the products until further research. But as there is a healthy supply of people who are suspicious of the drinking water but would take double doses of some pills with magical molecules, revenues soar. Still, it feels wrong. Maybe similar to investing in tobacco companies, just worse, as I believe tobacco consumers are aware of the effects of smoking, and they choose to indulge in their habit. I would have no qualms about investing in a tobacco company.

My dilemma is: I wish noone would buy anything from this company. I also understand that there are people aching for products like these. Would you consider buying in such a situation?

&gt;Did you short FB? 

&gt;Why isn't AAPL worth $1 trillion?

&gt;Did anyone catch the bottom for NFLX? 

But what I don't understand is how can one hope to succeed, time-after-time, when there are bigger, better, smarter, more experienced participants competing with you for the same piece of the pie.

I'm referring to ***ALL*** large cap stocks and most mid cap stocks. It's important to realize that your stock is being scrutinized, covered, analyzed, thought upon and dissected around the clock - by hedge-funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foreign investors - who are likely to be more informed than you. **The notion that an individual investor can inject himself inside of an often crowded frenzy and still hope to come out unharmed, and even expect generating alpha just boggles my mind.**

To someone with even the most basic tenets of common sense, it should be obvious that in order to improve your chances of winning, you have to take a road that few are willing to take. You have to play where few others want to play. I'm referring to micro-caps and small-caps. Most retail individual investors I see don't have millions to play with, or are stuck with large-caps. Yet they are dying to invest (and by invest, I mean compete) in the facebook or apple that are worth billions.

By focusing your attention on micro caps and small caps, you are *de facto* eliminating the most aggressive competitors there are in this market. You know - the ones that have been successfully playing in the market for a long time, have research teams, insider information, millions to play with, etc and that are avoiding small caps purposely because they have a much bigger fish to fry than compete for a stock that's too small to be worth their time.

An important principle of attempting to participate in any competitive endeavor is to, first and foremost, understand your competition.

Here's is my theoretical reasoning behind my valuation model:
1. Remove ""poor-quality"" cash flows from Cash from operations. This includes things like:  
-increases in AP  
-decreases in AR  
-deferred taxes/tax benefits  
-asset sales not in the regular course of business  
-stock based comp  
-decrease in ADA (allowance for doubtful accts)
-unexplained cash generated from changes in long-term assets
  
Once these ""high-quality"" Cash from operations are selected, remove taxes/interest payments for a final cash flow figure. Find the per-share value of this figure, and find its present value using a conservative (I use 2%) growth rate. 
  
Additionally, adjust the balance sheet by evaluating whether some portion of equity is really debt, whether assets are being valued fairly, and adding any off-balance sheet items. Finally, segregate the equity portion of this adjusted B/S and find the per-share value of equity.
  
Then take the Present value of cash flows per share and add it to the adjusted equity value per share to come up with a Price per share.  
  
Does this sound reasonable? Please shoot as many holes in my methodology as possible!
  
P.S. The hardest part I am finding is during the balance-sheet analysis, is how to properly value intangible assets. I usually wind up simply discounting the book value by 25-30% and calling it a day, but that seems unreasonable.

It was full of terrible logic on my part as I was falling into that speculation trap that Value Investing (and I) view as so detrimental.  With help from some of you I now realize that, despite my best attempt at making the reason I ""sold early"" a good decision, it was ultimately based in the emotions value investors strive to eliminate.  

It is a decision that has already shown in my return (I missed out on 12% worth of gains), and by re-entering at a higher price (my fair value is still much higher than what it is currently at) I have limited my upside (re-entering with original capital + gains allowed me fewer shares than originally invested) It also decreased my margin of safety by a substantial amount.  

While I hold that the initial pick has been/will be a good pick on my part, what I did with it after that was completely counter-productive.  A good lesson to learn early on and in the grand scheme of things, for not too much money.

I just want to thank those who posted to help me see the wrong in my decision.

The concept of ""Value investing"" struck a chord with me immediately when I first learned what the concept actually MEANT (which was by stumbling upon this subreddit).  Upon this ""revelation"" I shifted my focus from trying to learn about the options market and other speculative trading, to focus solely on the value investing strategy.  I have no finance background, but have been trying to learn basics from sites like khanacademy.org (Finance and Valuation &amp; Investing Topics are amazing, as are all of his videos).  I have copies of ""Security Analysis"" (2nd Edition), as well as ""The Intelligent Investor"", and Klarman's ""Margin of Safety"".  I have started reading The Intelligent Investor as it is my assuption that it is more of the Layman's overvue of Value Investing, whereas Security Analysis will get into the nuts and bolts behind the strategy (?).  I plan to follow that with ""Margin of Safety"".  

*I apologize for the long setup* 
Here are my questions.

1.  Is this an appropriate path to learning the actual means and methods of value investing?
2.  What changes if any would you make to my informal studying path?
3.  If no changes, where would I go from there?

I am really interested in actively evaluating companies in my spare time, and I understand that it will include the unsexy work of digging through mounds of financials trying to find that dollar bill that I can buy for 40 cents.

So Air Lease Corporation is a company that buys commercial aircraft and then leases them to companies around the globe. They went IPO in 2010 and have had positive and quickly growing earnings in 2011 and 2012. Additionally, they just started paying a small dividend.

Right now they are currently priced at about 20 P/E. Their EPS growth rate has been very good with their most recent quarter growing at 46% YoY. The top line has grown fairly quickly as well and they have been able to maintain their margins while at it. I think a P/E of 20 is undervalued at the rate they are growing and would be comfortable paying that multiple for only about a 20% YoY growth. 

Additionally, their founder and CEO is one of the pioneers of the airline leasing industry and they poached much of the executive talent from AIG's wing of airline leasing when they started AL. I have also noticed them placing quite a few aircraft in the 2nd and now start of the 3rd quarter.

I've read their most recent 10-K and it appears their management is doing a good job balancing expansion while not getting overleveraged.

So I have decided to write my own analysis software (I'm a retired developer) for my own use, however not necessarily exclusively.

The problem I am having is that I would like to see listed companies financials (quarterly preferably; also dividends, dates etc would be nice as well) but am having trouble locating a suitable data source. Surely this must exist somewhere.

What irks me is that it is available via the publicly filed documents - I just can't find a nice machine readable data structure anywhere.

I've been delving deeper into value investing and after reading Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman, I'm seeing that it takes quite a bit of analysis on my part. This has led to me doing some comprehensive calculations but I've got no clue if these are even accurate in the slightest. I'm hoping some more knowledgeable people in here can shed some light or offer input. 

**Liquidation Analysis**

* For this valuation, which is mentioned in Klarman's book, I take the total assets and subtract intangible assets and goodwill to arrive at a liquidation value. I then divide by the number of shares outstanding.
* Does anyone else use a different variation?

**NPV**

* I use a series of cash flows and a discount rate. However, what do people use as cash flows? 
* I currently use FCFE or FCFF depending on the company and then I use a growth rate specific to whether its FCFF or FCFE for each subsequent cash flow period. I found this all on [Damodaran's pages](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/). The discount rate I simply put multiple percentages from 10-15%.
* Are there other ways to arrive at cash flows? Should I be using WACC for the discount rate? What do you do?

**DCF**

* I have seen so many ways of arriving at a DCF valuation that I haven't even began trying to use DCF analysis yet. 2-stage, 3-stage, FCFE, FCFF, etc. I'm not entirely sure how this is different from NPV so maybe someone can clear that up for me.
* I suppose the DCF analysis could help me arrive at a somewhat reliable present value?
* I have a hard time finding the cost of debt and market value of debt for the WACC so I'm twiddling my thumbs in uncertainty.


If anyone has experience with this type of thing, I'd love to hear your input, I'm working on my own spreadsheet for all these calculations and perhaps if I can get it to a point where it's reliable and useful, I'll share it with others.

Cheers!

|  | in EUR 000s |
|:-----------|------------:|
| 5. Total revenues | 632,729 |
| **10. Operating profit (EBIT)** | **31,013** |
| **16. Net financial income/expense** | **–7,018** |
| 17. Earnings before taxes | 23,995 |
| 19. Consolidated net income for the year | 15,704 |
| 21. Consolidated net income for the year after minority interests | 14,826 |
| **22. Consolidated profit carried forward** | **66,886** |
| 23. Additions to share premium | 0 |
| **24. Consolidated profit** | **81,712** |
| 25. Number of shares | 17,387,600 |
| 26. Earnings per share (basic, EUR) | 0.85 |

So here's what I don't understand:

1. If the profit before taxes [10] is 31K and the net income [16] is -7000, then does that mean that the profit after taxes is -7000?
2. What is ""consolidated profit carried forward"" [22]?
3. If the consolidated profit [24] is 81K, and there are 17 million shares, then 81712/17387600 = 0.0047. Where did they get 0.85 earnings per share?     
If I do 0.85 * 17387600 = 14,779,460, which is close to [21], but I'm guessing that [19] is what they count as earnings. 
4. Is this company profitable or is it making losses? It has a positive cash flow of 42.4 million euros so I'm guessing that it's profitable...",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_1azmwf,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1azmwf/help_me_make_sense_of_this_annual_report/,

Page 1.

“The objectives of security analysis are twofold.  First, it seeks to present the important facts regarding a stock or bond issue, in a manner most informing and useful to an actual or potential owner.  Second it seeks to reach dependable conclusions, based upon the facts and applicable standards, as to the safety and attractiveness of a given security at the current or assumed price.”

Graham goes on to explain that the analyst must understand security forms, accounting, basic elements that account for success or failure of businesses, the general workings of the economy and securities markets. 

“He must be able to dig for facts, to evaluate them critically, and to apply his conclusions with good judgment and a fair amount of imagination.  He must be able to resist human nature itself sufficiently to mistrust his own feelings when they are part of mass psychology.  He must have courage commensurate with his competence.”

Graham presents 4 charts on pages 4 – 7.

A.	Stocks Versus Bonds for Maintaining Real Income.
B.	Financial Data (including Income, Debt and Corporate Tax)
C.	Physical Data
D.	Price and Wage Data, Common Stock Prices and Bond Yields.


On Page 13 Graham reminds us that the serious obstacle is that analysis is not an exact science.  He also mentioned, “An exception may be seen in the new-era markets of 1927-1933.  Both the advance and the decline in stock prices were so extreme during this period that the conclusions suggested by informed and conservative security analysis were found to have little practical utility.  This was truer because the business depression of the early 1930’s was so unexpectedly severe as to vitiate many conclusions regarding safety and value that had been reasonable in the light of past experience.

On page 17 he writes, “A valuation may be very skillfully done in the light of all the pertinent data and the soundest judgment of future probabilities; yet the market price may delay adjusting itself to the indicated value for so long a period that new conditions may supervene and bring with them a new value.”

On page 21 he writes, “It is a matter of great moment to the analyst that the facts be fairly presented, and this means that he must be highly critical of accounting methods.”

On page 23 he writes, “We do not believe that short-run price movements – the day-to-day or month-to-month variations – are a valid or profitable concern of the security analyst.


On page 27 he writes, “Practically all common stocks are subject to recurrent wide changes in market price.  It was formerly an accepted tenet that investment grade common stocks could be purchased at all times without regard to the market level.”   The crash of 1929 – 1932 showed us that even the highest-grade stocks could be dangerously overpriced in the upper reaches of a bull market.  The analyst must stay unemotional and “resist the persuasive optimism and pessimism of alternating market swings.”

On page 28 he writes one of his more famous quotes, “In other words, the market is not a weighing machine, on which the value of each issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in accordance with its specific qualities.  Rather should we say that the market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals register choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of emotion.”

“Beware of “bargains” when most stocks seem very high.”


On page 59 he writes, “However, for most investors, we think, the real implication of dollar averaging is that they should be wary of putting more money in stocks at higher prices than they did at lower prices – which is a common failing – and that they should never let a lower price level scare them away from buying.”


On page 65 he writes, “ The security analyst uses a vast amount of economic statistics. “  He cites the importance of Government statistics and use of trade journals.

 
On pages 70 and 71 he writes, “There is a strong tendency in the stock market to value the management factor twice in its calculations. Stock prices reflect the large earnings
which the good management has produced, plus a substantial increment for “good management” considered separately. This amounts to “counting the same trick twice,” and it proves a frequent cause of overvaluation.”

“Now let us consider a similar judgment based primarily upon the trend. In 1929 nearly all public-utility systems showed a continued growth of earnings, but the fixed charges of many were so heavy—by reason of pyramidal capital structures—that they consumed nearly all the net income. Investors bought bonds of these systems freely on the theory
that the small margin of safety was no drawback, since earnings were certain to continue to increase. They were thus making a clear-cut prediction as to the future, upon the correctness of which depended the justification of their investment. If their prediction were wrong—as proved to be the case—they were bound to suffer serious loss.”

Page 307 has an interesting sentence.  “It would appear to be sound theory to require regularly some protective provisions on the score of working capital in the case of industrial bonds.  We suggest that a ratio of 100% in net current assets to funded debt be considered as one of the specific criteria in the selection of fixed-income industrial bonds.”

On page 322, Graham tells us to use “The Poorest-Year test” in determining the minimum interest coverage needed for a company to survive an economic downturn.  It is acceptable for  the company to come reasonably close, since the poorest year will be less than average for a longer period.

On page 334, in regards to Industrial Bonds,   “The best criterion that we are able to offer for this purpose is the ratio of the market value of the capital stock to the total funded debt.”  This can be performed with a look at stockholders equity compared to debt as well.  Graham would use both, and felt that market value was a proper tool for determining safety of bonds.  He used an example of requiring enterprise value to be at least twice the amount of the debt.  He discusses how market prices are always fluctuating, and that one should allow considerable leeway for the vagaries of Wall Street.

	He goes onto discuss that operating rentals should be capitalized at an appropriate rate.  From that rate one can estimate a fair value for debt.  This has always been a confusing task for me, yet I write it here, as one day I may start using it.  

Page 388, “The boom of the 1920’s operated in the field of corporation finance largely by two distinctive manifestations:  the public utility holding company and the investment trust.  Nearly all of the holding company structures had at their base a group of sound and growing operating utilities.  But above them were reared fantastic pyramids, comprising as many as six successive layers of holding companies – each with its own complicated capitalization.  These never ending corporate developments added continuous fuel to the speculation of Wall Street.  They also created huge amounts of inadequately secured bond and preferred stock issues, together with a sad record of financial exploitation and malpractice.”

Page 407, “Thus the best industries for valuation are those which do not show large losses in severe depression.  Such industries would include, in addition to public utilities, the insurance companies, chain stores, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, cigarette makers, can manufacturers and perhaps others.”

Page 408, “Diversification is almost a necessary adjunct of the margin-of-safety idea.  A single issue bought for less than it is fairly worth may still “go sour” for some special reason and produce a loss.  A group of twenty or more issues will average out the individual favorable and unfavorable developments.  Thus if a margin of safety is soundly calculated it should have full opportunity to create a profit in the aggregate result.”

Page 459, “A frequent procedure of the security analyst is to form a favorable opinion of the long-term prospects of a certain industry, because of his general knowledge and judgment, and then make an intensive study of the available materials to find confirmation of his views.  The figures will generally prove quite encouraging – since he was attracted to the industry in the first place by some optimistic indications.”

“So, too, on industry prospects the analyst must beware of worshipping what may prove to be, in Lord Bacon’s phrase, the “idols of the market place.”  The payment of an exceedingly liberal price for expected future improvement – in the form of a very high multiplier of past earnings – is hardly a businesslike procedure.”  Graham goes onto discuss how this type of investment has “served at times to turn some of our best and strongest common stocks into speculative and risky vehicles.”

Page 476, “In the large sector of financial companies the asset value remains a prominent element in the valuation of a common-stock issue.  In fact the appraisal process is likely to start with the asset value as a point of departure and to add a premium or subtract a discount there from to reflect the many other elements of the valuation.  This statement applies fairly generally to banks, insurance companies, and investment funds, but only slightly, if at all, to finance or credit companies.”

Chapter 39, page 492 is titled, “The Valuation of Public-Utility Common Stocks.”

I have indicated this as a reference tool for the future.

Page 493,  Graham emphasizes that  projections of earnings are “subject to a considerable margin of possible error and that the best the analyst can do is to try to make his assumptions as reasonable as possible in the light of all the facts at hand.”  He informs us that we should arrive at a level of earnings, within a margin of error on the low and high side and base some valuations on that.  He indicates that as time goes on, circumstances change and that we must adjust our analysis.
On page 502 he writes, “This suggests that a favorable time to buy electric-utility common stocks is when the earned return is low in relation to the property-value base apt to be used by the regulatory commission in setting rates.”
 
Page 504, “Except during periods of temporary stress, therefore, the earnings figure for the analyst to keep in mind is what we would describe as the estimated earnings potential.  This expression is one we use to indicate the maximum per-share earnings reasonably expectable under the regulatory policies of the state in which the company operates.  It represents the earnings resulting from a “full,” or over-all return, after deducting the annual service requirements on all senior securities outstanding.”

Chapter 40 discusses an appropriate capitalization rate for expectable earnings.  This is called the “Earnings-Capitalization Rate.”

He indicates that this rate fluctuates widely over time.  Also mentions that electric utility companies have a tendency to have somewhat predictable historical averages.  You can see a table that Graham devised here.

Factors Affecting the Capitalization Rate

1.	Prospective Growth of the enterprise.
2.	Known or expected stability of the business.
3.	Dividend pay-out ratio.
























The following are notes I found in a note book.  I believe they refer to 3rd edition, but need to verify:

Page 327 – Charles Tatham Jr. had 2 useful ratios for use in Public Utility Bond Analysis.

Jay Sawell had a “Charges to Property Ratio.”    

‘Debt Service Requirements or Fixed Charges’ / Minimum Value of Property for Rate Making.’  If debt service ratio is 1% or 2%, all is cool.  If 45 or 5%, bond holder is weakened.

You can already see the effect of their dominance on higher returns than their peers for what now is mainly traditional shopping. I believe it will have an even bigger effect with online shopping.

As a refresher, each competitor manages a $100,000 portfolio and their performance is judged after three years. This simulation is meant to be deliberate practice, so invest as you would in real life. Although simulations are imperfect and there is no substitute to investing with real money, this will be a starting point in investing for many and a growth point for others that want to try new techniques.

35 people have registered for this competition, but only 16 people made trades.  The current leader is itsmedog with a 27.2% gain since January.  Most of his profits have come from positions in AAPL, AAPL call options, OCLR, PRXI, and BREW.  I am almost in last place.  I pursued a very concentrated strategy for the simulation and SVU is currently down 24%.  Only 4 of 35 people (itsmedog, nmelluzzo, Drited, and BusyBeingBorn) are currently beating the S&amp;P500's return YTD of 4.43%.  I expect this trend to continue as most active managers don't beat broad based indexes.

For those interested in joining this simulation, you can sign up for the competition [using this link](http://simulator.investopedia.com/Portfolio/?gameid=169711#axzz1hfgDlF7U) after you sign up for Investopedia.  

Game Name: **SecurityAnalysis 2015** Password: **BerenWasFirst**

Remember, this simulation is a marathon that ends January 2015.  Good luck investing!

I have purchased stock in an undervalued company.  I have a fair value price target of 5$ per share.  The stock is currently trading at 2$ per share.  As is the case with an undervalued company, and especially small/mid cap companies, there can be increased volatility.  From a VALUE INVESTING standpoint, is it taboo to attempt to buy and sell during LOCAL minima and maxima, along the way to the expected fair value of 5$ a share?  Is this practice considered too much speculation on the part of a value investor?  I'm aware of the risks from all possibly scenarios, I would just like to get an opinion from those more knowledgable.  I realize this practice becomes much more risky the closer one would get to a perceived ""fair value"" due to increased downside, but is it taboo altogether?  Or is it increasingly more taboo as the risk involved is increased.  I'm not looking for a general investing answer because I realize that there are a million investing/trading strategies out there, as I am looking to become an unemotional, disciplined value investor I'm essentially asking if this practice is bad with that goal in mind, and if so....how bad?

Off the top of my head, there's the CAPM Model and WACC. But as I will explain, I don't think WACC would be appropriate to use on the buy side. I was wondering if there were other ways to calculate the required Return?

I know that WACC is used in corporate finance to determine whether a firm should take on certain tasks. So it seems like this is something that someone within the firm can calculate as they have information from the firm that the public does not have. If this is incorrect and it IS possible to calculate the required return and use it in valuation models, then can you show me how?

Also, how do you use CAPM now that the US Government got downgraded? The Rate of Return for Long Term Government bonds were always used as the Risk Free Rate of Return in the model.

1. Rising Inflation
2. Rising Interest rates
3. Dollar Devaluation

I am mostly worried about the dollar getting de-valued. Is anyone buying Gold/ foreign currencies as a dollar hedge? I have never been fond of Gold ( especially when it's hitting all-time highs) but the growing deficit/debt, the constant money-printing and the [BRICS taking the first steps to move away from the Dollar](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/brics-credit-idUSL3E7FE0AV20110414) is disconcerting. 

I typically look for special situations opportunities and/or buy OOM puts on the SPY as market hedge. But, at this point I am a little torn between whether to keep putting more money in international securites/currencies or gold?

Michael Price, Mario Gabelli, Tom Gayner, and others will be speaking. There are always some great value picks - like Gabelli on Madison Square Garden a couple years ago. I am working on the event and guarantee that any of the presentations that speakers are okay releasing find their way to this subreddit. 

If you can afford and can come you should, it will be a great time. PM me for more details or if you want to know about where to stay in Dallas.  =)

I am currently doing a private company valuation. And had a question about a detail that seemed odd. This company has:
Assets: 442m
Liabilities: 434m
Equity: 8m

It has had negative equity historically. When calculating the cost of capital, does this mean that cost of equity becomes nearly irrelevant? Are these levels of debt normal for private companies (first time seeing one with these levels of debt)?

The company is danish (~Tax rates of 50%). So all this debt has a positive effect on taxable income, but still Assets nearly equaling Liabilities is something I haven't seen very often yet.

Thanks again for any input.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,1370969694.0,,,True,t3_1g4nyc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1g4nyc/private_company_valuation_help/,

I attended the BRK meeting this year and the short seller asked about Henry Singleton and Teledyne...found out that Charlie and Warren are huge fans of them. Unfortunately modern teledyne is very different and I tried to get the old annual reports but couldn't find them anywhere---

Just found this.
http://www.amazon.com/Distant-Force-Teledyne-Corporation-Created/dp/097913630X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368768064&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=distant+force

Biography was REALLY interesting (first half is kind of boring, talks about engineering/background etc) the second half was the most valuable for me. Talked about Singleton's capital allocation principles.

Also included are all the henry singleton shareholder letters and annual reports. Absolute gold.

Anyways just thought I'd post in case anyone else is trying to read up on amazing companies. (just learned about value investing but I love it already!)

EDIT: No I don't make any money from referral link through amazon. Feel free to just search ""distant force,"" the title of the book.

Also another book I highly recommend is Damn Right! the biography on Munger. Very insightful!",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_1ei2rc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1ei2rc/biography_on_teledyne_and_henry_singleton/,

1364975715.0,4,self.SecurityAnalysis,1bkqza,What do you think about Lanxess?,7,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1bkqza/what_do_you_think_about_lanxess/,"No one replied at /r/investing so hopefully someone from here will analyze this company with me.

In the last week the stock price went down more than 15%, so perhaps now they're not overpriced anymore?

Lanxess is a chemical company that produces all kinds of chemicals. Last year they invested a lot in producing tires. They made two acquisitions (small companies) and they both were somewhat related to the auto industry. In their annual report last week they said they had worse than expected sales due to low demand from car manufacturers, for example their tire sales went down 40%.

Here are some arguments why it's a good buy, please let me know what you disagree with.

* It's P/E went from 10.01 to 8.95 so now it's cheap (or in decline)
* Their profit for 2012 (=514) was *record high* and higher than in 2011 (=506), the problem is that it was expected they would earn more. Still, the fact that they've never been as profitable as they are now should be a good sign.
* Their ROA and ROE is lower than in 2011 but only by a bit, and is higher than in 2010. So if it wasn't for the poor sales, I'd say they're getting more efficient.
* The company was created as a spin-off from Bayer in 2005, and after going through a messy period they started giving out dividends in 2006 and never stopped. The dividend per share went up from 0.25 in 2006 to 1.00 euro this year
* Their EPS is 113% higher than the average for the previous 5 years, and 2361% higher than in the period 2005-2009
* Profit/Debt is 31.5% for 2012 and has been steadily growing since 2006.
* Profit/Revenue is 5.65% which is lower than in 2011 when it was 5.77%, but it has been steadily growing since 2006 when it was 1.18%
* According to Graham's formula for determining the stock's intrinsic value, it's 53.52 EUR. Its current stock price now is 55.05 so it's pretty close, it's not overpriced
* ROIC is 5.89% which is ""just right"" (more than 6% would be ideal)
* P/BV is 2.61 so it's a little bit expensive, but in 2011 it was 2.92 and in 2010 it was 4.16
* Graham's formula for determining financial strength: working capital/(2*debt) = 0.65 while &gt;1 would be ideal. It's still better than in 2011 when it was 0.31
* They have less debt now than they had in 2011
* They have more cash
* Inventories went up a little bit
* Their gross cash flow was positive and higher by 200 million compared to 2011 (and is record high)

All of this tells me that I should buy, and I probably will, but please tell me if you see something as a problem here.",,False,,t5_2s7v0,False,,,True,t3_1bkqza,http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1bkqza/what_do_you_think_about_lanxess/,

What's marked in blue are numbers derived from the numbers in the report. The numbers are in 000000's where applicable.

I'm planning to do a similar report for a few other companies I'm interested in, but first I'd like to know if I made some mistakes in this one. Please let me know what did I calculate wrong.

  1. Operating income = EBIT, this is right? In some reports they write it one way and in others the other way
  2. Expenses = EBIT - Revenue
  3. Minority interest = 0, at some point in 2008 Bayer did a ""squeeze out"" which under German law means that 95% of the shareholders may force the minority shareholders to sell their shares
  4. How to calculate free cash flow?
  5. Market capitalization = avg share value * shares (in millions)
  6. Other current assets = Current assets - Cash - Inventories
  7. Book value = Total assets + Depreciation - Other current assets - Debt
  8. Profitability = profit / revenue
  9. Stability = in the past 10 years, how many times was current EPS / avg(3 year EPS) &gt; 1 (meaning there was stable growth)

In the age of the internet, though, it should be possible to obtain a lot of the same information gained from scuttlebutt without actually talking to anyone, but merely crawling through the web. 

What websites do you know of that help an investor gain information related to the ""15 points"" that Fisher details? If not websites, then what about stuff you can do online to gain such information, from your computer? 

I know of four websites as of now: 

slate.com... which has some insightful business articles. 

twst.com... which has executive interviews of several companies.

amazon.com... you at least get customer perspectives on the products

glassdoor.com... lots of comments from current and former employees. Be wary of ""sour grapes"" though. You can also get the average salary and compare that to other companies. 

For those of you not familiar with Fisher's works, scuttlebutt is basically the process of asking smart questions to a ""representative cross-section [...] of those who in one way or another are concerned with any particular company"" with the objective of gaining ""an accurate picture of the relative points of strengths an weaknesses of each company in an industry."" (Quotes from ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits"".) It is a discovery process to determine the qualitative aspects of a company that Graham never considered in much detail.

I've invested in FHCO, which makes and sells female contraceptive (condom) to governments, non-profits, and consumers worldwide. I like the business itself and recently they beat earnings estimates which led to an increase in share price.
  
However one of their more influential directors has since been selling 20,000 shares daily, reducing their share price to pre-earnings release levels (summary here: http://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/863894.htm). 
  
I'm not sure what to think of it: on one hand, I like the company and their financials and business. On the other hand it seems like executives are squeezing any increase in share price out.

I am wondering if you have any ideas to add to this list: 

NAND - 2d/3d &amp; BiCS/re-ram/etc. Continued proliferation of smart devices, SSDs, especially as $/gig reaches parity with HDDs.

3D Printing - Obviously the 2 big 3D printing companies aren't value stocks, but i can see this industry eventually becoming revolutionary.

Renewable Energy - Especially solar. Seems like just a matter of time before price parity (although nat gas set this back), and/or large scale gov-sponsored infrastructure projects.

3G/4G &amp; beyond. Demand for data/bandwidth will increase. 

Ecommerce - seems there is still a lot of room to grow

Unconventional resource extraction - ultra-deep water, shale, horizontal drilling, fracing, etc

Big data - could mean ITSM/ERP/etc. More data --&gt; more advanced analysis of this data

Electric/Hybrid cars - possibly even nat gas engines. I don't think oil prices will stay below 85-100 for a prolonged period of time given cost of extraction averages. 

What would you add?
