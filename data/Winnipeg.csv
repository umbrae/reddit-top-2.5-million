Self post = NO KARMA,172,23,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/17nap5/need_help_finding_a_lost_dog_please_upvote_this/,"Long story short my friend's dog got out of the yard on Saturday the 26th, and has been gone since. We've been out searching every night and they think he might be in the spring hill area (or even in North Kildonan) (friend lives is in Transcona). If you guys have seen this dog/can post it on Facebook, twitter, or something I would really appreciate. I don't know what else to do and I've never seen my colleague so shaken up before. 

**The dog's name is Titan, if you see him, try and whistle him over but don't look at him in the eyes if you can help it as he might get scared/think you're playing.**

If you see/hear ANYTHING please PM me on here and I will forward it all to the owner.

[Here's an album of pictures](http://imgur.com/a/1q5lk)

[Here's the lost dog poster](http://i.imgur.com/BIabovD.jpg)


Once again I really appreciate it, and I just want to make sure Titan gets home safe.

EDIT: [Here is the Winnipeg Lost Dog Facebook Photo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=555288717823271&amp;set=a.190661520952661.48803.189085261110287&amp;type=1)

EDIT 2: He was last seen under the Dugald bridge near the floodway (This was Monday).

EDIT 3: I just got the PDF file for the lost poster from the owner and I'm printing out about 300 copies. I hate wasting paper but to be honest I'm open to anything right now.If you guys want to [Here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6HsPsaF66dSM3FaV1c5X0lhMmc/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to the  file. 

EDIT 3.5: We are going out Saturday to put up posters and going out tonight (Friday) to lockport to go search around there/around 59. With this wicked cold it's hard to keep an optimistic view but animals have done this for thousands of years and I know Titan is a fighter. Myself personally and my friend (the owner) really appreciates this. He's not a redditor but he says thank you to everybody supporting the search for Titan.

EDIT 4: We are putting posters up along the highways and into communities around Winnipeg today. Getting the word out is now the biggest priority, not the foot search. The owner says thanks again to everybody raising awareness for Titan!

EDIT 5: The owner and his girlfriend had spotted titan around Oakbank. He has gone into full survival mode and isn't even acting like himself. He bolted away, they are trying to keep him in one area and set a live trap, however no location is given yet as they don't want him to be scared away. He's still alive and we're still at it. Raising awareness is what we're working on as well, tons of posters are up and even door to door in the communities around Winnipeg.",,False,self,t5_2qtno,1359993844.0,,,True,t3_17nap5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/17nap5/need_help_finding_a_lost_dog_please_upvote_this/,

In the early 1900s Winnipeg had serious problems with its water supply, drawing its tap water supply from the assiniboine, and also utilizing wells throughout the city.  The assiniboine was bacteria ridden, while the well water wrecked machinery and was rough on the stomach.  This is due to being very mineral rich, as the aquifer underneath winnipeg lays on a limestone bedrock.

City of Winnipeg (which as growing at a very fast rate..pre-panama canal) decided to take the long approach, and hired a world class consultant.  After surveying many potential sources (Sandilands wells, Winnipeg River, et al.), Shoal Lake was graded as the highest, most pristine quality.  And being 300ft higher in elevation, this would allow for an aqueduct to be built.

Through special act of Provincial Legislature, the Greater Winnipeg Water District (GWWD) was created, a corridor leading from Winnipeg to Shoal Lake.  A railway was constructed, employing many men to build the railway, and also cut down trees for lumber--which was resold.  Much rough terrain such as muskeg was present, but it was overcome.  A series of train station were setup, and some town such as East Braintree (named as of such due to Braintree, USA potentially causing postal mixups) were founded.

The final station on the GWWD railway, named Waugh, is established at inlet for the aqueduct, on Indian Bay.  Snowshoe bay is dammed off, as falcon lake came into it, and made the water less blue. (this is visible on google maps; http://g.co/maps/894k5)

Over a few years, the aqueduct was built, about 120km of pipe, slightly graded so that gravity would do all the work.  From the inlet on Indian Bay, until the water reaches the Deacon Reservoir in Winnipeg (Deacons Corner), it is all gravity fed!  The aqueduct brings 80,000,000 Gallons Per Day.

The water is chlorinated (and fluoridated as well) along the way to keep out pests.

So, even without treatment, it was great water.  But now with the treatment plant which subjects the water to numerous methods, this is some of the best water you can get!

Did you know that the Queen decided on one of her tours through Canada that Winnipeg's water would be her official water for the rest of the tour?

Yeah, so I am bored at the airport, and I just felt like spitting that out.  Did a research paper on it a few years ago.  I have numerous (10?) sources in regards to this if anyone is interested, including an 1885 conversation between a citizen and the old Winnipeg water works utility, which used the water from assinboine.(ever see the WWW water caps in the ground?  near River Heights, and Misericordia, etc.  The Cornish Library is their old pumping station).

Fun Fact; prior to aqueduct, fire water was from assiniboine.  Because it was so muddy, when firefighters used it, it would completely destroy buildings and merchandise inside, as it got mud all over everything!",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_q9n14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/q9n14/winnipeg_has_some_of_the_best_tap_water_in_the/,

6 months ago I made a post here on r/Winnipeg asking for advice regarding an upcoming trip to Winnipeg  - [you can read that post here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/s5212/american_seeking_foodie_guidance_in_preparations/). The response I received from you guys was overwhelming! We (my SO and I) really want to thank everyone who made suggestions for things to do around Winnipeg as it made our trip one of the best ever. 

First off, you guys have a **BEAUTIFUL** city. Amazing restaurants, gorgeous parks, lots of things to see and do on foot. It was an experience well beyond our expectations and we have you guys to thank for that. 

Second, we decided to start up a small blog highlighting the trip! It's called, ""[the piglet and the boar](http://www.thepigletandtheboar.com/)"". It's not much, mostly Food porn with our thoughts on the restaurants and and things you guys all suggested.  The goal is not to be ""critics"" here, just provide our view of the experience. Since you guys took the time to share your opinions with us we wanted to share our experience with you. 

[Here is the link to the first post!](http://www.thepigletandtheboar.com/2012/09/13/travels-in-canada-winnipeg-day-1-part-1/) 

We are trying to update it at least once a week, but life sometimes gets in the way of that. There are a lot of posts to come, more of Winnipeg, Calgary, Las Vegas, and stuff from here at home in California. Hope you enjoy it and thanks again! 

P.S. Neither of us write or take photos for a living. This is something we just do for fun. There won't be any ads or spam here and we just ask that if there is any criticism try to make it constructive.

Usually when I go out I leave my cell phone at home. Only time I bring it is when I hang out with my buddy. Going down Ferry from Ellice when I noticed on my rear view mirror that a couple of cars was moving out of the way for a lit up police cruiser. Alright, I move to the side and the cop parks behind me. Really? Sigh as I get my license and registration ready.

Cop walks over to me, I greet him and ask what's the problem. He accuses me of using a cell phone while driving. What? I tell him I didn't have the cell phone on me. He a says I put it away somewhere. Really?? I ask him to search me and the van. He says no. I ask him to call my cell to prove me wrong. He refuses. And asks for my license. Asshole. After checking my license and giving me the ticket he told me not to tell any ""White lies"" to whom ever I pay the ticket to. I wished someone would have jumped out of nowhere and ripped his eyes out.

So yeah, now I'm stuck with a $200 ticket. First time getting one too. Don't know what to do exactly. Can I argue about getting it reduced or let off?

There isn't a lot of information available for women who are put into this situation online for options in Winnipeg. Recently, I have been feeling like I should give back to people who are in a situation I myself have experienced too.  So when looking online today to see where I could volunteer, I was intrigued by the ""Pregnancy Crisis Centre"" on Broadway. After looking under the ""Abortion"" information... I found they are pro-life, pushing Christianity, and implying this is not a womans right to chose. 

I just want to spread the word that this is not an open minded crisis centre, and for sound non-judgemental advice, the Klinic or Mount Carmel clinic offer great resources, which will explore ALL options and not push any hidden agendas on you.

Those bones are dangerous, and could splinter and choke doggies, and damage their insides.  I dunno about you guys, but I don't want my dog to get hurt because of someone else's carelessness!

How do we kick Katz out? ,57,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/13to1o/toronto_mayor_rob_ford_was_just_ousted_over_3150/,"[Re: This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/13td52/rob_ford_has_been_removed_as_mayor_of_toronto_due/) 

I'm a pretty casual observer when it comes to City politics, but it seems like Katz has done a lot worse than divert $3125 to his own charity. Am I wrong? Do we have different rules in Winnipeg? Is Katz doing a better job of sticking to technicalities? 

Edit: clarity

Edit 2: Apparently Katz faces trial on April 2nd under simliar circumstances, "" $2,915 of public funds on a party for city councillors, department heads and their families at his Hu's Asian Bistro restaurant on Ellice Avenue, according to previously released expense records.""

Just to be clear with the last point that doesn't mean we're banning anyone who bad mouths the city; we're just banning those who do nothing but bitch and moan without actually being constructive. Basically the rule of thumb is don't be a dumbass and you'll be fine.

Being human we can't catch everything which is why we need **you** to report stuff by marking it as spam. Once you do that we'll be able to clearly see and check the validity of the post.

There are free shows at the Cube in Old Market Square all weekend as well as parties at the WAG, Pantages Playhouse and Union Sound Hall.

This year's festival headliners include:

* Funk D'Void

* Deepchild

* Daniel Steinberg

* Noah Pred

* Desert Dwellers

* Cain

* Drumspyder

* The Librarian

* Longwalkshortdock

and lots more including lots of local DJs/performers.



I'll be playing tonight at the Cheer (including some original material) at the MEME House and Techno Opener. There's also the Bass Opener at Union Sound Hall tonight for those of you into Dubstep, Drum and Bass, etc.

Some days we had long waits, and the last day we went we were rushed right through the triage (they triage really well, no complaints about the waiting, always handling due to severity). 

The doctors and nurses were all really nice, you treat them with respect and they treat you nicely right back. One of the nights we came in there was a few drunken people arguing with the nurses in the room next to us, and the nurses took it really well, yelled right back and got the job done. One guy needed stitches and seemed to refuse treatment, he ended up just walking out against the doc's suggestion. They checked on us hourly when we were there, and the nurses and all the attending were very helpful and detail oriented. 

One time a nurse said she was going to get more sheets, but they didn't have any clean ones at the time so there was a bit of a wait, but we were going through several sheets, it's easy to see with a full ER how they can run out for a bit (need to be sure to save some for new patients). Sometimes it seemed like the staff had some time on their hands, but that only lasted a few hours and then they were clearly overworked again, it's amazing how much they get done when the ER fills up.

I had about 12 days to play and decided to see.

Headed out from Winnipeg going south on Pembina Highway through Saint Norbert and Saint Adolphe. The TCT was far too muddy and rough for my bike so I continued along the highway. Stopped briefly at the Mennonite Memorial Landing Site, there was a camp site there but I had only covered 50km so i continued the push to St.Malo


[Day2   - May 24rd 2012](https://picasaweb.google.com/105289714923942416155/May2012BikeAdventureDay2?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCO3y_8eChfDG-wE&amp;feat=directlink)

Woke up and explored St.Malo a bit. Continued south and picked up the TCT just south of St.Malo. It was a rough trail that varied between quad ruts and knee high grass, most of the trail was fenced in on either side with barbed wire. Found a  suspension bridge, had to unload my bike and carry everything across in a few trips. Eventually exited the trail on Highway 201 and headed west. I wanted to make it through to St.Joseph, but it got cold and dark so I stopped in Dominion City.

Lots of wind and a poorly setup hammock made this cold night terrible. Got a coffee from the grocery store and headed east on Highway 201 out from Dominion City.  13km later and I had an excellent breakfast at the Letellier Hotel . Explored Letellier a bit, they have a nice campground. Passed by the campground in St.Joseph out of interest and was happy I didn’t stop there (limestone pads a small trees, clearly for trailers not hammocks/tents). Stopped at the Agriculture Museum in St.Joseph, it wasn’t open for the season yet.  Stopped at a church in Morden for a fish fry dinner, it was excellent.  With a belly full of fish I headed to Lake Minnewasta to camp for the night.

Had an excellent at Lake Minnewasta and headed a mile west there the TCT picks up again. After a few kms of country roads the familiar quad trail continues. The trail left GPS range, so I stopped tracking. The trail covered lots of beautiful wilderness and crossed a cool log. Unfortunately the trail came to an end after about 2 hours of mostly pushing my bike. I could see the tail continued on the other side of the stream but I didn’t want to take the chance.  Turned around and took the highway to Manitou, hoping to pick up the trail in the morning. 


[Day 5&amp;6 – May 27&amp;28 2012 ](https://picasaweb.google.com/105289714923942416155/May2012BikeAdventureDay56?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCNGRwJK0n8GuGw&amp;feat=directlink)

Camping in Manitou was the coldest night yet. It rained all night, heavy winds, almost no cover, and mumbling cold.  I Decided I wasn’t coving any distance that way. Packed up and headed a motel in Manitou. Everything is closed on a Sunday in a small town so I had lunch in the motel restaurant and moped in my motel room for the day.

Woke up on day 6 feeling restored, and while the weather wasn’t great I felt like I should try to make some progress. I headed north up Highway 244 hoping to make it to Spruce Woods National Park that night. Stopped by the Glass Bottle Structures in Treherne, kinda cool. There are several kilometers of train cars between Treherne and Holland, I think they have been there for a while; I took pictures of the some of the nicer art. I spent too much time taking pictures of train cars. The TCT picks up again in Cypress Rivers and heads south in to Spruce Woods National Park, but it was too muddy to follow and I had to turn around. Went to camp in Cypress Rivers but the marked was not hammock friendly, the motel was super sketchy looking.

First night camping somewhere that is not explicitly a campground, at the Cypress River Millennium Park just outside of Cypress Rivers.  Unfortunately another cold winy nigh followed by a cold windy day.  I knew there were yurts waiting in Spruce Woods and I couldn’t sit under the shelter all day. I put on all my possible layers and made the a slow push for the last 30km. The first 15km brought me to Glenboro, where I stopped for lunch and to dry off.  Half way into the second stretch the weather was starting to clear. I got to the yurt around 2pm. No cell service or wifi. The yurts are not as rustic as I thought they would be. After a few hours or warming up I wandered the trails in the area, cleaned my bike, and contemplated my strategy for tomorrow.

Dilemma:  

*Continue to Riding Mountain 

*Hang out in Spruce Woods and check out day trails in the area

*Risk not making it home on time under my own power if the weather turns bad

Overnight I decided that it’s more important to get home under my own power than make it Riding Mountain. When I got up I felt amazing, the weather was clear and dry, I had to ride. I stopped in Carberry for  groceries and had a quick lunch in the park. When I turned off of Highway 5 on to Trans Canada Highway I was greeted by construction signs followed by 20(30?)km of pristine asphalt. I cheered on the highway crews when I finally caught up with them.  I rolled through the major towns along Hwy1 but didn’t make any major stops until dinner at Bill’s Stickey Fingers Ribs in Portage la Prairie.

It was by a Safeway near... Keewatin and Logan or something?  Just wreathed in smoke. (Sorry for my lousy iPhone 3G quality camera...)  After a while, there were two explosions.  (Video to follow to confirm this.  My buddy taped it on his phone)  There were a bunch of people around taking pictures as that sucker burned, but surprisingly I was the only redditor.  After a while, there were a couple explosions.  Video potentially to follow.

Not sure if act of arson or... random... vehicle fire?  Does that happen?

Is that a thing?

My first live car on fire.  You can help dampen the trauma by providing karma.  Every little bit helps.

**Edit:**

Yet today I am still living out of a mini fridge I had to buy. I paid 600 for the Stove and 650 for the fridge, and was assured that It would be delivered within 10 business days and when it comes they would haul away the old stove and fridge. 14 business days past before I got a call Saying the stove and fridge were ready to be delivered, but there was an issue with the fridge. a ""Small dent"" on the left side had occurred during shipping but they would bring it out any ways and I had the option to either keep the fridge and receive a discount, or return it and get a new one shipped priority. I take the day off due to the 6 hour delivery window given and like planned they delivery driver arrives. I told the driver what I was told on the phone and I asked him if he could bring it in so I could look at it. ""I am not bringing it in because your not going to want that piece of shit"" So I walk out to the truck and look at it and it had obviously been dropped at some point and the driver agreed it probably wouldn't turn on. The bottom was caved in and The back grill had popped off. I was obviously not keeping the Fridge. The driver was actually a good guy and basically said fuck Dufresne don't take there shit, get a new fridge which I respected his honesty.

So still didn't have a fridge but, The driver brought the stove in and took the old one, all was kinda well. Until about an hour later I noticed my old stove sitting beside my tree in my front yard... I call Dufresne and ask why my stove was still there? I was reassured that it was a different truck that picked up the old appliances and in a few hours it would be gone. 3 days later my old stove was still there and a poorer family in the area came and asked if they could have it. I said of course and they took the fridge. 

So then today, Haven't heard from Dufresne in over 2 weeks after re ordering the fridge, and getting sick of living out of the mini fridge I called Dufresne only to get into a discussion with the floor manager who was nothing but hostile. Ill be honest I was not exactly a Saint on the phone but how I was treated was way beyond unprofessional. I asked when I would get the Fridge? and asked if I was going to be compensated in anyway for this delay. He Told me I was ""Out Of my Mind"" ""Escalating the situation"" I just told him I wanted a date. But received a response of ""Listen I don't really care what you do, you can wait till it comes in or cancel your order. When you can make up your mind call some one who cares"" and he hung up the phone.

I am beyond sick of this and realistically just want my fridge. So Winnipeg if your looking for any kind of customer service don't go to Dufresne! 
 
EDIT: Well Tomorrow the fridge is supposed to come. Any time between 11-5...... So hopefully it all works out. I will update when it arrives. They happened to ""find"" one in the storage room. Sounds fishy but I don't care as long as I get me fridge! We will have to see :)",,False,self,t5_2qtno,True,,,True,t3_msl9x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/msl9x/sincerely_dufresne_on_ellice_fuck_you/,

Do y'all think I'm making the right move?,34,2,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/14tmni/im_applying_to_university_of_manitoba_right_now_i/,"So I'm living in South Georgia right now. I don't fit in here. It just doesn't work for me. I just turned 33 and I want a new life.  

I've moved away before and actually spent 6.5 years living in NYC. I loved the city and the vibrancy of the people from every place imaginable. 

But there in NYC, I could never get ahead of my bills or find a decent job. My rent was over $800 for a tiny bedroom in Redhook. 

I ended up coming back to my home in South Georgia. Now I'm striking out for the great unknown again. This time though it'll be different. I want to live some place firmly rooted in the future. I want to live some place that's very multicultural. 

Some place with good jobs and a decent cost of living.  I know it's incredibly stereotypical but I'm an American who wants to emigrate to Canada. 

I'm applying to the University of Manitoba in the next month or so. I think it's the best idea I've had in a long time. Am I right? 

Educate me. Thanks bunches. 

(And yes, I realize that the weather is Gawd awful horrible no good, and it's cold, beyond all imagining. I think I an deal with it. I mean if people from Bangladesh and Cameroon can, then so can I. )

Check out the Plastic Tech or the Assembly Tech jobs listed there. Those are the ""entry level"" positions. The only real requirements are to have Grade 12, to pass a number of security and background checks, and have some aptitude for building things. Click on the links and the job requirements are there in pdf format. If you have any questions about the application process or the work, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

I don't drink, don't do illegal drugs, nor smoke. I've been on anxiety medication since the age of 14. I'm the 2nd oldest of seven children.

Now for the part everyone loves.. racism. This is something I've dealt with since I was in Grade 1. After some time I stopped caring for the most part, although it still hurts as I grow.

I wanted to make this visible as it's own post. If you already commute by bike, there is a ton of good advice to improve your comfort and technique in there. It's also worth it to read as a motorist as it very concisely sums up the common problems both road users encounter with each other, and how to manage them.

Also [Here](http://biketothefuture.org/) is Winnipeg's cycling advocacy group's website, Bike to the Future. They are insanely professional and produce *so much* data. I really enjoy their approach to cycling advocacy, compared to what I have seen in other cities (more yelling and less well written committee reports).

I've never been to the Fort Garry's bar area but I suppose that would be my best shot, short of a Manitoba Club membership.  Rae and Jerry's maybe?  The Velvet Glove lounge at the Fairmont?

Long time reader, first time writer. 

Anyone recently noticed money missing from their bank account?  That's a scary prospect for many. Being a 27 year old in Winnipeg, and only ever having to file police reports for stolen goods, I never suspected that I'd be trying to report a debit card theft. 

I was checking my account balance online last night to see if the three outstanding cheques I wrote had been cashed yet, but to my surprise the account balance was lower then anticipated.  I combed over transactions for the last few days, and found transactions from a Shell location in Mississauga ON. The day in question, I was clearly in Winnipeg (I work down town in the exchange district, several co-workers can vouch for my whereabouts) I also don't own a car, so $500+ in transactions at a shell should seem a little strange. :P

I've reported the theft to the bank, and made a claim with Winnipeg Police. The officer I spoke with mentioned that there had been a large number of other fraud claims as well, I figured I'd try to contact who I could to determine if there's a connection between all of us.

I'm a creature of habit: I work downtown and live in Wolseley, so unless somewhere I regularly visit has decided to skim my card months/years ago, it's got to have been somewhat recently. 

The only two leads I have are hardly even circumstantial. 
* Last Friday (May 3'th, the day before the fraudulent transactions occurred) I purchased gas for someone else at a CO-OP gas bar (the one at Archibald and Marion) First time I've ever been to the location.
* Last Tuesday, I visited the Pita Pit @ 211 Bannatyne Ave, bought my usual once a week pita. The only reason I have to suspect this was a rumour from a friend that there was a skimming op going on at this location. I did see the other post about the videos and footage of the location after the fact, and I'm under the impression that the location recently changed managers. (though I have no facts to support this, just seeing new faces I didn't remember seeing regularly)

Beyond that: here's a quick list of everywhere else I've shopped in the last 31 days, if there's a large number of people with both fraudulent charges on their accounts, and a location they frequent/have visited once recently, I'd love to hear from you!

Please reddit-mail me any time, I'll provide you an email address and phone number for additional contact.

* TIM HORTONS #39 - in Winnipeg Square
* A.M.FOODFARE #1 - Portage and Burnell
* 7-ELEVEN 15198 - 781 Corydon Ave
* RED RIVER COOP Gas Bar - 650 Archibald at Marion
* NEW YORK FRIES - in Polo Park
* THE PITA PIT - 211 Bannatyne
* CANADA SAFEWAY - 3059 Ness Ave (the one by polo park)

This post was inspired by a recent trip to Pizzeria Gusto.  

My best was back when Gluttons was still open and Makoto Ono was still working there.  The food was incredible, service was attentive but not intrusive, all in all it was amazing.  Every time I've eaten at Segovia has been fantastic as well.

One of the worst was at Gusto recently.  Arrived shortly before 6:30 to put our name in for a table, and was told there was a 45 minute wait.  Not a big deal, so we put our name in for a table, give them our phone number and go elsewhere for a drink which is fairly standard practice there.  We get a phone call around 50 minutes later that our table is ready and to head back.  The hostess upon our arrival looks confused, and informs us that she has sat someone else at our table, without bothering to check their names.  She then tells us that another table should ""be available soon"".  In the end we waited for another 45 minutes, while she sat two other tables before us.  Basically the only reason we stayed was because we had waited so long already.

The food was great there, as it usually is.  But during the meal the other hostess that was working decided that since our pizza's were up that we were finished with our appetizer.  She literally just grabbed a plate of food that was barely half eaten off the table without even asking us and walked off.  Both me and my girlfriend were shocked, quickly ate our meals and got the fuck out of there, never to return again.",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_ms4jf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/ms4jf/your_bestworst_dining_experiences_in_winnipeg/,

1367080173.0,24,self.Winnipeg,1d7zwt,"Bike Auction today, I though I'd share a few basics when purchasing a used bike.",32,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1d7zwt/bike_auction_today_i_though_id_share_a_few_basics/,"I used to race and fix bikes years ago, and had a lot of them pass through my hands.  Some were brand new bikes from sponsors, others were beaters that friends needed to have fixed up or repaired in some way.  In the context of the bike auction, and with the thinking that you may go looking for a bike there, consider the following:

**1. Consider what you will be using the bike for.**  If you are looking for a straight up commuter, mountain bikes or a utility/commuter style bike, which have a more upright riding position and frame geometry that facilitates responsive turning, may be your cup of tea.  If you are looking to go on long rides for fitness, maybe you want a road bike(ten-speed style for my fellow old fogies), with thin tires that decrease rolling resistance and make pedaling easier with a frame geometry that puts you in a more aerodynamic position. You probably won't want a road bike for commuting, but to each their own.

**2. Budget:** Buying a bike at an auction can be a mixed bag.  You may get a good deal, but end up spending more than the bike is worth on replacing parts/ repairs.  Obvious things like tires and rims and frame condition can give you a superficial sense of how the bike has been treated, but you will have to have a sense of the internals such as hubs, headset, bearings, bottom brackets and shifters/levers and cables.  Spin the wheels to see how 'true' or straight they are.  Squeeze pairs of spokes to see how taut or loose they are.  Lift the bike by the seat and work the pedals to see if the crankarms are loose.  look for missing or loose teeth on the cogs and gear rings.  Better yet, have someone else lift the back of the bike by the seat and pedal with one hand while you shift with the other to see how smoothly it shifts or whether the shift levers and cables are in good shape.  Put your ear on the seat and slowly turn the pedals in reverse and listen carefully for any grinding or missing bearings, a good bottom bracket should not make any strange sounds.  If at all possible, RIDE THE BIKE!  You will find out immediately what problems exist if any. Parts for bikes are not cheap and many require special tools to install or remove, so make this consideration when you are bidding on the bike.  If the auction bike requires more than $200 in parts, don't bother buying it unless it is a high end bike in good condition that you plan to ride for a few years and keep professionally maintained.

**3. Quality:** reputable big name brands like Trek, Specialized, Giant, Gary Fisher, Cannondale etc. are going to be better build bikes and more expensive, which generally means that the owners will have treated them better and kept them well-maintained.  They will probably require less maintenance over time but the parts will be expensive.  On the other hand, a cheaper Hardware Store bike from Canadian Tire or Walmart will be cheaper, throwaway type bikes that have lower quality parts(ie plastic housings instead of metal) that often cannot be replaced and may end up with you having to get rid of the bike altogether.  Some people buy lots of cheap bikes and ride them to failure, others buy more expensive bikes and fix and replace what needs it.  Depending on your budget, needs, and how and where you ride, you will have to decide which approach works better for you. 


Whatever bike you chose, be ready to commit some time and/or money to it to get it rolling properly and maintaining it after.  The most important thing you can do to keep it in good shape is to keep it clean.  The preferred method is bucket and sponge, but if you must use a hose or God forbid a pressure washer(!), steer clear of any sealed hubs or bearings (hubs on both wheels, bottom bracket and headset[where the forks and handlebars connect to the frame]).  Let the bike dry then lightly lubricate the chain, cables, and other moving parts.

Hope this helps a little.  Don't get ripped off, maybe you can even get a steal of a deal on a really nice bike if you are lucky!",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_1d7zwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/1d7zwt/bike_auction_today_i_though_id_share_a_few_basics/,

This sums up why perfectly. http://imgur.com/a/Wai2A

The building is sealed, none of the windows can be opened. The climate is supposed to be controlled by some fancy geothermal heating/cooling unit, but it is absolutely terrible. You have no control over the temperature of your unit. I had a party at New Year's with about 8 people. The thermostat was set as low as it would go, and the circulation fan was set as high as high as it would go. The temperature got to about 35 degrees and one of my guests passed out from heat exhaustion. For the past week it has been between 29 and 31 degrees in my unit, which was advertised as having air conditioning. Since I and my roommate have moved in, we have had maybe two days where the temperature was less than 25 degrees. Maintenance requests for this issue fall on deaf ears, but after speaking with one of the newer building supers, it's the most complained about issue.

I'm looking to meet some new people in Winnipeg, but I'm really not sure how to go about that. I'm a male in my mid-20s, recently moved to Winnipeg, and don't really know many people in the area. And the few longtime friends I know and hang out with are in the married/kids stage already, so I rarely meet anyone new through those outings. I've met some people through my new job, but they're for the most part older than me and have families of their own.

I've heard that bars/clubs can work, but I don't know many people that would want to go, and going to a bar by oneself doesn't seem like it would work that great. Any events oriented around meeting people would be good, but I don't know if/where those occur.
  
If it triggers any ideas, I'm into gaming, movies, drinking, reading, and current events/politics. Unfortunately I'm not big on sports or snow, so  I'm even lower on ideas than usual this time of year.

If anyone has any suggestions on places to try, or knows of any local events/groups where I could meet similar types of people, I would greatly appreciate it!

Edit:
Just wanted to thank everyone for your PMs and suggestions! I haven't had a chance to go through them all yet, but fully intend to respond to everyone!

She runs 3 different Adult Literacy Programs for years in the city and someone who has worked for her for years has informed me of all this stolen tax payer money and I want i to stop. There are way too many of these bull shite programs eating up all of our over taxed money and it needs to stop one by one. Doing my part cause the government has allowed this to go on too long.

Thanks for the input and great advice. I am on this and I wont give up because this is blatant fraud and theft of  tax payer money and Someone needs to put a stop to this so maybe someone who actually gives a damn about Adult Literacy will take over and do the right thing with the grant money. Not anti government programs just Anti  Rip off and lining your own pockets with government program money. And yes I have enough proof to start an investigation and if more people did this maybe the government will keep a closer eye on where this money is Actually going to.

The South Osborne Bike Hub (A Lord Roberts Community Centre program) is having a fundraising social , there will be awesome (mostly bike related) prizes, good music , drinks , FREE bike tune-ups . There's an 'event' up on facebook (South Osborne Hub-aloo !) and tickets are 10 dollars. 

If anyone hasn't heard of the SOBH we're a community oriented , volunteer run bike shop where people can come learn how to fix/maintain/build a bike! We have programs with the community centre helping the kids their learn some wrenching skills. 

Open Monday and Thursday 6-9pm. 

If you're interested come down to the social, or just pop in during open hours , I'd be happy to show you around.

Cheers.

Also , please tell your friends! We're trying to get visibility up for the Hub and our social. Thanks !

**Final Edit: Because it's a social tickets NEED to be purchased ahead of time , you can pick them up at The Bike Hub, WRENCH, Mondragon , Bikes And Beyond, and I believe Natural Cycle.

The kids were basically unloved and existed simply to generate welfare.  It was not cool having 30 kids at your pool and zero parents there, every day.  There was some seriously disgusting incidents that also occured.

The kids in the North End were not bad however, and their parents seemed to love them and take care of them and watch them.

I was uncomfortable before the season started, when it was clear they stopped being honest with fans... from the reasons behind their food/drink and noise-maker policies to the excuses on why the stadium is/was late (I will never be convinced that *wind* was the cause.)  Garth's Buchko's explanation on the stadium delay was all marketing double-speak and was completely insincere. 

I was willing to look past all that, because I had faith in the football operations.  Even though we lost some key players over the off season, I never questioned the team's spirit.  This was never so evident as it was on Aug 24 vs the Lions.  Even though they lost, I left the stadium that night feeling like they were on the verge of a turn-around.

My faith in the Bombers football operations was crushed the next morning when Joe Mack fired Coach LaPo.  I knew right then that that turn-around I had felt the night before had just been turned to dust.  I know Mack had his reasons ... but it just seemed like a real slime-ball move.  Like he went right from talking to the players to firing LaPo without trying to fix what he felt was broken. And the timing of the move - even I could tell it was just wrong.

Since Mack fired LaPo, the Bombers have been outscored 120-28.  This team, as a whole, from the board right down to the players, well they just don't care.  So why should I?  Good luck Bombers paying for your new stadium.  Call me when you fire the board, Buchko, Mack, and the coaching staff.

(Really, my decision to cancel my tickets was cinched when Mack blamed the 52-0 loss (in part) on the death of Coach Harris.  That was truly disgusting.)",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_zwvb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/zwvb3/on_monday_i_will_be_cancelling_my_bombers_season/,

I was driving off the perimeter merge onto main southbound. Some idiot in their car decided not to move into the left lane to let me in, even though there was no traffic anywhere. I didnt want to go full stop so I decided to merge behind her at 40 kmh pulling an awkward angle and went right into an ice patch. A nice skidding steer for the next 100m followed with me trying not to slide into the very busy oncoming lane or hit cars driving by in the right lane. Got out of it fine but the back end of the car hit a curb at one point, luckily not too hard. 

Lessons to learn: 

1. There is no salt or sand on the roads right now and its fucking slippery. 

2. I know its not obligatory to pull over to let someone merge but for the love of God if it is possible please do! especially when your the only person on the goddamn road! 

3. Take your car to an empty parking lot that's covered in snow and practice steering when you're in a skid. It comes in handy to have experience cause I could have easy been in a horrible accident just now. 

Oh and I dropped my ipod on the sidewalk when I was opening my door at home and it exploded. 2x the shittyness today :(

Spent the first nice Saturday of the year exploring downtown.  I got my first exposure to ""community"" down there.  Two men sleeping (passed out) right on the sidewalk, a big group smoking weed outside of The Woodbine &amp; one just straight up pissing on the sidewalk in front of the MTS. Seriously....full blown piss, 7:00pm, people walking all around him.  He was laughing at people who were shooting looks at him, but nobody dared say anything because he was part of a bigger crew nearby.

It intimidating down there and I felt completely unsafe at times.  Almost like if you look at one of them the wrong way they might decide to start shit with you. There seemed to be lots of cool people in the exchange, but there's so many drunk/high shitheads that it ruins the whole experience.

How do the normal people of Winnipeg feel about this?  Do you just not notice it anymore or do you just avoid downtown because of it?

I am 26. I gave up my education for him, he discouraged me from working and wanted me to basicaly be his mother. I think this will be a blessing in disguise as I would love to go back to school and be my own person again. I am finally over tje grief and I am ready to begine protecting my legal interests. 

As he deals with the Stoffman's firm already, I am certain he has already retained him (although I did request of them, a conflict of interest search so who knows).  

I hear he is the best and my husband made it quite clear he has been planning this for while. Therefor, I would really like to hear from y'all wpg redditors; Who would you recommend?

EDIT: 
just in case it gets buried ..
*He had nothing when I met him, other than his truck and toolbox. I helped him with his drinking problem and grew his construction company with him. I did all the admin, encouraged him to move the office from out of the basement and taught him to work ""on his business"", rather than in it. 

He is a sneaky bastard. I know he is going to do everything possible to protect himself.

I talked to a few friends who worked in the pizza circuit,  and it turns out every place has their own signature sauce. I tracked down one aquaintance who worked at the north end Verns and he told me their secret ingredient is ANCHOVIES!

SOmeone once asked the owner if they should let people know. They got aa very stern talking to about trying to take business away from the company. Apparently management has a ""what they don't know won't hurt them"" philosophy. But it DID hurt my boyfriend. I called them and was dismissed by the dopey sounding supervisory guy working there.

This is a duplex type home, and is rented out to 2 sets of people at one time. For the last approx. 15 years, this house has changed occupants every 3-6 months and at least half if not 75% of them have been nothing but trouble.

Constant parties, rude obnoxious unruly children running around, drunken fights and scuffles, tresspasing. You name it, it happened.

Throughout this time, there had been times when someone would throw garbage out of the window. Both kitchens in this house face my parents house and their sidewalk leading into the backyard. At first, it was strange, and then it was annoying but we would speak to the current tenants and they would stop for a while, no big deal... About 3 years ago, I had enough. People were moving out and decided to throw household junk AND garbage out of both windows. I brought their mop and garbage back onto their porch and left it there. The next day, my dog found a pound of rancid meat that had been thrown out of said window, and that was it!

I phoned the provincial landlord and tenancy board to lodge a formal complaint. They said there was nothing they could do as an official would have to come and see it happening or we would have to catch this person(s). They instructed me to send a registered letter to the landlord himself and make the complaint directly to him. This was done, and he even showed up a week later with my letter and told my dad it would not happen again.

Well, it's happening again. KFC scraps and condoms are the hot ticket today! I phoned 311 as the landlord tenancy board is closed and they said to call the cops.

The cops rarely come out anymore as they have been called to that house many times, and seem to not give a care. I know as I have made numerous but legit calls to them and never see results.

What can I do? Has ANYONE else had this type of problem? Help!! The longer this goes on, the more I fear for my parents safety, the safety of our dog, and their home.

I messaged anyone who showed interest in a /r/winnipeg board games meetup with a link to a survey to figure out the best time and place to do this. If you're interested in participating and you want a say when and where this is going to go down, [complete this 30 second survey that I whipped up](http://eardrums.ca/gameform/gameform.php). Using your suggestions, I'll follow up with another thread in a few days to iron out more definite plans. Thanks!*

Pecking out this message very slowly because I've got a bandaged hand (PROTIP: oil can be hot, especially when heated):

When you think of board games, what do you imagine? Probably something like Monopoly or Risk. Candyland, maybe. The analogy's not perfect, but these are the board game equivalent of McDonald's food. Cheap, ubiquitous, borderline tolerable, and deeply unsatisfying.

To keep this post short, I'm just going to say that in the last 15 years or so, things have changed pretty dramatically in the board game scene/industry/hobby. Board games are actually fun now!

I have a collection of about 100 games. I play with my friends, my fiancé, my parents, and total strangers, so I need a really wide variety. Some take 10 minutes; some take a whole afternoon. None of them are as boring as Monopoly or Risk. (It's probably also worth mentioning that less than half of these games have a sci-fi/fantasy theme, in case that's a turn-off.)

My appetite for playing games is apparently bigger than my friends', so I'm looking to expand my board gaming group. I'm also interested in trying to get new people into the hobby.

So: 

* Would any of y'all be interested in learning more about modern board games? 
* Anyone have any favourites that you'd recommend? 
* Say I was to arrange a r/winnipeg board game night. I could host, or we could take over a coffee shop or pub. Would that be interesting, or a waste of time? 

**EDIT**: Here are some of the games we play that see a lot of table time:

* Settlers of Catan
* Ticket To Ride
* Carcassonne
* Dominion
* Race for the Galaxy 
* Dixit
* 7 Wonders",,False,self,t5_2qtno,1339344298.0,,,True,t3_uq2t6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/uq2t6/who_likes_board_games/,

Are slow songs/waltzes expected or would that be weird at a social?

Also, are there any traditions or routines that are unique to socials that I should know?  Are there any big no-no's when at a social? What are some things from socials you've been to that were really memorable or really made the social fun and enjoyable (that the DJ did or was responsible).

I have winter tires on my van and drive pretty carefully and I *still* found it pretty slippery out there yesterday and today.  I didn't even see a sand  truck out until late last night.

My point is, the posted speed limit is the maximum speed under *optimum* conditions.  Even then, there is nothing saying you have to travel at the maximum speed.  Why would you not err on the side of caution just to get where you're going a couple minutes faster?  I don't know what this woman was driving like, but I guess it doesn't matter for her now...

My name's Morley. My wife and I will be here to make this global meet up day the best ever and ensure you're having a blast at all times, if anything is bothering you at the time, or anyone specifically bugging you or harassing you just come talk to us on the side and well make sure it stops.
If there are a chance of showers and it rains then we will be switching the venue to the forks due to being able to host us all inside and we can make the best of a bad situation. Mass messages will go out a few days prior to the event.

Enter the water valve. I didn't even see it. It stopped the mower dead when I went over it and killed the blade bad.

Tell us what to see and do.,21,3,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/y2cp9/were_spending_the_next_36_hours_in_winnipeg_to/,"My wife and I, a pair of nerdy, childless, late 20 somethings, are looking to abandon the Toronto area.  We want to put down roots in a  simpler, somewhat more quiet lifestyle.  Having never seen much outside of Southern Ontario we decided to take a week to take a look at the Prarie provinces.

We landed this morning in Winnipeg and have a week to check out 4 cities here we're thinking of moving to; Winnipeg, Brandon, Regina and Saskatoon.

Because this trip is to get a glimpse of what the city is like from a resident's point of view instead of a tourists, we're looking for a slightly different perspective.

We've already talked to some locals, checked out a few neighborhoods, gone pretend grocery shopping to see how a grocery bill would compare etc.

What else should we do while we're here and what do we need to know to get a better taste of what it's really like here?

While we're at it, a few suggestions for a cool place to hang out tonight would work, too.

EDIT: So we've been touring for the past 2 days.  Sargent Sundae was packed but cool, Osborne Village reminded me a bit of Kensington Market in TO and the Corydon had decent places to eat.  Food in general seems to be a bit more expensive here than in TO.

Grand Beach was pretty cool.  The drive up reminds me more of Northern Ontario without the hills and rock cuts.  What's Selkirk like? We drove through on our way down, stopped to take a pic of that ugly ass catfish statue and the town seemed chill but kinda run down.

As far as neighborhoods go, I can see how the sketchier neighbourhoods got called out but to be honest everything seemed nicer and safer than Toronto.  Maybe it's one of those things where you can't tell how bad it is until you're there when the sun goes down.  We asked more people for their opinions of the city and got pretty positive reviews.  Even when we started asking people what sucked about the city people seemed pretty positive, aside from a consensus to avoid the NW parts of the city and hatred of winter.

My wife (reddit lurker) and I came to town to visit her grandparents. All in all I had a great time, but had a few questions and observations I was curious about.

1) I was in Transcona for the first few days. Is it illegal to wear shirts with sleeves? (and generally appear clean?) I got some weird looks (wearing a collared polo shirt).

2) Does no one in this city signal? We Calgary drivers are assholes, but seriously... random direction changes are scary.

3) Why do your streets magically morph into new streets with a different name even though its the same street (ie - Regent).

4) Went to see a relative play Polo at Birds Hill Park, that was awesome. Very nice park. Also polo is cool, but would be better with swords (personal opinion).

5) Just an observation but my back has never sweat so much. Jesus.

6) St. Vital has no starbucks. Can someone get on that?

7) Your grass is WAY softer here. (I mean lawn grass that I walked on /r/trees people)

8) Was feeling lazy and dropped into a local crossfit gym (Crossfit Winnipeg) - awesome group of people.

9) Why is rye bread like tasting heaven here, and shit in Calgary?

This isn't an ad asking for anyone to take me and my cat in, but I'm sure some of you redditors have lived in, or know of, some of the places around the city that will allow small animals.  From there I can contact the company to inquire about openings.  If someone could help point me in the right direction that would be fantastic!

Note:  I have checked out the places on the [Winnipeg Humane Society Pet-Friendly Housing Listing](http://www.winnipeghumanesociety.ca/pet-friendly-housing), but it seems pretty outdated, and either google can't find the complexes at all, there's no vacancy, or they're just *waaay* the hell on the other end of the city.  I don't think it's a complete list.

Thanks guys.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/ZSv7M.jpg) a picture of the little fluff ball I'll be carting around as a thank you.  I was up until 3:30am last night googling, and this is kind of my last resort before sitting in front of my computer and refreshing for new ads on Kijiji 24 hours a day.",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_nivpr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/nivpr/petfriendly_apartment_complexes_in_the_city/,

I, in an effort to not ride over her, took a serious wipeout, making me bleed from various points. She was very apologetic, and I was not going to hold a grudge. I picked up my bike, dusted off the gravel from me, swore a little and went on my way. I knew that in the morning I was going to be sore, but was late for a meeting and couldn't really think about that at the moment.

Anyhow, I get to and attend the meeting, bike home and go to bed. however, at about 1 in the morning I wake up in serious pain. My wrist, which I had apparently fell on, had swollen up like a mother-fucker and I was troubled by it. I took some Advil and iced it for a while, then tried to go back to sleep. This failed, and by 3 in the morning I was concerned that I had actually hurt myself, so I called Health Links(a 24hr. phone service where a nurse will do his/her best to help you over the phone) who told me that I should probably get it checked out sooner than later. 

With my girlfriend's help, I put on some clothes and head off into the night. I live about a 15 minute walk from the Misieracordia Hospital, so I just hoofed it. It was a nice warm night. I arrived at the hospital at about 3:30 and was promplty met by the triage nurse, who informed me, in the friendliest way possible, that the x-ray lab was closed between 2:00 and 7:30 each morning. My options were to stay there for a few hours, go home and come back in the morning or head out to a different hospital, of which the closest would be St.B or the HSC. I opted for the St.B, and so after a short cab ride, I found myself in my second emergency room of the night. I estimate that my arrival was around 4, or shortly after.

After the triage, I sat in the waiting room for about 30 minutes before I was led to a room to be seen by a doctor. Half an hour later he came to see me, and  I was sent off for x-rays. 10 minutes later, the results came back(negative, thankfully, seriously sprained though(this is taking forever to type with one hand)), I was given a small dose of T3's and sent on my merry way. I would have been home by 6:30, but the buses weren't running yet, so I walked over to a McD's and watched sports highlights in the very swanky new interior.

As I sat in McDonald's with my ""coffee,"" it occurred to me that very few cities on earth could have provided me such a pleasant night, given my circumstances. I think that as Winnipegers we sell ourselves short, but really, I walked through part of downtown at 3am without even thinking about my safety, because it simply was not a concern. Then I went to perhaps the second busiest ER in the city and was in and out, with a totally non-vital injury in a little less than 2 hours.

tl;dr I fell down and hurt myself, then went for a late night walk and got some totally free, fast and excellent health care. ",,False,self,t5_2qtno,False,,,True,t3_g6x2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/g6x2r/why_i_dont_mid_this_place/,
