I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. My son is three.

[I have a show about writing on Felicia Day's Youtube Channel: Geek and Sundry](http://geekandsundry.com/)

I also run a [charity called Worldbuilders.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2012/11/worldbuilders-2012/) Over the last four years we've raised over 1.5 million dollars for Heifer International.

[Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&amp;A sessions I run on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

1. You can ask any question.

2. Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

3. One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

4. I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

  4b. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

5. I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

6. I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

**I will be back at 8PM Central to answer questions.**


**[Edit at 10:15 PM:] Merciful Buddha. I thought I was getting to the end of the list, when it turns out I was just getting to the end of the first 500 comments. I'll stop back tomorrow and take another quick poke through things, and answer a few more questions. But for now, I've used up all my words. I need to get a little nap in, then do some more writing tonight. Thanks for a great time everybody.**

*******************************


Hi, I'm Jim Butcher.  I'm the guy who takes credit for the Dresden Files, the Codex Alera, and one Spider-Man novel for Marvel.  I've done a bunch of jobs, some of which sucked, some of which were fairly awesome, from selling vacuum cleaners to graveyard-shift tech-support for an ISP.  The best part about my current job is that I can do it in my pajamas and I never, ever have to wear a freaking tie.

I like martial arts, boffer-weapon fighting, first person shooters on a PC, and I probably play a bit more League of Legends than is good for me.  I read a lot.  Go figure.  I watch lots of nerd-compatible TV, and me and my writer-wife compete to see who can sum up the plot of any given show first and most accurately.  We usually get it done by about five minutes in.  I play a little guitar, a little keyboard, and I make noises which at times resemble singing.  I shoot a little, mostly with the finest weapon technology the 1860s had to offer, when I'm not using the finest weapon technology the 1860s BC had to offer.  I'm nearly adequate with either.

I'll be dropping by for an **AMA this Tuesday at 7pm central time**, so come on by and feel free to Ask Me Anything.  I'll answer.  I can't promise the answers will be any good, but I'll answer. :)",,False,self,t5_2qknd,1353466977.0,,,True,t3_13iexg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/13iexg/hi_im_jim_butcher_im_the_guy_who_takes_credit_for/,

I'm Brandon Sanderson, author of a number of novels.  I'm probably most well-known for being the one chosen to finish (and hopefully not screw up) Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  

Proof that I am who I say I am can be [found here](http://twitter.com/#!/BrandSanderson/status/108962032384090112). (That is a verified account.) 

I've been on reddit for several years now, mostly lurking.  I have an MA in creative writing, and have been known to teach the occasional class on the topic of writing sf/f.  I also run a Hugo-award-nominated [writing podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/). 

So, yeah.  That's probably enough of an introduction.  I should probably mention that [I released one of my novels ~~into the Public Domain~~ **with a creative commons license (sorry, herpderp moment)**](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/book/Warbreaker/page/20/WARBREAKER-The-Free-Fantasy-Book-Download).  That is a stand-alone epic fantasy novel, which I've also [fully annotated](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/annotation/book/Warbreaker) chapter by chapter. 

If you're curious to try out my work, you can do it there for free--though many readers prefer the Mistborn trilogy as a starting point.  You can read novellas I've written [here](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/library/53/Recent-Short-Stories---Defending-Elysium-Part-1) and [here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2008/12/firstborn).

Anyway, thanks for having me, and let's have at it.  I'll answer questions off and on for the next four hours or so.   Ask me anything. 

**EDIT 1: Okay, folks.  I'm going to give 10 more min for questions to come in.  I will do a 'snapshot' reload of the page with all comments shown in 10 min.  I will try to get to all of those questions eventually, though it may take a few days as I taper off my answering.**


**EDIT 2 And...I'm calling it!  Anything on this page right now, I will try to get to.  Warning, if you send me PMs in the next few days, I might not see them because of the flood of replies to this thread.  But I'll try!  I'll post on twitter/facebook when I'm finished with this.  There have been a ton of good questions, and I've answered a large number of them.  I think many people will find them very interesting.**

Thank you so much, reddit, for the welcome.  If I didn't get to your question, try a PM in a week or two or find me in /r/fantasy or the like.  I hang out here frequently, and I try to be free and open with my time.

Neal Stephenson here. I wrote a number of books including Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, The Baroque Cycle, Anathem, and most recently REAMDE (pronounced reem-dee) which came out in trade paperback a couple of weeks ago. I'm also one of several co-authors of THE MONGOLIAD, an epic historical fantasy which we published electronically starting in 2010 and which has recently been brought out in paperback by 47North.

THE MONGOLIAD is set in [Foreworld](http://foreworld.com/), which is a slightly tweaked alternate history of the planet that we live on, showcasing the historical martial arts traditions of [mostly] the west. We're hoping to make this the basis of additional fiction and graphic novels as well as filmed entertainment and video games. As much as I hate to type out this disagreeable buzzword, this is, in other words, a transmedia project. There. I said it.

As part of that, we've been quietly working for a few years on a sword fighting video game that we believe will be much more satisfactory than anything out there now. Its code name is [CLANG and here is the Kickstarter for it](http://kck.st/NoObyE). If you have ever played a video game with sword fighting and gotten the distinct impression that what you're doing bears no resemblance in any way to what actual sword fighting might be like, consider visiting the page and donating.

For a day they offered the ebook at $1.99 and put it on their daily deals.

Excitement! The book charged up the charts, became #1 best seller in fantasy, knocking Game of Thrones etc out of the way, and reaching #18 in fiction as a whole.

I get 25% on ebook sales. But it's 25% of what the publisher get, and on books selling for less than $2.99 the publisher gets 35% of the sale price rather than 70%. So I got 25% of 35% of $1.99 ... which is 17 cents.

So, if the book sold a thousand copies that day (it probably didn't do _that_ well, but that would be awesome) I made $170. Once I've paid 15% to my agent and 20% tax I'll pocket just under 12 cents a copy or make $120 on the thousand copies sold. 

Today I just came back from the post office having spent $30 mailing out two copies to reviewers and a prize from a blog competition.

I'm doing very well compared to most fantasy writers.

We are not rich.

Yesterday some ....person... commented on my blog that he had stolen my book because buying it involved some effort.

That's all I have to say about that.

5 I reserve the right to lie, or at least be wildly inaccurate.


6 Complete sentences, punctuation, and spelling words out in their entirety is encouraged. I’m more likely to pass over your question if it contains abhorrences like “ur.”


7 If I’ve already answered the question in depth on my blog, or in one of my innumerable online interviews, I’m going to pass over it.


7b If some lovely person wants to post up a link to where the answer to that question can be found, that would be appreciated.

Terry Goodkind here. Thank you for having me. Twenty years ago I began writing THE SWORD OF TRUTH series, starting with the epic fantasy adventure, WIZARD'S FIRST RULE. I've had Millions of books sold, a few #1 New York Times Bestsellers, 14 published major novels, 1 short-form novella, and a television series loosely based on the books called LEGEND OF THE SEEKER (produced by Sam Raimi). Recently, I've ventured into self-publishing. 

THE FIRST CONFESSOR: The Legend of Magda Searus is now available in exclusive ebook format. It's a self-published full-length novel and we've stirred big waves with its release. I'd be happy to answer any questions you guys may have, particularly related to the triumphs and controversies of self-publishing, including our interactions with book piracy, publishers, fans, expectations, industry conflicts, marketing, and the rest of it.

I live in Las Vegas with my wife, Jeri Goodkind, and when I'm not writing, I'm an avid race car driver. I won the Radical Racing Series Unlimited Championship last year and a team endurance race after that. Prior to becoming a bestselling author, I was a professional artist, violin maker, and I worked in antiques restoration.

Again, thank you for having me and I look forward to answering as many of your questions as I can. I feel very fortunate to be able to live my dream of being an author and I have the support of readers to thank for that.

Feel free to ask me anything.  I am currently publishing a trilogy titled *Dark Legacy of Shannara*.  The first book, *Wards of Faerie*, published last year.  Tomorrow, *Bloodfire Quest* will be released.  And in four months, *Witch Wraith* will conclude the series.  I think this is some of my best writing to date.  For those of you who have read *The Elfstones of Shannara*, the *Dark Legacy* trilogy might be right up your alley.


In November 2012, I partnered with my Web Druid Shawn Speakman to create *The Annotated Sword of Shannara*.  The 200 or so annotations give a bit of insight into how *Sword* came to be written, how it found its way to editor Lester del Rey, and how it eventually went on to be published.


For you new writers out there, I wrote a memoir / writing guide titled *Sometimes the Magic Works*.  Might be fun for you.


When I'm not writing, I spend my time traveling, enjoying my family, and reading whatever I can get my hands on.


Looking forward to answering your questions and talking about fantasy!


All the best,

I’m Robin Hobb, and I’m all ready for my second AMA here on Reddit.   You may truly ‘Ask Me Anything’ today.  But, to save a bit of time and duplicate questions and the pleasures of reading a new book, it would be great if readers did 3 small things. 

First, please be wary of spoilers, not just for Blood of Dragons, but for all the books.  There is a technique for masking spoilers; please try to use it. 

 Secondly, please visit the Frequently Asked Questions page on http://www.robinhobb.com 

   Then you won’t have to ask me “When does the next book come out?”  Or “Why do you write under two names?” Or even “Will you ever write about Fitz and the Fool again?”  You will already know!   

 
And my final request is to do a quick skim of the questions that have already been posted.  If someone has already asked your question, please ask a different one!


I think this will make it more fun for all of us!  I’ll be back at 6 PM my time (West Coast) which is 8 PM central time.  I’ll see you then!

I'm still [Guy Gavriel Kay](http://www.brightweavings.com/), a year after our first encounter here. I enjoyed that last AMA a lot, so I'm happy to be back, despite a (more or less accurate) label as an irritable curmudgeon. Reddit seems to like curmudgeons, so we should be fine again.

This is an eventful period for me, actually. That 12th novel I was working on last time, River of Stars, was published just a week ago, and I go on the road with it, in and out of home, in a few days. It seems like a good time to sit at my desk for an evening, a drink at one elbow (no, not at each elbow, that's a slanderous rumor), and visit with reddit again.

There were some terrific questions last time I was here [I mean that, good questions can startle, stimulate, make you happy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/pgf2s/hello_im_the_author_guy_gavriel_kay_ama/)

And, by the way, we aren't limited to the new book tonight. I'm good at gliding airily past what I don't want to deal with (usually because it demands a too-long answer) but it is an open field here for you. I know reddit has a clever spoiler-hiding device, so let's try to remember to use it if you've got book-specific questions, especially about the newest one.

**I'll be back at 7:00 PM CDT, 8:00 EDT for a couple of hours, at least.**

Play ball. (It's baseball season. Joy.)

Okay, Reddit, you gave it your best shot and I am (almost) still standing, or typing. I have little doubt the bones of mangled, mistyped words are strewn about the plain behind me, pale in the bleaching moonlight.

I really did enjoy it. Sharp, smart, funny, touching questions. You realize that if I may subvert my curmudgeonlinessistude, Reddit screws itself royally by being patient and empathetic and thoughtful. What the hell were you doing?

Seriously? Doing fine. 

Thank you. Will stop in tomorrow to clean up a few missed question. If you add more now I'll look at those too.

Be well, all of you.

1347863112.0,346,self.Fantasy,100fh2,In memoriam: Robert Jordan passed away five years ago today,403,57,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/100fh2/in_memoriam_robert_jordan_passed_away_five_years/,"On October 17, 1948, a man named James Oliver Rigney, Jr. was born. This birth was not the beginning; there are  neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was *a* beginning. And on September 16, 2007, five years ago today, James Oliver Rigney passed away from cardiac amyloidosis.

I'd like to take a moment to pay tribute to this great man and giant of Fantasy literature. For various reasons, the Wheel of Time gets a lot of hate on this sub, but for many of us it stands as one of the greatest stories ever told. I've been following the story of Rand and company for almost 20 years, and no other books have played a bigger role in my imagination or my life as a reader.

James Rigney, aka Robert Jordan, was a true groundbreaker. Rigney was the first modern fantasy author to seriously build a massive, many-volumed epic; the Wheel of Time had 5 books published before Terry Goodkind published *Wizard's First Rule*, 6 books published before George R.R. Martin published *A Game of Thrones*, and 8 books published before Steven Erikson published *Gardens of the Moon*. Rigney was breaking major tropes before it was cool; the idea that the Chosen One would be greeted not as a savior but feared as a destroyer was revolutionary.

Nearly everyone agrees that the first 5-7 books in the series are an absolute triumph of the fantasy genre. While no one argues that the series got bogged down in the last few books Rigney wrote, he was able to get things back on pace before he passed away with *Knife of Dreams*, the final book he published for the series.

As he was dying, Rigney was working ferociously, trying to get his fans to the final scene that was one of the first things he ever wrote for the series. Though he was not able to see his work finished, he left enough behind for Brandon Sanderson to carry the series over the finish line, with many fantastic scenes (according to Sanderson) being very close to Rigney's words verbatim.

So let's take a moment today and pay tribute to this great man, and make sure that his myth is not forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_100fh2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/100fh2/in_memoriam_robert_jordan_passed_away_five_years/,

My day job is writing for Time magazine. I'm the book critic, and I sometimes write about technology. Lately I've been writing a weekly books column for the website -- you can find the archive of those [here]( http://entertainment.time.com/author/levgrossman/?iid=ent-main-contrib).

I also write a blog, which is [here]( http://levgrossman.com/blog/) that covers news about my books, personal stuff, advice to writers, that kind of thing. And I tweet [here]( https://twitter.com/#!/leverus). 


More biodata: I was born in 1969, which makes me 42. I'm married with two daughters and live in Brooklyn, NY. I have an older sister who's a mathematical sculptor and a twin brother who's a writer and a video game designer. I like video games and comic books and all that other stuff.

AMA",370,50,392,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/qk5dt/hi_redditors_my_name_is_brent_weeks_im_an_epic/,"Hi, Redditors, my name is Brent Weeks. I'm a 34 year-old epic fantasy writer, and I'm best known for writing the *Night Angel trilogy: The Way of Shadows, Shadow's Edge*, and *Beyond the Shadows*. Right now, I'm published in 14 languages, and it's probably my fault (well, my publisher's) that you see **lots** of hooded men on the covers of fantasy books these days. (Not claiming I originated it *cough* AC *cough* publishers *cough*.)
 
After the Night Angel trilogy, I decided that rather than go the safe route and write the same style book for the rest of my career, that I would try something very different. *The Lightbringer Series* is that. [It is set in an alternate-Mediterranean world in 1600, with rudimentary firearms, swords, and magic.]( http://www.thewayofshadows.com/books/the-black-prism-trilogy/black-prism/)
 
[*The Black Prism*](http://www.brentweeks.com/books/the-black-prism-trilogy/black-prism/) also hit the NYT (low, but hey!) and *The Blinding Knife* is finished except for copy edits and will be released in September.
 
I've also recently written [Perfect Shadow](http://www.brentweeks.com/books/perfect-shadow/), which is a novella (17k words) set in the Night Angel universe that tells, roughly, the story of how Durzo Blint became Durzo Blint. It's set before the NAT chronologically, but is meant to be read afterward. I published that as an e-book, and have had a mixed experience with e-only. (It's also in two audio editions and a limited print edition, but I didn't catch hell for those.)
 
I'm a gamer (PC but mostly 360 because I already sit at my computer all day long). Love Breaking Bad, just started The Wire.
I do social media: [G+](https://plus.google.com/113394997361756536974/posts), [the Face](http://www.facebook.com/brent.weeks), and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/brentweeks). I have [my own web page, of course,](
http://www.brentweeks.com/) with a forum, [a monthly writing advice post that goes live the first of each month](http://www.brentweeks.com/extras/writing-advice/,) and like most writers who aren't technophobes, I'm always trying to figure out which things are worth my time (as opposed to just, you know, writing more books).
 
Some years ago, I skipped Reddit and did Digg instead, a choice over which I weep manly tears. And just to be relentlessly uncool:  I started with a BB Storm (which I actually liked for a while out of sheer ignorance because it was my first smart phone), went to Android (Incredible 1), and now own an iPhone 4S. I'm no fanboi, but I'm happiest with the iPhone. (I know, I know.) I love tech, but it's a humanities major's love of tech--like a particularly appreciative eunuch in a harem.
 
My writing has a lot of surprising twists, so it can be hard to talk about some of the more fun things I do without providing spoilers, so I won't ban spoiler-y questions, but **please** do make liberal use of the existence of the spoiler hiding post [This is my written spoiler] followed by (/spoiler).
 
**I will return at 7PM CST to answer questions live.**

Thanks for having me on your forum. Please be gentle:  I'm a lowly wordsmith, not a PR flack for Woody Harrelson.

I intend to do that when I finish [The Lightbringer Series](http://www.brentweeks.com/books/the-black-prism-trilogy/), which I'm planning to be four books. [The Black Prism](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Prism-Lightbringer-Brent-Weeks/dp/0316246271/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375130508&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+black+prism) just got a sweet new cover and release in trade paperback, and [The Blinding Knife](http://www.amazon.com/Blinding-Knife-Brent-Weeks/dp/1841499064/ref=tmm_pap_title_0) will be released in trade paper on August 27th. I've recently finished the second draft of The Broken Eye, which is slated to come out next summer.

As I mentioned at my [last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/qk5dt/hi_redditors_my_name_is_brent_weeks_im_an_epic/): My writing has a lot of surprising twists, so it can be hard to talk about some of the more fun things I do without providing spoilers, so though I'll answer spoiler-y questions (up to the end of what I have published only, of course), please do make liberal use of the existence of the spoiler hiding post [This is my written spoiler] followed by (/spoiler). I'll check in throughout the day to see what deviltry awaits me--I don't have the willpower not to--but I'll be answering questions from 7pm CST to 9pm CST. I'll swing by tomorrow to mop up the survivors, but if you haven't seen me answer YOUR question by then, you needn't refresh your browser constantly. I will do my best to answer all questions--except the ones I have no clever response for. So, maybe, indeed, a lot. You MAY see some other authors pop in here, but I'd suggest you ignore them. Authors hate that.

~~EDIT: It is now 9pm CST, and I have to run to a prior appointment. I will be back tomorrow to finish any questions that I've missed.~~ Thank you so much everyone! Really enjoyed it.
~~EDIT2: I came back late last night and answered a bunch more questions. And I will come back again later today to hit as many of the non-redundant ones as possible.~~
**EDIT3: After spending another 5 hours late last night and this morning, I'm toast! I think I got every question that had three points or more and as many of the one and two pointers as I could. If I didn't get your question this time, sorry and I'll drink more coffee next time! Thanks for all your great questions. I really enjoyed it, now I'm going to go take a nap.**",AMA,False,self,t5_2qknd,1375306523.0,ama,best-of,True,t3_1jcugk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jcugk/im_an_author_with_cloaked_guys_on_my_covers_ask/,

I'm a full-time novelist who never expected to be able to do what I love most as a profession. I had spent 10 years writing 12 novels and after getting nowhere I quit writing completely, because I figured I was just being stupid and wasting my time. For ten years I fought with the stories that were still coming to me and decided to let them out...but only on the condition...that I wouldn't seek publication (as that way just led to pain and disappointment). After reading the first three books post writing hiatius my wife made it her mission to ""get the books out there.""

From a publishing perspective, I've done it all: small press, self, and big five. Unlike those waging a religious war between self and traditional, I feel that each path has their pros and cons, and for my own career I'm adopting they hybrid model, and doing a bit of both.

-----------------

**Writing**

I have two series out: **The Riyria Revelations (Theft of Swords | Rise of Empire | Heir of Novron)** and **The Riyria Chronicles (The Crown Tower | The Rose and Thorn)** they are related (Chronicles is a prequel to Revelations) and they can be read in order of publication (my preference) or chronological (no spoilers if you choose this route). Today is release day for The Crown Tower (The Rose and Thorn will release on Sep 17 - my birthday). To celebrate, Orbit has reduced the price on Theft of Swords to $2.99 (£1.99 in the UK).  Since it is an omnibus, with 2 full length novels, that makes them just $1.50 each.  If you want to try out my work for free, I have a short story (The Viscount and the Witch) and also an extended preview of The Crown Tower (first 5 chapters) that you can take a look at.

I have a science fiction novel: **Hollow World** that has been released only to those who pre-ordered through Kickstarter. This book will go on sale in April for the reading public at large. This project has an unusual publication history. It was turned down by my main publisher, I got a really nice five-figure offer from another publisher but I opted to keep the digital rights and I've sold off the print rights and audio rights to traditional publishers. In an usual move, I’m going to giveaway free ebooks to anyone who purchases an audio or print edition.

I have short stories in a few anthologies: **The Jester** in Unfettered, **Burning Alexandria** in The End: The End - Visions of Apocalypse, and **Autumn Mists** yet to be released.

My current work in progress is a trilogy that I recently finished book one of. Unlike some authors, I don't submit/release books as I finish. Instead, I complete the entire series so that I can adjust earlier books as I write later ones. I'm working to have book two of this series finished by Thanksgiving and the final book hopefully by April 2014.

-------------------

**Publishing**

I really love all the new opportunities going on in publishing right now, and I'm doing what I can to help existing or aspiring authors to make sense of all the changes so they can make informed decision on what is right for them. To that end I have a number of places where I discuss publishing and marketing:

* [Amazing Stories Magazine](http://amazingstoriesmag.com/author/michaelsullivan/)
* [reddit sub: Write2Publish](http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2publish)
* [My blog's Writing Related Posts](http://firstempireseries.com/writing-advice/)
* [My blog's Publishing Related Posts](http://firstempireseries.com/publishing-advice/)

----------------

Last but not least, I'm doing a reddit giveaway (open to any country) for a signed and illustrated copy of The Crown Tower along with an exclusive T-shirt (I never sell these just give them away on special occasions). I will close that contest tonight at midnight. [**You can register to win here.**](http://michaeljsullivan.polldaddy.com/s/reddit-crown-tower-giveaway) Everyone who enters will receive a free short story.

I'm pretty active here on reddit, and not shy so, please...ask me anything. I’ll be back “officially” at 7:00 PM  CST but may be stopping in before and after if needed.

**EDIT 8/7/2013 11:39 AM EST: Okay I've completed going through the whole post and I'm all caught up.  Thanks everyone for coming out and asking such great questions and showing so much enthusiasm.

This is where I hang on reddit.  Get on, check the frontpage for interesting stuff/big news, then immediately click over here.  It's the only reddit where I go through the ""new"" queue.  This is my crib!  I've had countless awesome recommendations from you guys, so thank you.  Thank you for being here, thank you for being awesome.

Now, onto one thing that a lot of you kind of suck at (bear with me, don't downvote yet, I beg you):

Recommendation threads.

There are a LOT of these.  A LOT a lot.  The problem?  It seems like about 70 to 80 percent of people don't actually read what the OP is looking for in his/her personal thread, and just rattle off the same four or five titles every time.  While this obviously isn't EVERYONE, it can be maddening because it happens ALL THE TIME.

For example, OP is looking for books with shape shifting dragons and assassins.  Hey, there are books like that out there, and there are books that are close.  The Malazan  books fit the bill, Robin Hobb's books are close, etc.  But, inevitably, you've got the one guy that pipes up with Patrick Rothfuss, or Brent Weeks, or Joe Abercrombie, or whoever else is popular.  This happens in every...single...recommendation thread.

It's not hard to mentally sieve through the stuff  you've read and actually answer the OP's question, guys.  It's not helpful to rattle off the same ten authors, regardless of what the OP is looking for.  There are PLENTY of general ""what great fantasy is out there"" threads, and THOSE are the places to list the greats.  As much as I love the hell out of Abercrombie,  stop listing his stuff in a thread where the OP is requesting modern fantasy with a steampunk element.  I'm a super Malazan junkie, love the living fuck out of Erikson, and I don't pimp his stuff in every single recommendation thread.

To sum up:

It's not helpful.
It doesn't answer the OP's question.
It makes every rec thread around here look exactly the same, and there are a LOT of rec threads around here.

As I said before, I love you guys, and I love this community.  This wasn't meant to come across as bitchy.  But I think this helpful, awesome community would be even MORE helpful and awesome if we didn't use recommendation threads as opportunities to pimp our favorite authors, and instead just answered the damned OP's question. :)",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_16gho2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/16gho2/one_of_my_biggest_gripes_with_rfantasy_something/,

I don't really expect fantastic traction on my highly optimistic and totally un-requested AMA. I mostly wanted to post to thank you all for not downvoting me to oblivion for running the Sunday Book Swoop for the last 4 weeks. Also, cakeday.

Here's [my website](http://www.snorrikristjansson.com). It's Saturday. I'm bored. Ask me anything.

Edit 1: Golly! 4 upvotes! The excitement. If we hit 7 I'll reveal a random fact about myself.

Random fact: I've done standup comedy in a boxing ring and onboard HMS Exeter just before it was decommissioned. Next random fact at 11.

Edit 2: Here's me speaking on Sky News about the [Icelandic economic crash in 2008](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJQeSqRJZ28). To this day I have *no* idea why they called me rather than, say, economists, ambassadors or politicians. Next random fact at 15.

Edit 3: I play for the Icelandic national Correspondence Chess team. Next random fact at 22. 

Edit 4: In my salad days I was in an 80's cover band with super-talented Icelandic singer-songwriter [Svavar Knutur](http://svavarknutur.com/fr_home.cfm) and assorted other genii. [This](http://www.myspace.com/mrknutur/photos/50384154) is a picture of us. Our name was 'Moonboots', and we kicked ass. I'm rocking the pink shirt. The Internet: storing your shame since 1995. Next random fact at 29.

Edit 5: I have tap-danced in front of 250 drama students. That is on a very short list of things in my life that I am *never* doing again. Next random fact at 36.

Edit 6: I got to the 12-man finals of Britain's biggest new act comedy competition, the Laughing Horse New Acts. In front of an absolutely rammed comedy club I forgot my lines and blanked out for 17 seconds. I know this because I had it on tape. Those are to date the longest 17 seconds of my life. I persevered, got through my material and went off stage determined to never do anything again (at which I failed). The [guy that came on stage after me](http://www.jackwhitehall.com/) did slightly better. Next fact at 42.

Edit 7: I went to college with Gísli Örn Garðarsson, who went on to play the [Hassansin Leader](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100323182423/lego/images/9/9b/Hassansin_Leader_2.png) in the film 'Prince of Persia' (Picture not to scale). Next one at 49.

Edit 8: Eek! I no longer remember my face. Also, '93-'97 is more of a blur. I did rack up about 550-ish levels on various WoW characters between 2005 and 2008. My productivity increased sharply when I started writing in places without internet access. 53 up votes! (and 7 down votes; I like you too. Only not as much as the others.) Next random fact at 56.

Edit 9: I am the court translator of epic Viking metal band [Skálmöld](http://www.skalmold.is/). Next random fact at 63. 

Edit 10: I spent 3 years as player/coach of arguably Iceland's worst ever men's amateur basketball team. We won one game in those three years - and it was the one where I didn't show. Next random fact at 72.

Edit 11: I lived in Norway for 7 years, between the ages of 8 and 15. It is a beautiful country full of lovely people, but my experience there instilled in me a vitriolic hatred for anything to do with skis and/or skiing. Next random fact, provided my brain doesn't melt, at 80.

Edit 12: I am an award-winning translator. I translated all three High School Musical books from English into Icelandic. This is not a joke. Next random fact at 91.

Edit 13: I was an extra in a film called A Little Trip to Heaven, and got to 'do a scene' (i.e. sit on a bus in the middle of the night) with Forrest Whittaker and a pile of other extras. I had the common sense to not bother the poor man while he was doing his job - but I got to sit through ten minutes of some random man giving poor Forrest the whole Icelandic Tourist Board routine between takes. I cringed so hard I think I lost consciousness at one point. Last random fact at 100 - my internal organs are slowly shutting down.

Edit 14: 100 upvotes. The obvious random fact should be that I am absolutely *pants* at estimating upvote worth on Reddit, but that would be slightly cop-out-ish. So here goes:

- I have worked as, among others, an inept computer programmer, a longshoreman, a musician, a comedian, a caretaker for the mentally disabled, a journalist and a manual labourer in a cement-packing factory. I am currently employed as a teacher of Drama, English and Icelandic at a private school in London.

- I quit the acting profession after I heard of a casting for a man (tick) in his thirties (double-tick) with Icelandic/Norwegian accent (triple-and-quadruple-tick) to play a *Viking* (tick tick tick) whose **name** was Snorri - and I didn't even get an interview. (boom) After that I decided I could use my time for better things. I was correct.

- Last year I wrote a play in January based on the question of what would happen if Roger Federer and Andy Murray had to share a dressing room before the Wimbledon finals. It was performed at the International Youth Arts Festival in Kingston, and it was called 'Balls'. Because I am real mature like that.


01:28 GMT - Thank you tremendously, citizens of /r/fantasy! This has been great fun, despite battling a connection that hasn't been this slow since Fred Durst was cool. Now I'm off to go lie in a darkened room and read something good. 

All the best,

It REALLY left a bad taste in my mouth.  I agree that good story telling (regardless of genre) have common aspects (romance, history, adventure, mystery and philosophy), but I feel he would have been much better off stopping there. Taking a cheap stab at what is clearly his ""genre"" seems like crapping where you sleep.  

Does anyone else feel this way?

______________________________



Hi there! I'm Scott Lynch, author of the [Gentleman Bastard sequence]( http://www.scottlynch.us/books.html), which currently includes *The Lies of Locke Lamora* and *Red Seas Under Red Skies*, and will soon include *The Republic of Thieves*.


I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1978. I came embarrassingly close to an Associate of Arts degree, but after dodging it by precisely one phy ed credit, I bounced around Minnesota doing the usual authorly assortment: web design, marketing, office management, retail, self-publishing, poverty, frustration, and prep cooking. In 2004 I sold my first novel and moved to Wisconsin, where I still reside. 


I'm an unrepentant tabletop gamer, a general-purpose nerd, a mostly-retired World of Warcrafter, a Bethesda game sociopath, and a volunteer firefighter. I did my Firefighter I/II training and took my certification at Anoka Technical College in Minnesota back in 2005, and joined my city department in June of that year. I have a bunch of other tedious certifications (Incident Management System, Hazmat Operations, Vehicle Extrication, Confined-Space Operations, etc.) as required by my department.   


I have one cat, the charmingly misnamed Muse, a 1.5-year-old foundling rescued by my ex-wife and adopted by me, because I'm a gigantic sucker. 


As is the custom, ask me anything!


**I'll be answering questions live starting at 7 PM CST (1 AM GMT).**

Cheers,

My debut epic fantasy, *[Promise of Blood]( http://www.brianmcclellan.com/books/)*, hit bookshelves worldwide last week.

Some of you may have seen the variety of [guest posts]( http://booktionary.blogspot.com/2013/04/guest-post-industrialization-in-epic.html), [interviews]( http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/04/18/ten-questions-about-promise-of-blood-by-brian-mcclellan/), and [reviews]( http://www.brianmcclellan.com/reviews/) that have popped up over the last few weeks as part of my Spring Blog Tour. For those of you who haven't: 

I write industrial-era epic fantasy with flintlocks and magic. I was a student of Brandon Sanderson at BYU. In my spare time I bake, play computer games, make home made jam, hang out with my rockin' wife, and keep a hive of honeybees.

I haven't won any awards... YET.

Unless there's an award for loving cake. Then I've won that one. A lot.

I quite enjoy interacting with fellow geeky types, and I have a reasonably active online presence. You can find me on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/BrianTMcClellan), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/briantmcclellan), [Goodreads]( http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6524620.Brian_McClellan), or on my [blog]( http://www.brianmcclellan.com/).

Whatever you do, **do not** tell Sam Sykes that this AMA is happening.

~~I'll be back at 7:00 PM CST to answer questions. AMA!~~

~~I have returned to answer your questions! Quake, mortals! Or, you know, just do what you were doing before.~~

**Okay, friends. I'm signing off for tonight. Lots of great questions! Thanks for coming by. I'll check in the morning for any stragglers.**

Also, if you've gotten the book I'd love it if you were to come add yourself to my [Reader Map](http://www.brianmcclellan.com/reader-map/). Bonus points if you include a picture.

I'm Veronica Belmont, the co-host of the [Sword &amp; Laser](http://www.swordandlaser.com).

We're a science fiction and fantasy [book club](http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/4170.The_Sword_and_Laser), [video show](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFEC5DD1B2D256569&amp;feature=plcp), and [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-sword-and-laser-podcast/id274083853).

Most recently we had on Terry Brooks, who's doing his own AMA very soon! I'm also one of the hosts of the [Vaginal Fantasy Google hangout](http://vaginalfantasy.com/), along with Felicia Day, Bonnie Burton and Kiala Kazebee! We have a [book club](http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/62938-vaginal-fantasy-hangout) as well.

I also work in the tech world, as the co-host of [Tekzilla](http://www.tekzilla.com) on Revision3 and [Fact or Fictional](http://youtube.com/techfeed) on YouTube. I was also the host of Qore on the Playstation Network, and Game On! on TWiT. 

I tried an AMA once before with quasi-success, so hopefully we have some fun with this one! I'm excited to answer any questions you guys may have.

Hello, Reddit!
I am very happy to be doing my first official AMA. Like a cheeky monkey I snuck in an unofficial one in February (as /u/nommus) which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17rste/my_name_is_snorri_kristjansson_i_am_an_icelandic/), and contains several random facts about my life. There may be more of those later.

Now I'm back with a 'proper' author handle as my first novel, [*Swords of Good Men*](http://www.jofletcherbooks.com/books/the-swords-of-good-men/), has just been published by Jo Fletcher Books. Here's a selection of reviews:

I also did a guest blog for [SFX Magazine](http://m.sfx.co.uk/2013/08/01/guest-blog-terror-from-the-north-yes-please/).

I am happy to talk about anything - at length - Iceland, writing, fantasy, Vikings, chess, comedy, and more.  I will be around from 1700CST/2300 GMT.  Ask me anything!  Anything, I say!

###

17:06 CST - Hello all! I'm parked at the laptop, ready to get to grips with some questions and already boggling at the 81 upvotes. If we get to 90, I will post a random fact from my life.

17:31 CST - **Random fact #1** - I have witnessed the impact of Jude Law on a room full of women. The room in question was a dancewear shop, and I had just bought tap shoes. I have never been more invisible in all my life. Next fact in 15 minutes.

17:45 CST - **Random fact #2** - A long time ago, I visited my cousin for his graduation from Wabash College, Indiana. On Graduation Day he realized he’d forgotten documents in a suitcase in Champaign-Urbana, where we’d been for a road trip three days earlier. His dad and I hopped into a rental car, and I navigated my way back to the house by memory. It is 18 years ago, and my uncle still talks about it.

18:13 CST - **Random fact #3** - I play the double bass when I can. It is difficult as my double bass is in Iceland, and until recently I’ve lived in flats in London that are considerably smaller than a double bass. If I get another three questions I will reveal the next fact which is a) embarrassing and b) thoroughly fantasy-related.

18:27 CST - **Random fact #4** - I met Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams (Sansa and Arya Stark) in the Blue Lagoon this summer – and I didn’t realize it was them until two hours later.

19:00 CST - **Random fact #5** - -	I did voice-over work on the film ‘Golden Compass’. As I have a big mouth I talked my way into speaking for the Samovar warriors, whose lines subsequently became an odd, bastardised quasi-Finnish consisting mostly of variations of the names of my Finnish comedian friends [Tomi Walamies]( http://www.walamies.com/) and [Ismo Leikola]( http://ismoleikola.com/www/).

19:25 CST - **Interlude** I shall now, I think, go to sleep. I leave you with [this](http://imgur.com/3k7HMTk), and will check back in tomorrow. Thank you for excellent questions! 

Tutuloo!

02:12 CST - I have become reasonably competent at calculating CST. Popped in to answer another brace of questions; will continue to do so throughout the day as required. Keep'em coming.",AMA,False,self,t5_2qknd,1376032487.0,ama,,True,t3_1jz1f6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jz1f6/i_am_icelandic_ive_written_a_book_about_vikings/,

Hello, I’m [Guy Gavriel Kay]( http://www.brightweavings.com/ggkswords/guygavrielkay.htm), though I seem to be called GGK more and more often online over the years. Easier to type.


I’ve published [eleven novels in twenty-five or so languages, and been generously honored with a variety of awards and nominations]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Gavriel_Kay). If I don’t mess up, I will finish a twelfth some time this year. I’m a bit obsessive, so I try not to mess up in that.


First fantasy trilogy was [*The Fionavar Tapestry*, most recent book is *Under Heaven*]( http://www.brightweavings.com/books/index.htm).


Ask Me Anything has, predictably, a few caveats. I don’t talk about books in progress. I am one of those readers who hates spoilers, so I ask people to try to avoid them in Q&amp;As about my work, or at least put up alerts for others. I find it painful to discuss how I came to be a fan of the Minnesota Vikings. Laugh, but be kind. I will be really, REALLY boring and bland if asked about the work of most colleagues.


Boxers, not briefs. Hot fudge sundae w vanilla ice cream. No. The south of France. “The Wire”, “Breaking Bad”, and “Deadwood”. It really is my middle name. The vessel with the pestle has the pellet with the poison and the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true. “The Descendants” over “The Artist”. Currently, Springbank Claret Cask, but it changes often.


**I will be back at 8PM Eastern / 7PM Central to answer questions live.**


Let’s roll.

**Redditors, we've hit the two hour mark, so I think we should call it for tonight. I *will* check in again this week, try to pick up on a few questions I missed and any follow-ups. You were - and I mean this - a terrific, interesting group, the questions were fun and a few were completely new. Thanks for inviting me, and thanks to elquesogrande for setting it up. Be good.**

Thursday morning tidying up. No broken glass, people were good. Coffee not scotch just now. A few good questions got missed just in the speed of it all - and I am told we broke the internet, as reddit went down for emerg maintenance just after we wrapped. I think that's funny, actually. So scroll and find the new answers. I'll check in at least once more to try to deal with follow-ups. Cheers.

Raised on a steady diet of fantasy novels, comic books, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, I've been writing fantasy stories for as long as I can remember.

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Art History from the University at Buffalo in 1995, and spent over a decade in pharmaceutical publishing before selling The Warded Man in 2007 and returning to my bliss.

I've been publishing pretty regularly for almost fifteen years, depending on how you count it.  I did almost a decade of front line ISP tech support before that, and spent about twice as much time as I should have getting a BS in Biology that I've never particularly used.

I've lived in New Mexico almost my whole life, and I'm told we do things a little differently here.

You can ask me anything.  Most of the time I won't lie.

1373472640.0,229,self.Fantasy,1i0joz,I'm author Laurell K. Hamilton - AMA,311,82,397,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i0joz/im_author_laurell_k_hamilton_ama/,"Okay, everyone, you've tired me out. *laughs* It's been great answering your questions. I hope you've got some of your curiosity satisfied. Goodnight, folks. 

I’m [Laurell K. Hamilton]( http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/) and in 1993 I published my second novel, [*Guilty Pleasures*]( http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/works/), it featured Anita Blake. She raised the dead for living, as in zombies, and helped the police with preternatural cases as a consultant. She was also a legal vampire executioner in a world where vampires were legally alive and had rights, but they’d proved too dangerous to jail, so if they broke the law there was only one penalty – death. There was also this gorgeous master vampire named Jean-Claude, that I’d actually planned on killing before Anita would date him. 


Fast forward to 2013 and my newest book, [*Affliction*]( http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/works/affliction/). Anita has a badge of her own now, as a member of the newly formed U. S. Marshal Preternatural Branch, and I didn’t kill off Jean-Claude like I planned, and you guessed it, they’re dating. Anita is also dating quite a few other people. It’s . . . complicated. * **faceplam** * *Affliction* is number 22 for Anita, and celebrates twenty years of her adventures, and me writing at least a book a year, sometimes two. It’s pretty cool to be able to write that. I’ve also written eight books in the Merry Gentry series, and am currently writing the ninth in the series, after a four year hiatus waiting for Merry and myself to work our issues. I’m a character oriented writer, which means my imaginary friends argue and fight with me while I write the book. I rarely win these fights, but I always learn more about my characters, their world, and sometimes myself.
 

You can ask me anything, but I reserve the right to answer what I want to answer. Sorry, but thems my rules. A word of caution, I really will answer almost any question so be sure you want the answer. I’ve surprised some fans at live Q &amp; A’s occasionally by my . . . candor.  * **evil grin** * 

One caveat, *Affliction* came out on July 2nd and not everyone has finished the book so please avoid spoiler questions, or comments. Thanks in advance for that. For people who are new to the series in general I’m just not sure how to avoid some spoiler questions. It’s twenty-two books, folks, there is no way to avoid all spoilers without limiting the questions to general writing questions. I’m happy to answer writing questions, but I’m just not sure how to avoid all spoiler questions for the entire series. * **puzzled** * So _NO_ _SPOILERS_ for *Affliction*, but for the rest, ask away.

GoT is the closest thing I can think of in terms of a live action high fantasy success.  There have been other attempts which were miserable, such as the Dungeons and Dragons film.  An older film of the same genre which was successful that I can think of is Excalibur.  There is also the Conan films if you count them.

But if you look at the world of novels and video games, the market is saturated with new High Fantasy epics every year, yet in the film market, not so much.  Why is it the film industry has been reluctant to pick it up as a major thing despite the obvious stated success it has?  Sci-fi genre films never seem to be in short supply.  Shouldn't the LOTR trilogy success have spurred a movement to produce more high quality big budget high-fantasy films?

1355636639.0,208,self.Fantasy,14xifg,"I feel weird about this, but I think the reason I love LotR and The Hobbit so much is...",281,73,252,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/14xifg/i_feel_weird_about_this_but_i_think_the_reason_i/,"...there are no women in the fellowship.



FIRST, let me say that I, myself, am a female.


And it's not that I dislike female characters, either. The problem is, the minute writers/movie-makers throw a female character in there (into ANY story or movie), I know that at some point the exciting adventure is going to devolve (even if on the sidelines) into an eye-rolling romance of some sort. 


It seems a female can never be just another member of the ""fellowship"" (I use that term loosely, to mean a group of main characters doing stuff together.). She is potential sex, and many times a -perhaps unintended- weakness and hindrance to the group. Occasionally she will subvert the group by causing fighting among the others over her attention. Loyalty between brothers-in-arms becomes nothing. And so many female characters that start out as bad-ass seem to crumble by the end of their story-line as she realizes she needs a man, after all. If there is a female present, she *has* to be matched off with someone by the end. Yes, the fate of the world as she knows it may be on her shoulders, but god help us if she doesn't snag a boyfriend along the way.


It's all so predictable and it sometimes makes me feel like I'm watching the same two characters' relationships develop a hundred times through different movies or books.


I swear that I'm not a feminist or anything like that. I'm not a misogynist, either. I believe we ladies are so much more awesome than how we are made to appear. It's not a problem with *us*, it's a problem with how we're represented. I would LOVE to read a fantasy novel where the entire main cast was only females, just to see if it's as awesome as I found LotR and Hobbit to be. 


-BRIEF INTERLUDE: Yes I know that a story full of characters all of the same gender doesn't necessarily preclude romance. But a gay/lesbian romance would be INTERESTING and (despite the leaps forward the world is making) still takes some bravery, and I'd read the hell out of that.-


I know I've become kind of cynical about this, but as someone who has never and likely WILL never be a fan of romance, I miss books like Tolkien's; where romance (if any), is only briefly touched-upon and not a distraction from the main story, but instead flavors it with its fleeting loveliness.


Finally, let me say that I DO realize that I haven't watched every single movie or read every single book in the universe, so my sweeping generalization can only cover my little cache of experience. I know that and accept that. Also, I acknowledge that there have been exceptions: a handful of authors or books who actually handled their characters *awesomely*.


Let me also say that I would LOVE to be proven wrong, so I'm actually hoping for some awesome recommendations to shatter my opinion. Or some recommendations that would cater to my tastes as they are. 


Thanks for reading my semi-rant. No offense is meant at all, here. I know tons of people love romantic stories and characters and I'm glad that you love those things! Everyone should have stories that they can appreciate with a passion, even if it's not the same stories I choose, or for the same reasons.


No, this was just an impulse to sate that age-old question I've been wondering: Does anyone else think this way?

EDIT: Now with 10% more snarky rant.

#EDIT #2: I should have thought more about saying ""I am not a feminist"", because I realize now that it almost sounds like I am defending myself from a negative label- which I do not believe is negative at all! Where would I be without the neverending battle that dedicated feminists have fought for me? Probably nowhere good.

As one commenter said, it's more like I am not a *hardcore* feminist. Of course I want equality between genders and women to be seen to have as much value as men, but, besides really hating this trope in books, I don't really do anything in any other aspect in my life to fight for feminist ideals one way or another.

To be honest, it's harder to do that as I get older. I'm more skeptical of fiction and less forgiving of artistic choices that I disagree with. There are also more distractions, more trappings of adult life.

Then I get a novel like this that is so much fun for me, and I spend evenings curled on my couch turning pages, allowing a storyteller to take me on a great ride. And when I'm done, I'm reminded that my small amount disdain of escapism is poorly placed. I'm reminded that escapism has its place in a healthy mind. It introduces us to unknown possibilities, avenues of thought that would otherwise remain unexplored. I'm reminded that while escapism is often fun more than anything else, it expands my real world just a tiny bit, enough that it's valuable.

Anyway, I'm rambling, but *Lies* was a great deal of fun. I won't read *Red Seas* for a while because I have some other authors I want to try, but I'm definitely hooked on Lynch's novels, thanks to you guys.

It’s the first in a series called Bloodsounder’s Arc, and I’m currently banging my head against the sequel, *Veil of the Deserters*, right now.

 

I was born in the suburbs of Chicago, and except for a two-year stint living in England, I’ve lived most of my life within a few hours of Chicago. I will probably die in the burbs. I’m not sure how I feel about that. 

 

I’m the father of three girls. Speaking of dying, someday they will be 17, 15, and 13, and my autopsy report will surely be five words long: “Cause of death: teenage girls”. But for now, the girls are all under the age of 6, which is exhausting, but means I should have some more books in me.

Ask me anything. 

 

I reserve the right to be snarkily evasive, deceptive to the point of being fictional (or metafictional), or remarkably and uncomfortably candid. If I don’t answer your question, it could be because I’m easily distracted and might not have anything to do with the quality of the question. But then again it might. You’ll always wonder.

I’m a dual national US/UK citizen, born in the US (Illinois) and raised in the UK (London). I studied Physics for my first degree at Bristol University, and did a math-based Ph.D at Imperial College, London. I work as a research scientist and have done so in the UK and US. I now live in Bristol with my wife. We have four kids, some at university. The youngest, Celyn, is very disabled and when I’m not at work I’m her full time carer. Writing happens late at night when I should be sleeping.

 
I play video games (I’m a certified god at Modern Warfare II and Command &amp; Conquer III) though not so often of late. I read but rarely find the time. I misspent chunks of my youth playing D&amp;D and running fantasy play-by-mail.


I'm currently wrestling with my latest book, *Gunlaw*, which is a fusing of fantasy and western.
Despite appearances the only time I’ve ever read Joe Abercrombie is 5 minutes ago when directed to his Reddit intro as an example for writing my own. The ‘I’m currently wrestling ...’ line is cut&amp;pasted from his intro with ‘*Red Country*’ replaced by ‘*Gunlaw*’. I’m starting to hate him. He lives about 10 miles from me. 


*Gunlaw* is based on a series of short stories, the first of which I wrote in 2006, was accepted by Black Gate magazine in that year and will appear in their next issue.

 
Ask me anything.
 

**I will be responding to questions real time from 11pm-1am GMT (that’s 5-7 Central).**

AMA",216,28,193,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bo12x/hello_reddit_i_am_speculative_fiction_writer_mary/,"Hello, reddit!  [I am Mary Robinette Kowal.]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/)  I used to describe myself as a professional puppeteer who moonlights as a writer, but have to admit that the balance has shifted. 


I had a [twenty-year career with puppetry]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/puppetry/) doing work on stage and screen. I design, build and perform in a variety of styles. And yes, it was my day job. Over the last five years, the balance has shifted so that most of my creative is as a writer. 


[I write fantasy and science fiction in both short form and novel length.]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/fiction-collectio/online-fiction/)  I write all over the map within the broad speculative fiction umbrella, but in novel length my published work is all in the Historical Fantasy area. Go ahead, ask me questions [about the *Regency*.]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/novels/) 


I suppose this is where I should trot out the awards, which is so much easier to do in third person. I won the Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2008, the Hugo for Best Short Story in 2011, and am currently a finalist for a Nebula award for my novel [*Glamour in Glass*]( http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/novel/glamour-in-glass/), and a Hugo finalist for Best Related work, for the [podcast Writing Excuses]( http://www.writingexcuses.com/) that I do with Brandon Sanderson, Dan Wells, and Howard Tayler.


I'm also an audio book narrator, which I think of as puppetry without the pain.


My husband is the winemaker at City Winery Chicago, and we moved here last year from Portland, OR. We collect manual typewriters and have 16 of them currently. 
 What else... I lived in Iceland for year and a half, working on [the show Lazytown.]( http://www.lazytown.com/en_US/home)  Two cats. I'm obligated to mention the cats, right?


I'm stealing Pat Rothfuss's guidelines for questions because, dang, those are good.

&gt;**Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&amp;A sessions I run on my blog.**


&gt;1.	You can ask any question.

&gt;2.	Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

&gt;3.	One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

&gt;4.	I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

&gt;5. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

&gt;6.	I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

&gt;7.	I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

**I will be back at 8PM CST to answer questions.**

Yours,

Mary
  
  
  
**You ask wonderful questions, but my brain is starting to melt a little. I'll pop back in tomorrow to try to catch a few more.**

**The following AMA authors will be answering questions 'live' starting at 7PM Central**


I'm [Elspeth Cooper]( http://www.elspethcooper.com/facts.html), author of The Wild Hunt series: *Songs of the Earth*, *Trinity Rising* is due out soon (26 July UK, Feb 2013 US), I'm finishing up Book 3 at the moment, with Book 4, *The Dragon House*, to come. I'm a sword owner, tea drinker, cat slave and motorcycle racing aficionado who has been living with Multiple Sclerosis for at least 8 years. I live in Northumberland UK with my husband in a house full of books. I'm also British, but hey, you can't have everything.

----

Hi, Reddit!  I'm [Courtney Schafer]( http://www.courtneyschafer.com/about.html), author of adventure fantasy novels *The Whitefire Crossing* (Aug 2011) and *The Tainted City* (forthcoming in Oct).  I'm a voracious reader of all things SFF; I took up writing because new fantasy novels weren't being published fast enough to satisfy my craving for worlds full of magic and wonder.  In my day job, I'm an engineer at an aerospace company (and mom to an insanely active toddler).  When not writing, working, or chasing my son, I climb mountains, figure skate, squeeze through slot canyons, and ski way too fast through trees.  I live with my husband and son in the climbers' paradise of Boulder, Colorado, and you can visit me online [at my website](http://www.courtneyschafer.com/) or on twitter (@cischafer).

----

[Brad Beaulieu]( http://quillings.com/about/) is the author of *The Lays of Anuskaya* trilogy, a (rather large) story about windships, elemental spirits, and (of course) vodka. He likes cooking (with as much spice as his wife can stand), sneaking out for movies (when his kids let him), and watching his kids grow (as long as it doesn't happen too quickly). And apparently he's developed a (sudden) fondness for parens...

Hello, Reddit, I’m [Teresa Frohock]( http://www.teresafrohock.com/), and I write dark fantasy. I haven’t tried my hand at horror in many years, but I may take a turn at the genre before I’m done. I prefer dark fairy tales, and I love weaving magic and hauntings of all kinds into my stories.

I started writing when I was in my twenties and was represented by James Allen of the Virginia Kidd Literary Agency. I was really active on the local SFF scene in North Carolina, but I knew too much for my
own good and never got published. I quit writing for several years to take care of my family and work full-time, then I decided on a lark to take an online writing class. I gave writing a second shot and produced Miserere: An Autumn Tale, my debut novel.

I enjoy reading about religion and history, especially World War II, which was my father’s main interest. I read everything I could on World War II so I could be conversant with him. Now, I will read almost anything (fiction and non-fiction) and love research most of all. Rock and roll works nicely for me. I live in North Carolina with my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, and I’m currently at my four cat limit.

I’m working on my second novel, tentatively entitled *The Garden*, which is set on the Iberian Peninsula in 1348. Ask me anything …

----

I'm [Kameron Hurley]( http://www.kameronhurley.com/), author of the [Bel Dame Apocrypha]( http://mskameron.wix.com/kameronhurleycom1) consisting of *God’s War*, *Infidel*, and the forthcoming *Rapture* (Nov. 2012).  *God’s War* won the Kitschy Award for Best Debut Novel of 2011, and was nominated for both a Nebula Award and a Locus Award for Best First Novel. Right now I hack out a living in Ohio, a state where the extremely reasonable cost of living makes it an ideal place for low paid writers to establish apocalypse-ready compounds. My next novel, *Legion*, is a bloody space opera about two warring families battling for control of a fleet of cancerous world-ships sent out beyond the edge of known space. Perhaps they should have just stayed in Ohio…

----

[Anne Lyle]( http://www.annelyle.com/) was born in what is popularly known as “Robin Hood Country”, and grew up fascinated by English history, folklore, and swashbuckling heroes. Unfortunately there was little demand in 1970s Nottinghamshire for diminutive swordswomen, so she studied sensible subjects like science and languages instead.

It appears, however, that although you can take the girl out of Sherwood Forest, you can’t take Sherwood Forest out of the girl. She now spends practically every spare hour writing – or at least planning – fantasy fiction about dashing swordsmen and scheming spies, set in imaginary pasts or parallel worlds.
Her first novel, Elizabethan fantasy *The Alchemist of Souls*, was published in April 2012 by Angry Robot Books; the sequel, *The Merchant of Dreams*, is due out December 2012, with a third volume scheduled for autumn 2013.

----

Hi, all. I'm [Douglas Hulick]( http://www.douglashulick.com/), author of *Among Thieves*, the first book in the *Tales of the Kin* series. My next book, *Sworn in Steel*, is due out in 2013 (no hard date yet, sorry). To date, I've been published in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Poland.  The Czech Republic and Bulgaria are in the works (why do I feel like I'm playing *Diplomacy* all of a sudden?).

When not writing, I'm a stay-at-home dad for two boys, one of whom is autistic. I have a B.A. and M.A. in Medieval History, which qualified me for a veritable cornucopia of former occupations, including bartending, managing a bookstore, working in a brewery, writing freelance for the RPG industry, and now...Reddit! I've also been known to teach and fight renaissance rapier now and then, as well as do less
sane things.

Feel free to ask me anything. Heck, I may even know the answer.

----

Hi, I'm [Maz Williams]( http://mazarkis.blogspot.com/) and I write fantasy novels that explore 'what if' scenarios such as, 'What if a crazy guy is the emperor?'  Not quite American but not British either, I grew up on the outside of things and part of me always remains there. *Knifesworn*, book two of the *Tower and Knife* trilogy, will be released late 2012.

[Mark Lawrence’s AMA from March is linked here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/rj5ir/hello_reddit_im_fantasy_author_mark_lawrence_ama/) and [his brief bio can be found on his blog here.]( http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.com/)  His debut novel, *Prince of Thorns*, came out in 2011 and is the first in *The Broken Empire* trilogy.  The follow-up, *King of Thorns*, will be released on August 7th.      

----

[Stina Leicht]( http://www.csleicht.com/) is a 2012 Campbell Award nominee. Her debut novel *Of Blood and Honey*, a historical Fantasy with an Irish crime edge set in 1970s Northern Ireland, was released by Night Shade books in February 2011 and was short-listed for the Crawford Award in 2012. The sequel, *And Blue Skies from Pain* is in bookstores as of March 2012.

1360760869.0,185,self.Fantasy,18fy17,Thank you Robert Jordan,238,53,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/18fy17/thank_you_robert_jordan/,"EDIT: warning, possible spoilers in the comments

I have just finished reading A Memory of Light. I have been reading TWOT series for fifteen years now. I don't think I will ever read anything as profound as this series. For those who are unfamiliar with the series this may not mean much, those who have read all or some of the books will have differing opinions, criticisms and praise that I will partially agree with depending on what they are. But I think they will all agree that this series is the very definition of epic. A series that takes the theme of 'balance' and permeates it through every part of the story. Light and dark. Good and evil. Yin and Yang. Power and responsibilty. Slavery and freedom. Men and Women. Magic and technology. Choice and fate. Life and Death. Balance is one thing about the world we live in that we don't notice unless it's pointed out to us. This series is all about balance. 

But so much more. The nature of reality, possible and parallel worlds. A unique and logical system of magic that I have never seen anyone match in their writing. A complete departure from any kind of cliche fantasy staples 'elves, dwarves, wizards... etc"". I have never and probably never will read anything like it.

And most importantly for me, it has an ending. In the age of Lost and Battlestar Galactica, there is a series that has an ending that is appropriate and gives closure. Robert Jordan has stated that he knew how the series would end when he wrote the first novel twenty years ago. To me that is just incredible, and it shows in the story. The series uses a lot of prophecies and omens throughout, and cryptic hints in book one are borne out all through the 14 books (14!).

It's not perfect. People have complained that the story stalls a lot, some novels are almost entirely about catching up with a character just to see where he is without any real plot development. [One site](http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~karlh/cgi-bin/wot.cgi) puts the count of distinctly named characters at 2780! Each character having an impact on the overall story. Sometimes you don't care about some farmer who got dragged into an armies life story when there's main characters you want to know about! There's other criticisms too, things that some might see as positive points. His depiction of men and women is divisive, some say the women in wheel of time are all nags that hassle men, and men are all shy and clumsy and baffled by women. Others say the women are all departures from the classical damsel in distress or simpering maidens you see in fantasy, they take charge and aren't secondary to men at all.

Anyway, I wanted to post this to say thank you. First to Brandon Sanderson for finishing the monumental task of completing a story like this, and to Robert Jordan for creating such a unique and powerful fantasy series. R.I.P. I have been able to immerse myself in a fully realised world thanks to this man sitting and writing. That's something I can't express enough gratitude for.

I've published four novels including [THE KILLING MOON]( http://nkjemisin.com/books/dreamblood/the-killing-moon/), which just came out last week, and a bunch of short stories, which come out intermittently.


I've been nominated for a whole bunch of awards including the Hugo and the Nebula -- up for the Neb again this year, actually -- though I've only won one, the Locus.  (So far!)  


Lessee, what else.  I blog about race, gender, and oppression issues, though I'm still learning on this subject; I also blog about video games and science fiction/fantasy in general, same as any geek.  I'm a Brooklynite imported from the Deep South, with some side-trips to New Orleans and Boston.  For kicks and giggles I study pre-Columbian American history, travel when I can afford it, and drink.  I'm especially
fond of a good Riesling or a margarita.

I'm Elizabeth Bear--SF and fantasy writer, rock climber, cohabitator of a giant ridiculous dog. The dog is a Briard; he weighs about ninety pounds and most closely resembles a four-legged Wookiee with long, mobile ears.


I live in a hundred and twelve year old house beside the common of a 3600-person town in Central Massachusetts; the town is so small it doesn't even have a Dunkin Donuts. Before that, I lived in Connecticut and in Nevada, with a few years in Vermont that I was mostly too young to remember. I've been a full-time writer since 2006; before then, I had the usual mess of writer jobs--stablehand, college newspaper reporter, administrative assistant, maintaining procedure manuals, and writing a daily executive news summary.


I've published over a dozen novels and nearly a hundred short stories. The most recent novel is an epic fantasy called Range of Ghosts. It's the first of a trilogy from Tor, set in an alternate world the development of which was heavily influenced by the cultures of central Asia. The second book, Shattered Pillars, comes out next Spring. My other ongoing series, the Iskryne books, is written with Sarah
Monette, which is a high-mud Norse-inspired setting. The second book, The Tempering of Men, came out last year.


I'm also involved as a collaborator in the [occasionally experimental web serial Shadow Unit]( http://www.shadowunit.org/), and occasionally various
other places around the web.


I've been honored with several awards, including two Hugos and a Sturgeon.

David Eddings is the author of ""The Belgariad"" and numerous other book series. ""The Belgariad"" was the first fantasy series I ever read, and will always be near and dear to my heart. I so thoroughly enjoy reading the entire series (From ""The Pawn of Prophecy"" all the way to the ""Rivan Codex"") that I usually will reread it from start to finish every other year or so.
Well I decided to look up Mr. Eddings on Wiki to find out why he hadn't written any new books lately. It turns out he passed away back in 2009. It also turns out that he used to live in my town. I don't know why I never found that out before, or why I wasn't aware of it, but probably not more than 5 miles away from where I write this post now, my favorite author of all time used to live.
So now I sit here, once again reading ""The Belgariad"", with a new sense of sadness for the world having lost such a great and talented writer, and for the opportunity, right at my door step, that I've lost forever.
Wherever you are Mr. Eddings, for all the wonderful stories of Garion and Silk, Barak and Belgarath, Polgara and Ce'Nedra, and all the other amazing characters you brought to life, I say, for what it's worth, thank you.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,1351444098.0,,,True,t3_127rc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/127rc7/david_eddings_my_favorite_author_and_now_one_of/,

I'm a professional fantasy writer and writing teacher. My poems and short stories have been widely published and have received several fellowships and awards over the years. My debut novel, *THRONE OF THE CRESCENT MOON*, was released last week and my life has been a whirlwind since then.


I was born in Detroit and have recently returned to Michigan with my wife and twin toddlers after a decade in New York City. I spend my days writing my own books, editing novel manuscripts for aspiring writers, and being pwned by small children. 



[THRONE OF THE CRESCENT MOON]( http://www.amazon.com/Throne-Crescent-Moon-Kingdoms/dp/0756407117/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) is a sword-and-sorcery-meets-epic-fantasy novel. It's set in an invented world that draws on the 1001 Nights and medieval Arab history instead of European history and culture. THRONE is what might result if you were to throw the old AD&amp;D Dungeon Master's Guide, medieval Arabic texts about magic, a Dashiell Hammett story, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon into a blender. 


As Scott Lynch put it *""Flashing swords, leaping bandits, holy magic, bloodthirsty monsters, and sumptuous cuisine... what more do you want me to do, draw you a map? Read this thing.""*

I’m a writer, and people seem to have a tough time deciding what kind of writer I am, but I’ve always thought of myself as a fantasy writer. By now I usually just agree with whatever it is people tell me I am, nodding and chuckling amiably and muttering, “Yes, yes,” until the subject changes, though I have been accidentally married 3 times because of this. I guess what I’m saying here is that genre is hard.

My first book, [Mr. Shivers](http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/mr-shivers/), came out in 2010, and it won the Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel, the Sydney J Bounds Award for Best Newcomer, and was longlisted for a Stoker. 

My second book, [The Company Man]( http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/the-company-ma/), came out in 2011, and it won the Edgar Award for Best Paperback Original, as well as a nice runner-up thingy for the Philip K. Dick Award. 

[The Troupe](http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/the-troupe/) came out in 2012. It’s probably my most straight-fantasy book: it’s about vaudeville, art, and magic, and people seem to like it a whole bunch. It made or even topped a fair amount of “Best of 2012” lists.

[American Elsewhere](http://robertjacksonbennett.wordpress.com/american-elsewhere/) came out this last February. It is a Big McLargeHuge Giant book that has been used as a murder weapon to great success 9 times so far. (All in Florida.) So far people say it’s kind of like David Lynch meets HP Lovecraft, which is not only a good way to put it, but is also probably the worst imaginary makeout couple ever.

My erotic romantical novel of sensual sex and sexuality, [A Sexual Experience](http://vimeo.com/40911856), was the 9th worst-selling novel of the past two decades, and was briefly considered by the United Nations as a war crime, even with all the shit happening in Africa and stuff.

[Here is where I write.](http://www.orbitbooks.net/2010/10/04/the-writers-precious-workplace/)

[This is a place where I yell things.](https://twitter.com/robertjbennett)

Here is a list of things I like:

1. Bread
2. Keeping all or most fluids inside my body
3. Digging holes in the ground
4. Lotion
5. The one fireman who always comes to get me out when I get stuck in an empty oil drum
6. Walking in the woods, and maybe digging some good holes out there
7. Looking at the sun through a Jolly Rancher (cherry is pretty good to look through, not  fan of watermelon personally)
8. Petting an (alive) dog
9. When ducks fight over food at the park and really get into it
10. My wife and son (preferably alive, see #8 above)

And here is a list of things I don’t like:

1. Other people having sex with my wife (please don’t do this)
2. Being repeatedly struck by a bus or maybe a really fast tractor
3. Chairs that wobble, but not enough for you to pretend you’re riding a horse
4. When I take a bite out of a sandwich but instead of meat in there it’s just a rotten old sock (this hasn’t ever happened but it might and I think about it every time I pick up a sandwich)
5. When fluids leave my body, right in the middle of the Petsmart
6. When I’m on my porch practicing opera, and my neighbor is screaming at me over the top of his fence, just screaming his dang ol head off telling me to shut up, and then a wasp flies right in my mouth and just goes nuts in there (this has happened at least 4 times)
7. My dad’s friend Steve. Steve if you’re reading this you’re the worst and your Pontiac is dumb and you’re dumb
8. Fax machines (what ARE they??)
9. Ending lists on a 9
10. Lists in general, why did I do this

**I will be back at 7 PM CST to answer questions unless I get started on a really good hole and then I might be out there for days.**

Reddit can you please make sure Steve doesn’t ask any questions, Steve is the worst.

AMA! Reddit!

**EDIT - 8:30 PM CST:** *Okay, folks! I think I've answered all the questions for now.* I will be happy to check on and off tonight and throughout the day tomorrow, but I got some things that need attending to here, so for now, I'll have to bid adieu.

I’m Diana Rowland, author of the White Trash Zombie series and the Kara Gillian-Demon Summoner series.


I spent about six years in the casino industry as dealer and pit boss, seven years in law enforcement (street cop, detective, computer forensics specialist, crime scene investigator,) two years as a morgue tech/forensic photographer, and I’ve been a full-time writer since 2008. I have a black belt in Hapkido, I’m an expert marksman, I’m a shitty cook, and I can sew pretty much anything. I also totally saved my family’s life once when I grabbed a roach with my bare hand.


My husband is an Assistant District Attorney, and we met during the trial of a man who tried very hard to shoot me. After the trial/sentencing was over he asked me out and, despite a very odd first date, we got married about six months later. In addition to the almost-nine-year-old daughter we now have together, I have four stepdaughters and one stepson (ranging in ages from 24 to 36,) and six stepgrandchildren. (The darling husband is eighteen years older than I am. I tell everyone I’m his trophy wife.)

I wrote [*The Bones of the Old Ones*](http://www.howardandrewjones.com/the-bones-of-the-old-ones),[* The Desert of Souls*](http://www.howardandrewjones.com/books/the-desert-of-souls), [*Plague of Shadows]( http://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Tales-Howard-Andrew-Jones/dp/1601252919), [The Waters of Eternity]( http://www.amazon.com/The-Waters-of-Eternity-ebook/dp/B00603QRE4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359643715&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+waters+of+eternity), and a whole slew of short stories. I got my start in the industry assembling 8 collections of swashbuckling historical fiction by Harold Lamb for the University of Nebraska Press, then edited the first six issues of the Flashing Swords e-zine before moving on to [*Black Gate*](http://www.blackgate.com/), where I’ve been Managing Editor for many years.

 

I was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, studied radio-tv-film, and worked briefly as a tv cameraman and production assistant. Most of my work life, though, was spent editing technical books related to computers, or teaching English composition. Today I still live in Indiana with my wife and two children, and an animal menagerie that includes four horses and a dozen chickens. I write full-time.

 

The series that includes [*The Bones of the Old Ones*, *The Desert of Souls* and *Waters of Eternity*](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/510991.Howard_Andrew_Jones?auto_login_attempted=true) is historical fantasy, so I spend a lot of my spare time reading about 8th century Baghdad. When I’m not reading, writing, or taking care of horses I’m probably playing with my kids, playing piano, or sitting down with my wife and friends for some table-top role-playing games. 

 

I’m currently putting the final touches on my next [Paizo Pathfinder book]( http://paizo.com/products/btpy8iqp/discuss?Pathfinder-Tales-Plague-of-Shadows), featuring the same characters from *Plague of Shadows*, and promoting *The Bones of the Old Ones*, which was just released.

 

Ask me anything.

 

**I will be responding to the rest real time at 7:30 pm Central.**

 

I look forward to chatting with you, though it’s probably best to avoid spoilers. Outside reddit, I'm found at [Facebook here](https://www.facebook.com/howard.andrew.jones.1), and tweet from @howardandrewjon. I post regularly at my site, www.howardandrewjones.com.

AMA!",190,30,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hi6vd/howdy_everyone_my_name_is_dan_wells_and_im_here/,"Howdy everyone. My name is [Dan Wells](http://www.thedanwells.com/), and I'm here because I write books, play games, and [menace people with rusty cleavers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1g6wlo/this_will_not_end_well_dan_wells_wielding_a_rusty/). More specifically, in case you've never heard of me (and because I love to talk about myself) [I write this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Dan-Wells/e/B002S2VIBS/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1):

-The **John Cleaver** series, starting with *I Am Not A Serial Killer*. I've heard this described as horror, psychological thriller, and gritty urban fantasy; it's about a kid who thinks he's turning into a serial killer, so he sets rules to keep himself from hurting anyone, but then a real monster comes to town and he has to break all of his rules in order to stop it.


-**The Partials Sequence**. Post-apocalyptic SF. Humans created artificial people, someone released a plague that destroyed the world, and now the survivors of both species are trying to cure themselves before another war breaks out and kills everyone.


-**The Hollow City**. Another horror/psychological thriller. A man with schizophrenia realizes that some of the monsters he sees are real.

-**The Butcher of Khardov**. This is a Warmachine novella I wrote for Privateer Press, about a psychotic warrior haunted by rage and guilt and mad hallucinations. So yeah, I have a type.

-**A Night of Blacker Darkness**. In contrast to my other books, this is a straight-up screwball comedy...though it is about vampires, grave robbers, morticians, and stolen body parts, so I guess it fits the portfolio pretty well. This one's e-only.

I also do a couple of podcasts: 

-[**Writing Excuses**](http://www.writingexcuses.com/), a cast for aspiring writers, with co-hosts Brandon Sanderson, Howard Tayler, and Mary Robinette Kowal. This is the third year we've been up for a Hugo, but The Cambridge Companion To Fantasy Literature is going to murder us.

-[**Do I Dare To Eat A Peach**](http://www.doidaretoeatapeach.com/), a pop culture argument with my brother, Robison Wells, also an SF author with HarperCollins.

What can I say beyond that? I'm a gaming fanatic (last count was 253 board games, not counting the card games or the library of RPGs, and not updated since Essen last year), a voracious reader, and I love to travel. I have a wonderful wife and five kids, and we currently live in Stuttgart, Germany. Why? Why not? We thought it sounded like fun, and so far it's been awesome.

I will be back at 7PM Central - AMA!

1339075180.0,158,self.Fantasy,upptq,Hi.  I'm SF/F writer Kate Elliott.  AMA,174,16,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/upptq/hi_im_sff_writer_kate_elliott_ama/,"Hi. [I’m Kate Elliott]( http://www.kateelliott.com/wordpress/). I’ve been publishing fantasy and science fiction novels (and a few short stories) for over twenty years. My forthcoming novel [COLD STEEL (third of the Spiritwalker Trilogy)]( http://www.kateelliott.com/) will be my 21st published novel.


   Why do I write? Growing up in rural Oregon, I spent as much time possible playing outdoors. Unable to find a gate that would allow me to cross into a Hidden Land of Adventure, I was reduced to drawing maps of imaginary worlds and writing my own stories (I have a file cabinet full of early material that should never ever see the light of day).


   Random facts: I played basketball and ran track in high school. Later I took up karate, and for a few years I fought in armor in the SCA (my spouse and I met in a sword fight). My current sport of choice is outrigger canoe paddling. Although my spouse started work life as a police officer, his second career as an archaeologist has taken the family (we have a daughter and identical twin sons) to Mexico and Denmark and, most recently, Hawaii, where we live now (hence the outrigger canoes).


   I’ve traveled a fair bit. As anyone who has read my work will recognize, my favorite fields of study are history, anthropology, and religion. I’m a huge fan of The Wire. Wine: Reisling. Beer: Asahi. Favorite pie: Okinawan sweet potato pie, because it is purple. Finally, no cats: We have a schnauzer named Theoden.


Kate


9:30 pm Hawaii Time: **Thanks, everyone!** My thanks to our fearless leader who arranged everything and gave me good directions, and to all of you who asked such great questions and to those who read all or part of the AMA. I really appreciate it.

**I will stop by tomorrow and over the weekend to pick up any stray straggler questions, so feel free to ask if you seek clarification for a question or answer that was asked or if you would like an answer to a question that wasn't asked.**

[I'm Django Wexler.](http://djangowexler.com/)  My epic fantasy [*The Thousand Names*](http://djangowexler.com/book-info/) came out at the beginning of July.  It’s my first big-press book, though I have a couple of small-press novels from way back when.  My elevator pitch for the novel has evolved into “*Game of Thrones* with muskets” or “*Sharpe* with magic”, depending on who I’m talking to.



Before jumping into the writing gig full-time I worked at Microsoft as a Programmer/Writer, and before that as a research programmer on a DARPA AI project at Carnegie Mellon.  (The latter is not nearly as cool as it sounds.)  I play a lot of games (computer, tabletop, wargames, etc) and watch probably too much anime.



My other series, a middle-grade fantasy starting with [*The Forbidden Library*](http://djangowexler.com/2013/06/17/the-forbidden-library-cover-and-blog-updates/), starts next April.

[I'm Seanan McGuire]( http://www.seananmcguire.com/); I write urban fantasy and medical science fiction and weird stories about cheerleaders fighting monsters because why not.  I also watch too many horror movies, read a lot of comics, and spend a lot of time wrangling my three enormous blue cats.  I have a Classic Siamese and two Maine Coons, the smaller of which weighs nineteen and a half pounds.


I live in a creepy, crumbling old farmhouse deep in the San Francisco Bay Area, in a town that was mostly rural up until ten years ago, and has now gone very suburban, which explains why I want to move to the woods as soon as humanly possible.  I do still have a day job, and work for an international non-profit dedicated to bridging the digital divide by providing technological solutions.  I do actually know what that means, but it took me a while to figure it out.


I currently put out four books a year, because that's not a lot or anything, as well as a lot of short fiction.  My latest book is an urban fantasy called [Midnight Blue-Light Special]( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13501633-midnight-blue-light-special), the second in [my InCryptid series]( http://seananmcguire.com/incryptid.php), which is currently plotted for at least five books (and hopefully more).  My second urban fantasy series, the October Daye books, has been going since 2009, and book seven, Chimes at Midnight, will be out this fall.


[I also write as Mira Grant.]( http://www.miragrant.com/)  Two of the books in my Newsflesh trilogy (Feed and Deadline) were nominated for Hugo awards, which was really nice, and being two people makes it easier to get away with writing this many books.


I like cornfields, haunted houses, chainsaws, and going to Disney Parks.


I will be back at **7PM Central** to answer questions.

I'm [Felix Gilman](http://felixgilman.com/), author of four books now. My latest is *The Rise Of Ransom City*, which came out last week, and is a standalone sequel to *The Half Made World*, which came out in 2010 - both from Tor. 

*The Half Made World* and *Ransom City* are sort of steampunkish secondary-world sort of westernish fantasies, set in a world in the process of westward expansion, driven by a long war between the demonic forces of the Line and the Gun. *Ransom City* is about a salesman/inventor/vagrant/genius/con-artist/dreamer by the name of Harry Ransom, who's fleeing west with his fabulous Ransom Lightbringing Apparatus and his little band of followers to build the utopian Ransom City, leaving letters as he goes to explain how he got there and why he's running and what part he played in the Great War and why it wasn't entirely his fault.  It's a sort of Edisonade, and a sort of Horatio Alger story, and some other stuff.  There's a [related short story here](http://www.tor.com/stories/2010/10/lightbringers-and-rainmakers), and [an excerpt here.](http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/12/the-rise-of-ransom-city-excerpt)
 
I also wrote *Thunderer* and *Gears of the City* in 2008-ish.  They were about a big weird city and giant birds and things, and didn't actually have any literal gears in them if I remember correctly.
 
I live in New York. I'm originally from London. I spend a lot of my time at the moment at home with a toddler. Ask me whatever you like but I can't promise I won't start talking about the toddler instead, that's just how it is with toddlers.  

I will be back at 8PM Central to answer questions.

Thanks,

Felix

http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters is the link in question, but Reddit wouldn't let me re-post it to this forum so I'm making a self post.

I remember my excitement when I completed the first draft of my first book, I wanted to share it with the world at large, but /r/fantasy seemed such a negative place for that kind of thing. I learned in time that /r/fantasy was more for discussion of mainstream and independent authors rather than up-and-comers with one book to their name.

/r/fantasywriters is much more accepting of new works and you'll be critiqued by both readers and writers alike.

The best thing about it is that the more people who contribute to it the larger amount of feedback the works receive. So if you've any interest in fantasy but you're not planning on writing yourself you can still lend a hand with someone else's creation.

There are also other places like Critique Circle that cater to group suggestions if you want to head off-site.

I've really been looking forward to this! I'm [Michael J. Sullivan](http://www.riyria.blogspot.com/), author of [The Riyria Revelations](http://www.riyria.blogspot.com/p/books_19.html) from [Orbit](http://www.orbitbooks.net/2011/02/22/orbit-acquires-self-published-ebook-bestseller/) (fantasy imprint of Hachette Book Group), which includes *Theft of Swords*, *Rise of Empire*, and *Heir of Novron*. The series is actually six books but Orbit has released them as Omnibus versions so there are two books in each volume. Here's the official marketing spin from the first book:

&gt;""Acclaimed author Michael J. Sullivan created instant best sellers with his spellbinding Riyria Revelations series. This first volume introduces Royce Melborn and Hadrian Blackwater, two enterprising thieves who end up running for their lives when they're framed for the death of the king. Trapped in a conspiracy bigger than overthrow of a tiny monarchy, their only hope is unraveling an ancient mystery that has toppled kingdoms and destroyed empires.""

In addition to the two English Editions (US and UK) I also have foreign translations either out or in production for: 
Czech, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch, Turkish, and Hungarian. There are also hardcover bookclub editions from sfbc.com, and while all three will be in audio soon, presently just the first one has been released.

Oh...one more thing...as my books have lots of twist and surprise please use the spoiler formatting. So that anything that might spoil the story for other [such as this here](/spoiler) won't ruin the fun.  Instructuctions for doing so are on the right sidebar.  Thanks!

I was recently told by an editor that, while he thought many people would love to have his job, more might actually want mine.


My job, right now anyway, is sailing around the Caribbean writing books.   I gotta say, it doesn’t suck.  If you’re interested in our sailing adventures, drop by our [Sailing Blog](http://www.sailmrmac.blogspot.com/)


That hasn’t always been the case, and, in fact, I’m actually still paying my dues, though they are much less onerous than they once were.   I do, however, feel like I’ve really hit my stride.


I never thought to be a writer.  I wanted to be Jacque Cousteau.  No, really…  I think I was born about fifty years too late for that.  What I got was a twenty year career in biomedical research.  All throughout that time, however, I had a secret love: SF/Fantasy and RPG’s.  Finally, I got the idea to write up one of my RPG campaigns as a novel.  It’s been a rocky road, but I’ve had a surprisingly gratifying stint of self-publishing, a hit when I finally got the notion of putting my nautical experience into my stories (Duh!), several award winning novels, and finally a contract with Paizo for an RPG-related nautical fantasy, with a sequel pending approval.


Now I’m a sailing writer, or a writing sailor.  All I ask is that you enjoy my work.  I do, so you should, too.  So, go ahead and Ask Me Anything.  


I’ll be online for live Q&amp;A tonight from **7:00PM CST** until the rum is gone…

Fair winds!

Chris

I live in Oregon now, where my twin careers as a writer and a cancer patient really have been cutting into my reading time. A few years ago, people considered me a poster child for newer writers breaking into the field. Now I'm just another middle-aged, mid-list fart, but I'm still having a lot of fun with it.

[Having a child diagnosed with autism](http://autisticadvocacy.org/) has inspired me to illuminate the world through the eyes of those who see things differently.


I have a few projects on my table right now: A literary fiction novel I've written but haven't had the heart to revisit yet (it's emotionally draining), a horror novel that is too grotesque and taboo for the mainstream (thus also has been shoved to the back-burner), and volume two of the FOREVER GIRL SERIES, which is my priority now and has been a blast to work on so far!

There are several authors who I have missed. They are listed here.

* Robin Hobb

* Richard Kadrey

* ~~Moses Siregar III~~

* Guy Gavriel Kay 

* Steven Erikson (question got buried)

* Scott Lynch (same)


If any of you happen to know anywhere online where these authors compiled a list of their favorites, show me and I'll add them to the list. For science.

**Edit:** In case anyone was wondering why I put A Song of Ice and Fire under both Robin Hobb, and Joe Abercrombie's sections, here's why: Joe mentioned during his AMA's that the book was highly influential to him Robin Hobb also said that GRRM was currently her favorite author.

The *Gentleman Bastard Sequence* is a series of seven planned novels starting with [*The Lies of Locke Lamora*]( http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Locke-Lamora-Scott-Lynch/dp/055358894X/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1), [*Red Seas Under Red Skies*]( http://www.amazon.com/Red-Seas-Under-Skies/dp/0553588958/ref=pd_sim_b_1) and the upcoming *The Republic of Thieves*.  


In 2007 *The Lies of Locke Lamora* was a World Fantasy Award finalist and in 2008 Scott Lynch received the [*Sydney J. Bounds Best Newcomer Award* from the British Fantasy Society]( http://www.britishfantasysociety.co.uk/british-fantasy-awards/the-british-fantasy-awards-a-short-history/). 


[Scott Lynch also has an online serial adventure, *Queen of the Iron Sands*, that can be read here.]( http://www.scottlynch.us/ironsands.html) 



In 2008, Scott Lynch [posted a forthright livejournal update on depression and how it has impacted his life]( http://scott-lynch.livejournal.com/242814.html).  This should help pre-answer many questions around the timing of the *Gentleman Bastard Sequence*.




*  *""This is a fresh, original, and engrossing tale by a bright new voice in the fantasy genre. Locke Lamora makes for an engaging rogue, and Camorr a fascinating and gorgeously realized setting, a city to rival Lankhmar, Amber, and Viriconium. I look forward to returning there for many more visits.""* - **George R.R. Martin**


*  *""One part caper, one part swashbuckler, and one part Mission: Impossible, Scott Lynch's debut novel is deeply satisfying to the Robin Hood in all of us.""* - **Elizabeth Bear**


*  *“Among the year’s most impressive debuts ... Lynch immediately establishes himself as a gifted and fearless storyteller, unafraid of comparisons to Silverberg and Jordan, not to mention David Liss and even Dickens. Fans of lavishly appointed fantasy will be in seventh heaven here, but it will be nearly as popular with readers of literary crime fiction.""*— **Booklist, starred review**


*  *""As sequels go, Red Seas Under Red Skies is fabulous and a more accomplished, more tightly written novel than its predecessor. Considering what a top notch job Lynch did with his debut, this is impressive.""* - **Rob Bedford, SFFWORLD.COM**


We are lucky and very thankful to have Scott Lynch join us for an ‘Ask Me Anything’ session!  Please help spread the word and get your questions ready.


**NOTE:  This is a FYI about the upcoming Scott Lynch AMA  - use the comment section below for discussion and do not post your questions for Scott here.  The actual AMA will be posted early Wednesday morning with Scott returning ‘live’ at 7PM to answer questions.**

I'm [Myke Cole](http://mykecole.com/about), author of the military fantasy SHADOW OPS series from Ace (Penguin). The first novel, [CONTROL POINT]( http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Ops-Control-Myke-Cole/product-reviews/1937007243/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending), just came out yesterday and the second novel, FORTRESS FRONTIER, will be published roughly 1 year from now. I've published a few short stories and won the Writer's of the Future Contest about a million years ago.


I'm also an officer in the reserve. I've done 3 tours in Iraq and responded to both the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Irene.


I'm a nerd in the classic mode. I grew up on D&amp;D, and I still inhale comic books and fantasy/science-fiction novels at a fairly breathtaking rate.


Feel free to ask me any questions about breaking into the world of published authors. CONTROL POINT came out yesterday (January 31st) and it was a long road to get to that stage.  Would be glad to share anything about this experience as well. Also feel free to ask me any questions about military life, or how I balance a career in the reserve with writing.



I am new to Reddit, but I am very active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/MykeCole), [FaceBook](http://www.facebook.com/mykecole) and [my blog]( http://mykecole.com/) if you are interested. 



**I will be back at 8PM Eastern / 7PM Central to answer questions.**

My name is [Scott Oden](http://www.menofbronze.com/), and I’m another writer from that Golden Horde of Wordsmiths that periodically comes trampling through your halls, dangling their participles and splitting every infinitive they can find.  I work primarily in ancient historical fiction, a genre often indistinguishable from low-magic fantasy, though in recent years I have branched out into true and proper historical fantasy.  

I am the author of [MEN OF BRONZE](http://www.menofbronze.com/mob.php), an epic war novel set in Egypt, circa 525 BCE; the biographical novel [MEMNON](http://www.menofbronze.com/memnon.php), about a Greek general in Persian service, Memnon of Rhodes – the only man Alexander the Great feared; the Arabian Nights tale [THE LION OF CAIRO](http://www.menofbronze.com/loc.php), which blends Robert E. Howard style action and fantasy with the history of Fatimid Egypt; and the forthcoming A GATHERING OF RAVENS, which takes Orcs out of created-world fantasy and sets them down in Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Irish myth.

 

I live in North Alabama with my wife, Shannon, and our two dogs.  When not writing, reading, dog walking, or being a doting husband, I enjoy pen-and-paper RPGs, video games, and armchair archaeology.  

I do not necessarily enjoy my day-job, which paints me as a confidential courier of Italian-American delicacies (“pizza delivery guy” in the less grandiose world outside my own head).

 

I look forward to answering your questions!

*New York Times* bestselling author [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/) has a wide-ranging collection of awards and nominations to his name including the Locus Award, Clarke Award, Hugo Award, Prometheus Award and British Science Fiction Association Award.  


*  *""Sometimes when you're reading Neal Stephenson, he doesn't just seem like one of the best novelists writing in English right now; he seems like the only one.""* —Lev Grossman, *Time* magazine


[His speculative fiction works]( http://www.nealstephenson.com/) often defy categorization – ranging from science fiction, historical fiction, and fantasy to cyberpunk, and postcyberpunk.  Some of these include…


*  His 1992 breakthrough novel, [*Snow Crash*](http://www.nealstephenson.com/snowcrash/)  =, that redefined the standard for post-cyberpunk.  It was also named one of Time magazine's top one hundred all-time best English-language novels.  

*""A fantastic, slam-bang-overdrive, supersurrealistic, comic-spooky whirl through a tomorrow that is already happening. Neal Stephenson is intelligent, perceptive, hip and will become a major force in American writing.""* -- Timothy Leary


*  [Cryptonomicon](http://www.nealstephenson.com/crypt/), a blend of World War II codebreakers and their modern descendants as they deploy cryptologic technology to create a data haven.


*  [“The Baroque Cycle” *Quicksilver*, *The Confusion*, and *The System of the World*]( http://www.nealstephenson.com/quicksilver/) – A science fiction twist to historical events and characters from the 17th and early 18th centuries.   


*“A sublime, immersive, brain-throttlingly complex marvel of a novel that will keep scholars and critics occupied for the next 100 years""* – The Toronto Star  

*  *""Stephenson's [Reamde]( http://www.nealstephenson.com/reamde/) : perfectly executed, mammoth, ambitious technothriller...a book that represents a new kind of equilibrium in Stephenson's literary canon: a book that is simultaneously as baroque as System of the World and as cleanly and crisply finished as Anathem. It is, in other words, a triumph, all 980 pages of it.""* —Cory Doctorow


Earlier in June, Neal Stephenson fired off a [Kickstarter effort for CLANG – a swordfighting video game effort where players can enter the world of a real swordfighter.]( http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang?ref=live)  Clang is currently 60% funded with 20 days to go.

*  “At first, it’ll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don’t want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written–and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com’s new science fiction publishing house, we’ve already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that’ll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.”  


**NOTE:  The AMA will be posted Thursday morning – giving Redditors time to ask questions throughout the day.  Neal Stephenson will be ‘live’ answering questions at 8PM Central.**


Mark your calendar, think through some questions and please help get the word out!

My name is David Dalglish and I am a fantasy writer - AMA,149,17,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/19efgh/hey_rfantasy_my_name_is_david_dalglish_and_i_am_a/,"Hey guys, let me start off saying I don’t know anything. This mainly applies to reddit, but it’s a safe bet I’ll expose plenty of other things I’m clueless about as this AMA goes on. So if I mess up or do something stupid, well, you were warned.

To better introduce myself, my name is David Dalglish. I started out my writing career self-publishing fantasy novels, and to date have sold a little over 350,000 copies during the two and a half years I’ve been doing this. I have three different series so far, all fairly dark, and all varying wildly in terms of quality: [*The Half-Orcs*](http://smarturl.it/amzhalforcs), [*The Paladins*](http://smarturl.it/amzpaladins), and [*The Shadowdance Trilogy*](http://smarturl.it/amzshadowdance). 

Recently I’ve signed two significant book deals. The first is with **Orbit**, a six book deal to re-launch my *Shadowdance* books (easily my most popular, and the most likely reason any of you might have heard of me prior to, uh, now). The second deal is a three book deal with the Amazon imprint **47North**, to publish my Breaking World books that I’ve co-authored with a dear friend and fellow indie author, [Robert Duperre]( http://robertduperre.com/).
 
So, between self-publishing, Amazon, recently signing with an agent, signing with a traditional publisher, and co-authoring a new series of books, hopefully there’ll be a few things you all can ask me about. Well, besides the question I was warned about by one of my fans. Something about a thousand ducks or a horse..?
 
 
Oh, and obligatory info:  [Here is my website](http://ddalglish.com) and [my Facebook fanpage](http://www.facebook.com/thehalforcs).
 
**Edit 1: Okay, I'm here and answering. Let's hope this goes well, eh?**

**Edit 2: Winding down now, got about ten minutes before I go spend time with the wife. If you've got questions, hurry and ask away!**

**Edit 3: All right, comments slowing to a trickle, so calling it good. I'll be checking this over the next couple days, so any stragglers, I promise to still answer. Thanks everyone, I had a ball!**

Please add, so we can discuss what we think is coming in Book Three. 


In the Waystone Inn: 

* Kvothe's special skills are greatly diminished to the point of nonexistence. [Kvothe cannot maintain his Alar, recall the Ketan, or even open his mystery thrice-locked chest. But he can take ""one perfect step,"" suggesting a residual memory of his time in Ademre.] (/spoiler) 

* Bast is convinced he can heal ""Kote,"" [and is willing to do anything to try] (/spoiler)

* Based on currency quoted, the Inn is likely in Vintas. 

* Kvothe/Kote has traveled more than 1,000 miles, and slept more than 1,000 nights, since leaving [Ademre] (/spoiler)

* Chronicler and Kote have both spoken with [Skarpi] (/spoiler) relatively recently. 

* There is an active war between a king (""The Penitent King"") and unnamed rebels, one that is decimating the countryside. 

* This king's soldiers wear the same colors as the [Maer Alveron] (/spoiler)

* Kvothe does something in Book 3 that leads to legends being spread about magic rings on his hands (such as the rings given to Namers at the University), to other legends about rescuing a princess from a barrow-king, and to still further legends about him and ""Princess Ariel.""

* Kote's displayed sword ""Folly"" is NOT [Caesura/Saicere/Kaysera] (/spoiler), but it is made of the same material, which is likely distinct from both the material used to make Lanre's sword (silver) AND Taborlin's sword (copper). This unique material is as of yet unnamed. 

* Kote has not displayed a guilder, or implied he possesses one. This suggests that he is not a full arcanist, or is unwilling to reveal it to Bast or Chronicler. Nor does he appear to wear a gram. Therefore, either he is hiding a gram on his body, he's done something to thoroughly magically change himself so as to avoid malfeasance, or he would be vulnerable to, and powerless to stop, a Sympathetic attack. 

* We know from Elodin that changing one's Name is possible, but extremely dangerous. 

* Kote's residence at the Waystone is likely due to an attempt to fake his own death. Whether he lost his powers to assist in the ruse, or due to something beyond his control, is not known.

* Kvothe is thought dead, but people aren't surprised to find him alive.  

* Denna's song, [casting Lanre as a hero] (/spoiler), is popular by the time of Kvothe's fall from power.

In the main narrative: 

* Incidental clues, such as [Kvothe's father's poem, ""...tally a lot less...,""] (/spoiler) suggest that Kvothe's mother is [Meluan Lackless' lost sister, Netalia.] (/spoiler)

* Auri's gifts of a [key, coin, and candle] (/spoiler) mirror the tools of [Taborlin the Great.] (/spoiler)

* The Amyr are an actual, honest-to-goodness mystery. Even someone with Maer Alveron's abilities cannot find secular, reliable documentation of their existence. 

* But, the Amyr still exist, or have fooled Haliax into believing they do. 

* Tehlu was one of the most powerful Amyr, not a Jesus-like savior figure.
 
* Kvothe is owed favors by two powerful families -- [Stapes and Bredon] (/spoiler). The latter is said to be involved in ""pagan"" rituals. Kvothe dismisses this out of hand. 

* Ambrose Jakis' family is advancing rapidly in the Vintish line of succession, possibly due to foul play. Maer Alveron remains ahead of Baron Jakis. 

* [Hemme] (/spoiler) is now Chancellor, but it's not a big deal. Yet? 

* Kvothe has sworn (at least) three dangerous oaths. [(1) He swore to return to Felurian; (2) to *not* seek the name of Denna's patron, by ""my name, my power, and my good left hand,"" and; (3) to keep secret the existence of the Loeclos/Lackless Box by ""my hand."" We know his left hand is most important to him, because it's his chording hand. ] (/spoiler)

* The Lackless family *does* have a mysterious box, inscribed with barely-visible writing. 

* Popular mythology holds that there is another Lackless family secret -- the lockless door on the family lands. But this legend may be a corruption of the ""true"" legend of the box. 

* Chronicler's last name, Lochees, sounds like (but is not included in the list of) the Lackless family branch-names given by Caudicus. 

* The Chandrian do, as theorized by Kvothe's parents, operate independently of each other. 

* The Adem have independent experience with the Chandrian; possibly an older, more salient memory of their true Names; and can trace their own heritage to Myr Tariniel. At least some Adem swords are older than the Creation War, for example. 

* The Chandrian are powerful enough to threaten the Fae. 

* The Chandrian, and specifically Haliax, have something to do with the phases of the Moon.

* The University ""Underthing"" contains a disused, vaguely mechanized city. 

* Due to his contact with [the Ctaeh, Kvothe's life is likely to cause or end in tragedy. Perhaps it already has.] (/spoiler) 

* Kvothe was either *allowed* to approach [the Ctaeh] (/spoiler) by the Sithe, or he managed to elude them, wholly by accident. 

* The Sithe are opposed to the Chandrian. 

* Iax/Jax, the Shaper who instigated the Creation War and separated the Fae from the Four Corners, is shut beyond ""The Doors of Stone."" 

* Bast has sworn by ""the Doors of Stone,"" suggesting their existence is something of common knowledge to the Fae. 

* Elodin *might* have been behind the four-panel door in the Archives.

(For me, this was Lies of Locke Lamora.) Others grip you immediately but your attention wanes a little along the way. (For me, this was The Wheel of Time or The Farseer Trilogy.)

And then, some rare ones grip you immediately and keep their claws hooked under your skin 'til the very last page. (For me, this was books like The Name of the Wind, Ready Player One, Harry Potter, The Painted Man, Stardust, Lion of Macedon.)

I'd very much like to hear which books you guys have come across that fit the latter category.

I’m research scientist Mark Lawrence. I also write books. Unlike many authors it wasn’t ever my dream to be a professional writer. Even when I started writing books (in my mid 30s) I thought being published was so unlikely that I didn’t make it a goal.

So, the fact that my Broken Empire trilogy concludes today with the release of Emperor of Thorns in the UK/Australia (out on the 6th for US/Canada) is quite surreal. I just checked on UK Amazon and the hardback is #89 in books. I guess it’s a testimony to the rise in popularity of epic fantasy that #89 in books is just #17 on the Epic Fantasy Bestseller list! The kindle is at #13 on that list and 11 of the 12 spots above it are occupied by a certain George RR Martin.

*

The Broken Empire trilogy starts with [Prince of Thorns]( http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Thorns-Broken-Empire-Lawrence/dp/0441020321/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1290029691&amp;sr=8-1) 

I’ve linked the first 16 reviews to appear for [Emperor of Thorns](http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/emperor-of-thorns-early-reviews.html)

*

My books are often described as unpredictable so it would be great if you could use spoilers like this [spoiler description](#s ""your spoiler text"") when appropriate and also indicate which book you’re spoiling as people might want to discuss King of Thorns spoilers but not Emperor of Thorns ones. (it tells you how to do it near the bottom right hand side of the /r/Fantasy page.

*

I have a fully accredited Geek Card, was read Lord of the Rings at age 7, started Dungeons and Dragons in 1977 and misspent my youth on it, got a ZX Spectrum computer in 1982 and wrote bad games for it, and raised myself on fantasy books.

*

I am not now nor ever have been a person who knows how commas work.


*

I will be responding to questions real time from 10pm-2am GMT (that’s 5pm-9pm Central).

Fire away! Ask Me Anything!

Cheers,
                Mark

I won a Hugo Award a few years back, and have lost most of the other major genre awards (Nebula, World Fantasy, Stoker, Campbell Best New Writer, Sturgeon, etc). I've published a couple of story collections and really should try to put together another one soon.


I've written a couple of standalone fantasy novels, starting with cowpunk fantasy first novel The Strange Adventures of Rangergirl, and more recently Briarpatch, about suicidal ideation and magical cars and bears who turn into dudes (among other things).


I write an urban fantasy series as T.A. Pratt, about [an ass-kicking sorcerer named Marla Mason]( http://marlamason.net/). I published four books about her with a big publisher (Random House) before the series got dropped, and have since self-published three more via crowdfunding/reader donations. (I publish in all kinds of ways. I like trying new things.)


A couple of years ago I started doing roleplaying game tie-ins, with a Forgotten Realms novel out this spring and one in the Pathfinder Chronicles coming out very soon now, with another I'm writing right now.


Sometimes I edit anthologies. And do the odd bit of poetry. I'm a senior editor at [Locus magazine]( http://www.locusmag.com/), the trade magazine of the SF/Fantasy field. (If you're a SF/fantasy writer, and you die? I'm the one who writes your obituary.)


I'm here for you. Ask me anything.

What you often don't hear about are the authors who've been writing for years under the radar, grinding out stories without the recognition just because they love it.

I'm part of a collection with three other authors just like that: Daniel Arenson, D.P. Prior, and M.S. Verish, all of whom have created some unique and imaginative stories that just plain haven't gotten the recognition they deserve.

Well, that's about to change. Our *Ultimate Fantasy Box Set: Dragons, Dwarves, and Swords* is starting to fly off the digital shelves now that we've got it on sale for 99c. It's currently ranked #8 in Epic Fantasy on Amazon (just behind GRRM mostly), 367 in the entire Kindle store, and is the #1 Hot New Release for Fantasy.

We are the authors and artist behind the [**Unfettered**](http://grimoakpress.com/2012/08/unfettered-edited-by-shawn-speakman/) anthology.

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.  I was lucky in that it is a very treatable cancer; I was unlucky in that I didn't have health insurance due to a pre-existing condition.  Rather than declare medical bankruptcy and be financially ruined for a decade, I took a different route.  When I went to friend and mentor Terry Brooks asking for a short story donation that I would sell online, he suggested I contact my other writing friends and ask the same.

**Unfettered** came into being that way, an anthology filled with some of the most talented writers in our genre.  Through pre-sales for the book, my debt is almost gone.  The science fiction and fantasy community rallied around me.  You rallied around me.  

And for that I’ll be forever indebted. 

**Unfettered** authors [**Blake Charlton**](http://www.blakecharlton.com/) and [**Eldon Thompson**](http://www.eldonthompson.com/) plus artist [**Todd Lockwood**](http://www.toddlockwood.com/) will be taking lead on today's AMA.

For a majority of this time, pretty much everybody including the fantasy audience, book critics, and authors have regarded WoT as the foremost triumph in the fantasy genre since LOTR. It has been hugely popular and massively acclaimed. However, I've (and i'm sure other Wheel of Time fans) have noticed a trend in the last couple years that it has become an nearly accepted thing to hate the wheel of time. I'm not really sure why, part of me thinks it is because of the rising popularity of ASOIAF that people felt the need to tear something down while building ASOIAF up. Whatever the reason, it's pretty clear that in the last few years the general opinion on the internet is that WoT is terrible and not worth reading, and that really saddens me. Just the other day somebody posted on the WoT subreddit saying that everyone he knew was telling him how awful WoT is, and he wanted to be convinced to read it. I'm just curious to see if anybody has any opinions or insights on this. Bonus points if BS replies.

I wrote [*The Desert of Souls, Plague of Shadows, The Waters of Eternity*, and a whole slew of short stories]( http://www.howardandrewjones.com/fiction). I got my start in the industry assembling 8 collections of swashbuckling historical fiction by Harold Lamb for the University of Nebraska Press, then edited the first six issues of the *Flashing Swords* e-zine before moving on to [*Black Gate*]( http://www.blackgate.com/), where I’ve been Managing Editor for many years.


I was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, studied radio-tv-film, and worked briefly as a tv cameraman and production assistant. Most of my work life, though, was spent editing technical books related to computers, or teaching English composition. Today I still live in Indiana with my wife and two children, and an animal menagerie that includes four horses and a dozen chickens. I write full-time.


The series that starts with [*The Desert of Souls*]( http://us.macmillan.com/thedesertofsouls/HowardJones) and [*Waters of Eternity*]( http://us.macmillan.com/thewatersofeternity/HowardJones) is historical fantasy, so I spend a lot of my spare time reading about 8th century Baghdad. When I’m not reading, writing, or taking care of horses I’m probably playing with my kids, playing piano, or sitting down with my wife and friends for some table-top role-playing games. Our group still meets almost every Friday.


I’m currently putting the final touches on my next Arabian fantasy, *The Bones of the Old Ones*, featuring the same characters from *Desert* and *Waters*.


Ask me anything.


**I will be responding to questions real time at 7 pm Central.**


I look forward to chatting with you, though I’ll follow Joe Abercrombie’s lead and suggest it’s probably best to avoid spoilers.

Most negative reviews pegged Kvothe as a Mary Sue, extremely talented at everything. The response from fans was always the same; Kvothe is an unreliable narrator.

I decided that the latter crowd was probably right and that the negative reviewers missed some nuances. So I bought both books and started reading, looking out for hints of Kvothe's unreliability. If he is indeed an unreliable narrator and the book is as good as people claim, surely there must be some obvious hints left by Rothfuss. Maybe Kvothe contradicting himself, or another character pointing out some inconsistency.. Otherwise, how would we actually know that he is an unreliable narrator?

I finished The Name of The Wind yesterday and I'm starting to agree with the Mary Sue crowd. There were only two incidents that I found that somewhat incriminated Kvothe as an unreliable narrator.

1. He admits to spreading false information about himself at the University, so we know he's prone to glorifying himself. 
Rebuttal: everyone has told some lies to make themselves look better. The fact that Kvothe admits doing this doesn't make him any less reliable, it should maybe make him more reliable.

2. When talking about the beauty of certain girl, Bast says that he saw her and she wasn't really that beautiful. Rebuttal: beauty is subjective.

So am I missing something subtle, or even blatant?

Unless there is something in print that heavily suggests that Kvothe is an unreliable narrator, are the people that claim so not simply putting words into the author's mouth, as we often do? I have admittedly only read the first book, but you'd think that one book should be enough to clear this out.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_1g4xul,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1g4xul/kvothe_unreliable_narrator_or_a_mary_sue/,

I'm Liane Merciel. I write fantasy books of the swords-and-castles variety, most recently the Pathfinder Tales novel Nightglass. My other books include The River Kings' Road and Heaven's Needle. Some critics have suggested they were not completely terrible. I think my mom bribed them to say that, though.


In my ""real"" life I work as a prosecutor (mostly doing appeals from murder cases), torment PCs in a long-running roleplaying campaign, volunteer with a pet rescue group, and have a side gig as a professional dog trainer.


I live in Philadelphia with two permanent dogs, an exceedingly elderly guinea pig, and (usually) a third foster dog. Our current foster dog is a spectacularly smart border collie named Mab (yes, she's named after Shakespeare's Mab). Oh, and there's another human in the house too, somewhere...


Anyway: let's do this! Ask me anything. GO!


(...although I won't actually be back to answer your questions until **8 pm EST**.)


Thanks!

I’m [Richard Lee Byers](http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Lee-Byers/e/B001HPY8NM). I’ve written around forty fantasy and horror novels including *Called to Darkness*, my first Pathfinder novel, *Blind God’s Bluff*, the start of a new urban fantasy series, and *Prophet of the Dead*, my latest set in the Forgotten Realms universe. My novel *The Spectral Blaze* won Diehard GameFAN’s award for the Best Game-Based Novel of 2011.

I’m also the creator of The Impostor, a post-apocalyptic superhero series, have cranked out dozens of short stories, write a monthly feature for the SF news site Airlock Alpha, and contribute to The Night Bazaar, the Night Shade Books authors’ blog.

I live in the Tampa Bay area, where I spend my free time fencing, GMing, and playing poker. I often turn up at Gen Con and Florida SF conventions.

[I'm Tim Pratt](http://www.timpratt.org/), writer of various things, including a handful of fantasy novels set in the worlds of roleplaying games: Forgotten Realms novel Venom In Her Veins and two Pathfinder Tales novels, City of the Fallen Sky and Liar's Blade. (I'm currently writing another Pathfinder novel, set in the ""savage land of super science"" Numeria, which should be out sometime next year.) I've also published standalone original fantasy novels and have an ongoing urban fantasy series about an ill-tempered sorcerer named Marla Mason, too. 


I won a Hugo Award a few years back, and have lost most of the other major genre awards (Nebula, World Fantasy, Stoker, Campbell Best New Writer, Sturgeon, etc). My third story collection, Antiquities and Tangibles, just came out. Sometimes I edit anthologies (including the upcoming Rags and Bones co-edited with Melissa Marr -- it's got new stories by Saladin Ahmed, Kelley Armstrong, Holly Black, Neil Gaiman, Gene Wolfe, Rick Yancey, and other amazing people). For my day job I'm senior editor at Locus magazine, the trade journal of SF/F publishing, where among other things I write the obituaries. I publish traditionally with big and small presses, but I also crowdfund and self-publish some projects. I used to edit a 'zine. I live in Berkeley CA and have a brilliant wife and an adorable five-year-old son. I tweet too much. I'll talk about anything.

**UPDATE** I'm winding down now. Thanks for the great questions! I'll swing back by tomorrow and try to pick up any I missed. I'll be blathering as always on twitter, where I'm @timpratt.

1362514102.0,117,self.Fantasy,19q5nz,We are the creators and writers for THE MONGOLIAD - AMA!,131,14,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/19q5nz/we_are_the_creators_and_writers_for_the_mongoliad/,"**Neal Stephenson, Erik Bear, Greg Bear, Joseph Brassey, Nicole Galland, Mark Teppo and Cooper Moo** are the team behind **[The Mongoliad](http://foreworld.com/)**.  Members of the group will be here this evening at **8PM Central** to answer questions.

-----------------------------------------------------

*The Mongoliad* was originally conceived and presented as a community-driven, enhanced, serial novel. The story is set in the year 1241 CE when Europe thought that the Mongol Horde was about to completely destroy their world and only a small band of warriors and mystics stood in the way of utter defeat and subjugation by the great Khan.


[*The Mongoliad: Book One*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mongoliad-Collectors-Edition-Foreworld/dp/1612184693/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353881605&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=subutacorpor-20) was released in November, 2012.  The first novel to be released in *The Foreworld Saga*, it is an epic-within-an-epic, taking place in 13th century. In it, a small band of warriors and mystics raise their swords to save Europe from a bloodthirsty Mongol invasion. Inspired by their leader (an elder of an order of warrior monks), they embark on a perilous journey and uncover the history of hidden knowledge and conflict among powerful secret societies that had been shaping world events for millennia.

[*The Mongoliad: Book Two*](http://www.amazon.com/Mongoliad-Collectors-SideQuest-Dreamer-Foreworld/dp/1612185606/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362512859&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+mongoliad) involves the aftermath of the world-shattering Mongolian invasion of 1241 and the difficult paths undertaken by its most resilient survivors.

[*The Mongoliad: Book Three*](http://www.amazon.com/Mongoliad-Book-Three-Foreworld-Saga/dp/1612182380/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362512859&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+mongoliad) was released in February, 2013 and tells the personal stories of medieval freedom fighters to form an epic, imaginative recounting of a moment in history when a world in peril relied solely on the courage of its people.

-------------------------------------------------------

**[Mark Teppo](http://foreworld.com/the-authors/mark-teppo/)** is the author of the Codex of Souls urban fantasy series as well as the eco-thriller, Earth Thirst. He is the showrunner for the Foreworld Saga.  He lives in the Pacific Northwest.


-------------------------------------------------------

I was one of the main writers on the *Mongolian* storyline - dealing with Ogedei Khan, Gansukh, Lian, Chucai, and all those other guys. I've always been interested in the intermingling of cultures that results from imperialism, and the evolution of the Mongol empire in particular, so this was a somewhat perfect project for me. That sounds a bit pretentious for a martial arts epic I guess. I also like hitting things with swords.

[**Erik Bear**](http://foreworld.com/the-authors/erik-bear/)

------------------------------------------------------

 I was the primary writer on the *Circus of Swords* branch of *The Mongoliad*, dealing with the second stringers and B-team knights who decide to defy Onghwe Khan or die trying. I've got two more *Foreworld* titles coming out this year, and am currently working on a fantasy of my own. In my off-hours 
I'm a domestic husband and assistant instructor of a medieval martial arts class on the local military base. I've been a paper boy, farm-hand, picture-framer, hospital kitchen-slave, and temp worker in a lot of factories with questionable safety policies.

[**Joseph Brassey**](http://foreworld.com/the-authors/joseph-brassey/)

-----------------------------------------
Hi Reddit Fantasy Group, I’m Cooper Moo, one of two main writers on the Mongol branch of *The Mongoliad*.  Erik Bear and I worked to ensure the bad guys in our epic tale were portrayed as something more than just “the horde”– hopefully we pulled it off.  I’m one of four authors on an upcoming *Foreworld* book and have a side quest on deck called *Pox Mongolica*.  

For those who are fans of serendipitous sword fight adventures I offer: http://www.slate.com/authors.cooper_moo.html

Her novel Godiva will come out this July. She is the co-founder of Shakespeare for the Masses, a project that irreverently makes the Bard accessible to the Bardophobics of the world.

[**Greg Bear**](http://foreworld.com/the-authors/greg-bear/) is the author of more than thirty books, spanning thrillers, science fiction, and fantasy, including Blood Music, Eon, The Forge of God, Darwin’s Radio, City at the End of Time, and Hull Zero Three.

I'm **Anne Lyle**, author of alternate history fantasy series Night's Masque, set in Elizabethan England. The first book, [The Alchemist of Souls] (http://www.annelyle.com/nightsmasque/the-alchemist-of-souls/), was published in March this year, with the sequel [The Merchant of Dreams] (http://www.annelyle.com/nightsmasque/the-merchant-of-dreams/) out this very week! (I'm working on the third and final volume, The Prince of Lies, right now.) The trilogy follows the adventures of Mal Catlyn, a mercenary-turned-spy, who is plucked almost literally from the gutter to serve as bodyguard to an ambassador from the New World. A non-human ambassador… The books are a mixture of intrigue, action and romance, with - somewhat unusually for fantasy novels, even now - a number of LGBT characters in the main cast.

I was born in England, in a town that used to be at the heart of Sherwood Forest (before they cut most of the trees down), so I had a childhood fascination with Robin Hood and other swashbuckling heroes. Then in my teens I discovered fantasy and SF, and there was no turning back. Nowadays I live in an equally famous place, the university city of Cambridge, which has loads of medieval and Tudor buildings - perfect for a history buff like me!

I didn't study history at university, though, as I found school history lessons rather dull. Instead I opted for biological sciences, and now work for one of the world's largest medical charities as a web developer, helping to supply research scientists with the latest data on the human genome plus open-source software with which to analyse that data. With such a high-tech job, you'd think I'd write SF, but I find low-tech fantasy a nice change from all the computers :)

I'll be back at 6pm CST/midnight GMT to answer questions - however given that I'm normally not a night owl, I'll most likely duck out after a couple of hours and return in the morning to finish up. In the meantime, do ask me anything!

**EDIT: 2am GMT/8pm CST** It's getting late here in the UK, so I'm going to head to bed - do carry on with the questions, and I'll answer them in the morning. Thanks very much for the convo - it's been huge fun!

**SECOND EDIT** OK, I think I've answered everything. I'll check back over the next couple of days, in case you guys have anything else to add, but otherwise Happy Christmas/Hanukkah/Yule/(insert holiday of choice) and thanks for inviting me onto Reddit! Hope you enjoy the books :)

I’m [Alma Katsu](http://www.almakatsu.com/bio.php), the author of [*The Taker* and *The Reckoning*](http://www.almakatsu.com/books.php), the first two books in a trilogy published by Gallery Books (Simon &amp; Schuster). Haven’t heard of them? That’s probably because they are almost impossible to categorize. Many readers say they’ve never read anything like them, a fact that I’m proud of. They have elements of fantasy, horror, literary, and historicals and have been compared to early Anne Rice, Diana Gabaldon’s *Outlander* novels, and Elizabeth Kostova’s *The Historian*. But, others have compared them to *The Portrait of Dorian Gray* and my writing to Shirley Jackson’s and Patricia Highsmith’s. Which is just crazy talk. 

 

I can tell you that [*The Taker* was named one of the ten best debut novels of 2011 by the American Library Association](http://www.almakatsu.com/taker.php#praise) and has been published in 16 languages.

 

I can’t claim to be an expert on fantasy fiction, but I read pretty widely. What matters to me are original ideas and fearless writing. I earned a MA in fiction from the Johns Hopkins Writing Program.

 
And if none of that seems particularly interesting to you, I also had a 29-year career in intelligence. Yup, the real deal, cloak-and-dagger stuff. You can ask me anything, but that doesn’t mean I’ll tell you the truth. :-)

I’m Helen Lowe, an FSF novelist, a poet, radio interviewer, blogger, and the current Ursula Bethell writer-in-residence at the University of Canterbury (UoC.) Both the UoC and I are located in Christchurch New Zealand—a locale pretty much off the world’s radar until we became ‘earthquake central’ last year, a circumstance which has definitely made for ‘interesting times.’


In terms of my writing career to date I’ve published three novels, all fantasy—the kids/YA *Thornspell* in 2008, and the first two novels in THE WALL OF NIGHT series: *The Heir of Night* in 2010 and most recently *The Gathering of the Lost.* I am currently writing *Daughter of Blood*, the third novel in THE WALL OF NIGHT series. I’ve also published a considerable amount of poetry internationally and some short fiction, although novels are my first prose love. 


The radio work involves interviewing poets and novelists for a local station and I also do interviews on my blog, again chiefly with FSF authors and poets. My blogging credentials are modest, but I do post every day on my own [Helen Lowe on Anything Really]( http://helenlowe.info/blog/) site, on the first of every month on the [Supernatural Underground]( http://www.supernaturalunderground.blogspot.com/) and occasionally on [SF Signal]( http://www.sfsignal.com/). 


Other stuff I’m interested in outside of writing? I have a second dan black belt in the martial art aikido and represented my university in fencing. I am very interested in both history and astronomy, enjoy hiking and cycling, gardening and wine (all in no particular order), as well as both cooking food and consuming it—preferably in the company of friends.


**I will be answering questions starting at 8PM Central / 1PM in New Zealand.**


Best, 


HelenL




**Signing Off for Now:**

OK, I think it's 1 am Central Time, 11 pm Pacific Time and 6 pm (dinner time!) here in NZ, so time to call it quits for today. But I will pop back in tomorrow, (probably early to mid evening Central time if I can) to reply to any further comments or questions.

But for now I would like to say: thank you so much first to Robin for hosting me and for being so supportive of my books generally, and to elquesogrande for moderating--I really appreciate your both taking the time. But a huge thank you, too, to everyone here in the Reddit community; you've been tremendous and I've had a fabulous time. 

Waves *and* blows kisses.

Good night &amp; take care all.

HelenL

 


**Thurs 18**

Hi again, I apologise for the slight delay on the 'early' part of the evening, but it's 8 pm now (Central time) so am still making the ""mid"" for checking back--so now will have a ""look-see"" below to see if there's anything for me to do.:)

best, HelenL




9.20 pm (Central time) OK, have caught up on those few extra questions and comments &amp; think we may now have a wrap. Thank you again for being so welcoming everyone, and to Robin for hosting: I've had a great time.

Now I had best go do some writing ... both characters and worlds await!

Au 'voir, 

Helen

Robert Cargill, author of the new fantasy novel DREAMS AND SHADOWS and longtime lurker of r/Fantasy. Some of you might know me as Massawyrm from my decade over at Ain’t it Cool News, as Carlyle, the animated film critic over at Spill.com, or from the horror movie I co-wrote last year, SINISTER. I’ve also recently written scripts adapting the classic cyberpunk novel WHEN GRAVITY FAILS and the video game DEUS EX: HUMAN REVOLUTION.




When I’m not writing, reading or watching movies, I spend my time as an avid redditor, playing and painting Warhammer 40K and D&amp;D, arguing movies and politics over coffee at a local all-night diner and being a husband.




I’m a huge fan of coffee, pie, late night tacos, Mexican beer, the Harvard comma, and White Russians. I keep what my agents and editors all refer to as “vampire hours,” usually going to sleep just before sunrise. And I must warn you that I keep a bottle of good 12 year old Irish whiskey within arm’s reach of my keyboard, and I know how to use it.




So let’s open it up: ask me anything. I’ll be back at **8PM CST** to answer!

**Edit 1**: I'm here. I've got a cup of iced coffee and fingers itching to type. Let's talk!

**Edit 2**: going out to celebrate Pi day with my wife at our favorite dessert place. Keep the questions coming! I'll be back shortly to finish up what's left and hit up the new Qs.

**Edit 3**: And we're back! Let's finish out this bad boy.

On **Thursday, July 19 at 7PM CST** /r/Fantasy will be hosting a group AMA involving ten (10) authors who all had debut books in 2011.  These will include:

* [Teresa Frohock](http://www.teresafrohock.com/) - *Miserere: An Autumn Tale, The Garden* (Forthcoming)

* [Mazarkis Williams](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mazarkis-Williams/142758085795105?ref=ts) - *The Emperor's Knife, Knifesworn* (Forthcoming)

The scoop is that fellow redditor [*jdiddyesquire*]( http://www.reddit.com/user/jdiddyesquire) is also a fantasy blogger at [Staffer’s Book Review]( http://staffersmusings.blogspot.com/).  He was in the process of organizing this group and wanted to know if we would like to bring them all in for a mass r/ Fantasy AMA.  The authors were definitely up for it – so are we.

**NOTE:**  The [Staffer’s Book Review Debut Authorpalooza (2012)]( http://staffersmusings.blogspot.com/2012/07/debut-authorpalooza-2012.html) kicks off on Monday.  Each author will take over the blog for 10 total days with book giveaways each day.  The AMA and the Debut Authorpalooza are separate events, but please feel free to swing by and check things out as they progress.  Many thanks *jdiddyesquire* for pulling this together.

The AMA itself will be just like any other r/Fantasy AMA, except with 10 authors and a common debut theme.  You will be able to ask any author a specific question and/or to pose one for the group.  We should have several authors there ‘live’ Thursday evening at 7PM CST while the international crowd will pop in-and-out over the next day.

**tl;dr – 10 author AMA next Thursday. Have fun.**

1340081197.0,104,self.Fantasy,v9g7u,You should really read Hyperion.,111,7,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/v9g7u/you_should_really_read_hyperion/,"I guess Hyperion is technically Scifi, but I was goaded into reading it by a post here about a week ago, and I think it has a lot to offer to fantasy readers.

So my Hyperion pitch. Hyperion is a Scifi novel that uses the Canterbury Tales style frame narrative of related short stories to present its plot. The short stories are tied to one another by the planet of Hyperion and a mysterious monster that lives there called the Shrike. The stories address a wide variety of high minded topics like the nature of life, death, and time and the definition of god using fringe hypotheticals that are accessible because of the universe's technology.

The best part though, from my perspective at least, is that this is a Scifi world whose roots are firmly planted in our reality. Various real religious sects and their moral and theological conundrums are reevaluated in a universe that sometimes radically alters their basic premises. The accessibility of modern literature and art means that Hyperion doesn't have to spend an amazing amount of time building a philosophical foundation. Instead, it quotes, references, or alludes to established work like The Canterbury Tales, the poetry of Keats, the poetry of Yeats, the famous heresies of the Catholic church, and others. 

This is a rare piece of Scifi/fantasy that has great storytelling while simultaneously being a great piece of literature independent of genre. Seriously, go read it.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_v9g7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/v9g7u/you_should_really_read_hyperion/,

Feedback from these authors has been very positive about the redditors at r/Fantasy:  ""I had a wonderful time, really worth it, great questions, I showed my publisher and she was floored, an exceptional time...I really hope that I didn't offend anyone.""  That type of response. Nicely done, [/r/Fantasy](/r/Fantasy)!


What's next...

* We currently have Military Fantasy novelist [**Myke Cole** set for an AMA this Wednesday](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/oxnup/fyi_military_fantasy_novelist_and_writers_of_the/) - the day after his first book launch.  
* Author **Guy Gavriel Kay** will be joining us for an AMA next week.
*  Hugo award nominee **Saladin Ahmed** will join us the following week.
* Fantasy author **Brent Weeks** is lined up after that.

(These AMA's are set for now, but can change due to potential author scheduling conflicts.)

More are looking for specific dates and times.

Many of the older novels are superior to ones on this stringent modern list but not as well recognised and do not qualify.

**Preamble**

Seven months ago I compiled a [list of suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/okwoj/an_attempt_to_create_rfantasys_list_of_essential/) from the community as to what they regarded as the finest works of modern fantasy fiction. Now I've decided to create a condensed version of these results based on the process of elimination detailed below:

**Criteria**

In order to be part of this list, the books had to survive a series of arbitrary tests, establishing them as critically acclaimed, recognisably popular and relevant to the list at hand:

* No Young Adult fiction / Children's Literature / Paranormal
* Only one book per fantasy world (Discworld, Midkemia etc)
* Only the first book of a series allowed
* No compilation books allowed (Rule excludes Theft of Swords by Michael J. Sullivan at author's request)
* Must be considered a work of fantasy foremost
* Must have at least 1,000 ratings on Goodreads (Excludes books with different versions accumulating a total of over 1,000 ratings)
* Must have at least 3.80 overall rating on Goodreads
* Must be published after 1857
* Must be novel-length, no novellas

With that in mind, here's the list of books that survived the stringent cut, sorted by date of publication:

UPDATE: Thanks to ctbailey there's now a google doc of the list with amazon links for each book: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY7iz4-tPJbTiExZlLpSiiJlIcqxrRwFFqBbkxClNQs/edit)

Help spread the word?",168,61,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/lrny6/my_beautiful_talented_and_very_sick_13_year_old/,"** This is a cross-post from /r/assistance and /r/randomkindness **

nitesmoke encouraged me to post here. Thank you for reading!

My daughter Sarah has been suffering from Crohn's Disease for ten years and it's not an overstatement, I think, to say that she's barely been surviving it. I have Crohn's myself, for 28 years now, and I've been through a lot, but nothing like her. Treatment after treatment fails for her after working only a short time, or worse, causes such a bad reaction that the medication itself actually has hospitalized her twice.

She has joint pain throughout her entire body after a bad reaction to Remicade a few years ago, and when she gets up off the floor you can hear every bone in her body crack, like a sack of twigs.

Sarah's little sister, Izzy, is two. Until Monday, we thought she might be deaf. Now we're not sure what's wrong. She has a ""diagnosis"" of autism, but that was given to us by a speech pathologist who only saw her for 45 minutes. We think she might have suffered neurological damage from childhood jaundice but can't be sure. If there is damage, it's too ""mild"" to diagnose, so she gets ""autism"" instead. Izzy can barely speak and the words she does say are garbled and hard to understand. She has trouble with tasks like putting shoes on or taking them off, dressing, undressing, walking on uneven terrain... all things that she should be able to do, or at least attempt successfully around 50% of the time, at age 2. We have seen neurologists, audiologists, and now we've resigned ourselves to just taking her to speech and behavioral therapy for autism in the absence of another diagnosis. Izzy is a happy, affectionate, smilling, beautiful girl who LOVES hugs and kisses, loves to ""sing"", dance, play peek-a-boo, is incredibly imaginative and acts out spontaneous, imaginary scenes with her toys. If it's Autism, it must be incredibly MILD autism. I'd like to be able to get more frequent and more varied therapy for her than is generally available through usual channels like our state's early intervention programs (which are backlogged and inefficient), but that takes resources that I'm forking over monthly to creditors.

I've posted on /r/assistance before, on a longshot, asking for advice or help with our debt. Currently, 25% of my take-home pay is going to Citibank so that we'll have a prayer of being debt free in around 4 years, providing there are no major problems between now and then. This is necessary because just the interest alone on this debt is leeching SO MUCH of our household income that it's literally destroying our family's well being. We can't take Sarah to clinical trials even if we got accepted to one because they're too far away and we can't afford plane tickets, hotels, or whatever, because of the $800-$1000 per month that I pay Citibank each month to keep ahead of the interest charges. Bankruptcy won't work for us. We'll be categorized Chapter 13 and then instead of our own aggressive repayment schedule, we'll have a court ordered, mandatory one with no flexibility which will make things even more nightmarish than they are now.

Like I said in the title, Sarah has written a novel. She spent almost a year getting up every morning before dawn and writing before school. She wrote after her homework was done. She wrote on holidays, school vacations, sick days, and snow days. When her joint pain became too severe for her to sit at her desk, she lay on the couch and wrote with pencil and paper.

Sarah wanted to sell her novel as an e-book to try to help our family out of this situation, so over the past few weeks I edited and proofread it, created a cover (with a photo kindly donated by a professional photographer), wrote a foreword, and published the book to both Kindle and Nook.

You can read about the book here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/

You can read about Sarah's history, with cameos by Izzy, here:

http://www.sarah-story.com

And the regularly updated blog is here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/news


Would any of you consider sharing the URL for the book (http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/) through social media, friends, colleagues, classmates, whatever you feel might be appropriate, if you're so inclined? There is a link on that page to download the book for free in EPUB format for the curious, and a donate link for ""tips"" if you like it, so it's not even necessary to buy the book if you want to read it, and you can pay what you want, even if it's $0. On Nook or Kindle, the book is $2.99 (** UPDATE: non-US customers may have taxes or other fees added, please read the screen carefully before purchasing **)

I would dearly love any assistance anyone might give in spreading the word about this novel.

We're in Connecticut. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but it's getting cold here and we have about 1/4 of a tank of oil left and I'm not sure where the money for a refill, and/or for firewood for our woodstove, is going to come from. I'm already paying most of our bills two weeks late, and this week I had to take two days off unpaid to bring Izzy to a specialist consultation and a sedated outpatient diagnostic procedure. Things are getting bad. If we can generate interest in Sarah's book, it might bring some relief.

Thank you and kudos to you if you managed to read all of this. I'm not even sure where I'd begin on a TL;DR. Sorry if I've rambled.

** EDIT - Reddit, I am overwhelmed. Since this submission was posted, so far (as of lunchtime Friday) we've sold at least 61 copies of the book and have received nearly $500 in paypal donations, which will pay for 6-7 weeks worth of heating oil, which is good timing since it just started snowing outside last night. Thank you very, very much guys &amp; gals &amp; others. There are good people here. Sarah is extremely excited that people are reading her book. **

** EDIT 2 - We've lost our power, we have no water, and there's an oak tree hanging from the power lines in our driveway blocking most of the yard. Literally an oak tree, not a branch. We were able to use some of the donations to buy fuel for a generator we were loaned, but he generator blew when I hooked it up incorrectly due to bad advice. Still, redditors, without your donations we wouldn't have been able to go buy $100 worth of non-perishable food items at Walmart when we lost everything in our refrigerator. Thank you again. Our power (and water because we have a well) is expected to be out a week or more. **

** EDIT 3 - Thank you SO much to those of you who have shared over social media. We're getting a trickle of hits from facebook, tumblr, twitter, and webmail. We REALLY, REALLY appreciate it!!! **",,False,self,t5_2qknd,True,,,True,t3_lrny6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/lrny6/my_beautiful_talented_and_very_sick_13_year_old/,

As you may know, I am the editor of fantasy website [The Ranting Dragon](http://www.rantingdragon.com). About a year and a half ago, our website published [a list of finished epic fantasy series](http://www.rantingdragon.com/top-20-finished-epic-fantasy-books-an-introduction-to-the-genre/) with the intention to publish lists of unfinished series and standalones/duologies as well. We are now working on publishing those lists, but in the mean time a lot has changed and some unfinished series, like The Wheel of Time, have now been finished.

That's why I need your help. We would like to publish this series of lists over the course of the next couple months. To start that, I believe it would be good to update the list of finished epics first. This is where you come in. I could come up with a list of my personal favorites easily, but with this Reddit community, I have a great resource of well-read fantasy fans at my disposal. Instead of making my own personal list, I would like to publish a list that reflects the reading preferences of the fantasy community at large.

So, my question to you is: what are your favorite finished epic fantasy series? Series eligible for this list constitue three or more books in a sequence with at least one story arc completed. For instance, a finished trilogy counts even if a sequel or prequel series is yet to be completed.

They're every bit as lyrical and important as they're billed, and I can't recommend them highly enough.  

I started them when I was ten.  I'm 29 now.  I've read a lot of books in the interim.  I've learned a bit about the world, but not as much as I'd expected to.  I've forgotten some things I swore I never would.  I've been surprised and disappointed, I've lost good friends and made stupid mistakes.  I've lived, and I hope to keep doing it for a goodly while.

Le Guin's work is often about stories and the roles they play.  It's not a coincidence that my first instinct after closing the cover (or hitting *Back*--some rituals just don't translate gracefully to the digital age) was to come talk to you folks.  

/r/Fantasy is a special place.  We're professionals, students, and retirees, authors, artists, and publishers, people looking for our first recommendations, and seasoned genre veterans.  We bicker and heckle and make lists and categorize because that's what people do when they love.  We love.

We love what fantasy means and what it does.  Fantasy shows us who we are, who we can be, and who we'll fight to never become.  Fantasy allows our most intimate thoughts to exist outside our solitary minds, for our inner worlds to be shared and colonized.  Fantasy shows us that we're not so alone.  

The act of creation is magic, in every sense of the word.  Authors take words and create worlds.  Painters take a few colors and create motion and size and meaning.  Creation is an inherently intimate act.  No one creates anything of worth without risking something of themselves.  It follows, then, that no one responds to art without confronting something of themselves. 

Fantasy defies neat limits and rules.  Some people want a knight who'll save the day.  Some want an allegorical exploration of economic exploitation told through anthropomorphic squirrels. And some people just want to read about some cool shit.  There's a place in fantasy, and in r/Fantasy, for all of them.  There's a place for all of us.

Before this gets more self-indulgent and maudlin, I guess my wandering point is this: we live in an incredible age.  The quantity, quality, and availability of great speculative work is unparalleled.  The ability to come together with creators and fans all over the world to share our passion for all things fantasy is incredible.  

This is a special place.  I'm glad to have found it, and I'm grateful for all the people who make it.

I have written and published six books spread across three series this year. You can find most of them free on Amazon from tomorrow [here](http://www.amazon.com/J.-R.-Karlsson/e/B007AQQGFK). Alternatively, should you wish to purchase one of them you can go [here](http://www.amazon.com/El-Vadors-Travels-ebook/dp/B009W9Q18U/).

A compendium of my entire work can be found in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11qvno/since_were_discussing_selfpublished_authors_heres/) thread for free if you're not a fan of Amazon.

My official website (still a work in progress) can be found [here](http://www.jrkarlsson.com).

Additional biographical info: I was born in a small town called Ballymoney in Northern Ireland in 1985, making me a mere stripling at 27 years young. I've been writing fantasy since I was 9 years old and I am currently in year one of my ten year plan to brush shoulders with the [D&amp;D-playing greats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=UUyh53XRVsp1eP73f7BOWqOQ&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;v=uFy8wWQ1tdw) of the fantasy world.

I've been an active redditor and member of this community under this username for over two years now, posting all manner of comments and links and annoying more established authors.

Outside of writing I like PC gaming, music, football, wrestling and popular TV shows about meth labs and serial killers.

I write full-time as of this year, prior to that I ran a book shop, sang in a metal band and invigilated examinations.

As mentioned in my biographical data elsewhere, I do indeed have a very spoilt rescued cat named Jack.

Hit me up with any questions you want (except about the movie Rampart), I'll be back around 6 PM to answer them live.

**Edit: Oh my, lots of questions to answer! I'll get cracking now over the next 2 hours, feel free to chime in with responses or additional questions while I'm doing so!**

**Edit Part 2: Going to stick around for a little while longer to answer a few more questions, but first a sandwich is required!**

**Final Edit: That's me done for the night, thanks again for all your interesting questions.

1352914599.0,95,self.Fantasy,136ut9,"Hi, Reddit! I'm Dave Gross, author of Pathfinder Tales and Forgotten Realms novels, and lead writer for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.",111,16,246,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/136ut9/hi_reddit_im_dave_gross_author_of_pathfinder/,"Hi, I’m [Dave Gross]( http://frabjousdave.blogspot.com/). My first full-length novel was *Black Wolf*, set in the Forgotten Realms. Before that I’d written a number of short stories, a novella, and a very short novel also set in the Realms. But let’s go back a little further.
 
 
In 1993 I left a job teaching English at James Madison University to join TSR as Associate Editor of *Polyhedron Newszine*, the magazine of the Role Playing Gamer’s Association (RPGA). Now and then the TSR book department would post an open call for short story pitches, and I got my start writing for their anthologies.
 
 
Through guile and patience (mostly patience) I moved through the ranks of various magazines at TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and Paizo Publishing: *Dungeon, Dragon, Star Wars Insider &amp;Gamer*, and at last *Amazing Stories*. One the side, I continued to write stories and novels whenever the opportunity arose, most prominently in the Sembia series.
 
 
In 2004 I left Paizo and the U.S. for a brief stint designing video games. At the 2008 World Fantasy Convention in Calgary, my old colleague Erik Mona enticed me back into writing fantasy fiction by telling me about Paizo’s plans to launch the Pathfinder Tales line of novels.
 
 
Since then most of my fiction has been for Paizo, including several short stories, a couple of novellas, and the novels *Prince of Wolves, Master of Devils*, and the recent *Queen of Thorns*. All of those feature the investigator-adventurers Count Varian Jeggare and his bodyguard Radovan Virholt. I also had the great privilege and pleasure of co-writing *Winter Witch* with Elaine Cunningham, and I’ve written stories for *Tales of the Far West, Shotguns v. Cthulhu*, and *The Lion and the Aardvark*.
 
 
Earlier this year devilishly persuasive Trent Oster lured me back into the world of video game writing, where I’m part of a small but fierce team producing *Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition* for the PC, Mac, iPad, and other platforms.

I'll be back at 7:00 Central Time to answer questions.

Thanks,

Dave

I'm science fiction and fantasy writer Krista Ball - AMA,111,15,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12qk5e/hi_everyone_im_science_fiction_and_fantasy_writer/,"Hi everyone! I’m [Krista Ball](http://kristadball.com/)! I primarily write science fiction and fantasy. That’s my love. I’ve written a standalone military SF novel called *Road to Hell*, and I have the first book of an epic fantasy series out (*Tranquility’s Blaze*). Book 2, *Tranquility’s Grief*, comes out next month. Those will always be my favorite genres to write and I’ll do plenty in those, however, my life’s goal is to write a little something in every genre possible including cat mysteries and zombie erotica. Well, ok, maybe not that last one. Then again…
 
Hobbies…I like to LARP (live action role play), though I don’t get to do it very often. I really like Magic: The Gathering (though I suck at it), and love tabletop gaming (Descent, Roll Through the Ages, and Merchants &amp; Marauders are my current favourites). Munchkin has been banned from my house; we aren’t mature enough to handle it! I liked comic books as a kid, but fell out of the habit as an adult. I’m slowly getting back into DC’s New 52. Batman and Catwoman are my favourite, but I do have a weak spot for the Justice League, too.

I love replicating old recipes and lost skills and *[What Kings Ate](http://kristadball.com/2012/11/what-kings-ate-and-wizards-drank-is-out-today/)* (WKA) gave me the opportunity to really unleash my passions: history, food, and storytelling. I had a blast making homemade lard (as did my dog who ended up coated in it), grinding my own flour, and talking about how to properly eat rabbit bone marrow (mmmm one of my favourite childhood foods).
 
I’ll be back to answer your questions at 8PM Central so fire away!

He was created to help fight on behalf of great writers of, among other things, fantasy and science fiction for adults, YA, and middle grade readers.

He's also run a marathon or twelve, enjoys a good video game when there's still time, and will stop referring to himself in the third person at the end of this sentence.

Feel free to ask me anything, but keep in mind I will view novel queries in the discussion thread as attempts to troll.

I am, however, accepting queries through regular channels.  Feel free to [read the instructions first](http://awfulagent.com/submissions-2) and then send these to queryeddie &lt;at&gt; awfulagent &lt;dot&gt; com.

I've been an avid fantasy reader since I discovered Narnia, sitting in the back of Miss Tyleshewski's fifth grade classroom. I started collecting first editions in 2000, after a youth of comic book collecting didn't go so well.

I met and became friends with George R.R. Martin. He welcomed me into fandom, and I became an avid convention goer. Eventually I was able to meet and get signatures from most of my favorite authors. I attached a few of my favorite signatures in the album, as well as some neat stuff like the invitation to George's wedding and the wedding favor -- an iPod shuffle. 

I also have a neat thing in my collection... a signed editor's proof of A Game of Thrones.

I absolutely love seeing other peoples collections, and so I hope you like mine.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_1enh4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1enh4x/my_fantasy_heavy_book_collection/,

Joe Abercrombie has been [one of the most talked-about authors on Reddit ]( http://www.reddit.com/search?q=joe+abercrombie&amp;sort=relevance) over the past year.  *The First Law* trilogy including *[The Blade Itself]( http://www.amazon.com/Blade-Itself-First-Law-Book/dp/159102594X/ref=la_B001JP7WJC_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354723117&amp;sr=1-2),* *[Before They Are Hanged]( http://www.amazon.com/Before-They-Are-Hanged-First/dp/1591026415/ref=la_B001JP7WJC_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354723117&amp;sr=1-3)*, and *[Last Argument of Kings]( http://www.amazon.com/Last-Argument-Kings-First-Law/dp/1591026903/ref=la_B001JP7WJC_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354723117&amp;sr=1-4)* are frequently recommended as ‘must reads’ for anyone looking for that next great writer.  His stand-alone novels *[Best Served Cold]( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold)* and *[The Heroes]( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300768-the-heroes)* followed suit.

With the release of *[Red Country]( http://www.amazon.com/Red-Country-Joe-Abercrombie/dp/0316187216/ref=la_B001JP7WJC_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354723117&amp;sr=1-1)* in November, Joe Abercrombie has now joined the ranks of *New York Times* and *Sunday Times* bestselling authors as well.

* ""Joe Abercrombie takes the grand tradition of high fantasy literature and drags it down into the gutter, in the best possible way."" - *Time*

* ""The battles are vivid and visceral, the action brutal, the pace headlong, and Abercrombie piles the betrayals, reversals, and plot twists one atop another to keep us guessing how it will all come out. [Best Served Cold] is his best book yet."" - *George R.R. Martin*

* “The books are good, really good. They pulled me in. Well-developed world. Unique, compelling characters. I like them so much that when I got to the end of the second book and found out the third book wasn’t going to be out in the US for another three months, I experienced a fit of rage, then a fit of depression, then I ate some lunch and had a bit of a lay down. - *Patrick Rothfuss* [The First Law Trilogy]


* ""Imagine *The Lord of the Rings* as directed by Kurosawa."" - *Lev Grossman, Wall Street Journal* [Red Country]

* “Abercrombie rings the changes with his sixth novel, tipping his hat to the Western genre but continuing his mission to drag fantasy, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century with his characteristic mix of gritty realism, complex characterisation, set-piece scenes of stomach-churning violence and villains who are as fully rounded as his flawed heroes … Abercrombie writes fantasy like no one else: Red Country is a marvellous follow-up to his highly praised The Heroes.”
— *Eric Brown, The Guardian*

_________________________________________________________

I’m Diana Gill, Executive Editor/professional geek at [Harper Voyager US]( http://harpervoyagerbooks.com/category/voyager-us/). I publish science fiction, fantasy, urban fantasy/paranormal, supernatural and horror, with authors like Kim Harrison, Vicki Pettersson, Brom, Richard Kadrey, Jocelynn Drake, along with upcoming novels from David Wellington, C. Robert Cargill.


I’ve also worked with Sarah Langan, Patrick Lee, Mary Gentle, Dave Duncan, Kage Baker and more.

 
I’m addicted to caffeine and travel, not necessarily in that order. When not chained to my desk/working I do martial arts, run, sometimes get out to take pictures, scuba dive
far too rarely, play too many computer games, watch Asian dramas, and yell at the cats.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I’m Pamela Spengler-Jaffee – and if that’s just too long for you to process, I answer to Pam Jaffee, too.  I am the flackiest of flacks – publicist extraordinaire (in my own head), specializing in genre fiction: science fiction, fantasy, romance, thrillers.   I am the Senior Publicity Director with the Avon, Morrow and Harper Voyager imprints of [HarperCollins]( http://www.harpercollins.com/).


What that means is that I’m the tallish blur running by you at breakneck speeds at fan conferences, with an armful of books and at least one author in tow.  I live to get out-of-the-box publicity for my authors, and as such, am a serial stalker of major media contacts.  Luckily I haven’t been reported (yet).
 

In my free time (this was a leap year, so there was at least one off day), I read incessantly, terrorize my charge cards, herd my offspring and cats, drink coffee and wine in equal measures, and plan vacations long into the future.

I'm Ginger Clark, and I'm a literary agent at [Curtis Brown, LTD]( http://www.curtisbrown.com/about.php).  I handle adult SF/F/Horror writers (most relevantly here, Richard Kadrey) and young adult and middle grade writers. I also sell British Commonwealth rights to the entire children's list at Curtis Brown, which means I attend the Bologna and Frankfurt Book Fairs every year. I'm on the Contracts Committee of the Association of Authors' Representatives, I sit on the Rights Committee of the Book Industry Study Group, and I'm a member of the fundraising committee for First Book Brooklyn. I'm also a member of the committee to stop Ginger from joining any more committees.

My most recent [COLD STEEL (third of the Spiritwalker Trilogy)](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/sleeps-with-monsters-kate-elliotts-cold-steel) is my 21st published novel. 

I’m currently writing a new epic fantasy trilogy for [Orbit Books (November 2014)](http://www.orbitbooks.net/author/kate-elliott/), and revising a YA fantasy (“Little Women meets the Count of Monte Cristo in a fantasy world inspired by Greco-Roman Egypt”) for Little Brown Young Readers (Spring 2015).


Why do I write? Growing up in rural Oregon, I spent as much time possible playing outdoors. Unable to find a gate that would allow me to cross into a Hidden Land of Adventure, I was reduced to drawing maps of imaginary worlds and writing my own stories (I have a file cabinet full of early material that should never ever see the light of day).
Random facts: I played basketball and ran track in high school. Later I took up karate, and for a few years I fought in armor in the SCA (my spouse and I met in a sword fight). 

My current sport of choice is outrigger canoe paddling. Although my spouse started work life as a police officer, his second career as an archaeologist has taken the family (we have a daughter and identical twin sons) to Mexico and Denmark and, most recently, Hawaii, where we live now (hence the outrigger canoes).
I’ve traveled a fair bit. As anyone who has read my work will recognize, my favorite fields of study are history, anthropology, and religion. Two of my favorite tv shows are The Wire and Spartacus. Wine: Reisling. Beer: Asahi. Favorite pie: Okinawan sweet potato pie, because it is purple. Finally, no cats: We have a schnauzer named Theoden.

I will be back at **7PM CST** to answer questions.  AMA!

This is, in a word, AWESOME-SCARY-OVERWHELMING-SWEET-EXCITING-HOLY-CRAP-NOT-FREAKING-OUT-HERE-NOPE-NOT-ME.
 

Ahem. Anyway, my *Goblin Quest* series is a humorous look at Jig the goblin, a nearsighted underdog who knows perfectly well what happens to goblins in most fantasy adventures. I’m also the author of a series of fairy tale retellings which turn the traditional princesses into kick-ass action heroines. And I’ve got a new series starting in August with *Libriomancer, a magic-using librarian from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula who, among other things, fights sparking vampires…
 

I live in Michigan with my wife and two kids, along with an uncertain number of pets. I’ve got a day job for the state, which is not terribly exciting, but stable income + health insurance are very good things.
 

Online, you can find me at my [website]( http://www.jimchines.com/), [Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/jimhines), [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/#!/jimchines), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/114820416823559451404/posts), and [LiveJournal]( http://jimhines.livejournal.com/). (Yeah, some days it feels like I pretty much live online.)

 
Finally, I wanted to mention that I’m currently doing a fundraiser for sexual assault awareness month, trying to raise money for rape crisis centers. [I’m offering an autographed ARC of *Libriomancer*, and a number of other wonderful authors have joined in to offer signed books as well.](http://www.jimchines.com/2012/04/endrape-3/)
 



**I will be back at 7PM Central.  I’m looking forward to chatting and answering your questions!**

His works include **The First Law Trilogy: The Blade Itself, Before They are Hanged and Last Argument of Kings.**  His novels **Best Served Cold** and **The Heroes** are also set in the world of *The First Law.*  [Learn more about Joe Abercrombie's works here.](http://www.joeabercrombie.com/books/)


A couple of reviews just in case you haven't read his novels yet...

*“The books are good, really good. They pulled me in. Well-developed world. Unique, compelling characters. I like them so much that when I got to the end of the second book and found out the third book wasn’t going to be out in the US for another three months, I experienced a fit of rage, then a fit of depression, then I ate some lunch and had a bit of a lay down.”*

    —Patrick Rothfuss, author of The Name of the Wind

*“Joe Abercrombie’s BEST SERVED COLD is a bloody and relentless epic of vengeance and obsession in the grand tradition, a kind of splatterpunk sword ‘n sorcery COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, Dumas by way of Moorcock. His cast features tyrants and torturers, a pair of poisoners, a serial killer, a treacherous drunk, a red-handed warrior and a blood-soaked mercenary captain. And those are the good guys … The battles are vivid and visceral, the action brutal, the pace headlong, and Abercrombie piles the betrayals, reversals, and plot twists one atop another to keep us guessing how it will all come out. This is his best book yet.”*

    —George RR Martin, author of A Game of Thrones

Also, I'm offering a free short story (will be a different one than I gave away as par of The reddit Crown Tower giveaway) for all those that enter in the international version.  

So here are the links:

* [My international giveaway - which includes a free short](http://michaeljsullivan.polldaddy.com/s/the-rose-thorn-giveaway)

If you are in the US and UK can enter in both. If you are from somewhere else you can only enter in ""mine"" but I'll give you twice the odds to win (2 entries instead of one) so everyone has the same chance to win.

The Rose and the Thorn is the second book in the Riyria Chronciles but you can read it without reading the prior book The Crown Tower.

I’m Courtney Schafer, author of adventure fantasy novels - AMA",112,18,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12v141/hi_reddit_im_courtney_schafer_author_of_adventure/,"Hi, Reddit! I’m [Courtney Schafer](http://www.courtneyschafer.com/index.html), author of adventure fantasy novels *The Whitefire Crossing* and *The Tainted City*, the first two books in the Shattered Sigil trilogy.  I’m working on the third and final novel right now, *The Labyrinth of Flame*, and I’m pretty darn excited about it.  I call the novels adventure fantasy because they hover on the boundary between epic fantasy and sword-and-sorcery, not quite one or the other.  (For one thing, the books have plenty of magic, murder, intrigue, and even mountaineering, but no swords!)

I’ve loved reading fantasy and science fiction ever since I can remember, but I came to writing late because I was so busy with all my other hobbies:  I’m an avid climber, hiker, backpacker, canyoneer, skier…heck, anything that involves adrenaline and wilderness, I adore.  I also figure skate, and have competed several times at the Gold level at USFSA’s Adult Nationals.  Oh yeah, and my husband and I both love music, everything from gothic/industrial/electronica to choral classical – we sing regularly with the Colorado Music Festival chorus for performances of masterworks like Mozart’s Requiem, Beethoven’s Ninth, Haydn’s Creation, etc. 

I was born in Georgia, raised in northern Virginia, and did my undergraduate at Caltech in sunny southern California, where I first put on a harness and climbing shoes.  Now I live in the climber’s paradise of Boulder, Colorado with my husband and son, where we take full advantage of all the mountains have to offer.  To pay for my writing habit and all my adrenaline sports, I work as an electrical engineer in the space industry – a job in which I get to do science fictional things every day (part of why I choose to write fantasy in my free time!).

**I’ll be back at 8pm CST** to answer questions live, so please, ask me anything! (Bonus points for mountaineering and figure skating questions.)

**Edit: Whew! Great questions, everyone. I'm signing off for now (as of 10pm CST), but I'll come back tomorrow to pick up any stragglers.  Thanks again for having me!**

**Edit2: Okay, think I've answered the questions from the latecomers. I'll still be checking back to read any further responses, etc, over the next few days.  This was really fun - thanks to everyone who participated!**

 If you could right now have a direct sequel to any book, whether the author is living, dead or no longer writing, what would you choose? For the sake of the discussion, you can assume that the sequel will be of equal or greater quality when compared to the original.  
I personally have decided on Good Omens by Neil Gaiman &amp; Sir Terry Pratchett. Two of my very favorite authors collaborating on one of my very favorite books, it is hilarious and profound, exciting and contemplative. I would trade a hypothetical object of great value and importance for another like it.  
 And I realize that for many books part of the magic is in its uniqueness. That it does not really need a sequel. But, that does not mean that you do not want one.

This exchange will [follow the standard Redditgifts double-blind rules](http://redditgifts.com/about/) and will be open to anyone to participate.  Basically sign up and get matched anonymously with a giftee - another gift giver will anonymously send you a gift.

**/r/FANTASY TWIST:** /r/Fantasy will be inviting fantasy writers, artists, publishers, game developers and anyone else in the industry to participate.  

We will host a page where those participating can note that they are in the gift-giving mix and what item(s) they will be giving to a random match.  For example, an author might want to send a signed copy of his/her newest novel as a gift.  /r/Fantasy will host a page where the writer can note their participation, what they are giving and can provide a link to their works. Note that some random participant will also be selected to give them a gift in return.

More to come when we get closer to March.  We are hoping for some fun with this one!

I'm [Kat Zhang](http://katacomb.blogspot.com), university senior, Spoken Word performer, film geek, caffeine fiend, and author of the young adult novel [WHAT'S LEFT OF ME](http://hybridchronicles.katzhangwriter.com/About.html). The book is what I like to call ""speculative fiction,"" or maybe ""light-sci-fi"" or ""science-fantasy""...or maybe just ""alternate universe."" It's also been referred to as ""that character-driven sci-fi-ish book with the dystopian feel and touches of horror,"" so yeah. What I can say for sure is that it's about a 15-year-old girl struggling to reclaim control of her body in a world where two souls are born into each child and one is doomed to disappear.


Compared to some guests you guys have had in the past, I'm relatively new to the publishing sphere, but I'm happy to answer questions about writing/publishing/etc. :)  

I will be back at 7PM (Central) to answer questions.

This isn't an ""Advanced Reading Copy"" these will be the official version - that I've not even seen yet.  Here is a bit about the book:

**Two men who hate each other. One impossible mission. A legend in the making.**

Hadrian Blackwater, a warrior with nothing to fight for is paired with Royce Melborn, a thieving assassin with nothing to lose. Together they must steal a treasure that no one can reach. The Crown Tower is the impregnable remains of the grandest fortress ever built and home to the realm's most prized possessions. But it isn't gold or jewels that the old wizard is after, and if he can just keep them from killing each other, just might do it.

Variously it seems to mean:

- this thing I don't approve of
- how close you live to Joe Abercrombie
- how similar a book's atmosphere is to that of Game of Thrones

I've seen lots of articles describe the terrible properties of grimdark and then fail to name any book that has those properties.

**Ask Us Anything!**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, my name is [**Scott Taylor** and I’m the editor and creative director of *Tales of the Emerald Serpent*.](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2013/06/an-interview-with-scott-taylor/)  I’m also the founder of [**Art of the Genre**](http://artofthegenre.myshopify.com/) which publishes both *Tales of the Emerald Serpent* and other small genre books.  


My passion is combining great art with great writing, and it has helped me produce 1980s throw-back illustrated adventure novels like *The Cursed Legion* and *The Mid-Winter Fall,* as well as steampunk with *The Gun Kingdoms,* and also adult Swords &amp; Sorcery with *The Burning City.* In creating these titles I’ve had the honor of working with fantasy art legends like Todd Lockwood, Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson, Tim Truman, Janet Aulisio, R.K. Post, Brom, and many more that helped bring these novels to life.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Howard Tayler**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Tayler) is best known as the creator, writer and illustrator of [*Schlock Mercenary,*](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/) the Hugo-nominated science fiction comic, but he is also a contributor to *X-treme Dungeon Mastery* and Skull Island eXpeditions, and podcasts weekly with Brandon Sanderson, Mary Kowal, and Dan Wells on [Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/). He and his family live in Orem, Utah.
 

Born in Florida in the late '60s, he expected to grow up to be either a doctor or a rock star. He came into his cartooning and writing career later than most, appearing on the scene in his 30s in June of 2000. He is a vocal advocate of continuing education, focused practice, and will occasionally scold people for saying ""I wish I could do that"" when what they mean is ""I want to learn to do that.""
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
[**Alyssa Faden**](https://www.facebook.com/AlyssaFadenCartography) had the good fortune to be born in England and therefore did all of the usual geeky things - live roleplay, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, drawing fantasy places - while in the middle of real-world castles and ancient barrow mounds. Not many are honored to have grown up in a city established by the Romans, with intact Roman walls and a Coliseum, but Alyssa was and she fully embraced it in every respect. Is it any wonder that she was the first to be playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in her school? With a lust for the unknown and the magical country of ""America,"" she emigrated in 1998 and has been spreading 'home country historical goodness' via the medium of 'cartography' ever-since. She considers every mapping commission to be a privileged step into the mind of another person; seeing the mystical and fantasy worlds that they have created. The result is more than a map ... it is a living representation of years of imagination, a place where people and creatures roam, ships sail, and armies march. And who can't get excited by something like that? 

Alyssa's recent mapping endeavors have been for Kobold Quarterly, Art of the Genre, Whispers &amp; Venom, Jon Brazer Enterprises, and Jim Pinto's ""King for a Day.""

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Hello! [I'm **Todd Lockwood**.](http://www.toddlockwood.com/) I've been illustrating professionally for thirty+ years, the last eighteen or so in Science Fiction and especially Fantasy. You most likely know me from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and the Drizzt do' Urden tales of RA Salvatore. I'm also a published author, with stories in the [*Tales of the Emerald Serpent*](http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Emerald-Serpent-Ghosts-ebook/dp/B008C6JE2Y) anthology, the [*Unfettered* anthology](http://grimoakpress.com/unfettered/), and am working on a novel for DAW Books, release date to be determined.
 
In my copious spare time I sell prints, do conventions, maintain my website (poorly), garden, play with/yell at my cat, and shout into the void.

Hi, [I’m **Dave Gross**](http://frabjousdave.blogspot.com/), author of novels including *Prince of Wolves, Master of Devils, Queen of Thorns,* and the upcoming *King of Chaos*. Other recent publications include “The Devil’s Pay” and *Dark Convergence* for Skull Island eXpeditions, as well as stories in in *Tales of the Far West, The Lion &amp; the Aardvark,* and *Shotguns v. Cthulhu.*

1368224536.0,85,self.Fantasy,1e3hdm,I need to express a deep and heartfelt gratitude,101,16,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1e3hdm/i_need_to_express_a_deep_and_heartfelt_gratitude/,"For the first time, I participated in a gift exchange on Reddit a number of months ago. The idea of exchanging books was deeply attractive to me, in ways other advertised exchanges had not been. I spent a long, happy while trying to come up with a good gift for my own match, ambling around one of the beautiful bookshops in my town. I had thought this the best part; I enjoyed the idea of giving and receiving a book was almost incidental to the whole process for me.

My match, though, apparently had other ideas and sent me two exquisite experiences disguised as simple paperback books. I was gifted both Under Heaven and Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay and I can say with very little doubt, I'd not have touched them under my own steam.  I had so little idea of what I was missing. 

I have never read books with such beautiful and emotive prose! I felt immersed in these stories in a way that I have not enjoyed with others. This wasn't a deeper immersion, as such, but there is such emotive force in Kay's language, stories and vision. To me, it felt like a symphony. I finished Tigana about 30 minutes ago, whilst listening to [this](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DM3hFN8UrBPw&amp;h=hAQEg-_qM) and in the midst of a very stressful time, it was something I very much needed.  

I am writing this for a number of reasons. One, to extol these books! I could not recommend them more. I know many didn't feel the same way I did, but I know there are others out there who *could* feel this, and I want the same for you. 

Two, I couldn't the profile of my match to thank them, so on the chance they browse this subreddit, you have my utmost gratitude! Thank you, for sharing with me something you enjoyed so much and that I can now share with others! 

And finally three, to encourage everyone here to sign up for the next book exchange, when it rolls around. You can choose to be matched within your country, to avoid international shipping costs (I decided to go global; shipping my book to Texas and having mine sent to me from Belgium, I think). Reading someones profile and trying to find something you think they will enjoy was a surprisingly fun process, and something that really made me think and look at lots of books I otherwise wouldn't. It can also lead to a very enjoyable time perusing your local bookstore! And in return, you will hopefully receive something that another person has loved and shared, that you will grow to love as well, looking forward to sharing it yourself.

Geissinger, author of the Night Prowler novels, a UF/PNR series about an ancient race of shape-shifters that live hidden from the everyday world. My debut novel, *[Shadow’s Edge]( http://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Night-Prowler-Novel-ebook/dp/B007264HOU/ref=pd_sim_kstore_1
)*, was an Amazon US and UK #1 bestselling fantasy romance and book two, *[Edge of Oblivion]( http://www.amazon.com/Oblivion-Night-Prowler-Novel-ebook/dp/B007SX0246/ref=pd_sim_kstore_1
)*, was just released on 10/2. 

The series originated from my fascination with cats (the Ikati are panther shifters) and the [cat-worship culture of ancient Egypt]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastet_%28mythology%29). Because I’m a lovey-dovey kind of girl, there’s an awful lot of that going on, too, and it’s only getting grittier and more erotic with each book. (I hope my editor doesn’t read that; my work in progress has a few scenes that are more *cough* intense than she might approve of. I’ll let you know how it goes.)

Kindof a tough act following Jacqueline Carey, but I'd love to chat with you! **I’ll be answering questions live at 8pm CST.**

PS - I'm also having a [Kindle Fire HD giveaway on my facebook page]( https://www.facebook.com/JTGeissinger

I work as a concept artist at games developer IO Interactive, where I help create the visual look for the game Hitman. On the side I am working hard on my pet project called Fall of Gods, a story about the warrior Váli who sets out to bring back his murdered family from the underworld. The universe and story is inspired by Norse mythology, and will be a full illustrated book- Here I have collected some of my illustrations for the project:

http://rasberg.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/fall-of-gods.html

On my FB page I am posting my progress. 

https://www.facebook.com/sonsofmuspel?ref=hl

I have always dreamed of doing my own take on the mythology, especially because most attempts I have seen are far from how I see the Norse mythology. My goal is to get this out on ebook and later on print. I hope you’ll find it interesting. 

Best regards Rasmus

Sutter](http://www.jameslsutter.com), and I wear a bunch of different hats.
 


My first novel, the Pathfinder tie-in [*Death's Heretic*](http://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Tales-James-L-Sutter/dp/1601253699/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329868173&amp;sr=8-1""), ranked #3 on Barnes &amp; Noble's Best Fantasy Releases of 2011, and is the story of an atheist forced to serve the goddess of death as a problem-solver and monster-hunter. 



In addition, I've written a bunch of stories for places like *Escape Pod, Podcastle, Apex Magazine,* and the #1 Amazon bestseller *Machine of Death* (which Glenn Beck called part of “the leftist culture of death"").



I'm also one of the co-creators and primary developers of the Pathfinder RPG campaign setting. Before that, I edited *Dungeon* magazine, and I’ve written a bunch of RPG products for both Pathfinder and D&amp;D.


 
In addition to being the Fiction Editor for Paizo Publishing, I also edited an anthology called [*Before They Were Giants*](http://www.amazon.com/Before-They-Were-Giants-Science/dp/1601252668/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329868223&amp;sr=1-1), which paired the first published stories from folks like William Gibson, Cory Doctorow, Larry Niven, and China Miéville with new interviews and writing advice from the authors themselves.


 
On a non-literary note, I've gigged extensively with punk/metal/hardcore bands, and continue to sing and play bass and guitar in all sorts of genres--my most recent musical project is the rap video [""Do Your Fucking Dishes.""]( http://youtu.be/MzR5YgASB34) 



Other random trivia: I live in a house in Seattle called the Ministry of Awesome, with four roommates and a fully functional death ray. I once ended up on Wheel of Fortune by accident. I used to eat out of dumpsters on a regular basis. My friends once wrote and produced a full-length musical about me, and the next year I helped do the same for my roommate. I had an ex-girlfriend who got total amnesia. I used to be a journalist, and got to do crazy things and write about them, like being a background extra in a lesbian porn shoot. I think screaming is a valid form of musical expression. I'm secretly a big hippie, and believe strongly in intentional community (and yes, I’ve been to Burning Man).

1351199131.0,76,self.Fantasy,123514,Lyonesse by Jack Vance - Probably the best fantasy book I've read since Game of Thrones.,86,10,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/123514/lyonesse_by_jack_vance_probably_the_best_fantasy/,"Just finished the first book of the Lyonesse trilogy, and I rushed here to tell you all to go read this series. 

The author Jack Vance is known for his really influential Dying Earth books, which I have read and enjoyed. Vance is really inventive, but his often unlikable characters prevented me from outright loving that series. However, this book is just in a whole different category. It is easily one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. It should be this series, and not Dying Earth, that Vance is known for.

The setting of the story is the mythical Elder Islands next to Ireland and Britain, where magic still exists. The land is divided between warring kings and conniving magicians. The book begins with the King of Lyonesse plotting to invade neighboring Dahaut, leveraging his daughter to make an alliance with another kingdom.

Into this complicated political situation enters Prince Aillas, on a diplomatic mission to secure his own countries interests against Lyonesse. The meeting of characters and competing interests explodes and sets the plot into motion.  

This book is like Pan's Labyrinth crossed with Game of Thrones. I would call it a fairy tale for adults. It is dark, and at moments very violent.  There are moments here that made me feel as if I had suddenly wandered into a Grimm fairy tale, while the next chapter would be about court intrigue.The mixture is bewitching and addicting to read. It is strange at first, but it completely works, thanks to the crisp prose that Jack Vance is a master of.

If the next two books are just as good as this one was, then the series belongs on any list of the greatest fantasies ever written.

Do yourself a favor and check it out. You can get it on [kindle from amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Lyonesse-Suldruns-Garden-ebook/dp/B004KZQN20/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351189317&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=lyonesse) for the low price of 5 bucks right now. Totally worth it.

Every year this rolls around (see what I did there?) I think about the man's indirect effect on the fantasy genre.  In my particular case, I essentially owe my career to him.  And that's not because some of my fiction is set in the Forgotten Realms (a D&amp;D setting).  It's because the seeds of my desire to become a writer basically started around a gaming table -- rolling dice, developing characters, and fighting monsters.  D&amp;D was the first game I played that really turned my imagination loose and got me involved in what amounts to a collaborative storytelling and worldbuilding exercise.  And on top of that it had swords and goblins and demons, by Boccob!

I know many fellow writers played D&amp;D when they were young.  Of writers in my cohort (say 35-55 years old), I suspect D&amp;D was one of the first (and maybe one of the formative?) experiences they had with fantasy.  That's a big deal.      

I know there are some who dislike the ""D&amp;Ding of fantasy"" (I'm not one of them, but I take the point), but Gary's influence on the genre is hard to overstate. I think D&amp;D turned an enormous number of players on to fantasy storytelling and worldbuilding, and many of them would later become published writers whose work we read and love.

So, you know, thanks Gary.  Appreciated.  ",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_1j61qv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j61qv/gary_gygaxs_influence_on_fantasy/,
1373232254.0,75,self.Fantasy,1htmik,Self publishing - Is it ruining authors by giving them unrealistic expectations?,95,20,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1htmik/self_publishing_is_it_ruining_authors_by_giving/,"Hear me out before you downvote...I've got some thoughts on this based on what we've seen around here.

Lately, /r/fantasy (and I assume other niche reading boards) have been deluged with ""free"" fantasy novels almost daily.  This in and of itself isn't a bad thing, and I love that people are out there, writing and working their asses off to get themselves out there.  You never know whose going to be the next Anthony Ryan or Michael J Sullivan, and I encourage these writers to do their thing and keep putting stuff out there.

My problem is, because of the relative ease of self publishing, I feel like a lot of these books that we see on a daily basis are...Unfinished.  I feel like a lot of these independent authors lack the patience to see their book become fully realized, become edited and hammered into a finished product on the forge of the post writing process. 

I'm not going to name names, because it's not my intention to denigrate anyone in particular.  But as an example, there's an author who ""released"" their book recently, posted it here, thanked people for downloading it, and even posted a book trailer.  In many ways, they treated this book as a finished product that was ready to go to market.  The book itself, however, was riddled with dialogue that needed to be completely redone, had major pacing issues, etc.  The thing that irritates me about this is that the book was based on some great ideas and shows REAL PROMISE.  I could see this being a book I was willing to buy.  But it's sorely in need of beta reading, of major editing, and rewrites.  But you get the impression that, because of how easy self publishing is, the author finished the novel, checked it for grammar and spelling, let a few people read it, got someone off deviantart to make a cover, and released it as ""done.""

That was the most extreme example of this that I've seen, but I've downloaded at least 10 novels that have been ""released"" via self publishing that I've read about on here, and not a one of them actually felt like a finished novel.  They varied wildly between being something that I didn't like, or something that could have been GREAT with more polish, editing, beta reading, etc.

So I guess I wonder...What do you guys think?  Self publishing has been a boon to the industry, and it's brought us folks like Sullivan and Ryan and many others.  But it's also brought us stuff like the book that I talked about up there, an unfinished product that will sadly never realize its full potential because the author was probably in a hurry to get it on Amazon.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_1htmik,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1htmik/self_publishing_is_it_ruining_authors_by_giving/,

I recently began to think back to why this is and what books developed my tastes into what they are today.

The first actual, no pictures books I can remember reading were The Animorphs. I received a box set of the first 5 from the good old Scholastic book order when I was about 5-6 years old. I believe this was when my eyes really opened and I saw what books were capable of. Taking me somewhere else, let me experience new and impossible things and making me feel for the characters.  This series more than any other lead me to voraciously devour books through the rest of my youth.

As far as my love of Fantasy, the series responsible would be The Chronicles of Prydain. The memorable characters, great setting, genuinely scary antagonists and so much more made this series such a big impact on me. Specifically, watching Taran grow and mature over the course of the series. I have such fond memories and they opened the door to such a fantastic genre.

After that I never looked back. Harry Potter, The Hobbit/LotR, Redwall, Xanth, Legend of Drizzt and so many others soon followed.

I am very happy with where this genre has taken me. Looking around at all the amazing books and series we have available, and how the internet makes it so easy to find another great book you would never have heard of. It is an exciting time to be a reader of Fantasy. I am quite pleased to be a part of it.

So what about yourselves? Can you recall where it all began? Please share.

I'm Doyce Testerman, and my debut novel *Hidden Things* was just released on Tuesday, August 21st, from Harper Voyager, HarperCollins's SF/F imprint. Although it tends to be categorized as urban fantasy, it is probably more accurate to call it contemporary or even rural fantasy, as a good portion of the story takes place in the Midwest. (I prefer to call it magical realism for reasons I'll get into if anyone asks.) If you're looking for a bit more information on my work, you can check out a fairly brief introduction to the book [here](http://harpervoyagerbooks.com/2012/08/21/hidden-things-on-sale-today/) (complete with typos!), and read an excerpt from the novel on the Harper Voyager website, [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/103499389/Hidden-Things-Excerpt).

(RES isn't working for me on this computer. Links are hard!)

I was born in the wilds of South Dakota, grew up on a farm thirty miles from the nearest town, and spent a great deal of my free time lurking in the science fiction and fantasy section in the county library . I studied English Lit in college, got my degree, and immediately fled to Colorado, where I still live. Since I arrived in Denver, I've been blessed with two big dogs, a lovely wife, and two children, in roughly that order.

I am not a full-time author, though (thanks to the nature of my day job) I am a full-time writer. Probably due to the less romantic nature of the other writing work I do, I find I have very little patience for writers who are over-precious about their creative process.

When I'm not writing stories, writing for work, or with my family, I am generally either playing games (sometimes also with my family) or writing about them (either on my own website or something else's). I play a lot of computer games and MMOs, as well as pen and paper RPGs and boardgames -- a hobby that goes back (for me) to the very early eighties. I watch a few TV shows (Game of Thrones, Community, Doctor Who), and mourn many more (Firefly, Wonderfalls, Pushing Daisies...). I tend to read in bursts, with breaks in between in which I interact with other humans and remember to eat and take my kids to school. Some of my favorite authors are Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Roger Zelazny, and Tolkien. Naomi Novik has recently shouldered her way in there as well.

I've been an active participant and supporter of National Novel Writing Month for over ten years, and I've learned a lot about writing and what works and doesn't work for me as a result of that project. *Hidden Things* is, in fact, a 'NaNoWriMo Novel', albeit one that saw extensive expansion during the revisions that followed that somewhat spare first draft.

I am currently working on a novel called *Adrift*, which alternates between two stories: one a hard sci-fi story set on a moon-sized junkyard/Tortuga of abandoned spaceships, the other a series of bedtime stories full of talking animals and a magical forest. I've described it as ""switching back and forth between *Blade Runner* and *Redwall*"", which gives my agent a bit of a headache but makes me smile. Once that's wrapped up, I'm heading back to the setting of Hidden Things for awhile.

I meant to post this about a half hour ago, but I got distracted by the post from the six-year reddit lurker.

**I will be back at 7PM Central** to answer questions live, so please don't be shy: When this whole thing winds down, **we will give away copies of** ***Hidden Things*** to five randomly selected participants in this AMA, but as the man says, *you have to enter to win.*

It is by no means complete, and we are always looking for more reading suggestions.  Please reply in this post with any other ideas for the list.  

Suggestions should include:
---

* Author's name
* Series and/or book's name
* Any additional information or comments you want to provide --*no spoilers*

Book List Information:
---

Due to the length of the current list, it's broken into separate chunks for posting as replies.  We should be able to combine it into one clean list again when the new Reddit Wiki goes online.  Other notes about the list:

* YA = Young Adult and/or Children's books
* TBA = Publication year not yet announced
* Ongoing series with large numbers of books are listed with only the first 6 titles.  

---
**Edit: Please note, this is not the ""final"" version of the list, nor are the votes being tossed out.** This is the first rework/compiling of the suggestions in an attempt to make a definitive /r/Fantasy listing.  When the choices were sorted there were duplicates and inconsistencies.  Vote counts did not illustrate a clear pattern.  They were also not fair/comparable; for example, some votes were for different single books in a series, and others were on posts for the entire series.  Ultimately even a simple split to show the very popular/high vote options didn't work because low-vote options were a small minority.  

The plan is to use this combined, clearer listing as a foundation to gather the rest of the titles people like in this second pass.  Then a fairer poll with options presented will be posted to generate the /r/Fantasy-specific recommendations.  And finally all of this will be moved to the Wiki where it can be presented in different forms: By author, by votes, split for adult/younger readers, etc.  So the votes did not go away, they just got tabled for the moment.",,False,self,t5_2qknd,1349960156.0,,,True,t3_11albq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11albq/the_big_rfantasy_book_thread/,moderator

**QUICK REVIEW**

Back in September, we started off with a [Brandon Sanderson AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/k0fp8/iama_professional_fantasy_novelist_named_brandon/) that led to 25 more AMA's from some of the best and brightest in the Fantasy world.  

/r/Fantasy has doubled in size during that time and continues to grow at a phenomenal rate.  Even better, I believe that we have kept the site at a good quality level during this growth.


Quite a few of the new /r/Fantasy members and participants are authors and professionals from around the industry.  It's a blast to watch questions and jabs in each new AMA posted by Brandon Sanderson, Robin Hobb, Myke Cole, Howard Andrew Jones, Brent Weeks, Peter V Brett, James L. Sutter, Jim C Hines, Michael Sullivan and authors who we will schedule for future AMA's as well.

Thanks, /r/Fantasy redditors for making this a great place!


**WELCOME FANTASY BLOGGERS &amp; REVIEWERS**

One ongoing issue in /r/Fantasy is the lack of daily posts - especially higher quality posts.  We have several members of the Fantasy blogging / reviewing community who joined us recently and they are doing their best to add value while **not** posting direct blogspam.  

It's an odd dynamic and one that we will continue to work through.  I personally like to see the original content and FYI's from people who keep a finger on the pulse of the Fantasy world.  Yes, they get earnings by driving volume to their sites.  My attitude is that this is OK as long as they provide us with good quality content and FYI's.    

Please keep this perspective in mind when voting on blogger and reviewer-related posts.  Don't automatically downvote - please judge these posts by the content provided.  Let the mods know if the posts start to cross over into blogspam territory and we'll work to back off the volume.



**UPCOMING AMA's**


We have several AMA's coming up later this year ranging from big names in the industry to some new authors as well.  The mods will not post names or dates until they are confirmed.  More to come when when learn more.

To date, not a single request has been answered with a 'no'.  We have been ignored by many, but this should only merit yet another request since they really don't know what they are missing.


**ACTION:  AMA REQUESTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Please post below some names that you would love to see come in for an /r/Fantasy AMA.**  

This could include anyone involved in the Fantasy genre - authors, artists, film, TV, music, business-related and more.  Get creative!  Just let us know and we'll do our best to make it happen.

Even better - do you know anyone personally who might want to do this?  If so, then please PM me or send a message directly to the mods.

**Clint Lee Werner**

Howdy, [my name is Clint Lee Werner, better known to readers of Warhammer fantasy as C. L. Werner]( http://www.vermintime.com/). I am the perpetrator of a shelf’s worth of novels set in the grim Old World of Warhammer. My credits include the tales of Brunner the bounty hunter, the novels of the witch hunter Mathias Thulmann, *The Red Duke, Wulfrik, Runefang*, the Warhammer Online novel *Forged by Chaos, Blood for the Blood God, Palace of the Plague Lord, The Hour of Shadows, Vermintide* (writing as Bruno Lee), three novels featuring William King’s villainous Grey Seer Thanquol, and the Time of Legends novels *Dead Winter* and *Blighted Empire*. 

Earlier this year my first novella set in [Privateer Press’ Iron Kingdoms appeared: *Moving Targets*]( https://skullislandx.com/iron-kingdoms) featuring the iconic mercenary team of Taryn and Rutger. I am also responsible for several fantasy stories featuring the wandering samurai Shintaro Oba for Rogues’ Blades Entertainment. I was lead background writer for the AE-WWII tabletop wargame and developed much of the game’s rich alternate history. My first novel set in the sci-fantasy universe of Warhammer 40k was released last year, *The Siege of Castellax*, the first Chaos-themed entry in the Space Marines Battles series. Some of my original fiction has appeared this year in the anthologies *The Black Wind’s Whispers*  and *Fantastic Futures 13*. I have also penned several Cthulhu Mythos pastiches that have appeared in *Cthulhu Codex, Elder Signs* and *Midnight Shambler*.

My current projects include *Wolf of Sigmar*, the third part in the Black Plague trilogy for Warhammer’s Time of Legends. I am also working to develop a new novel featuring Taryn and Rutger in the Iron Kingdoms setting. There are also a clutch of further Shintaro Oba stories sitting on my harddrive in varying stages of completion and a story pitting panzers against dinosaurs that is in dire danger of being overdue!

I’m [Max Gladstone](http://www.maxgladstone.com), author of [Three Parts Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Parts-Dead-Max-Gladstone/dp/0765333104/) (out now), Two Serpents Rise (July 2013) and other novels coming soon from Tor Books.  Three Parts Dead follows Tara, a junior associate in an international necromancy firm.  She’s been hired to resurrect a dead fire god, but as she investigates (with the help of a chain-smoking priest, who’s having an understandable crisis of faith), she learns the god may have been murdered.  Skullduggery and calamity ensue.  

The idea came from the sky-is-falling terror I saw back in 2008 at the start of the financial crisis, which made me ponder the extent to which we're tied to an invisible world (market) of powerful immortal entities, who sometimes go to war and sometimes die.

As for me: I’ve lived in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Tennessee, Connecticut, and southern Anhui province, China.    Former tenor, teacher, karateka, tour guide, freelance translator, industry analyst, editor.  I cut my tabletop gaming teeth on the WEG Star Wars system.  I’ve wrecked a bicycle in Angkor Wat, and been thrown from a galloping horse on the Mongolian steppe.  Mostly, I write.

Ask Me Anything.  I’ll be back at 8pm central, 9 eastern to answer.  Oh!  And I just remembered--we’re giving away a few copies of Three Parts Dead, courtesy of the fine folks at Tor, to commenters.  I look forward to hearing what you have to say!

1374669970.0,75,self.Fantasy,1iyavq,Reddit Fantasy Writer of the Day: Tristan Gregory,96,21,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iyavq/reddit_fantasy_writer_of_the_day_tristan_gregory/,"Hello /r/Fantasy/! I'm Tristan Gregory, and I suppose I get to be your Fantasy Author Some Day... er, “of the” day. Whoops. Pretty accurate either way, I hope. Anyway, I'm a “nearly-thirty” guy from Michigan who pays the bills as a computer programmer and martial arts/self-defense instructor. Of course, those are simply the two hobbies I was able to get people to *pay* me to do on a regular basis. Activities I have yet to successfully add to that list are: acting, fight choreography, game design, and of course writing. I have a blog over at [tristan.rambles.blogspot.com](http://tristanrambles.blogspot.com/), which is mostly focused on writing-related stuff (though I'm thinking about adding game design to the list of common topics).


Writing-wise, you could say I have diverse tastes – as diverse as my tastes in reading. Currently I have self-published one novel titled [*Twixt Heaven and Hell*](http://www.amazon.com/Twixt-Heaven-and-Hell-ebook/dp/B008GOOQI4/), an epic tale of angels and demons and the eternal war between chaos and order and holy crap I swear it isn't as clichéd as I just made it sound. If you enjoy your fantasy action-heavy but not completely devoid of more thoughtful moments, you just might enjoy this one. 


Furthermore I have a pretty well-regarded series of fantasy novellas called The Wandering Tale, the first of which is titled [*The Swordsman of Carn Nebeth*](http://www.amazon.com/Swordsman-Carn-Nebeth-Wandering-ebook/dp/B0071H6SJW/). These stories are all set in the same world and share various interconnections, but they are intended each as a separate work – you could start in the middle and you wouldn't know you were doing so. They tend to stay closer to the personal side of the stories when it comes to things like wars, fighting, and magic.


Finally, I have a science fiction short story offered for free on Amazon, called (with apologies to Sir Thomas Mallory) [*Le Morte d'Arthur*](http://www.amazon.com/Le-Morte-dArthur-ebook/dp/B0070Z65FC). In fact, all of my work is available on both Amazon and Smashwords (and the various Smashwords channels such as Barnes &amp; Noble) with the exception of Twixt Heaven and Hell, which is currently only available on Amazon. 


All those titles up there are links and you can pretty reliably find all my stuff by searching for ""Tristan Gregory"" in any eBook store.


I like writing things with different feels, different moods. On that note, rather than post an excerpt from a published story, I decided to go out on a limb today and post a piece I'll be including in an upcoming collection of my science fiction. It is very short and – for me – rather experimental. 

**I hope you enjoy it, but if you've skipped down to read this bolded part first and only that's okay too! Please feel free to ask me anything concerning my experience writing, self-publishing, or whatever the heck else you'd like in the comments below.**


Thanks for your time!

*The Last Gasp of the Dragon*


The dragon slumbered upon its mound of stone and stolen riches. It's lair was no dank cave – this serpent loved the sun, and so had made its home where the rays were still strong, in a wild place surrounded by a vast jungle. 

The creatures of the land were wary of the dragon. Its children scurried about below its massive bulk, and the wildlife was wary of them too. The children cleaned it, and fed it, and occasionally disappeared inside it. Sometimes they came away from the bed of stone to kill, carrying back their carrion to serve the dragon's hunger – terrible even in indolence.

That hunger was the beast's undoing. Like all dragons, this one bellowed smoke and ruin. Its brethren across the world were dead, choked upon their own ash. Their carcasses littered the wastelands, bloated metal things. Their children, starving and sick, picked through the bones; soon to die as well.

It was waking. Birds took flight and fled at the first hiss, the wisps of steam curling threateningly from the creature's maw. It was a strange dragon, this one. It sat upon its face. Rodents and other crawling things – the only animals that could evade the dragon's children for long – sought refuge in their burrows or ran as the beginnings of a terrible roar echoed through the trees. 

There were no children scurrying about the dragon now. They had given themselves to it one by one, disappearing inside its black-scaled bulk. Its hunger must have woken it, and its anger was flame. Sparks fountained from a gullet as black as midnight.

It had no children left. Nothing to feed it. Nothing to keep it. The roar reverberated suddenly through the jungle, and the creatures of the world hid themselves. The dragon spewed forth the gifts of its kind – fire and smoke. It took flight, trailing the clouds of its passing like a premonition. The ash from the wreck of its brethren was still spreading through the world, and eventually even this place would grow dark and cold.

This one had escaped, for now. Its hunger was already terrible – its greed unsatisfied for the first time in ages. It would need a new home, and new children. It would remember the labor of its younger years as it built a new bed of stone and piled high the ravaged riches of whatever unfortunate land it chose to conquer.

Did its wings have the strength to carry it to lands beneath some distant sky? Or would it finally starve, far from a once-lovely home – its might broken, its fire quenched; conquered by itself.

I'm curious, however. All the books I read have 4+ reviews on goodreads and are highly recommended by this community. In particular, works like First Law, Malazan, ASOIAF, Kingkiller, Mistborn, Wheel of Time, LOTR, Assassin, and all other such series are constantly recommended.

My question to you: what fantasy books have you read that you just flat out didn't like? What books would you rate a one or a two on goodreads? Any books you wish you'd never read? For my part, no fantasy books come to mind as I've always waited for recommendations. But after I read Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac I was filled with remorse at having wasted my time with it. Any similar experiences with fantasy novels?

later i felt the need to read, went to my library and they had book 1 :)


3 days later book one was finished and i had bought the well of ascension &amp; hero of ages (library didn't have 2 &amp; 3, bookstore didn't have #1) book 2 took me about a week, book 3 about a week and a half... normally books of that size would take me longer, but they are so easy to read.. and compelling.


the depth of the world and its history is amazing.


but even more, i am amazed at the way some deep human issues were seamlessly woven into the storty. there's the obvious religious references and theories, which are handled very intelligently. but i also got a lot from [Elend's lessons to become king](/spoiler), to have faith in the person you are, and [Vin learning to trust people](/spoiler)... it made me wish i had read them when i was a teenager... and so i'm going to buy book 1 for my neice and see if she likes it, the strong female lead is another plus.


so if you haven't read the mistborn trilogy yet... read it, it's good.


and thanks r/fantasy for alerting me to the awesomeness, and thanks for writing them brandon :)

A couple of friends and I flew over to London from Ireland for his book signing in Forbidden Planet yesterday, and it was totally worth the trip. The book signing was supposed to take place from 1 – 2 p.m. but Brandon Sanderson came out to do a quick Q &amp; A at 12:40 p.m. before the signing and at 1 p.m. he began signing books but said that if anyone else had more questions to feel free to ask him when he was signing your books. A lot of people took advantage of this, me included.
 
My friends Dylan and Mairead were ahead in queue, and they told Brandon that we had flown from Ireland to be at the signing. He was so grateful for this that he gave them a free t-shirt. When my friend Joe and I got up, he thanked us again for flying in just to see him, he allowed us a little extra time to ask him questions because we’d made the trip over and we got a picture with him. He also mentioned that, if he had time, he’d stay behind and answer some more questions after the signing.

His signing didn’t end until about 4:20 p.m., as opposed to 2 p.m. like forecast. Nevertheless, he stayed behind to sign a bunch of books for Forbidden Planet to have in stock, and since it was just Joe and I left, we had a one (technically two) on one Q &amp; A with Brandon Sanderson. It was awesome. He talked to us for about 15 / 20 minutes. We were running out of questions as we didn’t expect to have such an extensive time to speak to him, especially by ourselves, so we hadn’t prepared all that many. Our friends Dylan and Mairead had gone to check into their hotel but were on the way back and Brandon offered to wait with us for another few minutes to speak with them (this was all after nearly 4 hours of booking signing and question answering already!).

We waited for them outside Forbidden Planet and when they arrived, we spent another 15 minutes or so chatting some more to him about the Cosmere, Mistborn, WoK and anything else we could think of. Before he left, he had one more gift for us. He gave me one for the codes for the Great Hunt (which I will use later, and probably post to Theoryland for those who are interested)! After he’d left, Joe and I went back into Forbidden Planet, chancing our arm in the hopes of getting a free t-shirt. They had none spare but two employees gave us their t-shirts as they weren’t going to keep them. To those two guys I would like to say thank you so much, you are awesome.

We got some interesting reactions and answers from the questions we asked. If anyone is interested in them, I can post them here as an edit, or to a separate thread. There are a few questions worth posting, some of which contain spoilers for Alloy of Law, WoK etc. so if anyone is interested, let me know. I’d post them now but I feel I’ve typed too much already, and if you’re still reading, thanks!

To summaries, Brandon Sanderson spent over 3 and a half hours singing books and answering questions, over 30 minutes talking just to myself and a few friends about his books and even waited around for some of them to return and gave us a free t-shirt and a code to the Great Hunt.

Brandon Sanderson, you are a gent and a scholar. Thank you from Chad, Joe, Dylan and Mairead.

Joe Abercrombie does it again for me. I posted when I finished reading ""The Blade Itself"" and people raised some valid points that Abercrombie isn't the end-all, be-all of fantasy authors -- but the man is pretty damn good. ""Before They Are Hanged"" led me on the whole time, hoping against hope that at some point, some sort of contrived deus ex machina was going to appear.

But Abercrombie was pretty much ""sod on that"" and even turned the whole ""hero quest"" / ""adventuring-group-to-save-the-day-with-ancient-magical-artifact"" trope on its head. I mean, [Ending of book](/s ""they went on that trip for ABSOLUTELY nothing. Poor Jezal's face."")

And Abercrombie even got me to liking a lot of the characters that I didn't like to begin with. Jezal's character arc started with me disliking him for being an uppity piece of shit to actually sympathizing with the guy. Glokta is just all-in-all fantastic and I can't think of a reason to not like Logen. Sure, some of the characters might not be the most complex or nuanced to ever appear in the genre, but the lead POVs are pretty good. And I can't help but admire how Abercrombie does his POVs -- each POV really FEELS different from the others. Not even GRRM's switching POVs had the same effect on me.

Also, as a plus, since I started by reading ""Best Served Cold"" first, I got a kick out of seeing Caul Shivers.

Needless to say, I can't wait to finally finish the First Law trilogy with ""Last Argument of Kings"" and move on to ""The Heroes"" and ""Red Country.""

tl;dr: ""Before They Are Hanged"" was bloody good fun. Say anything about JoeAb, say he is a heartless, cruel, cruel god, ",,False,self,t5_2qknd,False,,,True,t3_17vknz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17vknz/just_read_before_they_are_hanged/,

Shroud of the Avatar is being funded through a Kickstarter campaign and one of their recently announced stretch goals (1.8 Million) includes a new novel written by Tracy Hickman that will serve as a prequel to  the events covered in the game.

So I put in the two most popularly recommended books on this forum and here are the results I got.

**The Name of the Wind**

* The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson
* Red Seas Under Red Skies by Scott Lynch
* The Desert Spear by Peter V. Brett
* Last Argument of Kings by Joe Abercrombie
* The Black Prism by Brent Weeks
* Rise of Empire by Michael J. Sullivan

* Beyond the Shadows by Brent Weeks
* Heir of Novron by Michael J. Sullivan
* Red Seas Under Red Skies by Scott Lynch
* Captain's Fury by Jim Butcher
* Before They Are Hanged by Joe Abercrombie

The plot was amazing, and personally, I felt like I could call a lot of the plot.  I felt like I knew this, and then he threw out the amazing plot twist of Gavin really being Dazen, and Dazen really being Gavin.  It changed everything for me.  I didn't know who to root for, I didn't know who was the bad guy.  Then, the characterization was perfect, with characters making real assumptions off of information they had.  Like Corvan not telling Liv what was happening, made Liv think the Chromeria was holding her hostage against her dad which pushed her into the arms of the enemy.  Then there's the fact that because of Gavin, Dazen's switcharoo, Kip thinks Gavin is the one he has to kill when really, it's Dazen, who's Gavin, who's in the cell.  This stuff is freaking amazing.

How Brent wrote war really resonated with me.  You have the political machinations of Gavin, who manipulated the entire Spectrum.  You have the fact that in war people don't always know who to side with.  The writing of the battle at the end was marvelous, the shifting POVs was a bit hard, but damn if I didn't love how it really made the battle truly chaotic.

The top post today is/was a [FUUUUUUUU submission.](http://imgur.com/8yzcC)  No question that it is clever and relevant to Fantasy.  In a pure democracy, the members of r/Fantasy voted and said that they would like more of this activity.




A r/Fantasy member also flagged this post for removal.  My guess is that the reaction was based on keeping r/Fantasy meme and FUUUUUUU free.


I am leaning strongly towards banning FUUUUUU and meme submissions outright - no matter how relevant they might be to the Fantasy genre.     Some of the more popular subreddits have spiraled into ADD-fueled meme and FUUUUU submissions with little discourse or content remaining.  Meme and FUUUUU submissions can be fun to read...maybe r/Fantasy isn't the right place for them.

He made up a batch,

got too close with a match,

He was the first author to introduce me at a young age to a fantasy world that really showed people for what they were. 

He took real-world history and created his own worlds from it. 

He loves to make huge time lapses in his series to turn that world upside down with new technology and it's own past. His characterizations were detailed - the Moidart from the Rigante series was a complex, tortured individual that somehow really made the books greater, you never know if he's evil or just kind of an ass or even kind of good. Fight scenes and battles were great. Looooved when he does outnumbered sieges 

The sipstrassi tales- with a time gap from Arthurian fantasy to post-apocalyptic hell 
Drenai saga - great stuff.
Rigante - my favorite. With a time gap from old Druidic - to a Britain-like occupied Scotlandish country with guns and sword duels. 

I know I'm not writing this well but it's just something that's been on my mind. Maybe my nostalgia has made the books greater than they are. I know most of you know of waylander. But he doesn't hold a candle to Jon Shannow, the Jerusalem man 

He was a great author, in my opinion.

Edit: Damn, I'm so glad to see other Gemmell fans out there. He's not perfect but I was always addicted to his work. Thanks guys! And if you haven't read his stuff, My fellow fans and I hopefully will be enough to show you which ones to pick up!",,False,self,t5_2qknd,1349186224.0,,,True,t3_10svs4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/10svs4/i_dont_feel_like_david_gemmell_has_ever_gotten/,
