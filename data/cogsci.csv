Psychology Today is not a scientific journal.  Psychology Today is some sort of horrible muck-dredging, fact-crushing, tabloid monster that doesn't bother linking to the papers and journals it references, and constantly has bloggers posting bullshit that is not just suspect but flat out *wrong*.  Psychology Today rarely provides adequate context for the things they post.  The stuff they post doesn't even rise to the incredibly low bar of science journalism.

If you happen to see something you find interesting in Psychology Today, that's great, but be skeptical, and spend the time to dig up their sources.

If there are subjects you are interested, you are much better off reading Wikipedia on a subject, and then using Google Scholar to see if anything interesting has been posted that's freely available.",,False,,t5_2qh0k,False,,,True,t3_ecp1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/ecp1x/please_stop_posting_psychology_today_links/,

**• Pinocchio illusion:** feel like you have a longer nose

**• Feel like you've had too much coffee, lsd simulation or sexual simulation using an ipod:** Entrainment [forevergeek.com](http://www.forevergeek.com/2004/05/hack_your_brain_with_an_ipod/)

**• Use the proper ear for different uses:** The right ear is better at following the rhythms of speech and the left is better at picking up music tones

**• Clear a stuffed nose:** Alternate thrusting your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then pressing between your eyebrows with one finger. This causes the vomer bone to rock back and forth loosening congestion after 20 sec

**• Reduce toothache pain:** rub ice on the back of your hand on the area between your thumb and index finger. The nerve pathways in this area stimulate the brain that blocks pain signals from the face and hands

**• Stop the world from spinning:** put your hand on something stable, the tactile input from a stable object gives the brain a way to find balance.  Because the nerves in the hand are so sensitive, this works better than the foot-on-the-floor wisdom

**• Unstitch your side when running:** most people exhale as the right foot hits the ground, this put pressure on the liver which creates a side stitch. Try exhaling as the left foot hits the ground

**• Get your heart rate back to normal after an emotion:** blowing on your thumb helps to control the vagus nerve which control the heart rate

**• Get rid of brain freeze:** Press your tongue flat against the roof of your mouth covering as much as you can. 

**• Stop nose bleed with one finger:** press hard against the small dent below your nose as most bleeds come from that area

**• Get rid of pins and needles in the hand:** rock your head side to side, a tingly hand or arm comes from a compression in the bundle of nerves in the neck, rocking your head helps releasing the pressure

**• Hold your breath longer:** hyperventilate before holding your breath.  It's not the lack of oxygen that force you to release your breath but the buildup of carbon dioxide which makes your blood acidic which signals your brains that you need to release your breath **Edit: Do not do that to swim, read below for more information**

1290375253.0,145,self.cogsci,e9m2k,IAmA person who had a sudden personality change along with Aphasia. AMA,229,84,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/e9m2k/iama_person_who_had_a_sudden_personality_change/,"One day in 1995 I went to work as normal (USAF) and after being there a while I found that I could not complete most sentences. To everyone else I seemed to be stuttering, but what had happened is that I had lost access to all of the ""big"" words I commonly used in every day conversation. I could ""feel"" them, but they were not there anymore.

I was 25 years old.

It took me about three months to re-learn how to talk. I had to use analogies in speaking to replace the words I no longer had.  If someone said one of the words, I would understand it and be able to repeat it and use it in a sentence. But quickly afterward it would be gone again.

I had no improvement from this condition until about two years ago, some of the words starting coming back. They would just pop up in conversation when needed. I don't have the immediate recall of a 99th percentile vocabulary anymore - but sometimes a word is there when I need it. And sometimes not.

The personality change was a lot more subtle. I lived alone and had no friends, so no one noticed anything right away. I did not notice either (I have pieced this together over the last few years), but then people who have these sort of personality shifts are the last ones to notice.
But in the space of about a year, I went from having no friends my entire life to suddenly having people want to hang out with me. I had become the hub of a bunch of friends.
I suddenly started having startling success with the opposite sex, at least to the point of bedding women easily. This was after having only one incredibly dysfunctional sexual relationship previously (a few years prior). Women would quickly fall in love with me.
Prior to my ""event"" (as I have come to think of it) I would have been considered pretty straight down the line Asperger's (not that I knew what that was or even what Autism was about back then).
After the event I suddenly was able to judge social situations and body language. I started just ""knowing things"" based on subtle signs. I found that I was better at this than any of my peers.
All good except for the words thing, right? Well, not quite...

The bad:
Lost some of my savant-like talents.
Started being bad with money; going from debt-free to bankrupt by 1997.
Started doing risky things - lots of road rage incidents and ""fools rush in"" kinds of situations.
My memories of my past life became foggy and mixed up. New memories were similarly scrambled.
Lost some of my sense of smell.
Emotional blunting and alexathymia.
Became sexually promiscuous and careless.
Changes in libido and a shift in sexual interests.
Became hyper-sexual (could go in the good or bad column I guess)
Lost most interest in personal hygiene and housekeeping.
Lost the willpower to control my diet, began binge eating.
Was insensitive to authority when not directly in view, future punishment did not concern me.
Was apathetic about all of the above.

Now for the strange part (and you thought it was strange already).
I found that I now had two separate processes of cognition; the old one and the new one. You see, I was still thinking like I did before the event, AND I was thinking the new way.  Not dual personalities - dual intelligences.

Any time that a subject or problem would arise, I would have simultaneous differing perceptions of same - and differing solutions or judgments.

This sort of thing continues to this day, with the exception that I have worked out what my opinions are (and they are a mix of the two).
Romantically and financially, I could clearly see that the things I was doing were against what I continued to believe in, but that had no bearing whatsoever on my behavior. That part of me had become a observer only, a voyeur.

I know what you are wanting to ask: What the F did the doctors say happened?
Well, I never went to the doctor. Never seemed like a big deal to me (bearing in mind that only the aphasia was known to me at the time).

Over the previous 6 years or so, it actually was not unusual for me to experience changes in my cognition or memory. Usually this involved me completely forgetting how to do some previously mastered skill. Or sometimes it was completely forgetting a part of my daily routine for a week or two.
Sometimes it would come right back after a week or so, sometimes I would have to relearn.

An example would be when I forgot how to drive my stickshift in 1991. Took me a few months before it became natural again.

So I just assumed that the words would just come back in a week or two.

I know of no particular physical event that would explain any of this; but my memory is such that I would not necessarily be able to connect a fall or a car accident to a particular time frame. It is all a big mosh pit of vague connections.

I have experienced more changes since then, some I notice right away, some I don't notice for years.
One example is that I suddenly started having trouble parking in 2006. Since then I have major problems judging the distance that the front left of my car is from other cars. This causes me issues getting into and out of parking spaces. The rest of my savant-like spatial awareness is mostly unaffected.

Over the last couple of years I have had a lot of medical problems which generally atypical presentations or just plain never before seen. As part of investigating this I have had a MRI and CT of my head. I was surprised when I was told that there were no abnormalities seen whatsoever.

I do have a lot of feelings about all of this. I feel a great sense of loss, since I feel like I have a lot of talent in multiple areas that goes unused due to my various mental ailments.

My mind is extremely error-prone. I make a near constant stream of mental errors throughout the day. Fortunately my current job does not expose this too much; becoming a brain surgeon is NOT an option.

I have seen a slow decline in what remains of old skills and a regression in some of my post event gains. I fear that in the future I will completely go back to the way I was, but with the fogginess and other issues too. And that would be a bad thing.
Anything left to ask?

***edit***

I have seen many doctors in the last couple of years.  All scans come back negative.  Extensive EMG testing comes back with odd result and increased insertional activity in all muscles.  Muscle biopsy was abnormal but not enough so to be diagnostic.  Many tiny fibers noted.  High CK (3x), High AST and ALT, Uric acid, NASH found on biopsy.

***edit2***
Some of your observations have reminded me about some things.  When I take personality type tests, I could easily score out differently on the same test when taking it again.  Even if I re-took the same test minutes afterwards it would be different.  This is because I often cannot decide which answer I actually agree with *most*.

If you were to ask me to emulate a particular personality type when taking the test I would be completely consistent and would be able to skew the test whichever way I needed to.

I believe that some part of my outward personality is emulated.  I often have unspoken discussions with other people in my head.  I emulate their part in it, and often get answers I would have never have thought of ""on my own"".  The answers I get often turn out to be exactly what the real version of the person comes up with when it is put to them.

I believe that part of the dual intelligence thing is that I have partial access to the subconscious/common sense part of my mind.  I used to be wrong about everything in my life; even on subjects I had complete mastery of.

Now that the change happened, I can see the right answers.  When I meet people now, I can pick out the ones that have the same ""being wrong"" problem.  They might as well be holding up a sign they are so obvious to me.

Other people's cognitive issues are also obvious to me, there are few that I do not experience either chronically or episodically.  My own biases (cognitive and emotional) are plain to me on a real time basis and I filter them out.

Not allowing them to affect my interactions with others makes me difficult to understand for most.

Of course telling anyone that you are only rarely affected by common biases provokes an immediate *bullshit* from them.  Yet it is the case.

***edit3***
I forgot to mention that although I have attended college I do have quite a lot of college credit.  I found out that a perk to being in the USAF was that I could take CLEP tests for free.  So I started taking them.  No studying, just showing up on test day and browsing through the tests and picking one I thought I could pass.

I ended up with 40 some credits this way.  I was two classes away from an associates degree, but they were in two subjects that I would have actually had to do something for: algebra and speech.

Some of the tests I took only because I was mistaken about the subject matter.  For example I took Western Civ I because I mixed up east and west (as I usually do) and I thought it was going to be about Europe.  I somehow passed it by deconstructing the test and going back and changing 80% of the answers as I went.

I went ahead and took Western Civ II and passed it using the same method.

I also passed English with a 94% for a nice 6 credits.  This is despite me struggling in this subject in HS and failing it my Junior year.",,False,,t5_2qh0k,True,,,True,t3_e9m2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/e9m2k/iama_person_who_had_a_sudden_personality_change/,

In one sense, this means that the study is observational, not experimental, so it can't make a claim for causality.

Beyond that, it's comparing people who drink lots, little, and no coffee/tea. Their conclusions that ""coffee only returns people to normal"" were drawn from comparing high coffee drinkers to low/no coffee drinkers. The problem with this is that it assumes everyone's ""baseline"" is the same, ignoring the well-known fact that people who drink coffee for caffeine are, like people who smoke cigarettes for nicotine, often self-medicating for a neurobiological deficiency (i.e. in this case probably dopamine). To compare the levels of someone who self-medicates taken off their medication to someone who doesn't need to self-medicate makes no sense. It ignores the mediating variable which is the individual difference in baseline. In other words, what they're comparing with these two groups isn't the perk people get from caffeine, but the level of arousal that people who don't need coffee have without coffee, with the level of arousal that people who need coffee have without coffee - which has nothing to do with coffee ""withdrawal"" and everything to do with a biological predisposition that precedes the coffee habit.

The only way we can know for sure that caffeine doesn't give any real perk is to run this study as an experiment. To take a random sample of people, and have random sub-samples of them drinking high amounts of coffee, medium amounts of coffee, low amounts of coffee, and no coffee for several weeks. THEN to have the coffee drinkers stop drinking for 16 hours, and etc etc etc (see the methodology). Only then will we be able to control for the neurobiological predisposition / self-medicating factor and make these same claims.

1272852665.0,125,self.cogsci,bz7xg,"Anyone else think the Reddit UI is breeding conformity and eroding its once ""intellectual"" status?",305,180,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/bz7xg/anyone_else_think_the_reddit_ui_is_breeding/,"I've been thinking a little lately about UI (user interface) design for collective intelligence and cooperation. I think that despite conscious efforts to maintain a specific culture within online communities like Reddit, the actual UI and methods of content filtering eventually lead *away* from a beneficial environment for exchange of ideas. And this must be changed for future platforms.

As I'm sure you've noticed, there has been complaints across Reddit that the community is becoming yet another Digg or 4Chan with little quality input or discussion. Nowadays we are plagued by quick one-liners, puns and witty retorts. Encyclopedia Dramatica puts it [quite well](http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Reddit). And don't get me wrong, a lot of those one-liners are bloody hilarious... but they have their place.

I want a community where I can freely throw out any idea or thought I have and receive a flood of honest feedback in the hopes of improving my thoughts or making new ones. It's a selfish desire which naturally adds value to a community and may spark further thoughts and ideas amongst other users.. Occasionally this occurs, and I believe this is why Reddit was such a popular move for so many of the early adopters.

There's a lot of erratic thoughts floating around in my head, so I'm just going to throw them out in point form:

* **4Chan** - completely anonymous, doesn't really work for good discussions unless you have some amazing filtering technology
* **Digg** - very mainstream, homogeneous front-page feed, difficult to get story promoted so massive disincentive to continue to submit content
* **Reddit** - easier to get to front-page (at least of a subreddit), subreddits help ease the issue of thought conformity but still plagued by reward-seekers posting one-line puns and retorts
* **Facebook** - real name, real details, real-world friends. I used to post all my ""amazing"" thoughts about various topics of interest only to realise none of my real-world friends care, and every post you make actually influences those people's perceptions of who you are. Thus you will notice most posts on Facebook are short funny quotes stolen from elsewhere or quick blurbs about some awesome thing the person did to show how cool and funny they are by association.
* ........
* Humans are hard-wired for some reason to crave recognition. So things like number of likes, number of diggs, number of upvotes and karma points are good starters for that instant reward function. If you post something others like, YOU GET A POINT! YAY!
* By all accounts, these systems of filtering content via voting are extremely primitive... it works, but there's surely a better method we just haven't stumbled across yet.
* ........
* My biggest gripe with these methods is that the UI tends to condition users into posting only certain content, refraining from posting other content, and generally interacting in a very conformed way. For example, if you spend 20 minutes writing a post like this or replying to a comment... 1) it is likely to be long and so less likely to be read, 2) you will be less likely to get any upvotes which tends to destroy your motivation for posting any further in-depth comments, and 3) why bother spending so much time writing valuable content and receiving no recognition/upvotes when you could post a funny one-liner pun and receive a mass of instant recognition/upvotes.

And so the end result is what Reddit has become today. The culture was amazing in the beginning, but I think the UI and methods of filtering have forced our little chemical-powered brains to stupefy the potential here.

&gt; What can we do Reddit?




**TL;DR The once ""intellectual"" culture on Reddit is dying I think due to the upvote/downvote system and our brain's susceptibility to always seek instant reward and recognition. Including of course the mass of new users coming into Reddit.**

This isn't the time of action that the FDA had press releases for. However, vendors of piracetam have been served with letters indicating they had 15 days (as of 8/29) to take action to their letter. 

Here is a statement from one of the largest piracetam vendors in the US:

""The FDA has recently informed retailers and distributors that Piracetam is being marked as a drug.  That it is not legal to sell as a dietary supplement.  Smartpowders.com was informed of this on Monday August 30th, 2010.  We have been given 15 days to respond to this letter from the FDA....""

There isn't a straight forward press released type link if you don't believe this news. It is discussed multiple places, such as http://www.imminst.org/forum/topic/43512-fda-says-no-more-piracetam/ or http://www.mindandmuscle.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=42978

I don't know why you wouldn't believe this, but for those that are skeptical I will attempt to update this with better links as they come in.

I really need help.

After my family recently had a court order placed on him for mental evaluation, my brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He was prescribed Resperidal (Resperidone) and was acting more normal while he was forced to take it. The problem is since he is 28 years old we cannot force him to take it and we cannot afford to pay for it. In addition, he also thinks it's some sort of mind control. Mental problems have been a recurring problem throughout his life (in his early teens he was telling family members he worked for the C.I.A.), and he has also had a lot of criminal problems leading to jail sentences multiple times. 

Apparently we cannot even threaten to kick him out without 60 days notice (in comparison to 30 if he did pay rent which makes no sense). Now that he is out of the hospital and off of the medication he is getting worse again. He cannot hold a job and he cannot maintain stable relationships and has become exceedingly racist (he had a black girlfriend which I'm assuming provoked some of this). He recently has acquired a copy of the book ""The Biggest Secret"" by David Icke which he is encouraging me proves each of his theories. The author apparently went on television once and told everyone he was the son of Christ and we were gonna die in natural disasters. I'd like to reinterate he has had these thoughts well before any mention of this book, however.

I have just now recorded a rant of his (Nazis/Hitler, Free Masons, Reptiles, Jesus, Sex Slavery, Ressurection, Cloning, 2012 - some of his topics) with him confirming his name and date of birth. What can I do to force him to get some further help? Our family can't live like this and neither can he.

**EDIT:** I'd like to clarify that the eviction notice is supposed to be used as an enforceable threat to motivate him to take his medication or whatever other steps he needs to do to take control of his life. It seems there are quite a few people that think we kept him for 28 years to kick him out and let him die on the streets without a second thought.

**EDIT2:** He's currently blacked out in his bed due to vodka. He has a large history of alcoholism and its relation to criminal actions; can we use this to say he is a danger to himself?",,False,,t5_2qh0k,True,,,True,t3_harzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/harzb/my_brother_is_28_years_old_and_has_been_diagnosed/,

Or do you have your own theory? A thought has been lingering in my head recently, that Consciousness is just memory, Everything is memory. From a young age we start off as blank, And we learn everything through observation. That observation becomes deeply ingrained and second nature. All Self awareness is just a memory of what self awareness is suppose to be and is therefore just consistent active memory retrieval. Does that make sense? This is hard to articulate and I'm sure that there is a Wikipedia article about it somewhere. So, me typing right now is all memory, you reading is memory, Absolutely everything is memory.
****

Also I'm sure that I'm not the first person to think about it in this way. So if there is a name for this, please share. 

I want to know what you guys think.


**EDIT:**
I went into more detail below

Everything we do is continuous memory retrieval. We become so good at it that it becomes second nature, the same way we don't have to think about walking, It just happens. So your inner human dialog is just active memory retrieval.

Ok, that sounds a bit weird. So I'll try to go further. I think there may be many different layers of memory, and types of memory that are obscure to our knowledge. So, for example. You walk into your bedroom and your eyes capture your surroundings. The first thing that your eyes see is the shape of the room, and by shape i mean geometrical outlines of the room. So floor is still floor, roof is still roof. bed is bed, based on a quick scan of the shape of the objects in the room. This happens in a very very short period of time. next the details are filled in, colors match the colors that you brain remembers and all is well. This is the base level of our consciousness, something we learned from early childhood. All memory. All this being continuous active memory retrieval.

Now it gets more complex. This is where memory fits into the idea of consciousness. Thinking. What if our ability to think about things, is just learned behavior, So if i think to my self. ""I like Cognitive Science"" What did it take for me to make that statement. 1.) Remembering words. 2.) Remembering sentence structure 3.) remembering the meanings of the words. 4.) Retrieving a memory based emotion, that is associated with the words. ""Cognitive Science"" = ""happy emotion"" Therefore ""I Like"". All this with memory. 5.) Now the actual hard part. The Inner dialog. Could this be just another learned behavior. We learn to talk and to retrieve memory so well, is this not just another skill like walking and talking. All this being simply memory. So from a young age we learn to talk to our self with out actually speaking. This is a really really simple crude example. I hope i made it clear.

So being ""self aware"" is just the massive accumulation of memory and we know that memories link to each other. So consciousness is just the consistent retrieval of a ridiculous amount of memory, that all work together to make a bigger picture. Similar to how you cant tell what is in a picture from one pixel. Once you sequence and combine them all, they make the complete picture. Also the complexity of our thought now is just the evolution of thought from past generations all adding there pixels of knowledge that make up the picture that is our consciousness. So when they people talk about primitive man we can understand that they had a fairly grainy picture of consciousness that was missing pixels. But, with time, we all fill that picture and pass it on to our children. All this through their environment. They receive the end result and hopefully pass it on to their children. I hope this makes sense.

Innovation is just the ability to find patterns in memory. So say you're an inventor and you want to innovate the cell phone. You evaluate all the current features of the phone and then associate other possible features for the phone. So you think what else do i have that is mobile.. aha! the camera. OK so what if i put a camera into the cell phone. Brilliant! Not the best example but i hope you see what i mean. Please excuse grammatical errors, this is the first time Ive written this down and There is still a ridiculous amount more. But the main idea remains simple. Everything is form of memory.

TL;DR Read it, It might make you think.

I highly, highly recommend picking up [Talking Nets](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3922) for an inside-personal history of some of the greatest Neural Network scientists, including Rumelhart. You can probably find it used via Amazon for 3$.

Below is a note from Jay McClelland to the Math Psych Listserv:


&gt;Dear Colleagues,


&gt;It is with great personal sadness that I write with the news that David Rumelhart passed away this morning.  David was a towering intellect and contributed to many areas of mathematical psychology and cognitive science.   Hailing from South Dakota, be studied Mathematical Psychology as a graduate student at Stanford, then joined the faculty at UCSD. After 20 years he returned to Stanford as a professor in the Department of Psychology.


&gt;Rumelhart developed powerful algorithms for training neural networks and played a critical leadership role in articulating the computational advantages and implications of neural networks in the 1980's.  Among other things David led, with me, the group that produced 'Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition', a two volume work on the foundations and applications of neural network models that has sold over 100,000 units (including both single and double-volume sales) since its publication in 1986.


&gt;David became tragically disabled due to a progressive neurological
condition during the mid-1990's, leaving his professorship at the end of that decade.


&gt;David received many honors during his lifetime, including election to
membership in the National Academy of Sciences and a MacArthur 'Genius' Award.  David was also a Fellow of the SEP and he and I jointly received the SEP Warren Medal in 1993. In 2000, the Glushko-Samuelson foundation created a major prize for fundamental contributions to the theoretical foundations of cognitive science in David's honor.


&gt;There will be a memorial service for David later in the spring in the
bay area.

the reason is because this is eating me up inside. i can't live a life where the primary goal is reproduction, but that is a different discussion.

anyway, please throw any arguments you have against this at me, because it is difficult to live if this is true. (before anyone points me towards /r/suicidewatch, i am not suicidal)

edit: also please point me towards the right subreddit if this is not the correct place.


edit 4: i have been thinking some more. i realize that the reason this (reproduction being the main 'drive') bothers me is that it means i have less choice, and that my future is being affected by forces i could not control. i realized that the reason i asked this question is that if i could find an answer in some form, then it would mean that there was less 'primal' influence on me. now i realize it doesn't matter. even if any work of art or anything i create *is* affected by a primal drive, that is OK, because that drive is a part of me anyway. every human being and animal might also be affected by it, but that doesn't make it ""worse"", it just makes it common. it is not the influence that matters, it is how i use the influence. for example, a fly uses that influence to have many kids and reproduce, I used that influence (through a dislike for it) to realize things about how stuff works and how i work and what i should do. the drive itself might be towards reproduction, but what i use it for doesn't have to be. and that is what makes us human. yes?

edit 5: my drive towards happiness is likely to make me want to have kids, but it doesn't have to. that is why it was created, but that is not what i can use it for. my goal in life doesn't have to be determined by what my drives were originally ""created"" to do. being human means i get to pick what my goal is, and it can be *completely arbitrary*. it doesn't need to have any reason other than that it makes me happy. so now what do i pick?

i think i know the answer, at least partially. evolution may have given me raw drives towards food or sex or pleasure, but that is what they were. they were raw. living for these 20 something years has changed them. they do not resemble their raw form any more, they have evolved as i have grown up. they have changed, and now their sum total may not point me in the direction of reproduction, it might point me towards doing something else. this is sort of like the invention of fire. sure, it was invented to keep people warm and cook food, but now its use has evolved into so many things, things that have nothing to do with food or warmth. so is that what being a human is about? you can accept your raw drives and obey them. but you also have a choice. a choice to take those drives and use them to do something else. something completely unrelated. you can modify their function so that it no longer resembles why it was made at all. and you can do it for no reason other than the fact that you can. that is what sets me apart from a fly. we both have the same drives, but i get to choose how to use *my* drive, and its original function can have no relation to its final function.

tl;dr: what makes me ""better"" than a fly is not me having different drives, it is me being able to choose how to use those drives. reproduction got me here, but it doesn't have to lead me any further.
