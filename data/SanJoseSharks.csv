[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030174)

**Big story:** The Vancouver Canucks are reeling and none of the changes -- from switching goalies to mixing lines -- has worked, putting them on the brink of another early exit and back into a goaltending controversy as they try to avoid being eliminated by a San Jose Sharks team that has never swept a Stanley Cup Playoff series.

Only three teams in NHL history have come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-7 series, and after losing all six to San Jose this season, there's little to suggest the Canucks will add to that. But the Sharks, who almost blew a 3-0 lead before winning Game 7 against the Detroit Red Wings in 2011, will be wary.

""It's going to be the toughest game,"" goalie Antti Niemi said. ""They're going to put out their best effort, so we got to be ready and we got to go to our next level.”

**Team Scope:**

**Canucks:** The focus will undoubtedly be on the goaltending after Cory Schneider replaced Roberto Luongo in Game 3 despite being out of game action for almost two weeks, and then gave up a soft third goal at a crucial time in the third period, and another nine seconds later, opening the floodgates for a 5-2 loss.

Luongo, who was excellent despite losing the first two games of the best-of-7 series, went back in for mop-up duty after Schneider was pulled, but when asked whether he should start Game 4, said of Schneider, ""It's his team.""

Despite all attention on the Canucks' crease, the real problems are at the other end, where Vancouver only has five goals through three games against San Jose, and has now scored just 17 while going 2-11 in its last 13 playoff games overall.

While most of the focus will fall on top-line twins Daniel Sedin and Henrik Sedin, who combined to set up Alexandre Burrows in Game 3, the reality is Vancouver has gotten little beyond them for two postseasons now, including lengthy droughts for Mason Raymond, Jannik Hansen and Chris Higgins, while NHL Trade Deadline acquisition Derek Roy has been mostly invisible.

Meanwhile the Sharks got two goals from their third-line center, Joe Pavelski, to complement the top players.

**Sharks:** San Jose players were saying all the right things about not resting on their laurels with a 3-0 lead against the Canucks, but as long as the Sharks' power play remains dominant it's hard to envision Vancouver coming back.

The Sharks scored three power-play goals, including a 5-on-3 to open the scoring, and are now 4-for-17 in this Western Conference Quarterfinal, which also includes a key goal to tie Game 1. They didn't get one in Game 2, but tied it with 55.1 seconds left and goalie Antti Niemi pulled for an extra attacker.

San Jose also killed off an early 4-on-3 before taking the lead for good on the two-man advantage in the first period of Game 3, and killed six of seven Canucks' power plays. Even when the Sharks don't score with the man advantage, they at least generate momentum, something Vancouver has failed to do. With so little room and scoring 5-on-5, special teams play has been the deciding factor.

""They scored on the power play and they get a lot of momentum from them,"" Canucks captain Henrik Sedin said after taking a bad Game 3 penalty. ""They are killing us. Part of winning is staying out of the box and we've got to be calmer.""

**Who's hot:** Logan Couture continued to make his case as the new face of the Sharks with two goals, four points, a couple of key blocked shots, and 15 of 18 faceoffs won in Game 3. With three goals and six points in the series, Couture tops a list of hot Sharks that also includes Patrick Marleau (three goals) and Joe Pavelski (two goals and four assists).

1334078966.0,60,self.SanJoseSharks,s2tix,Just got a phone call from one of the Sharks!,63,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/SanJoseSharks/comments/s2tix/just_got_a_phone_call_from_one_of_the_sharks/,"So last week I was hanging out with one of my buddies and he got really excited.  He told me that he was at a steak house and was leaving when he noticed a drivers license laying on the ground.  He picked it up and read the name at first he thought it was an odd name then he started to put things togethor.  Well a couple of days later he shows me the license and I am shocked that he found Pickle's license.

So fast forward a few days to april 7th I am at the hockey game watching the Sharks play the Kings in the final game of the season.  So I am having a few drinks and the second intermission begins.  So I am sitting there when I have a thought about Vlasic and his license.  So I decide to walk over to the bench which was clear at this point except for a couple of trainers and some guys that work behind the bench with gear and equipment.

Well this one guy was doing something with the gloves and I kinda just leaned over the railing and said ""excuse me...""  The gentleman kinda looked up and he just figured I was a fan looking for gear i guess so he kinda ignored me.  

Undeterred I said again.  ""Excuse me I found Vlasic's Drivers Licesne.""  

This got the guys attention and he walked over to me and said ""can I have it""

I then responded ""well I don't have it on me my friend actually found it in a steak house the other day and we just wanted to return it to him.  I can give you my business card if you could get it to Vlasic that would be great!""

The guy just nodded and took my card.


So fast forward to today on 4/10 and my work phone starts ringing and I answer it and Vlasic is on the line. the conversation went like this.


""Business of Operation How may I help you?"" I stated

""Hi is this zipo29?""

""Yes this is him, may I ask who is calling?""

""Yeah this is Marc-Edouard Vlasic...I recieved your business card from _____(drawing a blank on the equipment guys name).  He said that you had my licesne?""

""Oh hey, yeah I do have it I wanted to get it back to you do you want to meet up so I can get it to you?""

He then said ""I don't have time right now but I can meet up with you after I get back from St. Louis""

I then gave him my cell phone number and he is going to call me back after he gets back from the Lou.

I am more then excited to meet him.  I already have his jersey so I am going to ask him to sign it for me.  I will edit this post with pictures after I meet up with him in a few days.

Guy at the Sharks tank said they were very good counterfeits (seems like legit Ticketmaster paper, had the glossy look, and you can see the blue tint when held up to the light).  He said he could tell they were fake because the barcode didn't seem right and the price on the ticket (162.50) isn't a price for that section.  And he had already about 8 people come through with the same fake tickets.

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings this season between teams that ended last season fighting tooth-and-nail for a Stanley Cup Playoff spot. The Sharks finished seventh in the Western Conference with 96 points and the Flames missed the postseason with a 90-point, ninth-place finish. Calgary won the season series with a 2-1-1 record against San Jose.

**Big story:** This season-opener features two veteran-heavy clubs looking to take a big step forward. San Jose was ousted by St. Louis in the opening round of last year's playoffs while the Flames haven't won a postseason series since 2004.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** While the Sharks made the postseason for the eighth straight year, their first-round exit was a major step back following back-to-back trips to the Western Conference Finals. Despite the disappointment, general manager Doug Wilson decided to keep his team intact.

The most prominent addition the Sharks made was actually behind their bench, as former Devils assistant and Hall of Fame defenseman Larry Robinson joined the staff. His primary task will be improving a penalty kill that ranked 29th last season. The offensive end shouldn't be a problem for the Sharks, who last season ranked second in shots, faceoffs and power-play percentage.

**Flames:** A 3-4-4 streak to end last season ended the Flames' postseason hopes and handed Calgary its third straight year missing the playoffs. That futility inspired general manager Jay Feaster to make wholesale changes, starting with hiring Bob Hartley to replace Brent Sutter as coach.

Changes weren't isolated to the Flames' bench. A number of free agents, most notably center Olli Jokinen, weren't re-signed, and Feaster made a splash in free agency by signing defenseman Dennis Wideman and forwards Roman Cervenka and Jiri Hudler.

Despite being one of the League's oldest clubs, the team will get a youthful infusion from 2011 first-round pick Sven Baertschi, who scored three goals in five games with Calgary last season.

As usual, the defense will be anchored by veteran goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, but the offense will need some help after ranking 24th in goals and 26th in shots last season. They'll also need to improve on last season's 5-16 record in overtime and shootouts, which could be a major liability in the shortened season.

**Injury report:** For the Sharks, Brent Burns is questionable following hernia surgery. Jason Demers (wrist) is out. … The Flames could be missing new additions Cervenka and Hudler. Cervenka is out with a blood clot, and Hudler was nursing an abdominal injury before returning to the Czech Republic to attend his father's funeral. Anton Babchuk (shoulder) is out; Jarome Iginla (groin) is expected to play.

He came back to us 5 minutes later and was gracious enough to answer a bevy of questions while watching the Sharks work during a 5 on 5 scrimmage. 

___

Matt Irwin and Matt Tenneson are NHL ready and will see ice time early in the year as Demers, Braun and Burns get healthy. The fact that he chose to exclude Nick Petrecki does not speak well to his ability to crack the lineup this season. 
___
Martin Havlat looks great and will be a 'much different player this season'. I knew that Havlat had injury problems but Wilson is confidant that those are behind Marty.
____
He's been trying to reacquire Brad Stuart for the past 4 seasons. He will be a big part of the improved PK.
____
Wilson said he's been trying to bring in Assistant Coach Larry Robinson for 5 seasons and he will help with the detail plays the Sharks were lacking in the past few seasons. The PK will look different this season with his direction.
___
Taylor Doherty would have been invited to camp if he was not currently injured. 
___
Michal Handzus is 100% healthy and will be a much better force on the 3rd line this season. 
___

Doug said that he built this team last season and just wanted to make some tweaks during this offseason. While he has said before that he treats every day like the trading deadline, he said that unless there is an injury or poor play he believes that this current roster will not need any further improvements. Don't expect any trades Sharks fans. 

It was very cool of him to come by and talk with my friend and while most of you are angry at the NHL and NHLPA, I am super pumped for this season to get started.

I am also bit of a stats junkie so [here](http://i.imgur.com/hcEUV.png) are the daily impressions for the last few months. The day after we finished Detroit off we had our highest numbers yet!

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030241)

**Season series:** The teams split four regular-season meetings, with the home team winning each time. Three of the four games were one-goal affairs, including one that went to a shootout.

**Big story:** The Los Angeles Kings will have home-ice advantage in a playoff series for the first time 1992. Will they be able to take advantage of it in this all-California series?

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** It was a different feeling for the San Jose Sharks on Monday. They finally went to practice knowing who they would be facing in the Western Conference Semifinals.

The Sharks have been fine-tuning their own game since finishing their sweep of the Vancouver Canucks on May 7. Now they have an opponent to game plan for.

""We all want to play hockey right now,"" center Logan Couture said. ""Guys were excited. We're anxious to get going [Tuesday]. Pretty pumped up.""

The Sharks took two days off after sweeping Vancouver before getting back to work.

""They are antsy,"" coach Todd McLellan said. ""They haven't been involved in this type of break this year at all. This is the longest that's occurred. You can tell in practice they're like racehorses. They're ready to run.""

**Kings:** Los Angeles didn't really have a rooting interest in the series between the Anaheim Ducks and Detroit Red Wings, but the Wings winning did make the Kings' lives a bit harder in one way -- instead of a short trip to Anaheim for road games, they have to travel all the way north to San Jose -- a one-hour plane flight.

""I would have liked to have played the Ducks,"" defenseman Drew Doughty said. ""I think we match up well with them, and it would have been good for California to have that rivalry because everyone kind of makes that rivalry so big around California. But to us, we haven't really had to battle with them like a playoff series, so I think a playoff series would have made that rivalry a lot deeper.""

The trade-off, though, is having home-ice advantage for the first in 21 years -- or when Doughty was a 2-year-old in London, Ontario.

""It's huge to have home ice,"" Doughty said. ""We get to be at home here, have our home-cooked meals, sleep in our own beds. It's just awesome. Obviously we're playing in front of our own fans, which is a bonus. St. Louis, in that first series, fed off their own fans in those first two games. I think that's a main reason they won those two. We have to do the same thing. We got to use that energy and make San Jose not want to play in our rink.""

**Who's hot:** Sharks centers Joe Pavelski and Logan Couture tied for the team lead with eight points each in their four-game first-round sweep of the Vancouver Canucks. … Kings forward Jeff Carter scored three of his team's 12 goals in Los Angeles' six-game first-round series win against the St. Louis Blues.

Currently, the jersey sits at 8-15 solely in the playoffs. I sat down yesterday and turned on the game well through the 2nd period after I got home. Immediately, the Kings scored a goal, we get an obvious penalty, and the next period the Kings score again! I throw my jersey off and turn off the TV.

Is it really my jersey? Hockey is such a superstitious sport, and during the playoffs, us as fans tend to adopt some of those traditions. Every time I wear the jersey on game day, we seem to lose. The only stipulation seemed to be in the 09-10 season where it did pretty good until we met the Blackhawks. Another thing is, I noticed i'm 0-8 when I've drank (or smoked), and 8-7 when I'm sober.

So here's my dilemma. Do I just fucking burn the jersey? Never watch the Sharks again unless I'm completely sober? Or just keep on, keeping on. It's tough though. So easy to blame the jersey.

tl:dr: my jersey is bad luck. i likes to party.

UPDATE: Didn't watch the game nor wore the jersey. Take it for what it's worth, but I'll be watching game 7 tonight! I really wanna wear the jersey too, but for the sake of the cup it will remain where it lies.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030172)

**Big story:** It was déjà vu for the Vancouver Canucks on Wednesday night, when a 3-1 Game 1 loss to the San Jose Sharks unfolded in an eerily similar fashion to last year's Stanley Cup Playoffs opener against the Los Angeles Kings.

Vancouver failing to take advantage of Roberto Luongo's great early saves, generating little offensively, and struggling on special teams were all themes last year too - and that series ended in five games. If the Canucks don't come up answers in Game 2 at home, where they have lost five straight playoff games, it may be over even faster as San Jose only lost two games in regulation at home during the regular season.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** The only question to emerge from San Jose's Game 1 win was whether second-line wing Martin Havlat would be healthy enough to play Game 2. Havlat left with nine minutes left in the first period and replays showed him taking a stick in the groin from Canucks defenseman Kevin Bieksa on his final shift.

Coach Todd McLellan didn't have - or at least wouldn't share - that answer after a heavily optional practice, but the fact Havlat, who also missed the final game of the regular season, wasn't on the ice Thursday doesn't bode well.

McLellan mixed up his lines after Havlat left, finally settling on former Canucks forward Raffi Torres late in the game. Spare forward Tim Kennedy, who had two goals in 13 games this season, may take Havlat's spot in the lineup.

Other than that, the Sharks won't want to change much from a game that saw them force turnovers with an aggressive forecheck, keep the Canucks away from goalie Antti Niemi's crease and dominate faceoffs and special teams.

""We got one game, now we want two,"" said Logan Couture, who scored San Jose's first goal and set up Patrick Marleau's insurance tally with 5:23 left. ""It's a good start, but that's it. We know they are going to be better though so we have to be prepared for that.""

**Canucks:** Vancouver shook up its forward lines in practice after failing to put a puck past Niemi in the opener - Torres knocked their only goal past his own goalie ­- and loaded up their second line. Centers Ryan Kesler, who was fighting the flu in Game 1, and Derek Roy will play together on a line with Chris Higgins. That trio played together late in the season and created a lot of offense, something the Canucks badly need after generating little in the series opener. But it leaves the bottom-six forwards short of a proven center against a Sharks team that rolls out Joe Thornton, Couture and Joe Pavelski as its top-three centers, giving San Jose more of a balanced attack. The Canucks will need more from Kesler, Roy and the top line duo of Daniel and Henrik Sedin.

""I need more from my whole team,"" coach Alain Vigneault said, refusing to single out his top forwards after Game 1. ""There's no doubt there that all our players understand that we have to get better and we're going to get better.""

That means doing more to get in front of and disrupt Niemi.

""We were shooting but had no one there,"" Daniel Sedin said. ""Niemi saw pretty much everything. Any goalie in the league is going to stop those pucks.""

**Who's hot:** There aren't any hot streaks on a Canucks team struggling to score again in the playoffs, but Couture has picked up where he left off in the regular season for the Sharks. Couture had four goals and three assists in five games coming into the playoffs, and added a goal and an assist in Game 1.

**STORY LINES:**

""It's a tough city to play in,"" said Antti Niemi about Vancouver. ""We lost two years ago and remembering those games, they were a little lucky, they got a few lucky goals. Hopefully, we'll get a few bounces this time.""

The San Jose Sharks face the #3 seed Vancouver Canucks in Game 1 in the best of seven Western Conference First Round Stanley Cup Playoff series in Vancouver on Wednesday at 7:30pm (PST). This will be the 29th playoff series in franchise history for the Sharks (13-15) and the 2nd playoff series meeting vs. the Vancouver Canucks.

**Previous Playoff Series/Action vs. the Canucks:**

2011 Western Conference Final – the #1 seed Vancouver Canucks defeated the #2 seed San Jose Sharks 4-1. (Dan Boyle had the GWG in Game 3 in the Sharks only win of the series)

The Sharks head into the playoffs with the best regular season home record in the NHL (17-2-5) but had the fewest points on the road (8-14-2) out of the 16 playoff bound teams. Like the Sharks, the Canucks dropped their final two games of the regular season and were 5-4-1 in their last ten games overall.

San Jose swept the three game regular season series (3-0-0) vs. Vancouver outscoring the Canucks 10-5. Antti Niemi was 3-0-0 vs. the Canucks with a 1.63 GAA and an impressive .943 save % in the three games. Joe Thornton led all Sharks players with four points (2-2-4) and Joe Pavelski added two game winning goals vs. the Canucks. Jannik Hansen led the Canucks with four points (1-3-4) and Alex Burrows had three points (2-1-3) to lead the way offensively for Vancouver. Cory Schneider started all three games vs. the Sharks (0-2-1) with a 2.94 GAA and a .902 save %. San Jose was 3-14 on the PP (21.4%), a perfect 12-12 on the PK, and led the way vs. the Canucks in the faceoff circle 114W-77L (59.7%).

San Jose is 41-42-9-5 all-time in the regular season vs. the Canucks.

**Season series:** The San Jose Sharks swept the three-game series, starting at home with a 4-1 thumping of the Vancouver Canucks on Jan. 27 that was part of seven straight wins to open the season. The next two were at least closer, with San Jose winning 3-2 in a shootout in Vancouver on March 5 and 3-2 in regulation at home on April 1.

Big story: These two teams met in the Western Conference Finals two years ago, and the series was much closer than Vancouver's five-game victory would indicate. The Canucks won Game 4 by scoring a postseason record three 5-on-3 goals, then clinched the series on a double overtime goal no one saw, converting a strange bounce off a stanchion in the glass that fooled everyone. Several San Jose players have talked since about being the better team and thinking they should have won that series. Now they get a chance to prove it.

**Team Scope:**

**Canucks:** Outside of whether or not Cory Schneider will be healthy enough to play goal, the biggest question facing the Canucks is whether their power play can keep rolling in the playoffs. It was crucial to beating the Sharks in the Western Conference Finals two years ago, and a big part of losing all three games to them this regular season, going 0-for-12 and giving up a shorthanded goal in the first two games before not even getting a chance in the third meeting.

The last two meetings were part of a decade-worst slump that included just two power-play goals in 20 games as Vancouver fell to the bottom of the NHL rankings. The Canucks have been better of late, however, scoring 10 times with the man advantage in the final 12 games while converting 25 percent of their opportunities -- almost double their success rate before that streak.

Having Kesler, who was out with injury for all three games against the Sharks, back as a shoot-first, right-shot option opposite the pass-first Sedin twins has made a big difference, and the Canucks need it to continue in this series.

**Sharks:** Just as the Canucks didn't have Kesler when they played San Jose this season, the Sharks are also a different team since sweeping the series, actually improving after trading away key players like defenseman Douglas Murray and power forward Ryane Clowe before the NHL Trade Deadline. They are faster and deeper since then, spreading the offense over four lines by splitting up Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton, moving defenseman Brent Burns up front as a top-line power forward, and dropping Joe Pavelski back to center a third line.

The newfound depth was enough to have the Canucks switching up their own lines in practice leading into the series, spreading out their top centers over three lines rather than using both Kesler and trade-deadline addition Derek Roy on a loaded second line. Whether the lines stay that way remains to be seen, but it's clear these aren't the same teams that met in the regular season.

**Who's hot:** For the Canucks, there aren't a lot of individual scoring streaks after dropping the final two games of the regular season, but Schneider had won eight straight at home before missing the final two games with a minor injury, which is key given the importance of keeping home-ice advantage against a Sharks team that was 17-2-5 at HP Pavilion. … For the Sharks, Logan Couture has four goals and three assists in his past five games, part of a season-long scoring surge that has seen him emerge as a leader in San Jose.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030247&amp;navid=DL|SJS|home)


**Big story:** The home team has won every game in this series so far, but the Sharks are hot, winning three of the past four to force this Game 7. Can the Sharks continue their resilient play? Or will the Kings' championship pedigree carry them to the Western Conference Finals?

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Game 7 in any playoff series is a pressure-cooker, a win-or-go-home experience that can cause even the calmest of minds to start jumping around.

Sharks center Scott Gomez, however, could be the rare player immune from Game 7 nerves. Tuesday will mark the 10th Game 7 of the 33-year-old's NHL career.

""It means I'm getting old, I guess,"" Gomez said after practice Monday. ""Someone brought that up the other day and I started thinking about all of them. I couldn't remember most of them.""

Gomez is 6-3 in his nine Game 7s, including a win in Game 7 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Final as a member of the New Jersey Devils. But it's the ones he lost -- including Game 7 of the 2001 Stanley Cup Final -- that stick with him the most.

""I'll never forget the worst moment, losing a game 7 [in the Cup Final],"" Gomez said. ""[Devils general manager Lou] Lamoriello always said it best, 'When it comes to Game 7, if you can look yourself in the mirror after and know you gave it your all, that's what it's about.' I'll always remember him saying that.""

**Kings:** The Los Angeles franchise doesn't have a lot of recent Game 7 experience -- the most recent time the club played in one was 2002 -- but that doesn't mean the players don't have history in Game 7s.

Mike Richards is 3-0 in Game 7s, including a memorable second-round series in 2010 that saw his Philadelphia Flyers force a Game 7 after rallying from a 3-0 series deficit and a 3-0 hole in Game 7 against the Boston Bruins. Justin Williams won a pair of Game 7s with the Carolina Hurricanes en route to winning the Stanley Cup in 2006.

Kings captain Dustin Brown said having those players, as well as a few others, will help those who haven't gone through that kind of pressure. Brown said he believes enough of his teammates have gone through other big games, so Tuesday shouldn't be something out of the ordinary.

""You've also got guys that have played in an Olympic gold-medal game, which is probably the equivalent of a Game 7,"" Brown said in reference to himself, Richards and Drew Doughty, who played for Canada in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. ""Guys have experience in big games. You look at a group of our guys [who] have won world juniors ... those final games in those world juniors and world championships and Olympics, those are Game 7s. It's a matter of using that experience and trying to get yourself ready.""

**Who's hot:** Sharks goalie Antti Niemi has allowed five goals in the past four games -- three of which the Sharks won -- after letting in six in the first two games.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030173)

**Big story:** The San Jose Sharks come home with the chance to put a stranglehold on their Western Conference Quarterfinal series against the Vancouver Canucks after winning Games 1 and 2 at Rogers Arena. The Canucks trail 2-0 in an opening-round series for the second straight year.

**Team Scope:**

**Canucks:** Two years ago, the Canucks were one win away from the first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Since then, they've won just once in nine playoff games -- but their loss to the Sharks on Friday night was especially painful. Vancouver was less than a minute away from evening the series before Patrick Marleau scored with 55.1 seconds left in regulation and former Canuck Raffi Torres beat Roberto Luongo for the overtime winner.

The back-to-back home losses make Game 3 a must for the Canucks, who've dropped their last six postseason games at Rogers Arena and need a win in San Jose to earn a chance to snap that streak.

""Every time we are down in a series, no one believes in us,"" captain Henrik Sedin said Saturday. ""This is a city where if you win a playoff game, everyone is happy. If you lose one or two, no one is going to believe in you. … We have to believe in ourselves and do the same thing tomorrow to give ourselves a chance.""

**Sharks:** Marleau's reputation as a player who can't produce in the playoffs is belied by his numbers. He has goals in each of the first two games, and his game-tying tally on Friday was the 54th postseason goal of his career -- more than any other active player not named Jaromir Jagr. He didn't score in last year's five-game loss to St. Louis, but had 15 goals in 2009 and '10, helping the Sharks make the Western Conference Finals both years.

""You just have to look at the stats,"" Sharks forward Brent Burns said. ""The guy is incredible. The only knock on him is he just makes it look too easy. I wish I could do that. He's an unbelievable talent and he's one of the hardest-working guys here. It's pretty incredible to see and just follow a guy like that.""

**Who's hot:** Ryan Kesler was in line to be the hero Friday night before the late heroics by Marleau -- he scored twice in the third period to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 lead. … Sharks goaltender Antti Niemi has allowed just three goals on 61 shots in the first two games.

**Season series:** This is the first of five meetings between the teams. The Coyotes went 4-1-1 against the Sharks in 2011-12.

**Big story:** The Sharks could have a new face in their lineup, as the club signed veteran forward Scott Gomez to a one-year contract Wednesday. Gomez had the final two years of his contract bought out by the Montreal Canadiens prior to the start of the season and became an unrestricted free agent.

""Everyone who plays in the NHL, you challenge yourself every day and you want to prove that you can contribute,"" Gomez told the Mercury News on Wednesday. ""But the main things is I want to come here, I want to help out and I want to win another Stanley Cup.""

**Team scope:**

**Coyotes:** Phoenix brings some momentum to San Jose after earning an impressive win on home ice Wednesday night. Veteran winger Steve Sullivan notched a hat trick and defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson scored twice and added an assist as the Coyotes cruised to a 5-1 victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets.

It was a nice turnaround for Phoenix, which opened the season with back-to-back losses against Dallas and Chicago.

""We played more committed with the puck,” Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. “We weren't trying to make a fancy play every time we touched the puck.""

**Sharks:** San Jose has stormed out of the gate with back-to-back victories on the road, including Tuesday’s 6-3 win at Edmonton. All six of the Sharks’ goals against the Oilers came in the opening period, as they held a 6-1 lead after 20 minutes, chasing Edmonton goalie Devan Dubnyk.

“We kind of let up in the second and third [periods], but we built ourselves a good enough lead,” Sharks forward Logan Couture said.

**Who’s hot:** Besides Sullivan and Ekman-Larsson, four other Coyotes also have three points through the club’s first three games – Shane Doan, Radim Vrbata, Antoine Vermette and Mikkel Boedker are the others. … Couture, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau each have five points through San Jose’s first two games.

**Injury report:** Phoenix goaltender Mike Smith was forced to leave early in Wednesday’s game due to a lower-body injury. The Coyotes termed the injury minor and said after the game that Smith will make the trip to San Jose. He's listed as day-to-day, but the Coyotes will bring up Chad Johnson from Portland of the AHL as an emergency call-up. … To make room for Gomez on the roster, the Sharks placed defenseman Brent Burns (lower body) on the injured reserve list Wednesday. Forward Jason Demers is out with a wrist injury.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030241)

Big story: In the first round, the Los Angeles Kings had to rally from a 2-0 deficit to advance. Now they're in position to do what the 2012 championship team did for four consecutive rounds: jump out to a 3-0 series lead, if they can defeat the San Jose Sharks at HP Pavilion. The Kings have won six in a row following their stunning 4-3 come-from-behind victory on Thursday.

Team Scope:

Kings: It has to be scary for opponents that Los Angeles is now winning games in just about every fashion imaginable. After relying on goaltender Jonathan Quick to come up huge in the third period of a 2-0 victory in the series opener, the Kings surrendered an early 2-0 lead built on goals by Jeff Carter and Drew Doughty, and trailed Game 2 by a 3-2 score late into the third period.

A two-man advantage after penalties to Sharks defensemen Brad Stuart and Marc-Edouard Vlasic quickly resulted in the game-tying power-play goal by Dustin Brown with 1:43 left. But the Kings weren't content to just head to overtime with a 5-on-4 man advantage. As a result, they got Trevor Lewis' game-winning goal 22 seconds later.

""I've said this before, experience is one thing and it's another thing to have all that experience together as a group of guys, because that goes a long way when you get yourself in a hole,"" Brown said. ""We didn't play a great game tonight, but we found a way to win and that's the important thing. We've got to get back to playing our game if we want to continue to have success against the Sharks.""

Sharks: The news came down a few hours before game time Thursday that San Jose will be playing the remainder of this series without forward Raffi Torres, suspended for a Game 1 hit on Jarret Stoll. If the Sharks can't find a way to win Saturday, the rest of the players on the team may find themselves with a lot of extra free time on their hands as well.

They had to be feeling good after absorbing the blow of another two-goal Kings lead and rallying to tie in the second period on scores by Patrick Marleau and Stuart before Vlasic put them in front for the first time in the series at 8:56 of the third. But the goals by Stuart and Vlasic took a backseat to the critical penalties they would take in the final minutes.

""It's a tough loss regardless,"" forward Joe Pavelski said. ""We know we can break through. We have done it before. We know we're going to get our chances, and we did, and we could have had another one. It was just a tough way to lose it.""

Who's hot: Carter and Mike Richards lead the Kings in scoring for the series with one goal and two assists each. Lewis, who doesn't have a power-play goal in 203 career regular-season games, now has three in 34 playoff games. … Marleau has a goal in five of the Sharks' six playoff games. Scott Gomez picked up a pair of assists in Game 2 for his first points of the postseason.

Ben Eager will undoubtedly be in the lineup tomorrow and for the remainder of this series. McLellan's post-game comments indicated that his only criticism of Eager's performance was the repeated march to the penalty box.  And the bottom line is that we need him.  His grit and tenacity are exactly what's missing from our side this series.  If he can play with a bit more discipline he has the potential to be a very effective player.

As for all this stuff about him being a goon and an embarrassment and the ""can we never play him again"" and ""when is his contract up?"", I don't get it.  Pretty sure the guy's name is on the Cup.  Pretty sure he's got an idea of what it takes to win.  The game was lost, the team had lost their composure and was just trying to get on the plane.  McLellan (rightfully) let Eager off the leash because you know what? FUCK THOSE GUYS. FUCK THAT BUILDING. FUCK THOSE FANS and FUCK LUONGO'S SMUGNESS. 

The Sharks have lost 5 of their last six and put themselves in a position where they have to win 4 of 5.  Shit's not working, so let Ben do an upper-decker in their house, get on the plane and go win the next two at home.  

Eager and McLellan sent a message in the third period.  It wasn't a message of intimidation or anything like that.  It was much simpler.  It was, ""FUCK YOU."" That's it.

**Season Series:**

It's opening night for both teams and the first of six meetings between the Pacific Division rivals, the teams ended last season with a home-and-home on April 8-9. The front end in Glendale was a big one for the Coyotes. Not only did they snap an eight-game winless streak against the Sharks, the 4-3 win clinched a playoff spot for the second consecutive year. The Sharks bounced back the following night in San Jose with a 3-1 win.

**Team Scope:**

**Coyotes:** The tweaking goes on in Glendale as the Coyotes try to regain the magic of 2009-10, when they set franchise records for wins and points, made the playoffs with ease and pushed the Red Wings to the brink in a seven-game first-round series. Last season they made the cut by only two points and were swept by the Wings in four games.

It's a different look six months later, with goalie Ilya Bryzgalov shipped off to deep-pocketed Philadelphia and other veterans such as center Vernon Fiddler and defenseman Ed Jovanovski following the money as well.

Some of the money saved went to locking up top defenseman Keith Yandle, signing him to a five-year, $26.25 million deal. Scoring will come by committee as it did last season, when 10 players scored at least 11 goals. New faces Raffi Torres and Daymond Langkow -- who's ready to go after missing all but four games last season with a neck injury -- are expected to help.

Goaltending is the biggest question mark. With Bryzgalov gone, Mike Smith will get his chance as the starter with Jason LaBarbera backing him up. ""Obviously, our goaltending has to be good for us to do well this year, but (I'm) very confident with the depth in goaltending,"" general manager Don Maloney said.

**Sharks:** The journey to the Stanley Cup starts with a single step, and given how the Sharks left the gate last year, that step had better be on the right foot.

""You know, 12th place in the conference in mid-January, with this hockey team, that's beyond being unacceptable,"" GM Doug Wilson told NHL.com over the summer. ""I think last year, our last 27 games, it was almost a record (winning) pace. I think we drained our tank.""

That pace continued all the way to the Western Conference Final, where they lost to the Vancouver Canucks in five games.

It will be a different team without the offense of Devin Setoguchi and Dany Heatley, but the Sharks believe the improvements made in defense over the offseason will more than compensate.

""I do believe we do have plenty of firepower up front, but you're going to win, I think, by playing good defense,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said to NHL.com. ""We stressed that in the second half of the year and it kind of turned around our season. Yeah, we lost some firepower, but we gained some good players on the back end with Burns and Vandermeer and Colin White. They can play a lot of minutes, and hard minutes.""

**Who's hot:** 

Coyotes newcomer Patrick O'Sullivan led both lineups with seven points in six preseason games.

**Injury report:** 

Martin Havlat (offseason shoulder surgery), acquired from the Minnesota Wild in July, will not skate his first shift as a Shark just yet, as Wilson wants to make sure he is 100 percent ready first. Starting goaltender Antti Niemi skated on Thursday but watch Thomas Greiss play in the opener as he continues to recover from pre-camp surgery to remove a cyst from his leg. Backup Antero Niittymaki will miss at least another two months after abdominal surgery. … The Coyotes skate into Saturday with a clean bill of health.

**Stat pack:** 

Four Sharks scored four goals in the six-game series last season, while no Coyote had more than two. … One major focus for both teams was improvement on the penalty kill. San Jose was 24th in the NHL last season; Phoenix was 26th. … San Jose's power play was second at 23.5 percent.

**Puck drop:**

""We know it's going to be a dogfight to get to the playoffs in the Western Conference. It's going to be a challenge… we're going to have to continue to play well as a team. Consistency is always a big factor in that."" -- Coach Dave Tippett on the Coyotes' website, setting the scene for the new season

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020441)

**Season series:** This is the third and final meeting this season between these teams, with San Jose having won the first two, including a 3-2 shootout victory at HP Pavilion on Jan. 31. Logan Couture has feasted on the Oilers in his career, with seven goals in his last nine games against Edmonton.

Big story: The Oilers are hoping to make the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time since 2006, while San Jose has been a perennial playoff contender. But with the Sharks having lost six of their last seven and the Oilers posting a 3-0-1 record in their last four, these clubs appear to be going in opposite directions as the playoff push approaches.

**Team Scope:**

Sharks: Since starting the season 7-0-0, San Jose has gone 5-10-6 and is now in very real danger of missing the postseason for the first time in a decade. The Sharks were tied for eighth in the Western Conference with Phoenix heading into Tuesday's action after struggling through two games in Southern California to kick off a five-game road trip.

After a 5-2 loss to the Kings at Staples Center on Saturday, the Sharks visited the Ducks at Honda Center on Monday. In a closely-contested opening period against Anaheim, Jason Demers scored his first goal of the season to even the score 1-1 late in the first. But Anaheim exploded in the middle frame, beating Antti Niemi three times in under three minutes to take a commanding 4-1 lead. San Jose made it interesting in the third, outshooting the Ducks 16-6 and pulling to within 4-3 on Matt Irwin's goal. But an empty-netter from Francois Beauchemin (his second goal of the night) sealed the 5-3 Ducks win.

""Effort was better, results are the same,"" coach Todd McLellan said. ""I thought we took a tight-checking game and turned it into a track meet, and that certainly doesn't favor us.""

**Oilers:** A 3-4-2 record in their recent marathon nine-game road trip showed flashes of hope for the young Oilers, who ended the trip with wins in Chicago and Colorado. They returned home Friday against Detroit, dropping a 3-2 overtime contest before facing off Sunday against the Predators, a team that walloped them 6-0 in Nashville just nine days earlier.

Magnus Paajarvi opened the scoring in the second before Shea Weber replied for the Predators eight minutes later. But the game turned in the final period shortly after Justin Schultz was whistled for delay of game after flipping the puck over the glass. With the Oilers down a man, Sam Gagner raced past Sergei Kostitsyn, whose sudden return to the Predators bench allowed Lennart Petrell to join the rush and eventually notch a shorthanded goal that gave Edmonton the lead. Jordan Eberle scored the eventual game-winner five minutes later as the Oilers held on for a big 3-2 victory.

**Who's hot:** For the Sharks, Irwin has goals in three consecutive games while Patrick Marleau has five points over his current five-game point streak. Brent Burns has six points in four games since returning from injury and being moved to forward. … Taylor Hall and Gagner are leading Edmonton's offensive charge with seven and six points, respectively, in the last four games.

**Season series:** It's the first of three meetings this season, with two scheduled for the Shark Tank. Vancouver won three of four games last season, including both visits to San Jose.

**Big story:** Both teams are coming off shutout victories in which they were dominant. The Canucks will try to slow down the unbeaten Sharks, who've won all four of their games by two or more goals.

**Team scope:**

**Canucks:** Revenge is sweet, as the Canucks proved on Friday night. Six days after they were embarrassed by Anaheim in their season-opener at Rogers Arena, the Canucks returned the favor with a 5-0 victory at Anaheim, spoiling the Ducks' home opener.

""They came into our barn on our opening night and gave it to us pretty good,"" said forward Mason Raymond, who scored twice. ""For us, I think we did a good job. I think we had something to prove. We wanted to get back to what we thought we could do.""

Perhaps the best news for the Canucks was the play of goaltender Cory Schneider, who surrendered five goals on 14 shots to the Ducks on opening night but has bounced back with consecutive wins, including his fifth career shutout on Friday.

**Sharks:** It's hard to have a better first week than the Sharks, who've blitzed their first four opponent thanks to the dynamic duo of Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton. Marleau scored two goals in Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Colorado to become the first player in 95 years to start the season with four straight two-goal games.

""I'll keep taking them if they keep coming that's for sure,"" he said. ""I'm not going to get greedy, just take them as they come. Trying to do the same thing, work and go to the same areas. It's good that we're winning and things are going well right now.""

Most of Marleau's goals, including the two on Saturday, have come on assists by captain Joe Thornton, who leads the NHL with nine helpers, one more than fellow Shark Joe Pavelski. Thornton and Marleau share the scoring lead with 11 points.

**Who's hot:** Daniel Sedin had a goal and an assist on Friday and has points in all four of the Canucks' games so far. … Antti Niemi is expected to start in goal for the Sharks after Thomas Greiss blanked Colorado on Saturday. Niemi has won all three of his starts.

**Injury report:** Vancouver is still without center Ryan Kesler, who's recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, and forward David Booth (groin). … San Jose has been thriving despite the absence of defensemen Brent Burns (lower body) and Jason Demers (wrist). Both are listed as day to day.

**Season series:** This is the second of three meetings between the teams. San Jose scored six first-period tallies in a 6-3 win at Edmonton on Jan. 22.

**Big story:** With Chicago losing in a shootout at Minnesota on Wednesday night, the Sharks are now the only undefeated team remaining in the NHL. They’ll look to make it seven in a row against the high-flying Oilers.

**Team scope:**

**Oilers:** Nail Yakupov’s exciting start to his NHL career continued Wednesday night, as he beat Chad Johnson via the power play at 3:52 of overtime to lift Edmonton to a 3-2 victory at Phoenix. It was Yakupov’s team-leading fourth goal of the season and his first game-winner.

""It's another big goal for Nail. He seems to have a knack for scoring big goals,” Oilers forward Sam Gagner said. “He finds a way all the time. It's impressive.""

**Sharks:** San Jose continued its winning ways Tuesday night, when it skated away with a 3-2 shootout victory against the Anaheim Ducks at HP Pavilion. The Sharks erased a 2-1 deficit with just 2:45 remaining in regulation on Logan Couture’s fourth goal of the season.

""We got to be excited that we put points in the bank and we were able to come back, but we have to tell it like it was,"" Sharks coach Todd McLellan said. ""They were the better team. Didn't feel real good tonight with the flow of the game, with the management of players. Opportunities to execute, but we didn't do it. It was a frustrating night, but at least we found a way to win.""

**Who’s hot:** Oilers winger Taylor Hall has a goal and seven assists in six games, while Sam Gagner is 2-5-7 and Jordan Eberle is 3-3-6. … Sharks forwards Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau are tied for the League lead with 14 points through the first six contests, while Joe Pavelski is 3-8-11 and Couture is 4-5-9.

**Big story:** Following an overtime thriller on Saturday and two full days off, the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks get back at it in Game 4 from HP Pavilion. The Sharks can knot up the series with a win, while the Kings will look to become the first road team to taste victory.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** Between its run to the Stanley Cup a year ago and having to rally from two games down in the first round this year against St. Louis, there aren't a lot of situations Los Angeles hasn't encountered and doesn't know how to handle. That's why it was surprising to see the Kings take some critical penalties in Game 3 and come a little unglued after the Sharks capitalized on them.

With less than a minute left in regulation of a 1-1 game, Robyn Regehr was called for hooking and Trevor Lewis received a goaltender interference penalty 37 seconds apart. That gave the Sharks a 5-on-3 heading into overtime, which the Kings killed off, but 11 seconds later they gave up the winning goal on the man advantage. Jonathan Quick, who made 38 saves, was given a game misconduct for chasing down an official to argue the calls.

""It's the position that we put ourselves into that is mind-boggling,"" forward Anze Kopitar said. ""It's not the way we want to play and be in that situation. We came close to killing it off, but just like we've said it all along, you can't give them too many opportunities, because they will score and they did.""

**Sharks:** Now the position for San Jose isn't quite as dire as if it had gone down 3-0 in the series, but if the Sharks can't come up with another win Tuesday they will be faced with having to take three in a row, two of which are scheduled for Staples Center.

Dan Boyle and Logan Couture got the power play clicking in Game 3, with Couture scoring the winner at 1:29 of overtime after it looked like he might be knocked from the game in the second period following a battle along the boards with Jeff Carter. Couture lost his balance and went awkwardly into the boards, came up favoring his left leg and departed the ice briefly. But he'd be back.

""It's playoffs. Everyone plays through injuries,"" Couture said. ""The four years I've been here, I've seen guys play through a lot of injuries. The Stanley Cup is what you're playing for. Whatever it takes.""

**Who's hot:** Quick has stopped 101 of 106 shots in this series for the Kings, a .953 save percentage. … Patrick Marleau leads the Sharks in scoring over the first three games with a goal and two assists.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020674)

**Season series:** This is the third of three meetings. The Columbus Blue Jackets have outscored the San Jose Sharks by a 10-2 margin in two victories. Both of those games took place at Nationwide Arena.

**Big story:** The Sharks are still fighting for home-ice advantage in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, as they enter Sunday’s action in fifth place in the Western Conference, tied with the Los Angeles Kings at 55 points apiece. The Blue Jackets are aiming for the second-ever appearance in the postseason and began Saturday’s action in eighth place in the West, two points ahead of the Detroit Red Wings and Dallas Stars.

**Team Scope:**

**Blue Jackets:** Columbus saw its five-game winning streak come to end last Thursday, as Jonathan Quick denied 20 of 21 shots in a 2-1 loss at Los Angeles. Sergei Bobrovsky made 21 saves for Columbus and Dalton Prout scored the lone goal.

Sunday marks the fifth of what has thus far been a highly successful six-game road trip for the Blue Jackets. They’ll visit Dallas on Thursday.

""We have to protect the puck better and be a little bit more efficient in the neutral zone to spend more time in their end and cause them to chase us more times than not,"" Prout said. ""Keep them out for a longer time so they have to take those penalties.""

**Sharks:** San Jose continues its playoff push Thursday as it cruised to a 6-1 win against the Minnesota Wild at HP Pavilion. Logan Couture had two goals and two assists, Martin Havlat had two goals and one assist and Antti Niemi made 27 saves for what was his League-leading 23rd win.

""We all feel comfortable,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said. ""We all like where our game is. We can still improve in some things and we still got some games in the regular season to win. But, yeah, we keep getting better. It's a perfect time for that.""

**Who's hot:** Blue Jackets defenseman Fedor Tyutin has two goals and two assists over the past four games and winger Blake Comeau is 2-1-3 in the past three. … Couture has four goals and two assists in the past five games for San Jose.

**Season series:** This is the first of five meetings between the teams. The Ducks won five of six meetings against the Sharks last season.

**Big story:** This Pacific Division rivalry renews with both teams off to great starts. San Jose has stormed out of the gate with five straight wins, while Anaheim has taken three of its first four.

**Team scope:**

**Ducks:** It’s rare for a player to make his NHL debut at the age of 30, but Swedish goaltender Viktor Fasth made his first appearance Saturday night, leading the Ducks to a 3-2 shootout victory against the Nashville Predators at the Honda Center. Fasth stopped 19 of 21 shots through overtime before denying all three Nashville shooters in the breakaway competition to help his club earn two more points in the standings.

""I just tried to do my job,"" Fasth told the team’s website. ""The guys in front of me played incredibly good today. They helped me a lot out there, so they made it easy for me. They did a really good job today.""

**Sharks:** San Jose’s torrid start continued with Sunday night’s 4-1 win against the Vancouver Canucks at HP Pavilion. Joe Pavelski scored twice, Antti Niemi made 23 saves and the Sharks killed all seven Vancouver power plays.

""It's been pretty good all season so far,"" Pavelski said of the penalty kill. ""There's just been a minor breakdown here or there where the puck's ended up in the net. We knew we had to just stay with the plan we knew we were going to do, and if we can pressure a little bit more, we'll try to do that.

""We're confident in the group, that we all can kind of chip in and do it. We've got four units that go out there. On the four-minute kill tonight, it was important. No one got tired. We got the clears, we won some faceoffs. That's what you've got to do on PK.""

**Who’s hot:** Daniel Winnik (five goals, one assist) and Saku Koivu (one goal, five assists) have six points in five games for Anaheim. … Sharks forward Patrick Marleau scored two goals in each of the Sharks’ first four games and added his ninth of the season Sunday night. He and Joe Thornton (three goals, 10 assists) each have 13 points through five contests.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020035)

Season series: This is the first of three meetings between the teams. They split four games last season, with each decided by one goal. Both Oilers wins came via the shootout.

Big Story: This should be an interesting matchup between San Jose's veteran talent against the Oilers' youth brigade.

Team Scope:

Sharks: Paired with Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Brad Stuart was a plus-1 with one shot in his second debut with San Jose.

Taken by the Sharks with the third pick of the 1998 NHL Draft, he spent his first six seasons in San Jose, and then was re-acquired from the Detroit Red Wings in June.

""It felt good. It was strange, but it was good,"" Stuart told CSNBayArea.com on Monday. ""I was excited about it, and to get that first game out of the way is nice. I'll start to feel a little more comfortable, I think, now that we've all gotten back to the swing of things.""

He said he also enjoyed playing alongside Vlasic.

""He's a good, smart defenseman, and those are always the easiest guys to play with,"" Stuart said. ""It will take us a few games to kind of learn how to read off of each other a little bit better, but I think for the most part it's been good.""

Oilers: For his first game as a full-time NHL coach, Ralph Krueger wasn't very nervous. In fact, he said his first game, a 3-2 win in Vancouver on Sunday, was easier than some of his previous coaching jobs.

""I'm used to coaching [international] teams where everything is a one-off, where you would coach at the Olympics or the world championship, and you had to win every game, whether it was France or Belarus,"" he told the Edmonton Journal. ""This is 48 games. I was very calm and relaxed.""

Krueger had filled in for former coach Tom Renney last season after Renney's father died and when he sustained a concussion, but now it's his team, and his systems. Well, at least some of them.

""We have a new specialty team,"" Krueger said. ""That's all Freddie [Chabot, goalie coach],"" Krueger said.

Who's hot: Sharks forward Patrick Marleau started the season the right way, scoring a pair of goals in San Jose's season-opening 4-1 win in Calgary on Sunday.

Injury Report: Sharks forward Jason Demers is out with a wrist injury, while defenseman Brent Burns is questionable while recovering from hernia surgery. … The Oilers are missing defenseman Andy Sutton (knee) and Theo Peckham (hip flexor), forward Ryan Jones (eye) and goalie Nikolai Khabibulin (hip).

**Big story:** The Los Angeles Kings remain unbeaten at Staples Center, and as a result they have the opportunity to clinch their second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals. However, in order to accomplish that and avoid having to go a seventh game with the San Jose Sharks, they'll have to win at HP Pavilion, where they lost twice earlier in this series. After posting a 10-1 road mark on their march to the Stanley Cup in 2012, the Kings are 1-4 away from home this postseason.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** Goals haven't been easy to come by throughout this series, and Game 5 proved no exception as Los Angeles and San Jose battled scoreless into the latter stages of the second period. That the ice was finally be broken by Anze Kopitar came as a bit of a surprise -- not because Kopitar doesn't have the pedigree of an elite scorer, but because it was only his second goal in 27 games dating back to the regular season.

After Kopitar broke the ice with 1:52 left in the second, defenseman Slava Voynov found his own scoring touch again and doubled the lead 53 seconds into the third. Jeff Carter added an empty-netter and Quick completed the shutout with 24 saves for a 3-0 victory that puts the Kings back in control.

But to avoid a Game 7, they'll have to figure out a way to win at the Shark Tank, where San Jose has lost just twice in regulation in 28 regular-season and playoff games.

“We’re preparing to go up there and win,” captain Dustin Brown said Saturday. “We don’t want to go up there and steal a game. We want to go up there and win a game. Your game plan doesn’t change, it’s just a mentality to go into a tough building and get the job done. There’s a difference between knowing you’re going to win and hoping you’re going to win and we got to go up there knowing we’re to win.”

**Sharks:** Just as Los Angeles has yet to lose a game in its building this postseason, San Jose can make the same claim. The Sharks are a perfect 4-0 on home ice against the Vancouver Canucks and Kings, and they have no choice but to build off that if they want to force a winner-take-all seventh game.

Antti Niemi won't be an issue -- even in defeat Thursday, he stopped 26 of 28 shots and gave his team a chance to win. But the Sharks are having the same issue the St. Louis Blues had before them -- as well as the Canucks, Blues, Phoenix Coyotes and New Jersey Devils last postseason -- and that's finding a way to get enough goals against Quick to win.

Forward Logan Couture, who included himself among the top players who didn't produce in Game 5, said Saturday he expects a much better effort and that he and his teammates are in a positive frame of mind.

""Confident and having a good time,"" Couture said of the Sharks' outlook entering Game 6. ""There's definitely not an uncomfortable feeling. We're going to approach it like our season's on the line because it is and I expect us to be very desperate and play well.""

**Who's hot:** Quick's shutout in Game 5 was the seventh of his postseason career. He has three in 11 starts, matching his total from 20 starts a year ago. His 1.50 goals-against average and .948 save percentage lead the NHL. Carter (2-3-5) and Mike Richards (2-3-5) lead the Kings in scoring for the series. … Niemi has allowed just four goals on 78 shots over the past three games.

This is as far back as they have records for, but conveniently it goes back just as far as we need. What happened in 2008 that made Thornton go from facing the other team's worst players to facing their best? The answer, of course, is that Ron Wilson was replaced as coach by Todd McLellan.

McLellan is the protege of Mike Babcock, whom he worked under as assistant coach in the years before coming to the Sharks and whose system he tried to emulate. McLellan and Babcock both implement a system in which their best players are not sheltered so they can score more (as most coaches incl. Wilson do), but in which they try to use their best players to shut down the other team's best players and score at the same time. This lightens the load on the your team's other lines but, naturally, makes scoring more difficult for your stars.

Unsurprisingly, Pavel Datsyuk is among the only two other players in the league currently top 30 in both points and QoC (the third is Martin St. Louis).

While it is often used as an excuse by fans of stars with declining points totals, in this case it really is true: Joe Thornton has become a much more complete forward and that is the reason his points totals have decreased.

**Last 10: Los Angeles 6-2-2; San Jose 6-4-0**

**Season Series:** The Kings have a chance to even things up for the season on the last day, as the Sharks picked up the first road win of the series with Thursday's 6-5 shootout win in Los Angeles. Each of the first four games went to the home team. Since they go in even on points, the head-to-head will not have any bearing on the Pacific Division title because the winner will have at least one more point than the loser.

**Big Story:** Both teams are in the playoffs thanks to Dallas and Colorado losing Thursday, but the Pacific Division is still a three-horse race. The Coyotes had two more games to play going into Friday night and a chance to finish with 97 points and the title. A slip-up in either game, though, opens things up for the winner of this one, who will end up with 96. At the end of Saturday's action, one team will have the third seed in the Western Conference and the other two will be seventh and eighth.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** They won't meet in the playoffs unless they both go deep, but Thursday night's home-and-home opener in Los Angeles had that level of intensity, even if it had a little regular-season chippiness. Three fights and 63 penalty minutes will do that, plus a little twist of fate that the Kings will remember for Saturday as they play for what would be only the second division title in their 44-year history.

With about two minutes left in regulation and the score tied 5-5, Jarret Stoll skated down the right wing on a break in front of the Sharks' bench when Ryane Clowe stuck his stick out and poked the puck away. Stoll complained, the cameras caught it, but the refs didn't. Clowe claimed ignorance, but Drew Doughty wasn't buying it.

""I don't see why he shouldn't (get suspended),"" Doughty said. ""To me, that's like a guy running down the football field and a guy comes out and tackles him to keep him from getting a touchdown. I don't see how this is any different. Maybe the refs didn't see it, but I wouldn't blame them full-out. It's hard to see things like that, especially a stick reaching over the bench.""

**Sharks:** While the Clowe stick trick was caught on video, the NHL will not be handing down any supplemental discipline for the action, as it was a missed interference call according to the rulebook.

""Had the referees or linesmen seen this, it would have been a minor penalty, nothing more,"" John Dellapina, NHL Vice President of Public Relations, told the San Jose Mercury News in an email. Clowe kept mum on the subject immediately after the game, but confessed to his actions in practice Friday.

""Obviously, as you can tell when I sat down on the bench, that was stupid, that was a dumb play,"" Clowe told the Mercury News. ""It probably should have been a two-minute penalty and I was lucky it didn't cost the team. It was definitely a brain cramp at the time. Don't think it'll ever happen again.""

**Who's Hot:** Anze Kopitar set a career high with his 49th assist on an Alec Martinez goal Thursday and added two more assists. He is currently on a five-game points streak. … Both Joe Thornton and Clowe had Gordie Howe hat tricks on Thursday. Clowe added to his by getting into a second scrap. It's the first time in Sharks history two players had Gordies in the same game. The pair, along with Marleau and Joe Pavelski, all have three-game points streaks.

**Injury Report:** Kings forward Jeff Carter (ankle) has missed four games so far but expects to be ready for the postseason at least. … Sharks defenseman Douglas Murray (lower body) has also missed four games but has been skating and is close to returning. Torrey Mitchell, still smarting from a hit by Colin Fraser, may be held out of Saturday's lineup.

**Stat Pack:** The Kings reached a season high in power-play goals scored Thursday with four, but allowed a season-high three. It was the first time they scored four with a man up since Feb. 16, 2009 against Atlanta. It's also only the second time this season the Kings allowed four goals or more in regulation. They had been 8-0-0 when scoring four. … The Sharks have won six of eight and three in a row, but their road win in Los Angeles is only the fourth in their last 15 opportunities. … In the five head-to-head games so far this year, Kopitar leads all scorers with nine points (2g, 7a). Marleau has 33 goals and 74 points in 82 career games against the Kings.

**Puck Drop:** ""As a team we want to be emotionally attached to the game, but with that comes some emotional control. I thought it was a very intense game yesterday and at times it got the better of us. I thought we took far too many penalties, penalties we didn't need to take. And that should have been one of them."" -- Sharks coach Todd McLellan in the Mercury News discussing the missed call on Clowe's interference with Stoll

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020639)

**Season series:** This is the third of four meetings. The teams faced each other twice in a three-day span in March, with each club earning a victory.

**Big story:** One point separates the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks as they battle for the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference, which guarantees home-ice advantage in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. San Jose, which currently resides in fifth, stayed two points ahead of the Minnesota Wild with Monday's 4-0 road win against the Phoenix Coyotes.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** Los Angeles is coming off back-to-back victories, as the defending Stanley Cup champs made it two in a row with Saturday's 2-1 win against the Pacific Division leading Anaheim Ducks at Staples Center. Drew Doughty had a goal and an assist for the Kings, while Jonathan Quick made 19 saves.

""I liked our team,"" Kings coach Darryl Sutter said ""We just finished seven of 11 on the road, and the White House [visit], and managed to still win our home games while we were doing it. Without having one off anywhere there, with all that traveling, I think all of our guys did a good job.""

**Sharks:** San Jose bounced back nicely from Saturday's 2-1 loss to the Dallas Stars by cruising past a Phoenix club that was desperate for points. Antti Niemi stopped all 35 shots he faced for his fourth shutout of the season, while Tommy Wingels had a goal and an assist.

""We've got a big game tomorrow night we're all looking forward to and it was good to get this one first,"" said center Logan Couture, who had the first of San Jose's three second-period goals. ""We had a good second period. We got pucks behind them and when we roll over our four lines we're a tough team to beat.""

**Who's hot:** Doughty has goals in four of his past five games for Los Angeles. Two of those tallies have come via the power play. … Niemi has allowed two or fewer goals in three straight starts.

**STORYLINES**

The (#7) San Jose Sharks face the (#2) St. Louis Blues in Game 1 in the best-of-seven Western Conference Quarterfinal series in St. Louis on Thursday at 4:30 PM (Pacific). This will be the 28th playoff series in Sharks franchise history (13-14) an d the 4th playoff series against the Blues.

Previous Playoff Series vs. St. Louis (all Western Conference Quarterfinals)
2003-04: (#2) San Jose Sharks defeat (#7) St. Louis Blues, 4-1
2000-01: (#4) St. Louis Blues defeat (#5) San Jose Sharks, 4-3
1999-00: (#8) San Jose Sharks defeat (#1) St. Louis Blues, 4-3

San Jose enters the playoffs on a high note, having won their last four games to claim the 7th spot in a highly-contested Western Conference while the Blues went just 1-2-2 in their final five games of the regular season.

The Sharks had a tough go in the four-game regular season series vs. the Blues with St. Louis winning all four games while outscoring the Sharks, 11-3. Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo led St. Louis with five points (2-3-5), followed by fellow blueliner Kevin Shattenkirk with four points (2-2-4).

Both goaltenders Jaroslav Halak and Brian Elliot posted shutouts against the Sharks in the regular season, both in St. Louis, as San Jose failed to score a single goal at the Scottrade Center on 49 combined shots in the two games. Sharks forwards Torrey Mitchell and Michal Handzus and defenseman Brent Burns scored the only goals for the Sharks in the regular season series.

**MATCH-UPS TO WATCH**

**Offense vs. Defense:** The St. Louis Blues defense gave up the fewest goals in the NHL allowing just 1.89 goals against per game and caused fits against the Sharks 11th ranked offense (2.67 goals for per game) in the four-game season series.

**Special Teams:** San Jose and their No. 2 power play (21.1%) will need to get things rolling offensively, but must do so against St. Louis’ seventh-best penalty kill League-wide (85.8%). The Sharks went just 1-for-15 (6.7%) vs. the Blues on the man advantage during the regular season while St. Louis converted 5-for-19 (26.3%) on their opportunities against the San Jose penalty kill.

**Balanced Scoring:** The Sharks had four players hit the 60-point mark this season: Joe Thornton (77), Logan Couture (65), Patrick Marleau (64), and Joe Pavelski (61). St. Louis did not have any players reach the 60-point plateau. For the first time in team history, San Jose had three 30+ goal scorers: Couture, Pavelski (31), and Marleau (30). St. Louis had just two players score over 20 goals this season: David Backes (24) and David Perron (21). However, St. Louis did have nine players score at least 10 goals this season while San Jose had just six.

**SHARK BITES**

Remember me?... Patrick Marleau is the only current member of the San Jose Sharks that was in the Sharks lineup for the last playoff series vs. the Blues in 2004. Marleau led all Sharks players with four points (3-1-4) including series-clinching goal in the five-game series victory over the Blues. Current San Jose Sharks development coach Mike Ricci had a goal and an assist in the series for San Jose.

Game 1… The Sharks have a 13-14 record all time in Game 1’s of the Stanley Cup Playoffs with a 7-7 record on the road during Game 1.

In the 13 Game 1 Wins… the Sharks went on to win 9 of the 13 series (69.2%)
In the 14 Game 1 Loses… the Sharks went on to win 4 of the 14 series (28.5%)

Can’t wait… Rookie Tommy Wingels is looking to dress in his first Stanley Cup playoffs game.

125 and counting… Patrick Marleau is set to dress in his franchise-leading 125th playoff game for the San Jose Sharks in Game 1 vs. St. Louis.

Joe loves the Spring… Joe Pavelski has 38 points (20-18-38) and seven game-winning goals in 58 career playoff games.

Not singing the Blues… Joe Thornton has 37 points (8-29-37) in 37 career games against St. Louis.

Niemi vs. STL… Antii Niemi is 4-5-0 with a 2.59 GAA and .917 save percentage in his career against the St. Louis.

**BLUES NOTES**

Awesome at Home… The Blues had the fewest regulation home losses (6) in the NHL during the regular season.

Familiar Faces… Scott Nichol and Kent Huskins, who spent last postseason on the Sharks roster, open this postseason on the Blues roster. Nichol played 80 games for St. Louis this season, posting eight points (3-5-8), and Huskins added seven points (2-5-7) in 25 games.

Standing Tall… Blues netminder -- and likely Game 1 starter Jaroslav Halak -- has two shutouts in seven career games against San Jose.

2002… The last time the St. Louis Blues won a playoff series.

A change will do you good… The Blues went 43-15-11 to close out the season after head coach Ken Hitchcock took over behind the bench on November 6, 2011. Hitchcock led the Dallas Stars to the Stanley Cup in 1999.

Just grabbed 20… David Perron had a goal in five of his last six games for the Blues and scored nine times in the last 15 games to reach 21 goals this season.

Welcome to the playoffs… The Blues have seven potential players set to make their Stanley Cup Playoff debuts this spring. Ian Cole, Evgeny Grachev, Alex Pietrangelo, Chris Porter, Ryan Reaves, Jaden Schwartz, and Kevin Shattenkirk.

**INJURY REPORT**

San Jose is relatively healthy headed into the postseason. Right wing Torrey Mitchell missed the regular season finale due to injury, while defenseman Douglas Murray returned to the lineup for Game 82 after missing four. There were some questions about alternate captain Ryane Clowe’s health, but head coach Todd McLellan quickly quieted those questions stating that he expected Clowe to be ready for Game 1.

St. Louis goaltender Brian Elliott (undisclosed, day-to-day) is questionable after reportedly sustaining an injury in practice. Accordingly, the Blues have recalled Jake Allen from Peoria to serve as a potential backup to Jaroslav Halak, the probable Game 1 starting goaltender.

**WHAT THEY’RE SAYING**

""They (St. Louis) play a hard game. Up and down the ice, physical, pucks to the net. We've got to match that. If they're going to do it to us, we've got to do it to them."" – Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Sharks defenseman

**BOTTOM LINE**

The Sharks would love to score an early goal, grab momentum and break the 0-for-49 shooting percentage in St. Louis this season. A few goals early in Game 1 for the Sharks could go a long way in this series against a very young and rather inexperienced Blues team. Although it is always a great way to start of a series with a win on the road, the Sharks just need to focus on keeping a high-tempo physical style of play and grab a split in the two games on the road before heading home to HP Pavilion at San Jose.

Let the Playoffs Begin!

**Last 10: Minnesota 1-7-2; San Jose 8-1-1**

**Season Series:** This is the third of four meetings this season. The teams split the first two games, both played in San Jose. The Wild seek their third straight home win over San Jose.

**Big Story:** When these teams met back on Dec. 6, the Wild were surging, while the Sharks were struggling. Now, the roles are reversed with San Jose shooting for its fifth straight win and Minnesota hoping to avoid its fourth loss in a row. The Sharks aim to add to their Pacific Division lead, while the Wild try to stay in the Western Conference playoff picture after going 1-8-3 since Dec. 10, when they had a five-point lead as the West's top team.

**Team Scope:**

**Wild:** Minnesota avoided its second straight shutout as forward Dany Heatley slipped one past Calgary Flames' goalie Miikka Kiprusoff with less than seven minutes remaining in Saturday's 3-1 loss, but that was about the only positive the team could manage.

A return to Xcel Energy Center isn't necessarily a solution to the Wild's problems as they are just 2-2-2 there over their last six games. But playing at home should probably yield better results as Minnesota is 0-6-1 in its last seven road games with its last win coming back on Dec. 10 against Phoenix.

**Sharks:** San Jose will try to establish a three-game road winning streak, while also trying to extend its overall hot streak to five in a row as it faces off against a vulnerable Minnesota team Tuesday. The Sharks will hope for a similar result to Saturday's 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals, in which left wing Patrick Marleau notched a goal and 2 assists to extend his points streak to five games. Marleau has 2 goals and 5 assists during the run and has put up 5 goals and 13 points in his last 11 games for the Sharks.

Marleau's goal was the result of a pretty no-look pass from center Joe Thornton after Jumbo Joe took a crisp feed from Dan Boyle at the point. The play was an example of the excellent all-round effort the Sharks have been getting from nearly all their players recently.

""Dan made a great play to see me, and Patty just gave a little scream so I knew where he was,"" Thornton said. ""Patty just talking made that all happen.""

**Who's Hot:** Heatley has goals in three of his last five games for the Wild. … Sharks goalie Antti Niemi has won three in a row and is 4-1-0 with a 1.61 goals-against average and one shutout in his career against Minnesota.

**Injury Report:** For Minnesota, forward Guillaume Latendresse (concussion) remains out, while forward Jarod Palmer (upper body) is on injured reserve. … The Sharks are expected to be without forward Martin Havlat (lower body) and defensemen Jim Vandermeer (upper body) and Colin White (lower body).
 
**Stat Pack:** Part of the reason for Minnesota's rough patch is that it has scored two goals or fewer in each of its last nine losses. Prior to that, the Wild reeled off at least three goals in seven of their previous nine games.

**Puck Drop:** Minnesota has certainly hit a bump in the road, but it's not too late to get back on track. This appeared to be the sentiment shared by the Wild players after Saturday's loss.

""We've got to try and find a way to reset,"" forward Kyle Brodziak said. ""We've obviously lost our game in the last month or so. Everything we do has to find a way to get back to doing the little things we were doing when we were having success.""

[John Kreiser - NHL.com Columnist](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020298)

**Season series:** The teams are meeting for the first of three times this season. Detroit comes back to HP Pavilion four weeks from today, while the Sharks visit Joe Louis Arena on April 11. San Jose won three of the four games last season.

**Big story:** The Red Wings and Sharks have been playoff perennials, but both teams will have to scramble to make the top eight in the West this season. The Red Wings come to the Bay area after a disappointing 2-1 loss at Los Angeles on Wednesday night, while the Sharks hope they've turned things around after beating Colorado 3-2 in a shootout on Tuesday.

**Team Scope:**

**Red Wings:** Detroit grabbed an early 1-0 lead in Los Angeles on a fluke goal by defenseman Kyle Quincey and nursed it well into the third period before finally paying the price for a parade to the penalty box. The Red Wings killed off a long 5-on-3 power-play for L.A. in the second period, but Jeff Carter scored on another two-man advantage to tie the game midway through the third period before Anze Kopitar scored the game-winner.

""This was a tough one,"" captain Henrik Zetterberg said after the Wings' two-game winning streak ended. ""We played really well in the first period. We had really good penalty killing in the second. And then the third was pretty even. Unfortunately, they got two goals. It's not often you win if you only score one goal.""

**Sharks:** Ryane Clowe, normally a top-six forward, will be back in the lineup against Detroit after sitting out a two-game suspension. But he was skating on the third line with Michal Handzus and Andrew Desjardins at Wednesday's practice -- and coach Todd McLellan said he may keep that setup against Detroit. Clowe has yet to score this season.

""I don't think Ryane Clowe should lose his Top Six role because of a suspension when he got involved to defend a teammate. But with that being said, we liked how the lines have been playing up front, creating more scoring opportunities,"" McLellan said, ""so we have to do what's right for the team.

""When Clowe comes back, we've really stressed his foot speed and keeping his feet moving and using his overall size to drive the net rather than always playing around the boards. If he's going to play well, he's going to work on that part of his game. But he's a huge part of our organization.""

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020689)

**Season series:** The Stars will be looking for the season-series sweep Tuesday. They are 3-0 against the Sharks this season, including a pair of wins this month.

**Big story:** Despite being in 10th place, the Stars are in control of their own playoff fate because they still play the two teams they're chasing, the Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets. However, it's also possible those games against the Red Wings and Blue Jackets could mean very little or nothing at all if the Stars don't beat the Sharks on Tuesday.

The Sharks could have a playoff spot clinched based on the outcome of games Monday, or if a win against Dallas will do the trick. The Sharks clinch if the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Red Wings in regulation on Monday.

**Team Scope:**

**Stars:** The Stars have hit a rough patch at a bad time, going 1-2-1 in their past four games. Had they beaten the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday they would be in ninth place, two points behind the eighth-place Blue Jackets with a game in hand.

However, Jeff Carter scored in overtime so the Stars couldn't pick up the extra point, leaving them in 10th place, three points behind the Blue Jackets.

""We battled to get one point and then kind of let it slip right there, but we've just got to move on,"" Stars defenseman Alex Goligoski said. ""If we win these next three, we feel like we have a pretty good shot.""

Actually, if the Stars win their next three in regulation, they are sure to clinch a playoff berth.

**Sharks:** The Sharks have lost two games in regulation on home ice, but one of them came Sunday, when the Blue Jackets capitalized on Joe Pavelski's turnover and got a late goal from Ryan Johansen to pick up a 4-3 victory that snapped San Jose's three-game winning streak.

""You never want to make a play like that at the end,"" Pavelski said of his turnover. ""You understand where you are in the game and you understand these things do happen once in a while. It's tough when they do, but we have to move on and get better from this and I have to try to execute better next time.""

Despite the loss, the Sharks are 11-3-1 over their past 15 games and still have a shot at earning home-ice advantage in the Western Conference Quarterfinals. They're currently fifth, two points behind the Los Angeles Kings, who play in Minnesota on Tuesday.

""I listen to coaches stand in this spot after every game around the League and they're trying to get their teams playing the right way heading in [to the playoffs],"" Sharks coach Todd McLellan said. ""We've got that going. We can't let that slip.""

**Who's Hot:** For the Stars, Ray Whitney has 11 points in the past eight games and Antoine Roussel has goals in back-to-back games. ... Sharks forward Martin Havlat has three goals and an assist in the past two games, Pavelski has goals in back-to-back games and Logan Couture has five points in the past two games, including a four-point effort last Thursday against Minnesota.

**Season series:** The third of three regular-season meetings, with the Predators entering the series finale having won both previous games. In the most recent victory, Colin Wilson scored 2:08 into overtime and Pekka Rinne made 25 saves in a 1-0 win Feb. 12 in Nashville.

**Big story:** Nashville lost for the third time in four games Wednesday against the Anaheim Ducks, the first game of a three-game California road trip. The Predators, who have allowed just 2.29 goals per game this season, have yielded four or more in each of their past three games. The timing couldn't be any worse, either, since Nashville plays eight of its next 10 on the road. The Sharks, 6-1-3 at home, currently are ninth in the Western Conference with 22 points, but just one behind fifth-seeded Nashville.

**Team Scope:**

**Predators:** The Predators are 6-2-2 against the Pacific Division this season, but will need a big effort coming off a disappointing 5-1 loss to the Ducks. Anaheim opened a 2-0 lead just four minutes into the game on a pair of goals in a span of 61 seconds and never looked back. Craig Smith scored the lone goal for the Predators midway through the second, but by that time the Ducks had built a 4-0 lead. Rinne had his worst start of the season, allowing five goals on 21 shots before being relieved by backup Chris Mason to open the third. Rinne entered Wednesday's game 7-0-2 with a 1.58 goals-against average in his previous nine starts against Anaheim, with both losses coming in shootouts this season.

""[The Ducks] tore us apart,"" Nashville coach Barry Trotz told The Tennessean. ""Their big guys stepped up and led the way and they ripped us apart. We didn't step up and meet the challenge.""

**Sharks:** While the Sharks may have picked up one point in a 2-1 shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday, their offensive woes continue. The Sharks have scored more than two goals in a game only once in their previous 14 -- a 5-3 loss to Chicago on Feb. 5. Ryane Clowe, who has no goals and six assists in 17 games, returned to the lineup against the Red Wings after serving his two-game suspension for leaving the bench to start an altercation against the Blackhawks on Feb. 22. He took three shots in 14:43 of ice time on a line with Michal Handzus and Tim Kennedy. Clowe also was one of three San Jose shooters stopped by Detroit goalie Jonas Gustavsson in the shootout.

**Who's hot:** Wilson averaged a point per game in the month of February for the Predators, totaling 4 goals and 10 assists in 14 games. He leads the team with 15 points in 21 games this season. … San Jose captain Joe Thornton has a point in five straight games (one goal, four assists).

[Brian Hunter  - NHL.com Staff Writer](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011020117&amp;navid=DL|SJS|home)

A strong start to a lengthy road trip has the San Jose Sharks back on track.

The Nashville Predators hope the beginning of a three-game homestand and the possible return of two key players will help them do the same.

The Sharks look for a third consecutive victory Tuesday night when they face the Predators, who are searching for their first home win of the season.

San Jose (3-3-0) totaled four goals while dropping three in a row before opening a six-game trip by scoring four goals in each of the first two contests, victories at New Jersey and Boston. Joe Pavelski had a goal with an assist and Massachusetts native Benn Ferriero scored the game-winner in Saturday's 4-2 triumph over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Bruins.

The Sharks hope to remain perfect on the trip when they try for a third consecutive victory over Nashville (3-3-1), which snapped a four-game skid with a 2-0 win at Calgary on Saturday.

""(The Sharks are) always good,"" forward Jerred Smithson told the Predators' official website. ""They have a lot of skill and are a big team. They play physical if they want, but can also play the skill game. For us, we have to get our skating legs under us early, establish our forecheck, play tight defensively.""

The Predators prevailed against Calgary thanks mostly to 33 saves from Pekka Rinne. His strong effort came one game after he was pulled for allowing four goals on 16 shots in the first period of Thursday's 5-1 loss at Vancouver.

""When you need a win, Pekks is always the guy who can stand up and give you a real good performance,"" Predators coach Barry Trotz said.

Rinne is 3-1-3 with a 2.48 goals-against average versus San Jose.

Rinne may need to have another big night for the Predators to avoid dropping three straight home games to open a season for the first time since 2002-03. Nashville could also get a boost from the possible season debuts of forward Mike Fisher (shoulder) and defenseman Francis Bouillon (concussion).

""We can be a lot of better and we will be,"" Trotz said. ""Some of that poise and trust isn't quite there, but that will come.""

Fisher had eight goals and 11 assists in 39 regular season and playoff games last season after the Predators acquired him from Ottawa.

A concussion limited Bouillon to 44 games last season after he skated in all but one in 2009-10.

Sharks forward Ryane Clowe has a goal and two assists in his last two games, and one goal with five assists in eight career contests against the Predators. Pavelski, meanwhile, has one goal and one assist in each of his last two games but has been held without a point in three straight versus Nashville.

Since missing the season's first week to have a cyst removed, San Jose's Antti Niemi is 2-1-0 with a 2.63 GAA. Niemi, who made 37 saves against the Bruins, has stopped 53 of 56 shots while winning his last two starts versus Nashville.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020653)

**Season series:** Rubber match of three; each team has won at home.

**Big story:** The Minnesota Wild and San Jose Sharks are neck-and-neck in the Western Conference standings with aspirations for better. Each is within theoretical striking distance of their division leader, and either could fall out of the Stanley Cup Playoff picture just as easily. The Wild may have the bigger challenge because the Sharks have been virtually unbeatable at HP Pavilion, where they haven't lost in regulation since Feb. 5, a 10-0-4 stretch, their longest point streak since a record 31-game run from March 3, 2008-Jan. 13, 2009.

**Team Scope:**

**Wild:** It would be Minnesota's first playoff berth in four years, so pardon the Wild faithful if they're looking behind their team in the standings as well as ahead. The Wild had a successful run through Alberta to open their three-game trip, scoring a total of nine goals against the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames, compared to eight during their previous 1-5-1 slide.

""We went through a definite lull where we weren't playing the way we should, but as of late we are starting to find our game again,"" said forward Kyle Brodziak, who ended an 11-game goal-scoring drought with two in Edmonton on Tuesday.

**Sharks:** One reason San Jose can be confident down the stretch is goalie Antti Niemi, who has been in nets for all but two of the Sharks' home games this season and has a 1.76 goals-against average in the Shark Tank. He's tied for the NHL lead in wins (22) with Thursday opponent Niklas Backstrom and has had his name put out there as a Vezina Trophy candidate. Niemi is second to Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne in games (41-39) and has almost singlehandedly kept the Sharks in contention through an up-and-down season.

""He's been a real good workhorse for us,"" coach Todd McLellan said. ""There's been guys in the past who played 80 of 82 games in the League. So it's not uncommon for goaltenders to play a lot. We're only halfway through what would normally be a regular season. So he looks like he's got a lot of gas in the tank and is excited about playing.""

**Who's hot:** Backstrom logged his first shutout of the season against the Sharks on March 23. … Wild forwards Zach Parise and Pierre-Marc Bouchard, and defenseman Ryan Suter each have a three-game point streak.

[NHL PREVIEW](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020137&amp;navid=DL|SJS|home) 

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings between the teams. The Sharks went 2-1-1 against the Blackhawks in 2011-12.

**Big story:** It’s a showdown featuring currently the top two teams in the Western Conference. Chicago became the lone NHL squad without a regulation loss after San Jose suffered a 2-1 defeat at Anaheim on Monday night.

**Team scope:**

**Blackhawks:** Corey Crawford’s early-season performance (5-0-2, 1.66 goals-against average) has received a lot of attention from the media, and rightfully so. But Ray Emery was downright brilliant Saturday night, stopped 45 shots to help the Blackhawks record a 3-2 shootout win at Calgary.

""That was criminal,"" Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said of Emery’s performance. ""They've got to call the cops after that performance. He stole two points. He was spectacular. I've never ever been outplayed, out-chanced like that in my life.""

**Sharks:** Logan Couture notched his sixth goal of the season Monday night, but it wasn’t enough as San Jose suffered its first regulation loss to the Ducks at the Honda Center. The Sharks certainly had their chances to extend their points streak to nine games, but ended up going 0-for-6 on the power play.

“I thought that let us down tonight,” San Jose coach Todd McLellan said. “That was, and has been, and will be, a huge part of our team. We didn’t get it done six times. We had every opportunity to at least put two up on the board and we just didn’t do our thing.”

**Who’s hot:** Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane has 13 points (four goals, nine assists) in nine games, while Marian Hossa is 6-4-10. … Four Sharks have already reached double digits in scoring – Joe Thornton (3-11-14), Patrick Marleau (9-5-14), Joe Pavelski (4-8-12) and Logan Couture (6-5-11).

**Injury report:** Chicago has been playing without defenseman Michal Rozsival (lower body) and forward Daniel Carcillo (knee). Dave Bolland missed Saturday’s game at Calgary with a lower-body injury. … San Jose remains without defenseman Brent Burns, who is on injured reserve following offseason hernia surgery.

**Wings continue trip in San Jose**

[Tal Pinchevsky  - NHL.com Staff Writer](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2011020270&amp;navid=DL|SJS|home)

Last 10: Detroit 4-5-1; San Jose 7-2-1

**Season Series:** This is the second of four meetings between two of the Western Conference's premier teams. They played in Detroit on Oct. 28, a game in which San Jose captain Joe Thornton scored two goals, including the game-winner, in a 4-2 win.

**Big Story:** While neither team is perched atop the Western Conference, they've both showed flashes of the play that has made them two of the NHL's marquee franchises over the past decade. Detroit undid the damage of an uncharacteristic six-game losing streak with four straight wins before Tuesday's 2-1 loss in St. Louis, and the Sharks' early-season five-game win streak has them near the top of the ultra-competitive Pacific Division.

**Team Scope:**

**Red Wings:** The lengthy skid the Red Wings experienced early in the season had fans fearing that Detroit would lose seven straight for the first time in more than two decades. The last Wings team to do it, the 1990-91 club, finished the season with a sub-500 record. However, the Wings snapped the six-game losing streak with a convincing 5-0 win against Anaheim on Nov. 5 before proceeding to win their next three games. The Wings looked to make it five wins in a row on Tuesday in St. Louis, but the Blues had other plans, outshooting Detroit 30-13 after the first period.

""Our performance tonight was unacceptable,"" said Niklas Kronwall, who played 21:59 despite being hurt on a check from behind by Chris Stewart, who subsequently earned a three-game suspension for the hit. ""We're losing way too many battles, made too many mistakes. Our power play wasn't good enough. We had some chances. We just have to bear down.""

**Sharks:** An early five-game win streak had the Sharks showing the form that put them in the Conference Final each of the last two seasons. A 5-2 loss at Madison Square Garden on Halloween snapped the streak, but San Jose rebounded nicely by going 3-0-1 in their next four games. Playing their fourth in a five-game homestand, the Sharks hoped to continue that run on Saturday against the Coyotes.

Against the Sharks, Radim Vrbata and Boyd Gordon gave Phoenix a 2-0 lead before the game was 20 minutes old. The Sharks outshot the Coyotes 24-12 in the next two periods, but failed to get a shot past Mike Smith, who stopped 31 shots to earn a 3-0 win, his first shutout of the season. ""It was a bad start,"" San Jose forward Ryane Clowe said. ""Bang, bang the first period is over and we're down 2-0. It was uphill from there.""

**Who's Hot:** For the Wings, Drew Miller is enjoying a three-game point streak in which he has three points while captain Nicklas Lidstrom has eight points in his last nine games and Valtteri Filppula has six in his last five games. … San Jose's Patrick Marleau has five points in his last three games and Dan Boyle has seven points in his last seven games.

**Injury Report:** Defenseman Ian White is out for the Wings with a broken cheekbone while Todd Bertuzzi is on IR with a sinus infection that has caused dizziness. … The Sharks are not missing any major pieces of their roster.

**Stat Pack:** The Sharks and Red Wings have cultivated quite a rivalry over the past two playoff seasons. The two teams have played 12 playoff games, with the Sharks winning eight, over the past two playoff years. Only the Canucks and Blackhawks, with 13 matchups, have competed in more playoff games in that span.

**Puck Drop:** With every game played, Lidstrom continues to climb the all-time games played list. Five more games and he will pass his former teammate, Steve Yzerman, for 13th on the all-time list. After that, he'll be 10 games short of another former teammate, Brendan Shanahan.

Last 10: Los Angeles 5-3-2; San Jose 6-3-1

**Season series:** This is the first of six meetings between these Pacific Division rivals. The Sharks took the 2010-11 season series with a 3-1-2 record, winning twice in the shootout.

**Big Story:** Neither team is playing its best hockey right now with the Kings going winless in their last four games and the Sharks dropping two of their last three games. San Jose aims to pull even on their home record after beginning the season at 2-3-0, while Los Angeles will attempt to get back on the winning side of things as it has currently dropped its last two road games.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** While Los Angeles has managed to gain at least a point in three of its last five games, it hasn't exactly been a very successful stretch recently. The Kings' most recent game saw them surrender a 2-1 lead with just under three minutes to play in regulation and eventually lose to the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins in the shootout this past Saturday. 

While Anze Kopitar continued his strong play as the center on the Kings' first line with a goal, assist and a plus-2 rating against Pittsburgh, it wasn't enough to get his team the much-needed two points in the standings.

""If we play like that, I like our chances in each and every game. We had a couple chances in the third and in OT but we couldn't score there. It didn't go our way tonight,"" Kopitar told Kings' reporter Rich Hammond.

**Sharks:** San Jose has been impressive after regulation this season, going 3-1 in the overtime and shootout, but Saturday's 4-3 loss in overtime to the visiting Predators was a game that it would rather have back. The Sharks gave up a 3-1 third-period lead and eventually fell after the Preds' David Legwand tallied midway through overtime.

The Sharks started the game dominating on mostly all angles and outshooting Nashville 19-7 in the first period. But the strong effort resulted in a scoreless opening period and San Jose struggled to keep up the momentum throughout the rest of the game.

""Sometimes when you focus on the start as much as we did, we got it,"" coach Todd McLellan told NHL.com following the game. ""But the back end of our game wasn't what we wanted. So, we're trying to find a full 60 minutes from our guys.""

**Who's Hot:** Kopitar has 3 goals and 6 points for the Kings in scoring in four of his last five games. … For the Sharks, Joe Pavelski notched a goal and an assist in Saturday's loss and has managed at least a point in seven of his last eight games.

**Injury Report:** Kings forward Colin Fraser remains day-to-day with a foot injury. … Goalies Antero Niittymaki (hip) and Alex Stalock (knee) and forward Frazer McLaren (hip) are on injured reserve for San Jose.
 
**Stat Pack:** The Kings' scoring touch has been misplaced nearly all season long as they have scored two or fewer regulation goals in 11 of their first 13 games.

**Puck Drop:** The Kings players are aware that they need to pick up their scoring pace quickly, but panic hasn't set in just yet.

""This team is good enough that it's going to come around for us. Guys are going to start scoring goals,"" defenseman Matt Greene told losangeleskings.com following Saturday's loss. ""It's going to happen sooner or later by sticking with the system and doing what we do, cycling the puck, and getting chances is how it's going to happen.""

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020631)

**Season series:** The San Jose Sharks have won two of three against the Phoenix Coyotes this season. Each of the past two matchups has gone to a shootout, with the clubs splitting them.

**Big story:** The Coyotes, who currently sit four points shy of eighth place in the Western Conference, need a win -- but the Sharks are also still trying to cement their place in the top eight.

**Team scope:**

**Sharks:** San Jose won seven straight games to storm into contention for the No. 4 seed in the West, including victories against Detroit, Minnesota and Vancouver (teams also potentially vying for fourth), but the Sharks have slipped since the streak. They have lost three of four (1-2-1) and are in danger of slipping to the seventh or eighth seed, which would likely mean a first-round matchup with either the Chicago Blackhawks or the Anaheim Ducks.

""We can't get too high, we can't get too low,"" coach Todd McLellan told reporters. ""We've got to play every minute of all 60 as hard as we can. I thought that was probably our downfall [in a 2-1 loss to Dallas on Saturday night]. We probably gave away 13 or 14 minutes of valuable time and it cost us.""

**Coyotes:** Like the Sharks, the Coyotes were on a roll after the first week of April. Points in six straight games (4-0-2) had Phoenix two points shy of eighth in the West and alone in ninth place. A three-game trip to Western Canada produced only three of six possible points, and the Coyotes have slipped to 11th in the conference. Six of the Coyotes' final seven games are against teams ahead of them in the standings, including another matchup at home against San Jose on the 24th.

""That was obviously big to get a point, but not good enough, we need to get two,"" captain Shane Doan told reporters after the loss to Calgary on Friday night. ""You have to try and stay within striking distance.""

**Who's hot:** San Jose hasn't been scoring a lot of late, but goaltender Antti Niemi has won eight of his past 11 appearances and yielded two goals or fewer in eight of his past 10 starts.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020601)

**Season series:** This is the third and final meeting of the regular season. They split the first two matchups, with the Sharks winning 2-0 on March 28 after falling 2-1 in the shootout exactly one month earlier.

**Big story:** With fourth and 13th place in the Western Conference separated by just 10 points, the Sharks and Red Wings are in the thick of a cluttered playoff push. San Jose held fifth place in the conference entering Wednesday's play, while Detroit has dropped four of their last six and are holding on to the eighth and final playoff spot in the West.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Following a perfect 7-0-0 record in January, the Sharks went 6-11-6 through February and most of March, causing speculation that the team's run of eight straight playoff berths could end. But San Jose rebounded nicely with a seven-game win streak that started late last month.

That streak ended with a 5-4 shootout loss to Dallas on Sunday, which was followed by a four-game road swing that started Tuesday night in Columbus.

Against the Blue Jackets, the Sharks appeared overmatched against a squad that made headlines at the Trade Deadline for acquiring star wing Marian Gaborik from the New York Rangers. Matt Calvert opened the scoring midway through the first period and Columbus widened the gap in the middle frame as James Wisniewski and Ryan Johansen scored just 1:46 apart.

After assisting on Johansen's marker, Gaborik added a goal in the third following some pretty passing courtesy of former Rangers teammate Artem Anisimov. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 30 shots for Columbus to secure the 4-0 shutout win and hand the Sharks their first losing streak in almost a month.

**Red Wings:** A 5-1-0 stretch last month put the Red Wings in a favorable position heading into the late-season playoff push. But they've gone 2-4-0 since then, combining for just nine goals in that span and putting their incredible streak of 21 straight postseason appearances in jeopardy. Heading in to Wednesday night's action, Detroit was just two points ahead of Dallas and Columbus, which had played one extra game.

A big divisional win on Sunday against the St. Louis Blues would have helped the Red Wings' cause. But Chris Porter scored the game's only goal and the Red Wings failed to beat Brian Elliott as they suffered a 1-0 defeat and were shut out for the second time in a week despite holding a 28-25 shot advantage.

""I liked our game,"" coach Mike Babcock said. ""If we just keep doing the things we did today and keep working hard, things will go our way.""

**Who's hot:** Brent Burns has eight points in his past nine games for the Sharks, while TJ Galiardi has three points in his past four games. … For the Wings, Gustav Nyquist has three points in his past four games while Henrik Zetterberg has eight points in his past 10 games.

**Season series:** This is the second of three meetings. The Sharks blanked the Avalanche 4-0 in their first contest on Jan. 26.

**Big story:** Both the Avalanche and Sharks are desperate for a win after struggling to gain points in the standings over the last few weeks.

**Team Scope:**

**Avalanche:** Colorado currently sits at the bottom of the Northwest Division standings with 16 points in 17 games played. The Avalanche are coming off of two consecutive losses, including a 4-3 overtime loss to the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday despite boasting a 2-0 lead in the first period.

""Right now, our focus is trying to gain points,"" coach Joe Sacco said. ""Unfortunately, we fell short on picking up the second one.""

**Sharks:** The Sharks will be without forward Ryane Clowe for the next two games as the forward was suspended for coming off the bench to initiate an altercation with Chicago's Andrew Shaw on Feb. 22. The Sharks are looking to break out of a funk that started at the beginning of February, which has seen them notch just one victory in their last 10 games. They’ve been outscored 25-12 in that span.

""[Saturday was] more of the same. Pretty good effort, but you can't take consolation in that,"" San Jose coach Todd McLellan said. ""You have to put points in the bank, and we're not doing it right now. You can't win games scoring one goal.”

**Who's hot:** PA Parenteau has four points in the past four games and is Colorado’s leading goal-scorer this season with eight tallies. … Patrick Marleau boasts a team-best 12 goals so far this season and has three points in his last three games.

**Injury report:** Erik Johnson (head) and Ryan Wilson (leg) remain out indefinitely for Colorado. … For San Jose, defenseman Brent Burns is day-to-day.

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings. The Sharks won three of four against the Blue Jackets in 2011-12.

**Big story:** Both teams will be looking to get back on track in this one – San Jose enters with a four-game winless skid (0-2-2), while Columbus has won only three of its first 12 games this season.

**Team scope:**

**Sharks:** What happened to San Jose’s offense?

The Sharks are coming off a 1-0 shootout loss on home ice against Phoenix on Saturday afternoon, as Antti Niemi was outdueled by Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith. Four of the Sharks’ last six contests have gone to shootouts, and their inability to win those games has them now looking up to the Anaheim Ducks in the Pacific Division.

Monday marks the beginning of a six-game road trip.

""We still need to bear down around the net, but there are things we can build upon heading out on the road,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said after Saturday’s defeat. ""We feel comfortable playing this type of game, but unfortunately we lost in a shootout.""

Thornton and winger Patrick Marleau have each gone five games without a point. They’re still tied for the team lead in scoring with 14 points apiece.

**Blue Jackets:** Columbus suffered its third straight loss Sunday night, although it certainly wasn’t due to a lack of effort. The Blue Jackets peppered Devan Dubnyk with 40 shots, only to be on the losing end of a 3-1 decision against the Edmonton Oilers at Nationwide Arena.

The Jackets outshot the Oilers 40-14, including 15-3 in the third period.

“We probably should have had 10 goals tonight,” Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson said. “You only score one goal, you’re not going to win many hockey games. That’s the most frustrating part, is the offense giving ourselves a chance to win. You’re probably going to have to score three, four goals every night to win. Otherwise, our poor goalies have to pitch a shutout every night. That’s just unrealistic to ask.”

**Who’s hot:** San Jose has killed off 34 straight power plays. … Columbus defenseman Fedor Tyutin has four assists in his last four games.

**Injury report:** Columbus will be missing defenseman Adrian Aucoin (lower body) and forward Cam Atkinson (lower body). Defenseman John Moore (lower body) did not play Sunday.

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings this season between these teams. San Jose went 3-0-1 last season against Colorado, with the duo of Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau combining for four goals and seven assists in those four games.

**Big story:** Both of these Western Conference teams are off to promising starts in this compacted NHL season. Following an opening-night loss in Minnesota, Colorado has outscored the competition 7-1 in its last two contests while San Jose appears to be a juggernaut early on, netting 15 goals in their first three games.

**Team Scope:**

**Avalanche:** After back-to-back wins at home, Colorado is embarking on a season-long four-game road swing that starts Saturday afternoon in San Jose. The Avalanche will be starting the trip on something of a hot streak after defeating the defending champion Kings 3-1 on Tuesday before dismantling the Blue Jackets two nights later.

They wasted little time against Columbus on Thursday, with PA Parenteau opening the scoring just 51 seconds into the game. Matt Duchene contributed his first two goals of the season and Semyon Varlamov stopped 33 shots for the shutout in the Avalanche's 4-0 victory. But much of the talk following the game swirled around John Mitchell, who required stitches after taking a puck to the face before returning to notch his second goal of the season.

""It could have been a lot worse if it had been in the teeth or an eyeball,"" Mitchell said of the errant shot. ""The forehead is a pretty thick bone, I guess.""

**Sharks:** San Jose might not be too popular a team in the province of Alberta. After opening the season with a 4-1 win in Calgary, the Sharks crashed the Oilers' home opener by scoring a remarkable six goals in the opening period on their way to a 6-3 victory.

That hot play continued Thursday night in San Jose, where the Sharks opened a six-game homestand against Phoenix. The Coyotes appeared to have a stranglehold on the match when Lauri Korpikoski's goal gave Phoenix a 3-1 lead 7:28 into the final period. But the Sharks rattled off four unanswered goals, with Marleau and Thornton combining for three goals and three assists in that span to give San Jose a 5-3 win.

**Who's hot:** Following an injury-plagued 2011-12 season in which he was limited to 58 games, Duchene is off to a strong start with four points in his last two games. Parenteau has goals in consecutive games while Varlamov's .948 save percentage and 1.68 goals-against average rank among the best in the League. … For the Sharks, there might not be a hotter tandem in the NHL than Marleau and Thornton, who ranked first in the League in goals and assists respectively heading into Friday's action. Joe Pavelski and Logan Couture have kept pace, notching seven points apiece in three games.

**Injury report:** The glaring omission on the Avalanche roster will be winger Steve Downie, who is lost for the season following knee surgery. … The Sharks are missing defensemen Brent Burns (hernia surgery) and Jason Demers (wrist).

**Big story:** In the first round, the Los Angeles Kings had to rally from a 2-0 deficit to advance. Now they're in position to do what the 2012 championship team did for four consecutive rounds: jump out to a 3-0 series lead, if they can defeat the San Jose Sharks at HP Pavilion. The Kings have won six in a row following their stunning 4-3 come-from-behind victory on Thursday.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** It has to be scary for opponents that Los Angeles is now winning games in just about every fashion imaginable. After relying on goaltender Jonathan Quick to come up huge in the third period of a 2-0 victory in the series opener, the Kings surrendered an early 2-0 lead built on goals by Jeff Carter and Drew Doughty, and trailed Game 2 by a 3-2 score late into the third period.

A two-man advantage after penalties to Sharks defensemen Brad Stuart and Marc-Edouard Vlasic quickly resulted in the game-tying power-play goal by Dustin Brown with 1:43 left. But the Kings weren't content to just head to overtime with a 5-on-4 man advantage. As a result, they got Trevor Lewis' game-winning goal 22 seconds later.

""I've said this before, experience is one thing and it's another thing to have all that experience together as a group of guys, because that goes a long way when you get yourself in a hole,"" Brown said. ""We didn't play a great game tonight, but we found a way to win and that's the important thing. We've got to get back to playing our game if we want to continue to have success against the Sharks.""

**Sharks:** The news came down a few hours before game time Thursday that San Jose will be playing the remainder of this series without forward Raffi Torres, suspended for a Game 1 hit on Jarret Stoll. If the Sharks can't find a way to win Saturday, the rest of the players on the team may find themselves with a lot of extra free time on their hands as well.

They had to be feeling good after absorbing the blow of another two-goal Kings lead and rallying to tie in the second period on scores by Patrick Marleau and Stuart before Vlasic put them in front for the first time in the series at 8:56 of the third. But the goals by Stuart and Vlasic took a backseat to the critical penalties they would take in the final minutes.

""It's a tough loss regardless,"" forward Joe Pavelski said. ""We know we can break through. We have done it before. We know we're going to get our chances, and we did, and we could have had another one. It was just a tough way to lose it.""

**Who's hot:** Carter and Mike Richards lead the Kings in scoring for the series with one goal and two assists each. Lewis, who doesn't have a power-play goal in 203 career regular-season games, now has three in 34 playoff games. … Marleau has a goal in five of the Sharks' six playoff games. Scott Gomez picked up a pair of assists in Game 2 for his first points of the postseason.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020570)

**Season series:** The Dallas Stars won the first meeting of the season in February. The teams see each other three times in a 17-day span before the end of the season.

**Big story:** While the Stars are trying to stay on the fringe of the Stanley Cup Playoff race, the San Jose Sharks have surged and are looking for an eighth straight victory.

**Team Scope:**

**Stars:** Dallas entered Saturday five points out of eighth place with 11 games to play. Winning eight of the final 11 is probably the minimum requirement to steal a spot in the playoffs, and even that could leave the Stars a point or two shy.

The Stars were clearly sellers at the NHL Trade Deadline, moving three critical forwards -- Jaromir Jagr, Derek Roy and Brendan Morrow -- for futures. If Dallas is going to make a playoff push, goaltender Kari Lehtonen and top forwards Jamie Benn and Ray Whitney need to produce superstar efforts.

**Sharks:** What a roller-coaster short season it has been in San Jose. After starting 7-0-0, the Sharks lost 17 of the next 23. When the Minnesota Wild defeated them 2-0 on March 23, the Sharks were 13-11-6 and sitting outside the top eight in the Western Conference.

General manager Doug Wilson made a pair of trades, unloading veteran forward Ryane Clowe and defenseman Douglas Murray for draft picks, while the team has rallied with seven straight victories.

The Sharks entered Saturday in fourth place in the West, but this is the final game before a four-game road trip. They are seven points clear of ninth place and appear safe to earn a playoff berth, but are four up on eighth with six of the final 10 games away from home.

**Who's hot:** The Stars have five goals in the past three games, and forward Vernon Fiddler has an assist on three of them. ... Sharks forward Joe Pavelski has five goals, and he, Joe Thornton and Brent Burns have seven points each during the seven-game win streak.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020558)

**Season series:** Final and deciding match of the three-game series, the first two at the Scotiabank Saddledome were split by 4-1 scores.

**Big story:** Two teams going in different directions. The San Jose Sharks extended their winning streak to six on Wednesday with a 4-2 win over the Minnesota Wild and snuck past the Los Angeles Kings for the fifth seed in the Western Conference, all while making adjustments to their roster at the NHL Trade Deadline. The Sharks shipped Ryane Clowe to the New York Rangers and replaced him by trading for Raffi Torres, and picked up some defensive help by reacquiring Scott Hannan.

The Calgary Flames are in full rebuilding mode, sending Jarome Iginla to the Pittsburgh Penguins, Jay Bouwmeester to the St. Louis Blues and Blake Comeau to the Columbus Blue Jackets prior to Wednesday afternoon's deadline.

**Team Scope:**

**Flames:** Calgary certainly looks like a rebuilding team -- and then some. The provincial rival Edmonton Oilers came to town looking to pick up a couple of points, just not as easily as it turned out. The Flames opened an early lead but the Oilers proceeded to torch them by an 8-2 score that got Calgary thinking about how it wanted to finish the season.

""You guys think we just sit in here and put our head down and go home,"" Matt Stajan said to the Flames website. ""Trust me, we talk about it. Last night wasn't acceptable. We talked about it. The last few games haven't been acceptable. It's on us to change it. Talk as much as you want, we said what needs to be said and now it's on us to turn it around. We've had a tough time on the road and it's a great place for us to get a better feeling in this dressing room.""

**Sharks:** Torres has two significant hits to Sharks players to his credit. While with the Oilers in 2006, he took an open-ice run at Milan Michalek that helped turn a 2-0 Sharks lead into a 4-2 second-round Stanley Cup Playoff series loss. Five years later in a Vancouver Canucks uniform, Torres laid a shoulder-separating blow on Joe Thornton that hurt the Sharks' chances in the 2011 Western Conference Finals. For Thornton, it pays to have a short memory, and if fans anticipated a confrontation when Torres entered the dressing room, it just wasn't happening.

""Oh no,"" Thornton told the San Jose Mercury News. ""I don't think too many guys know him too much so it's just kind of like, 'Hey how are you? My name's Joe. Nice to meet you, Raffi.' ""

Torres said, ""What happens on the ice, stays on the ice -- and it's a different model when you're in the room and now you're part of the team. Hopefully we can put that stuff behind us and look to the future.""

**Who's hot:** Stajan scored both Flames goals Wednesday and has three points in the past three games. … Thornton extended his points streak to four games with back-to-back goal-and-assist performances. Goalie Antti Niemi extended his personal winning streak to six games and he's allowed nine goals over the stretch, none on the power play.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020401)

**Season series:** This is the first of four meetings, with the second Saturday. The Sharks won four of six meetings against the Kings last season, with three victories going past regulation.

**Big story:** Los Angeles hasn't lost two games in a row since Feb. 7-10; San Jose has two regulation wins since Jan. 31. Despite that, the teams are separated by two points in the Western Conference standings, with the Kings holding a 30-28 edge.

**Team Scope:**

**Kings:** Los Angeles has gone 11-4-0 since starting the season with three wins in 10 games.

""I think it's important for us to realize that we got off to a rough start and we've been playing better hockey as of late,"" forward Dustin Brown said, according to The Associated Press. ""But if you look at the standings, any night you're not getting points, you're falling. That's just the nature of the Western Conference and the shortened season.""

The Kings have played five games within the Pacific Division, going 2-3-0, including a 5-2 loss at Phoenix on Tuesday that ended a stretch of three games in four nights after another of four in six.

Los Angeles plays five more division games in the next eight days.

""The next [few] days are going to be pretty important to this group,"" Brown told the Los Angeles Times. ""That's where you can really separate yourself from the pack.""

**Sharks:** San Jose's recent troubles have not seeped into HP Pavilion, where the Sharks are 7-1-4 this season. But this is the last home game before a five-game road trip that begins at Staples Center and includes two games against the Pacific Division-leading Anaheim Ducks.

""At the end of the day, you've got to win games,"" defenseman Dan Boyle told the San Jose Mercury News. ""People don't remember how you played game 12, game 18, game 19 -- they just remember if it was a win or a loss and we've got to find a way to win hockey games.""

San Jose outshot the St. Louis Blues 41-21 Tuesday but lost 4-2.

""I thought it was one of our most complete games of the year,"" forward Joe Thornton said, according to the AP. ""If we continue to play like that we're going to win a lot of games.""

Tuesday marked the return of Brent Burns, who missed seven games with a leg injury after sitting out the first 10 games of the season following offseason sports hernia surgery. Burns, usually a defenseman, was used as a wing, scored a goal, and wound up playing some on the top line alongside Thornton and Patrick Marleau.

""I saw what I expected from him. I've seen it before,"" coach Todd McLellan said to CSN Bay Area. ""He provided us size, speed and a shot up front. Played the game with -- I don’t want to say a reckless abandon -- but he played using his body, and attacked. I thought he provided our team a lot of energy. That was as good as we've been attacking in a long time, against a very good defensive team.""

**Who's hot:** Kings defenseman Slava Voynov has nine points in his past six games. Defenseman Jake Muzzin has seven points in his past five. … Sharks forward Scott Gomez has four points in his past five games. Defenseman Matt Irwin has three points in his past three games after getting two in his first 13. Goalie Antti Niemi is 3-1-0 with a 2.11 goals-against average in five home starts against the Kings.

[Brian Compton - NHL.com Deputy Managing Editor](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020230)

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings. They last met in the 2012 Western Conference Quarterfinals, a series that the Blues won in five games.

**Big story:** Behind rookie goaltender Jake Allen, the Blues return home after going 3-0 on their recent road trip, earning victories in Detroit, Calgary and Vancouver. Meanwhile, their opponent Tuesday night has yet to win February, as the Sharks are 0-4-3 this month. It’s their longest losing streak since an 0-7-3 funk from Nov. 5-30, 2005.

**Team scope:**

**Sharks:** The woes continued for San Jose on Friday night, when it suffered a 4-1 loss against the red-hot Chicago Blackhawks. Tim Kennedy had the lone goal for the Sharks, who are only halfway through their six-game road trip.

""We just have to keep working,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said. ""We'll work our way out of this and that's all we can do. It's tough, but we have a lot of veterans here.""

**Blues:** With Jaroslav Halak injured (groin) and Brian Elliott struggling mightily (.849 save percentage), Allen has been a godsend for the Blues. He had a 2.58 goals-against average on the road trip and made 28 saves in Sunday’s 4-3 shootout win against the Canucks.

With Halak now healthy, it’s up to Blues coach Ken Hitchcock to find playing time for both – and he says he will. St. Louis will visit Colorado on Wednesday night.

""(Allen) has really helped stabilize us,"" Hitchcock said. ""He's just a solid guy. There's no holes in his game. It's a big step for us.""

**Who’s hot:** Even with Friday’s performance (four goals on 37 shots), Sharks netminder Antti Niemi has still only allowed five goals in his past three appearances. He’s boasting a 1.94 GAA and .930 save percentage in 11 games this season. … Blues winger Alexander Steen has four goals and eight points over the past five games.

**Injury report:** Sharks forwards Andrew Desjardins and James Sheppard are on injured reserve. … Blues winger Jamie Langenbrunner (hip) is out for the season.

The strangest part of the game occurred after one of my teammates took a penalty and couldn't find the penalty box.  At our regular facility the penalty boxes are between the benches on all four rinks, but at the Tank they are located on the opposite side of the ice.  
  
The ice was terrible, though, as the Zamboni driver didn't shave the ice much.  We played the second game of the day and the ice was already heavily sliced and marked.  
  
The best part?  I got a shutout!  The not-so-best part?  We didn't win.  Seriously, we ended up with a rare beer league 0-0 tie.

This will also help to consolidate all the trade posts into one neat discussion.  

I've had a couple different ideas for the Sharks.  First is this line up which I posted in a different thread. This roster doesn't make many significant changes except for signing Michael Ryder.  Its also a good one because the extra cap saved in the 2013-14 season will allow the Sharks to re-sign Couture, Thornton, Marleau, Pavelski and Boyle.  Call me a homer but I want to see Marleau retire as a Shark.  Hopefully those guys will take a hometown discount as they have in seasons past to help save a bit.

1) Buyout Martin Havlat using the amnesty buyout.

2) Re-sign: TJ Galiardi, Raffi Torres, James Sheppard, Tim Kennedy (send him to the jr Sharks for development time and to help them out with the scoring), and Andrew Desjardins.  Let Gomez, Hannan, and Demers go.

3) Sign UFA Michael Ryder to replace Martin Havlat on the 2nd line right wing.

--------

If miracles could happen I would have the Sharks look like this next season. This lineup is dependent on whether Toronto re-signs Clarke MacArthur...if they don't I think he would look pretty damn good on Jumbo's left wing.  This line up spends to the limit for sure but damn it looks good on paper.  The only problem is that it doesn't leave much to re-sign players in two seasons but this is a balls to the wall line up so lets not worry about that for now.

1) Buyout Martin Havlat using amnesty buyout.

2) 2) Re-sign: TJ Galiardi, Raffi Torres, Tim Kennedy (send him to the jr Sharks for development time and to help them out with the scoring), and Andrew Desjardins.  Let Gomez, Hannan, Demers, and Sheppard go.

3) Sign UFA Michael Ryder to replace Martin Havlat on the 2nd line right wing.

4) Sign UFA Clarke MacArthur to play on Joe Thorntons left wing.

^◄ If possible trade Burish to free up a little cap.  Move Wingels to 4th line and Galiardi to 3rd if he is traded.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020618)

**Season series:** This is the third of four meetings, with the last April 23 at HP Pavilion. The Dallas Stars won the first two, 3-1 on Feb. 23 and 5-4 in a shootout on Sunday.

**Big story:** On March 20, the San Jose Sharks were in eighth place in the Western Conference, tied with two teams slotted below them at 30 points. Now they can chase home-ice advantage in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs -- they enter Saturday trailing the fourth-place Los Angeles Kings by one point with a game in hand, and are six points clear of ninth place.

""I don't think there's any comfort in a seven- or an eight-point lead right now,"" coach Todd McLellan told CSN Bay Area on Thursday. ""Four or five games from now, if you still have it, I think that's the big thing. So right now the focus is just winning to solidify a [playoff] spot, and as we move on, if we're lucky enough, we'll start taking about home ice.""

Dallas, after a 5-2 road win against the Nashville Predators on Friday, are among a group of five teams with 46 to 43 points battling for seventh and eighth place in the West.

""We're not getting too far ahead of ourselves,"" Stars coach Glen Gulutzan told Fox Sports Southwest. ""Every day is a battle and every game day we're focused. We're just trying to claw our way into one of those top eight spots.""

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Prior to the NHL Trade Deadline on April 3, San Jose parted with forwards Ryane Clowe and Michal Handzus and defenseman Douglas Murray, all of whom were at least 6-foot-2 and at least 215 pounds. Starting with the trade of Murray on March 25, the Sharks are 8-1-1.

""We're playing with a little more speed, a little more tempo, we're getting pucks up the ice a little bit quicker, spending less time in our zone, more time in the other team's zone,"" McLellan said. ""I'm not sure if that's completely due to the change as far as personnel, or the change in mindset that we need to play a certain way and everybody buying into it.""

San Jose is 7-4 in shootouts, including a 3-2 win against the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday. Forward Logan Couture has scored on four of five attempts.

""I think the big thing with those is just confidence, go in knowing that you're going to score, and be confident in the move you're going to do,"" Couture said.

**Stars:** Dallas also changed its makeup before the deadline, trading forwards Jaromir Jagr, Brenden Morrow, Derek Roy and Michael Ryder. The Stars have won all four games after April 3, outscoring their opponents 18-8.

""The last couple weeks the guys have felt that people have written them off and we haven't liked that very much,"" Gulutzan said. ""And we just keep playing for each other in that locker room.""

Rookie Alex Chiasson (five goals in his first five NHL games) and veteran Vernon Fiddler (nine points in five games after six in 33) have made unexpected contributions.

""It just seems like everybody's pulling on the same rope, and it seems like we're firing on all cylinders,"" Fiddler said.

Goalie Richard Bachman played against Nashville in place of Kari Lehtonen (groin) Friday and made 26 saves in his first start since Feb. 26.

""I think right now, at this time of the year, no matter what it is, a back-to-back or a three-in-three, you get yourself up and you get ready to play, because it's life or death for us right now,"" Bachman said. ""No matter what it is you have to come ready to play.""

**Who's hot:** Sharks forward Brent Burns has eight points in his past 10 games. Couture has five points in his past five games. … Stars forward Ray Whitney has six points in his past three games, 22 in 24 games played this season.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020516)

**Season Series:** It's been a split so far, each taking a game at the Shark Tank. They'll play this one in HP Pavilion again then go to Glendale twice in April.

**Big story:** Now that the Coyotes have blasted their way out of a near-fatal seven-game slump, the object is to string a few more wins together and regain some ground in the Western Conference playoff race. The Sharks are one of the fortunate teams above the cutoff line, and back-to-back shutouts by Antti Niemi have helped keep them there, but there is not much room for error as seven points separate fifth from 13th place in the standings going into Friday's action. This is the third of a crucial seven-game homestand for San Jose.

**Team Scope:**

**Coyotes:** With their six-goal first period in a 7-4 win at Nashville on Thursday, not only did the Coyotes tie a franchise record set in 1999 and send Vezina Trophy finalist Pekka Rinne to the bench in less than four minutes, they snapped out of a funk that had seen them score just eight goals in an 0-6-1 slide.

""Whatever it takes; if it takes seven goals to win, that's what we need right now,"" said Radim Vrbata, who scored two of the six first-period goals. ""It was a crazy first period. That's not our style of play. I'm sure that's not theirs either, but we will take whatever we can get.""

**Sharks:** While the Coyotes caught fire offensively Thursday night, Niemi was busy extinguishing Detroit's three-game winning streak. For the third time in his career, he posted a second straight shutout as the Sharks beat the Red Wings 2-0 at HP Pavilion. It was the first time in his career and the first time in franchise history that a goaltender had posted shutouts on successive nights.

""I felt good after last night,"" said Niemi, who had 27 saves in the win, the Sharks' third straight -- their most since winning seven in a row to open the season. ""I thought I was able to be real patient and wait for the pucks and then react. I wasn't cheating or expecting anything else. I was just reading the play. That's a confidence thing for sure.""

**Who's hot:** Coyotes defenseman Rostislav Klesla's four assists in that six-goal first period Thursday ties yet another franchise record for points in a single period and matches his career single-game high. Keith Yandle's goal gave him points in three straight games and four of five, while David Moss' goal also extended his point streak to three games. … Joe Pavelski's goal on Thursday made it three games in a row with at least one. Brent Burns scored the other goal and has a similar three-game goal-scoring streak.

**Season series:** It's the second of three meetings this season. Detroit beat San Jose 2-1 in a shootout at the Shark Tank on Feb. 28. They meet again in Detroit on April 11.

**Big story:** Two teams that are starting to put it together try to extend winning streaks fueled by victories against Anaheim. The Red Wings complete a four-game trip that included two wins in Anaheim before Monday night's 3-2 victory at Phoenix. The Sharks completed a home-and-home sweep of the Ducks on Wednesday with a solid 4-0 victory at home.

**Team Scope:**

**Red Wings:** It took a long time, but the power play has finally figured out how to score away from the friendly confines of Joe Louis Arena. The winning goal in the victory at Phoenix came with the extra man, and the Red Wings have scored a power-play goal in six consecutive road games -- after startong the season 0-for-37 away from home.

Our specialty teams in the first 10 games were awful, both the power play and the penalty kill,'' coach Mike Babcock said Wednesday. ""We had a change in staff (Tom Renney joined the Wings as an assistant when Jeff Blashill became coach at Grand Rapids, their top farm team). We also have a bunch of different players. So when you put it all together it takes some time.

""I thought it was coming on, but it never really went in the net for us and now it's going in the net.''

**Sharks:** There were smiles all around after San Jose gave a full 60-minute effort to complete the home-and-home sweep of Anaheim. Joe Pavelski scored 60 seconds after the opening faceoff, Tommy Wingels had a goal and two assists, the defense limited the Ducks to 22 shots and Antti Niemi stopped them all. The Sharks led 3-0 and never looked back.

""We knew we had to get after them right from the start,"" coach Todd McLellan said. ""I think that first shift Pavelski had set the tone for the next 10 minutes and we took advantage of it.""

**Who's hot:** Detroit's Pavel Datsyuk scored the winning goal against Phoenix and has five points in the first three games of the trip. Johan Franzen has two goals and four points in those three games. … Joe Pavelski had goals in both games against the Ducks.

**Season series:** This is the third of five meetings. The teams have split the first two games, with each team winning its game on home ice.

**Big story:** One team is running away with the Pacific Division, while the other is fighting simply to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Bruce Boudreau’s Ducks have lost only three times in regulation all season, while Todd McLellan’s Sharks are still trying to find consistency.

**Team scope:**

**Sharks:** McLellan was livid after his club’s most recent performance – a 5-2 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday. San Jose is 1-3-2 in its past six outings and has been outscored 16-7 in the past four.

Saturday’s loss meant the Sharks had to settle for a split of their home-and-home series with the Kings after they beat the defending Stanley Cup champs 4-3 on Thursday at HP Pavilion.

""How frigging disappointing is that?"" McLellan said after Saturday’s loss. ""We play against the Stanley Cup champions back-to-back. We're lucky enough to win one in San Jose. We come here and you got to think they'd to be champing at the bit and be ready to go, and they're going to push you, and what a great opportunity for our team to test themselves collectively, but also individually: Do I belong in the NHL? When I look across, can I outplay the guy that I line up against? We had a lot of passengers. So disappointing. So disappointing.""

**Ducks:** Anaheim returns to the Honda Center on Monday to begin a five-game homestand after going 2-0-1 on a three-game road trip. The only bump took place Saturday, when the Ducks suffered a 2-1 overtime loss against the St. Louis Blues.

Anaheim has won its last 11 games at home.

""For the team just to play as good as they've been playing consistently is pretty amazing to me,"" Anaheim coach Bruce Boudreau told The Associated Press.

**Who’s hot:** Sharks forwards Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau each have four-game point streaks. … Ducks goalie Jonas Hiller stopped 63 of 65 on the first two games of the trip before making 19 saves in Saturday’s loss. He’s won six straight on home ice.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020333)

**Season series:** Second of three meetings. Joe Pavelski had a pair of goals, including the game-winner, as the Sharks topped the Canucks 4-1 at HP Pavilion on Jan. 27.

**Big story:** San Jose's previous win against Vancouver was part of a 7-0 month of January for the Sharks. They went 2-6-4 during a dreadful February, but recorded a one-goal victory Saturday over Nashville to get March started on the right foot. The Canucks have been up and down of late, but still hold a two-point lead atop the Northwest Division standings.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Nine of San Jose's next 11 games will be played on the road, including this quick trip through western Canada that finishes Wednesday in Calgary. The Sharks persevered for a 2-1 win over a Predators team that prides itself on defensive and goaltending, peppering Pekka Rinne with 39 shots and breaking through twice on the power play. Joe Thornton set up both goals, by Dan Boyle in the first period and Pavelski in the second, and although the Sharks yielded a shorthanded goal in the third they shut the door, as Antti Niemi finished with 18 saves.

""If you get that many shots, you're bound to score more goals,"" said Logan Couture, who also had two assists. ""We had a lot of good looks, a lot of wraps and jams, which we wanted to going into tonight, and we need to build off that. They're a good defensive team, Nashville. They got a great goalie. So if we get 40 shots every night, I think we're going to score more than two.""

**Canucks:** It's the third game in four nights for Vancouver, which got mixed results over the weekend. After snapping the Kings' five-game winning streak in convincing fashion Saturday night, the Canucks had travel issues getting to Calgary and then let a pair of leads slip away in falling 4-2 to the Flames on Sunday. Jannik Hansen set up Chris Higgins' first-period goal and scored one of his own in the second, but the Canucks lost for the third time in four outings.

""I don't think it's a game that got away,"" coach Alain Vigneault told the Vancouver Sun. ""I'm real proud of the way we competed and battled tonight. We came here under different circumstances, never used excuses, went out and played real hard and in my opinion we deserved a better outcome.""

**Who's hot:** Thornton has a goal and six assists during a six-game points streak for the Sharks. Couture has two goals and two assists during a three-game points streak. Niemi has allowed two goals or fewer in 12 of his 17 starts. … Henrik Sedin (1-5-6) and Higgins (3-1-4) have four-game points streaks active for the Canucks. Hansen has consecutive games with a goal and an assist.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020720)

**Season series:** Final game of the four-game set and final game of the regular season, so far the home team has won each contest.

**Big story:** Even though the Sharks and Kings are both in the playoffs, the Western Conference bracket is far from settled. Both these teams have 57 points, the fourth-seeded St. Louis Blues have 58, but the Kings have more regulation/overtime wins than the other two. So all they need to do to move into fourth place is tie the Blues on points, while the Sharks would have to win and depend on a regulation loss by the Blues, in which case the Sharks and Kings would meet again.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** A quick look at the team stats won't reveal much. The Sharks are sixth in the NHL on the penalty kill at a very respectable 84.9 percent. Consider that last year's was a second-worst 76.9 percent and the improvement is tremendous.

In six of the last seven games in which they've had shorthanded spells, the Sharks have allowed a power-play goal and have been snuffing out penalties at an even-worse 75 percent clip. So fixing it will be a priority for Todd McLellan and his coaching staff.

""There's concern any time that you go on a streak that has a negative angle to it,"" McLellan told the San Jose Mercury News, ""but you also have your ups and downs over a year. Lately we have been scored on so we've got to clean that up going into the playoffs, there's no doubt about it.""

**Kings:** On Sunday at Staples Center, the Kings turned in a performance that made people think about last season's Stanley Cup run, defeating the Dallas Stars 4-3 in overtime. Then they went on the road and lost to the Minnesota Wild and Detroit Red Wings, both of whom are struggling to stay in the top eight. They've lost six away consecutive road games row and look like the exact opposite of last year's Cup champion, who won two more road games (10-1) during their playoff run than this team won all season (8-12-4). It's small consolation that the Sharks are no better at 8-13-2.

""Once playoffs start, it's a totally different story,"" center Anze Kopitar said after Wednesday's 3-1 road loss to the Detroit Red Wings. ""Obviously, it's not encouraging to throw away points like that late in the year.

""But regardless, winning games, not winning games, we're going to have to get to a whole different level during the playoffs. We all know that.""

**Who's hot:** Logan Couture has six points in four games, while Joe Pavelski has four in four. … For the Kings, Kopitar has gone 15 games without a goal and has only one in his past 18. But he has nine assists in his past 11 games. Antti Niemi got a night off Wednesday in favor of Thomas Greiss, and is 5-2-0 over his past seven starts, though he has a 3.74 goals-against average in his last six starts against the Kings.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020584)

**Season Series**: This is the second of three meetings. The Blue Jackets won the first showdown, 6-2, on Feb. 11. That game was also in Columbus.

**Big Story:** While the Sharks are trying to solidify their playoff position, the Blue Jackets are still hoping to catch fire so they can crack the top eight by season's end. The problem is, Columbus is stuck in 12th place with 39 points and has lost two in a row.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** San Jose's seven-game winning streak came to an end Sunday in a 5-4 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars.

It was the first time the Sharks gave up more than two goals since their 5-3 win against the Anaheim Ducks on March 25. It was the first time they gave up more than three goals since March 18, when the Ducks beat the Sharks, 5-3.

San Jose finished its seven-game homestand with a 6-0-1 record. The game Tuesday in Columbus starts a four-game road trip that will also take the Sharks to Detroit, Dallas and Phoenix before they return home a week from Tuesday.

Despite the recent run of success, coach Todd McLellan was not pleased with the way his team played Sunday. The Sharks had a 4-2 lead going into the third period and gave it away within the first 10 minutes.

""I didn't like our game basically the whole night,"" McLellan said. ""It was great we were able to score four, but we had a lot of key, key people, high-minute, high-end players who really didn't perform very well. Some of the workers worked, but we need more from those guys heading out on the road right now.

""When you're up like we were, you shouldn't give them back,"" he continued. ""A lot of mistakes. We didn't look very quick.""

**Blue Jackets:** Columbus is just 1-2 since the trade for Marian Gaborik. The Blue Jackets were blanked 3-0 by the Minnesota Wild on Sunday after losing 3-1 to the St. Louis Blues on Friday.

Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson said the team may have to win out to make the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Columbus has nine games remaining.

""It'd be nice, that's the goal,"" he said following the loss to Minnesota. ""That's what we're shooting for the rest of the season. We're in a position if we take care of our own games we can be in the position we want to be in. This one definitely hurts. It makes the next one even more critical.""

The Wild scored twice on their three power-play chances Sunday, while the Blue Jackets were held to only three shots and no goals on their four chances.

""They could have scored 10 power-play goals and it really doesn't matter if you can't score one,"" Johnson said. ""It's a pretty tough pill to swallow if you're in must-win games and you don't score a goal. That's pretty devastating.""

**Who's hot:** Sharks defenseman turned forward Brent Burns has four points in the past three games. He scored one of San Jose's four goals Sunday night. T.J. Galiardi also has a three-game point-scoring streak going. Raffi Torres had two assists in his Sharks' debut and has four assists in his past two games if you go back to his final game with the Phoenix Coyotes.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020478)

**Season series:** This is the fourth of five meetings. The Ducks are 2-0-1 against the Sharks and earned a 5-3 victory in the most recent showdown last Monday at the Honda Center.

**Big story:** After looking invincible for much of the season, the Ducks have struggled of late. They are coming off back-to-back regulation losses on home ice against the Detroit Red Wings, as they were outscored 7-2 in the two contests.

Monday marks the beginning of a home-and-home series between these clubs. They’ll meet again in San Jose on Wednesday.

**Team scope:**

**Sharks:** It’s the finale of a five-game road trip for San Jose. The Sharks are 1-3-0 through the first four contests and are coming off a 2-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild at the Xcel Energy Center on Saturday. San Jose peppered Niklas Backstrom with 33 shots, but the Wild netminder stopped them all.

""I think whoever scored the first goal was probably going to win that game,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said. ""We had some good chances and just couldn't get it in. Special teams are going to win you games right now.""

**Ducks:** Bruce Boudreau’s club probably couldn’t wait for the Red Wings to leave town. After Detroit cruised to a 5-1 win in the series opener Friday, the Ducks suffered another setback Sunday in a 2-1 decision at the Honda Center.

“As long as we don’t dwell on it to the point where we’re feeling sorry for ourselves now, we’ll be fine,” Boudreau said. “This is a real tough stretch we’re going through against a lot of really good teams. So we have to bring our ‘A’ game every night, or we won’t be successful.”

**Who’s hot:** Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf has two goals and three assists in the past four games, while winger Corey Perry is 2-2-4 in the past five.

[NHL PREVIEW](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020118)

**Season series:** First of three meetings, two of which will be at HP Pavilion. Last season, the teams split both home and away, each pocketing an overtime loss point in the Shark Tank.

**Big story:** The wins have gotten a little harder to obtain, but the San Jose Sharks continue to reign supreme as the only remaining undefeated team in the NHL, thanks to a powerful 3.86-goals-per-game offense and a defense that allows 1.71, tied with the Ottawa Senators for League best. The Predators are treading water, scoring a League-worst 1.57 goals per game, but have managed to go 2-2-1 so far on a seven-game, 15-day road trip which ends next Tuesday at the St. Louis Blues.

**Team scope:**

**Predators:** It's been either a shootout or a shutout for Pekka Rinne in his first five starts, the Predators getting blanked by the Blues and Coyotes while failing to come up with more than three goals in regulation against any opponent and not grabbing an extra point in their first three shootout attempts. Not a familiar state of affairs for a goalie who led the NHL in wins last season. Going into Thursday, he had none.

That night was looking similar to the others going into the shootout, but the Predators defeated the Kings 2-1 on Sergei Kostitsyn's eighth-round wrist shot underneath Jonathan Quick.

""I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself,"" Rinne said to the Tennessean. ""This was my first win of the season, and we are already six games in. It has been a tough go so far. Hopefully this kind of changes the course of how things are going.""

Kostitsyn said, ""It's nice to score to help Peks win the game in a shootout. We lost three before that. A good road win and good for Peks.""

**Sharks:** You'd never know it from the record, but the Sharks are not perfect. A blown 2-0 lead forced them into the shootout for the second game in a row, but they nailed down the 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday.

And for the second game in a row, Michal Handzus did a little of what he's now famous for: scoring the opening shootout goal. Even as he searches for his first point of the season in game action, his 18-for-34 record in shootouts puts him in the top slot when the final overtime buzzer sounds.

""Zeus, ever since he's been here, he's been pretty money on shootout goals,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said in the San Jose Mercury News. ""Last game he buried one, and tonight, so it's an easy choice for coach (Todd McLellan) to put him out there as the No. 1 shooter.""

**Who's hot:** For the Sharks, everyone. The top line makes the headlines, as Thornton and Patrick Marleau share second place in the NHL with 14 points, one behind leader Thomas Vanek of the Buffalo Sabres. Linemate Joe Pavelski is right behind them with 12 and Logan Couture is on his heels with 10, giving the Sharks four players among the League's top 10 scorers. Marleau leads the League with nine goals, Thornton leads the League in assists with 11. Only Handzus, known for his contributions when the clock isn't running, has a negative plus-minus rating. Antti Niemi's 1.95 goals-against average is up with the elite, and backup Thomas Greiss shut out the Colorado Avalanche in his only appearance. Even Scott Gomez, rescued from oblivion four games ago, wins 68 percent of his faceoffs, complementing a team that's second-best in the League overall at 58.5 percent.

**Injury report:** One reason for the Predators' sputtering offense is the absence of top goal-scorer Patric Hornqvist, who led the team last year with 27. He's weeks away from returning with a sprained knee. … Sharks defenseman Brent Burns has no timetable for a return from a lower-body injury, but undrafted 25-year-old rooke Matt Irwin has stepped up admirably, playing more than 19 minutes per game.

**Last 10: San Jose 6-4-0; Los Angeles 7-2-1**

**Season Series:** This is the fifth of six meetings between these Pacific Division foes, with the home team winning each of the first four matchups. Each club posted a two-goal victory in November before the Sharks claimed a 2-1 shootout decision in December and the Kings a 5-2 triumph on March 20.

**Big Story:** This is the first of a home-and-home set to close out the season for both teams. The clubs will also meet on Saturday in San Jose. While the Kings have solidified a playoff spot, the Sharks are currently clinging to the eighth seed with 41 wins and 92 points -- three ahead of Dallas and four ahead of Colorado, with two games remaining.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Logan Couture snapped a 10-game drought when he connected for the decisive goal 17:24 into the third period to help lead the Sharks to a 5-2 victory over the Stars on Tuesday. After sweeping the home-and-home against the Stars, outscoring them, 8-2, in the process, now it's on to Los Angeles. Antti Niemi made 29 saves in the victory, which enabled San Jose to take a big step toward securing a playoff berth for the eighth straight season.

""We can't enjoy this for very long,"" coach Todd McLellan said. ""We've got work to do. Good teams keep their highs and lows at a very even keel and we still have work to do. We cannot let our guard down. That'll be the message again sent to the players.""

**Kings:** Los Angeles, which has won nine of 12, could clinch its first division title in 21 years with two regulation wins over San Jose. The Kings joined the NHL in 1967, yet won just one division title in their first 43 seasons. Goalie Jonathan Quick made 19 saves for his NHL-leading 10th shutout on Monday in a 2-0 victory over Edmonton. Los Angeles, which is 87-0-7 in its last 94 games when leading after two periods, has a team-record 11 shutouts this season.

**Who's Hot:** Kings center Anze Kopitar has 15 points in the last 11 games, connecting for five goals and 10 assists over that stretch.

**Injury Report:** Jeff Carter (ankle) is day-to-day and Simon Gagne (concussion) and Scott Parse (hip) are out for the Kings. … For the Sharks, defenseman Douglas Murray (lower body) is questionable.

**Stat Pack:** San Jose defenseman Dan Boyle is just the fourth undrafted defenseman in League history to record 500 career points, joining Borje Salming (787), Steve Duchesne (752) and Brian Rafalski (515). Boyle has 502 points in 831 career games spanning 13 seasons.

**Puck Drop:** ""It is a playoff atmosphere. It's exciting,"" Boyle said. ""I've never been in a position down to the wire like this. Thirteen years now and this is a first.""

**Last 10: Chicago 3-5-2; San Jose 4-5-1**

**Season Series:** Chicago has won two of its first three games against San Jose this season, most recently defeating the Sharks 4-3 at the United Center on Jan. 15.

**Big Story:** As the Hawks deal with their longest road trip of the season, the team is struggling and desperate to break out of its funk. Visiting the Pacific-leading Sharks shouldn't make that particularly easy, but San Jose is dealing with a slump of its own.

**Team Scope:**

**Blackhawks:** There remains a sizeable cushion between the Blackhawks and the ninth spot in the West, meaning they shouldn't be too fearful of missing the playoffs unless their current skid becomes more protracted, but there is no denying that in the highly competitive Central Division, Chicago is starting to be left behind. As the Hawks bounce around on an arduous nine-game road trip, they have yet to get a win heading into the mid-point, going 0-3-1 in their first four games on the swing. Add that to two losses before leaving the Windy City, and the Blackhawks have a grand total of one point to show for themselves in the last six games.

The slump has dropped the Blackhawks in a considerable hole behind Detroit, St. Louis and Nashville in the Central after being in a dogfight with the other three teams for first in the West just two weeks ago. As the road-weary Hawks continue their trip, the schedule is likely to make things even more difficult -- after San Jose, Chicago still has to visit Nashville and the New York Rangers. Once they get home it doesn't get much easier. The Blackhawks' first two games back at the United Center are against the Blues and Red Wings.

**Sharks:** As it stands, the Sharks aren't exactly cruising to another Pacific Division crown, but they do appear to be in decent shape. San Jose's closest competitor in the division is Los Angeles, which was two points back heading into Thursday night's action, but will also have played four more games by the time the Sharks and Blackhawks drop the puck Friday.

While Chicago's slump will be grabbing the headlines heading into this matchup, the Sharks have had their own struggles lately. San Jose has lost two straight and five of its last eight games. And on the horizon after Friday's game with the Blackhawks is San Jose's own exhausting nine-game road trip.

**Who's hot:** Patrick Sharp has 2 goals and 2 assists in the last three games for Chicago. … Joe Thornton has been lighting it up for San Jose, tallying 8 points in his last four games.

**Injury report:** As if things weren't already difficult enough for the Blackhawks, a flu bug seems to have found its way into the locker room. Viktor Stalberg, Niklas Hjalmarsson, Nick Leddy and Bryan Bickell are all questionable for Friday with flu-like symptoms, while Steve Montador is also questionable with an upper-body injury. Of course, Chicago isn't the only team dealing with the bug. Dan Boyle is also questionable for San Jose with flu-like symptoms, while Martin Havlat, who has been out since Dec. 18 following hamstring surgery, should be nearing his return to action, but is still on IR.

**Stat pack:** Chicago, despite being one of the better teams in the League this season, has struggled with its goaltending, giving up a surprising 2.96 goals per game, but even that modest mark has been made to look impressive by its play lately. In the first four games of the Blackhawks' current road trip they have given up 19 goals, an average of 4.75 per game.

**Puck drop:** Both of these teams stand on tenuous ground, as a brief slump could turn into a massive one if they don't start winning games soon. If those slumps become massive, their postseason futures could be as dicey as their current play. Not only is Friday a solid chance to turn things around, it will also be a barometer of how each team can fare against both adversity and solid competition -- and it just might be a preview of another postseason meeting. If the season ended today, Chicago would be right back here in San Jose for Game 1 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals.

**Last 10: San Jose 5-3-2; Calgary 5-4-1.**

**Season Series:** This is the second of four meetings between the teams. San Jose earned a 2-1 shootout victory last Tuesday at HP Pavilion.

**Big Story:** The Sharks may have suffered a huge blow during Monday night's 2-1 shootout loss at Edmonton. Early in the third period, Oilers forward Ales Hemsky got into a knee-on-knee collision with San Jose defenseman Brent Burns, who needed to be helped off of the ice. Hemsky was given a kneeing major on the play.

""I tried to go down the wall and it was just a reaction play,"" Burns said. ""It didn't feel too good on my part. I knew it wasn't good right away. I thought I was going to throw up.

""I don't know how bad it is yet. It happens. It's a quick game. I've been on the other end of these. It happens so quick. It's not his fault.""

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** San Jose threw everything but the kitchen sink at Edmonton goaltender Devan Dubnyk on Monday night, but Dubnyk was downright sensation in a 44-save performance through overtime. He then denied all three Sharks in the shootout and Taylor Hall tallied the shootout winner against Thomas Greiss to give the Oilers a 2-1 victory.

San Jose has now lost three in a row (0-2-1).

""It seemed like we spent an awful lot of time in their end, but you still need to score the goals,"" said Sharks forward Logan Couture, who tallied the club's lone goal Monday night. ""We're frustrated right now. We are playing all right, but you still need to find a way to win games like this. We need the points right now. We haven't been getting the wins lately. We got a point tonight, but I would have rather had two. We're having a tough time scoring goals right now.""

**Flames:** Calgary will be looking to make it three in a row Tuesday night. After disposing of the Los Angeles Kings in a 2-1 shootout victory last Thursday, the Flames followed it up with a 6-2 win at Edmonton on Saturday night. Lee Stempniak recorded his second career hat trick in the victory and helped Calgary improve to 5-1-1 over its last seven games.

""I was the recipient of a couple of good plays and it feels good to score in a win,"" said Stempniak, who had only one goal in his previous 20 games. ""It was a big game for us and it was nice to be able to contribute like that. It's a relief to get some goals. Hopefully that is the start, and I can get rolling off of this.""

**Who's Hot:** Couture has 3 goals in his last two games and leads the Sharks with 21 tallies this season. … Flames captain Jarome Iginla has 3 points (1 goal, 2 assists) in his last three games.

**Injury Report:** Besides Burns, the Sharks are likely to be without Tommy Wingels (upper body), Ryane Clowe (nose) and Martin Havlat (hamstring). … Calgary is missing Curtis Glencross (knee), Derek Smith (ankle), Alex Tanguay (undisclosed), David Moss (foot) and Henrik Karlsson (knee).

**Stat Pack:** Couture's goal Monday night was his 100th NHL point. … Twenty of Calgary's remaining 33 games will be played on home ice.

**Puck Drop:** ""We know how important the points are the rest of the way in and we want to play consistently hard hockey. We played well on this road trip, and if we can continue to do that and play as well as we have at home, I think we are going to set ourselves up nicely. Everyone is keeping their eyes on the standings right now. There aren't going to be any easy games from here on out."" -- Flames forward Blake Comeau

**Last 10: Chicago 5-4-1; San Jose 7-2-1**

**Season Series:** This is the first meeting of the season for Chicago and San Jose. The Sharks won three of four last season, but the Blackhawks took the finale, a 6-3 win at United Center on March 14, 2011.

**Big Story:** After their worst defensive performance in nearly four years, the Blackhawks will try to bounce back as they hit the home stretch of their annual November Circus trip against San Jose, which is among the hottest teams in the NHL.

**Team Scope:**

**Blackhawks:** As Chicago opens the second half of its Circus Trip, the Hawks sit nicely entrenched in first place in the Central Division, tied with Minnesota and Pittsburgh for the most points in the League. However, Nashville and Detroit are both nipping at the Hawks' heels and after an embarrassing 9-2 loss in Edmonton on Saturday night, it's hard for Chicago to feel too good about itself.

Those nine tallies are the most Chicago has surrendered since Jan. 1, 2008 -- almost exactly four years ago -- and the defense and goaltending will need to shore itself up if the Blackhawks hope to avoid a similar fate against the Sharks. Helping the cause is that Corey Crawford should get the start for Chicago. Crawford was supposed to have the night off Sunday in Edmonton, but after backup Ray Emery gave up seven goals, he was pressed into action. Still, the workload was lighter than usual and with four days off, the hope is that Crawford -- and the Hawks -- will have mentally moved past the debacle.

**Sharks:** San Jose had struggled at the start of the year, but after reeling off five wins to start a six-game road trip of its own last month, the Sharks are rolling. San Jose has won 11 of its last 14 games, shooting the team up the Pacific standings and into first place. The Sharks do have competition -- Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles are all within two points of them -- but with a potent offense and a plus-14 goal differential, the numbers bode well for San Jose to continue its hot streak.

Wednesday is the first game in a stretch in which the Sharks will play six of seven games at home, but San Jose seems perfectly fine on the road, too. The Sharks swept a two-game trip through Dallas and Colorado -- on back-to-back nights, no less -- with identical 4-1 scores this past weekend. Patrick Marleau led the way Sunday night in Denver with his first hat trick in two years.

**Who's Hot:** Sharks captain Joe Thornton has been his usual self with 7 points in the last three games, but no one typically expects to see defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic matching his scoring prowess. The Pickle has 7 points of his own in the same span. … After a slow start to the year, Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews is rounding into form with 10 points in his last six games.

**Injury Report:** Michael Frolik (shoulder) and Brent Seabrook (lower body) are both listed as questionable for Wednesday. … San Jose should have its full lineup with the exception of goalie Antero Niittymaki, who has been out all season following hip surgery. He is approximately one month from returning.

**Stat Pack:** Chicago has already established itself as one of the Western Conference's elite, but making sure the Hawks get a top seed and hold home ice advantage could be a key for them in any long playoff run. Chicago is 7-1-2 this season at the United Center, but on the road, the Hawks' 5-5-1 mark is a veritable coin flip.

**Puck Drop:** The Blackhawks could certainly use a win to rebuild their confidence after their blowout loss to Edmonton, but a win in northern California could also be the first shot in a fight for the mental advantage between these two teams. The Sharks and Blackhawks are very familiar with each other and with both leading their respective divisions again, there is a very good chance that Wednesday night could be a postseason preview.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012030245)

**Big story:** Prior to Game 4, Los Angeles Kings coach Darryl Sutter downplayed the notion of momentum being big in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but the Kings have certainly experienced the ebbs and flows of it dating back to the first round. They fell in a 2-0 hole against the St. Louis Blues, then swept the next four games to advance. They extended their postseason win streak to six by jumping ahead of the San Jose Sharks 2-0 in the Western Conference Semifinals, but now the Sharks have taken two in a row by 2-1 scores and are feeling good about themselves heading into Game 5 at Staples Center.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Much was written and discussed heading into the playoffs about how San Jose has become Logan Couture's team, and never has that been more evident than over these past two games. Facing an unenviable position if they didn't win both games back at HP Pavilion, the Sharks needed someone to step up and drag them out of their hole, and Couture delivered.

First, he scored the overtime goal in Game 3 that kept the Sharks' hopes alive -- after returning from a second-period injury. On Tuesday, his second-period power-play goal staked them to a 2-0 lead and held up as the game-winner. Couture finished with five shots, three hits, three blocked shots and two takeaways. Joe Thornton also stood front and center, setting up Brent Burns' goal that opened the scoring, and Antti Niemi made 22 saves.

""We knew going into this series we'd have to win one game at Staples Center if we want to win this series,"" Couture said. ""We've done our job at home. We need to go into L.A. and win a game on Thursday. We're looking forward to it.""

**Kings:** For the second straight series, Los Angeles faces a pivotal Game 5 -- unlike in the first round, this time it's on home ice. However, this time the Kings are the team that has lost two in a row and must find a way to get things going back in their favor.

Just like the Sharks came out of the first two games of the series feeling they probably should have managed at least a split, the Kings can look at the last two in San Jose knowing there were opportunities to win. Late penalties doomed them in Game 3 and they had a chance on Tuesday after Mike Richards' power-play goal midway through the third period, but couldn't get another puck past Niemi. A solid performance by Jonathan Quick (21 saves) was wasted.

""We've got to start on time,"" defenseman Matt Greene, back after missing nearly a month due to injury, told the Los Angeles Times. ""It's easy to play when you get down 2-0. You open up a little bit. We've got to start on time. We've got to play better right away. You can't be trying to come back every night in the playoffs.""

**Who's hot:** Niemi has stopped 48 of 50 shots over the past two games for the Sharks. Couture has goals in consecutive games. … Quick has allowed just seven goals on 129 shots in the series for the Kings.

I also realize this post will be heavily down-voted and you have that right but hear me out first. Looking at the road ahead to the playoffs DW may have made a pretty shrewd move. Aside from Vancouver and Chicago, the other 6 teams in the top 8 are big heavy hitting teams and a lot of our grit was traded East with Ryane Clowe. Not to take away anything from Clowe, but Torres can obviously hit, be strong with the puck, and most importantly score. 

Look at the last game against Minnesota, the Couture line was completely dominated against and no one stuck up for him. Yes the Sharks scored on two power plays from some of the penalties but this is never a guarantee particularly in the playoffs. It should be noted that Vancouver was also interested in reacquiring Torres (potential first round match up in the playoffs) in which case the Sharks could be facing an always tough Vancouver team with Torres on the line up. Many of you can recall how the series 2 years ago against Vancouver Jumbo had to play through a separated shoulder injury after a hit by none other than you guessed it Raffi Torres, not to mention the hit on Michalek in 2006 when they lost the series against Edmonton. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is, hes on the team, better to play with him, and we need his tenacity (assuming he doesn't kill anyone out there). The playoffs are not known for teams playing the cleanest hockey anyway and if by some amazing chance the Sharks win the cup no one is going to say it was because of Torres. No I don't like him, no I don't think he belongs in the NHL, and no I hope he doesn't get resigned next year but let's face it though Sharks need a guy (mostly) like him so DW recognized that and pulled the trigger. He seems reformed (for now) and stoked to play for SJ so lets just roll with it.

**Big Story:** The Sharks are riding a five-game winning streak, their longest since winning seven in a row to open the season. But that didn’t stop them from shipping forward Ryane Clowe to the New York Rangers on Tuesday night in exchange for three draft picks. San Jose had already traded defenseman Douglas Murray and forward Michal Handzus.

""Ryane is a tremendously respected player and teammate, and an individual of outstanding character,"" Sharks general manager Doug Wilson said. ""These deals involving players who have spent a substantial amount of time in and contributed much to San Jose are difficult, but it's also important for us to get value for a player who is set to be an unrestricted free agent. We want to wish Ryane and his family the best in the future and thank them for everything they have done for the Sharks organization and the San Jose community.”

**Team Scope:**

**Wild:** With so much at stake and so little time left in the season, now is not the time for a team to slow down. But the Wild played the first two periods of Monday night's matchup with the St. Louis Blues as if the grind of six games in 10 days was finally catching up with them, and the fans in Xcel Energy Center were on to it, booing their team as the second period wound down. They picked up the pace in the third, outshooting the Blues 13-2, but the 4-1 loss got Zach Parise and his teammates' attention.

“We were flat. We got what we deserved. We didn’t play well at all,” Parise told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. “It was pretty similar to the team that we started the season. That’s the type of game we played — not competitive, and too many turnovers.

“It’s crept back into our game. The last few games we’ve gotten away with it. Tonight, against a team like that, you’re not going to.”

**Sharks:** It could have been a distraction. With all the trade rumors that surrounded Clowe that finally materialized with a deal to the Rangers on Tuesday, the Sharks took the ice against the Vancouver Canucks on Monday without the veteran forward and extended their winning streak to five games with the 3-2 victory. Three goals within 2:13, one each by Andrew Desjardins, Joe Thornton and Logan Couture, sealed the deal.

""I think they rolled with it pretty easy,"" coach Todd McLellan said of his team's reaction to the unusual circumstances. ""They're smart people in the locker room. They sense what's going on with Clowe's situation. It didn't just pop out of thin air today.""

**Who's hot:** Mikko Koivu's seven-game point streak was stopped Monday. Devin Setoguchi had seven goals and four assists in 10 games before being held off the board as well. Parise has a six-game point streak against the Sharks, with three goals and five assists. Overall, the Wild had scored 38 goals in nine games leading up to Monday, which has helped goalie Niklas Backstrom, who has a 3-1-0 record in his past four games despite a 3.40 goals-against average over the stretch. ... Thornton also picked up an assist Monday, extending his point streak to three games. Antti Niemi has won four straight starts with a 0.98 GAA and also has back-to-back wins against the Sharks. The Sharks' defense is one big reason they've won five straight -- they've only given up seven goals after allowing 35 over a prior 2-5-2 slump.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020530)

**Season series:** The Sharks have taken the first two matchups this season as they seek to win their fifth straight Monday night against the visiting Canucks. The Sharks won their last meeting in a shootout, 3-2, on March 5 at Rogers Arena.

**Big story:** As the regular season hits the home stretch, both Vancouver and San Jose sit in the Western Conference's top eight, but given how tightly-packed the race is, both are far from clinching a playoff spot. The Canucks and Sharks can pick up a valuable two points when they meet in San Jose on Monday.

**Team scope:**

**Canucks:** Vancouver lost its last game by a lopsided 4-0 margin in Edmonton on Saturday, but while the loss was a particularly brutal one -- the Oilers scored three goals in the first three minutes -- the Canucks might have just been due. Prior to the loss, Vancouver had won six games in a row, a stretch that has pulled the Canucks into an extremely tight race with the Minnesota Wild for first place in the Northwest Division. Both teams have 44 points as of Monday morning and while the Wild have a game in hand, there is plenty of time for Vancouver to overtake its division rival and get the first-round home ice advantage that comes wih a division title.

Doing so might require a bit more production, however. Before he was yanked after giving up two quick goals Saturday, goalie Cory Schneider had been tremendous in net for the Canucks, providing a rock at the back throughout their winning streak even as the offense struggled. The Canucks have averaged just over 1.86 goals per game over their last seven outings.

**Sharks:** San Jose has struggled to gain any consistency for most of the season, and its trade last week of Douglas Murray to the Pittsburgh Penguins would seem at first glance to be general manager Doug Wilson waving the white flag ahead of this week's trade deadline. But since the trade, the Sharks have won four games in a row -- including a home-and-home sweep of the Pacific-leading Anaheim Ducks, lifting San Jose up the standings and, for the moment, comfortably into the West's top eight.

Those last three wins have all come at HP Pavilion, where the Sharks boast one of the best home-ice records in the League at 11-1-4. San Jose still gets four more games at home before it heads on the road again later this month, which, if the trend holds, means the Sharks could very well rise even higher in the West.

**Who's hot:** Schneider has lost just two games in regulation for the Canucks since the start of March. In his past seven games, he's 6-1-0 with a 1.31 goals-against average. ... San Jose's Joe Pavelski has scored in four straight games, including two game-winners, while adding two assists over that stretch.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020457)

**Season series:** This is the first of three meetings between the clubs this season.

**Big story:** The Wild are red-hot and hoping to stay that way. They have won four in a row and six of their last seven, with the lone loss coming against the Anaheim Ducks. The Sharks will be trying to win their second straight game for only the second time since they started the season 7-0.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** They're coming off a 4-3 shootout win over the Edmonton Oilers. It was one of those gutsy, come-from-behind wins that could spark a team into a hot streak.

The Sharks were down 3-1 early in the third period, but Logan Couture and Tommy Wingels scored less than three minutes apart to tie the game. It stayed that way until the shootout, when Dan Boyle won it for San Jose in the third round.

Couture scored two goals in the game and is now up to 14 for the season.

The Sharks are eighth in the Western Conference heading into the games Friday night.

""To win the way that we were able to and come back with two goals in the third, hopefully that can get us going in the right direction,"" Couture said. ""We needed something. We need all the points we can get right now. We need to find ways to get points every single night right now.""

**Wild:** After a slow start to the season, the Wild have things going in the right direction. They have won four in a row, including a 4-2 win over the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday.

They have scored 18 goals during the four-game winning streak. By comparison, the Wild scored only 23 goals over 12 games in February.

""We expect to win now,"" defenseman Ryan Suter said. ""Early on we had that doubt. Now we expect to win and we're holding each other accountable. We know what we're capable of. We know what each guy's capable of. Now we're expecting it and it really shows.""

Niklas Backstrom also deserves credit for the turnaround in Minnesota. He's made 71 saves over the last two games and has his goals-against average down to 2.32, his save percentage up to .917.

The Wild are first in the Northwest Division.

**Who's hot:** Couture scored twice against the Oilers for his second two-goal game in the past four games. … Wild forward Devin Setoguchi scored twice against the Red Wings, giving him six goals during a five-game point-scoring streak.

Last 10: San Jose 4-3-3. Los Angeles 6-4-0

**Season series:** Second of four overall and the back end of a home-and-home that began Thursday night in HP Pavilion, a game the Sharks won 4-3 after holding off a last-ditch third-period attack by the Kings.

**Big story:** Both teams, along with Minnesota, have 30 points in 26 games and are in a group of eight teams that are within four points in the Western Conference playoff scramble. A win could vault one of these teams as high as fourth; a regulation loss could put the loser on the outside of the playoff picture.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** The wake-up call came in the form of a second-period Andrew Desjardins hit on Colin Fraser. The hit was legal; L.A. defenseman Jake Muzzin's response wasn't. Muzzin was called for instigating, unsportsmanlike conduct (instigating with a visor) and a 10-minute misconduct in addition to the five for fighting, giving the Sharks a four-minute power play. San Jose converted both ends as Matt Irwin and Logan Couture scored to turn a 1-0 lead into 3-0. Logan Couture added a third-period goal that became the winner after the Kings cut a 4-1 deficit to 4-3. It was the Sharks' first four-goal game since Jan. 27, a 6-9-5 stretch. It was also only their second regulation win in 11 games.

""It's always a positive when you make a play like that. It's just like making an assist,"" Desjardins told the San Jose Mercury News about the hit and the ensuing fight. ""Just something to try and get the boys to feed off of, and it worked.""

""He turned the game totally around with that hit,"" Sharks captain Joe Thornton said.

Kings: One big difference between this season's team and last year's Stanley Cup-winning squad is the scoring, now at 2.88 goals per game, good for 10th best in the NHL, versus a second-worst 2.29 last year. While the puck is getting into the net more often, captain Dustin Brown is more concerned about too many pucks going into L.A.'s net -- the Kings own a very middle-of-the-pack 2.62 goals-against average, a big jump from last season's 2.07 GAA that was second-best in the NHL.

""The last three games we've lost, we've been giving up four and five goals,"" he pointed out to the Kings' website."" A lot of games we win, 6-5.

""We've got to clean up our D-zone. We're trying to climb out of 4-0, 4-1. It's not an easy thing to do. At the end of the day, our goals against has got to come down. You look at why we were successful last year - we weren't scoring a lot of goals, but we were winning games 1-0 and 2-1. We've got to really tighten up our D-zone.""

**Who's hot:** Couture's three-point night on Thursday gives him five points in four games. Thornton and Patrick Marleau picked up assists to extend their individual points streaks to three games. … Brown scored twice Thursday to give him five goals in three games.

**Season series:** This is the second of four meetings between these Western Conference foes, who square off in Edmonton for the first time this season. In the first matchup on Dec. 17 in San Jose, Patrick Marleau scored the only goal of the third period to lift the Sharks to a 3-2 victory. Antti Niemi stopped 23 shots for the win, while Nikolai Khabibulin made 34 saves in defeat.

**Big Story:** San Jose, which leads Los Angeles by just one point for the top spot in the Pacific Division, is aiming to get back on track after dropping two in a row. The Sharks do have four games in hand over L.A., as they travel to Edmonton for the middle contest of a three-game swing through western Canada. San Jose's recent struggles pale in comparison to those of the Oilers, who have just five wins in their last 25 games and have dropped to 29th in the League with only 38 points.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Following a one-goal defeat at Vancouver on Saturday afternoon, the Sharks have now lost three of four after recording a point in 14 of their previous 15 (10-1-4). Logan Couture scored San Jose's first two goals -- giving him 20 for the season -- and the game was tied 2-2 late into the third period, when the teams suddenly combined for three goals in 92 seconds. Ryan Kesler started the outburst, giving the Canucks a 3-2 lead with 5:49 left. Dan Boyle responded merely 36 seconds later with his fourth goal of the season to knot the game once again. Vancouver grabbed the lead right back though, as Cody Hodgson netted his second tally of the game to send the Canucks to a 4-3 win. Hodgson was actually trying to make a pass from behind the goal line, but the puck caromed off the stick of Sharks forward Michal Handzus and slipped past a surprised Niemi.

""The frustrating thing is we are aware of the mistakes we're making and still making them,"" Sharks coach Todd McLellan said. ""A missed faceoff assignment (on Hodgson's first goal), a pinch we don't cover above (on Kesler's goal), and the goal from below the goal line is tough to swallow. Good teams make you pay for those errors. We didn't make many, but when we did, they put it in the net.""

**Oilers:** The Oilers were booed off the ice Saturday night at Rexall Place after they lost the Battle of Alberta for the ninth straight time and the fourth time this season. Lee Stempniak had a hat trick and an assist for Calgary, who maintained its dominance over Edmonton with a convincing 6-2 victory. Taylor Hall returned after missing two games with a grisly 30-stitch cut in his forehead, but it provided no early spark as the Oilers fell behind 3-0 after one period.

""We got ourselves behind the eight-ball right away,"" Oilers coach Tom Renney said. ""We weren't very smart. Calgary has played very disciplined against us and we needed to match that intelligence and play the way we need to play to have success. I think they (the Edmonton players) are giving it everything they have, but are at a little bit of a loss right now. It may be a confidence issue. But the answer is with them, not anybody else.""

Andy Sutton and Ryan Smyth scored in the third period for the Oilers, who have just one regulation win in the last month -- a 4-3 victory at Chicago on Jan. 2.

""It's unacceptable,"" Smyth said. ""Everybody has to look in the mirror and take responsibility right now. We have to come and play hard with pride, character and care.""

**Who's Hot:** Boyle has points in six of his last eight games for the Sharks, notching 2 goals and 8 assists in that stretch.

**Injury Report:** San Jose forwards Ryane Clowe (facial fracture), Martin Havlat (hamstring) and Tommy Wingels (upper body) are all on Injured Reserve. Defenseman Jim Vandermeer, who hasn’t played since Dec. 6 because of an upper-body injury, was activated from IR on Saturday. … Edmonton forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (shoulder) and blueliners Tom Gilbert (ankle) and Cam Barker (ankle) are on IR. Defenseman Ryan Whitney has also been sidelined with an ankle injury, but is likely to return Monday or Tuesday.

**Stat Pack:** In Saturday's loss to Vancouver, Couture scored a short-handed goal as well as a power-play goal, which was just San Jose's sixth tally with the man advantage in 45 chances since Dec. 23. … Edmonton hasn't scored more than two goals in a game since a 4-3 loss at St. Louis on Jan. 5.

**Puck Drop:** Hall was making headlines after Saturday’s game for something other than his new battle scars. The 20-year-old forward was seen on the ice mouthing 'Where's the goalie?' after Calgary’s sixth goal, which was an empty-netter.

""A bit of frustration,"" Hall told the team's official web site after Sunday's practice. ""We all want to win, we all care in here and to have that kind of result and effort we did last night isn't what we wanted. After that goal, I was just so frustrated at the whole sequence of events. I'm not singling out Tom (Renney) by any means, I respect everything that Tom does. It's kind of embarrassing on my part to say that. But we've moved on and talked about it and everything is fine.""

Renney said the incident should be used as a learning experience.

""That's okay. He regrets that. Frustration is alive and well in here right now. It's an opportunity to curtail that and recognize that growing up and maturing as a player involves doing that. If you're going to be a leader on this team down the road -- and he will be -- he's got to be able to handle these types of circumstances and understand what we're doing here.""

**Last 10: San Jose 7-1-2; Chicago 4-4-2.**

**Season Series:** This is the third of four meetings between the teams. They split the first two games, as Chicago avenged a 1-0 loss at San Jose on Nov. 23 when Patrick Sharp scored in overtime to give the Hawks a 3-2 victory on Dec. 11 at the United Center.

**Big Story:** The new calendar year has been very kind to San Jose thus far. With Saturday night's 2-1 win at the Columbus, the Sharks improved to 6-0-1 in 2012. They're also 10-1-2 over the last month. That success has allowed them to pick up ground in the race for the Western Conference lead, as they'll enter Sunday's action just four points behind No. 1 Vancouver. The Sharks -- who have earned at least a point in eight straight games -- were in eighth place on Dec. 13.

""We're starting to do the things we're capable of doing -- not necessarily offensively, but defensively,"" San Jose coach Todd McLellan said. ""We're happy with the way it is going. We know we have a lot of work to do in a lot of different areas. Both of the strings coincidently came after five- or six-game losing streaks, so maybe that was the wakeup call we needed."" 

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** Just when it seemed the Sharks and Blue Jackets were destined for overtime, Patrick Marleau broke a 1-1 tie with just 2:57 remaining in regulation to lift San Jose past Columbus at Nationwide Arena. Thomas Greiss made 25 saves and beat the Jackets for the second time in a span of nine days.

""Both games had their moments. Last game they had a couple of 2-on-1s right at the get go and this one was almost all the other way around,"" Greiss said. ""They had more at the end. It was a pretty tough game at the end.""

**Blackhawks:** Chicago received a strong effort from Corey Crawford on Saturday afternoon in a 40-save performance and Jonathan Toews erased a 2-1 deficit in the final minute of regulation. But, in the end, the Blackhawks left Detroit with just one point as Todd Bertuzzi scored in overtime to lift the Red Wings to a 3-2 victory at Joe Louis Arena.

Toews' goal allowed the Blackhawks to remain one point ahead of Detroit in the Central Division.

""We're not going to beat ourselves up about it,"" Toews said. ""We knew that game wasn't over until the end and we stuck with it and got a goal in the last minute. It's unfortunate we couldn't find a way to get the extra point in overtime.""
 
**Who's Hot:** Marleau has 10 points (4 goals, 6 assists) in his last eight games. … Toews has a goal and 2 assists in his last three contests.

**Injury Report:** San Jose is expected to be without Martin Havlat (hamstring), Jim Vandermeer (hand) and Colin White (lower body). … Patrick Sharp (hand), Daniel Carcillo (knee) and Marcus Kruger (concussion) are likely out for Chicago.

**Stat Pack:** With Saturday's win, the Sharks improved to 18-1-3 when leading after two periods. … Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane has only 2 goals in his last 16 games.

**Puck Drop:** ""You look at our division, you've got four teams all way up there. Every game is critical, every point is vital. Winning your division, the reward is going to be huge, because you know you had to do a lot of good things to attain it. Let's concentrate on trying to be there and know that it's a long rest of the season. But that's definitely our primary focus the last half of the year."" -- Chicago coach Joel Quenneville

**Season series:** Friday's game is the first of four meetings between the Red Wings and Sharks, who won three of four regular-season matchups in 2010-11. The Sharks also eliminated the Wings from the Stanley Cup playoffs last season, beating Detroit in Round 2 for the second consecutive year. Joe Thornton has five goals and four assists in his last six regular-season games against the Red Wings and added six assists against them in the postseason.

**Big Story:** These rivals meet for the first time since San Jose edged the Wings 3-2 in Game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals last spring. For Detroit, this game is not about redemption though; it's about getting back on track after back-to-back losses in which the Wings have been outscored 11-2. The Wings had won five in a row to begin the season before a 7-1 drubbing in Washington and a 4-1 loss in Columbus, the Blue Jackets' first win in nine games this season.

The first line of Henrik Zetterberg, Pavel Datsyuk, and Danny Cleary has become a point of concern for coach Mike Babcock, who used six different line combinations in an attempt to mix things up. The three forwards have combined for just three goals and six assists in the first seven games.

""When I looked at my sheet after the game, I had six sets, so that's a problem,"" Babcock told the team's Web site. ""That means nothing is going right. So we have to figure it out. I had (Zetterberg-Datsyuk-Cleary) together in practice [Thursday], but it really doesn't matter much. So I'll think about that tonight and decide what I'm doing for [Friday].""

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** With wins in New Jersey, Boston and Nashville, the Sharks are perfect on their current six-game road trip, the second-longest of their season. Their play has picked up since Antti Niemi made his season debut on Oct. 17. The Finnish netminder missed the first three games as he recovered from a procedure to have a cyst removed from his knee. Niemi has posted a 1.95 goals-against average in the three wins, and other key San Jose players have stepped up as well. In the Sharks' latest win -- a 3-1 victory over the Predators on Tuesday -- Joe Pavelski scored two goals, including the game-winner. Thornton notched his 700th career assist on Pavelski's second goal of the game and sixth of the season.

""It's a good number, but it doesn't mean anything right now,"" Pavelski said of his early-season tallies. ""When you suit up for the next game, the number of goals you have don't matter. It's about production and in the moment and not getting ahead of yourself. Hopefully, I'll keep getting chances and just keep building.""

**Red Wings:** The Red Wings hope a return to the Motor City means a return to their winning ways, as they play seven of their next eight at home. They are already guaranteed one return as Jimmy Howard will be back in goal on Friday after missing the last two games due to the birth of his first child. The 27-year-old goalie is 4-0-0 with a 1.72 GAA on the season. He'll need some smarter hockey from his teammate -- Detroit took a season-high seven penalties in Columbus and R.J. Umberger scored 21 seconds into the game to send the Jackets on their way.

""There's no excuse for what happened tonight,"" Babcock said after the game. ""I wasn't very impressed. There weren't a whole lot of guys who were really jumping for us tonight. As a coaching staff, we're supposed to have the guys ready, and we weren't -- as a team we weren't ready to go. Why is that? ""

**Who's Hot:** Pavelski has four goals and two assists during San Jose's winning streak, though hasn't scored in his last eight regular-season games against Detroit. Thornton has a four-game point streak (1 goal, 5 assists) and Logan Couture has goals in back-to-back games and points in three straight. Since making his Sharks debut on Oct. 21, Martin Havlat has an assist in each of his three games played.

**Injury Report:** Defenseman Mike Commodore still hasn't played for Detroit because of a knee injury. …For San Jose, Antero Niittymaki (hip), Alex Stalock (knee) and Frazer McLaren (hip) are on IR, while forward Torrey Mitchell has missed the last two games after sustaining an upper-body injury against the Devils.

**Stat Pack:** Friday's game features the two busiest shooting teams in the League. San Jose leads the NHL with 38.4 shots per game, while Detroit is second, averaging 36.1 shots. … Niemi is 5-1-1 with a 1.97 GAA in the regular season against Detroit.

**Puck Drop:** Following practice on Wednesday, Babcock told the team's Web site that he ""did the sleep test"" with less than stellar results.

""I went to sleep, I was bitter. And I woke up and I was still bitter. Normally, the sun gets up and I'm having a good day. I bounce back real quick…It took me a little longer today.""

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020491)

**Season series:** Fifth and final meeting of the regular season between these Pacific Division rivals, and also the completion of a home-and-home. San Jose won 5-3 in Anaheim on Monday to even up the season series at two games apiece.

**Big story:** Just when it appeared the Ducks might take advantage of a slump by the Blackhawks to chase them down for the Western Conference's top seed, Anaheim has hit a tailspin of its own. The Ducks lost the final three games of a five-game homestand, which doubled the amount of regulation defeats they suffered in their first 29 contests this season. They still hold a 10-point lead in the Pacific, however.

This game marks the start of a four-game road trip for Anaheim and a seven-game homestand for San Jose.

**Team Scope:**

**Ducks:** By the time Monday's game was a minute into the second period, Anaheim had already dug itself a 3-0 hole. Owners of the fifth-best offense in the NHL, the Ducks fought back and twice cut their deficit down to a single goal, but could never draw even. Corey Perry had a goal and an assist in the third.

""We've got to just get a bit of a sense of urgency back in our game,"" defenseman Sheldon Souray said. ""We're starting these games possibly thinking it's going to be an easy night. We've got to understand that we've played well all year to put ourselves in the position the other teams are going to be ready for us.

""We should have a little bit of swagger, for sure, and we deserve to be where we are because we've played really well. But we've gotten away from that a little bit.""

**Sharks:** Looking to shake his team from a doldrums that saw it lose seven of its past nine, San Jose general manager Doug Wilson traded popular defenseman Douglas Murray to Pittsburgh on Monday. The Sharks came out later that evening looking motivated and jumped on the Ducks with first-period goals by Brent Burns and Joe Pavelski just 84 seconds apart. Martin Havlat ended a 15-game goal drought by scoring 34 ticks into the second, and the Sharks were off and running.

""We're all pros,"" center Joe Thornton said. ""We got to go out and play. It doesn't matter who gets traded. You got to out play and work hard, and we knew they were coming off back-to-back games and we wanted to start quick, and we did and it worked out in our favor.""

**Who's hot:** Francois Beauchemin scored his fifth goal of the season Monday and boosted his plus/minus to a plus-21, tied with Souray for best on the Ducks and best in the League among defensemen. … James Sheppard's first goal for the Sharks and the 12th of his NHL career ended up as the game-winner.

[NHL Preview](http://sharks.nhl.com/club/preview.htm?id=2012020373)

**Season series:** The teams are playing the last of their three games. The San Jose Sharks won the first two at home, 4-0 on Jan. 26 and 3-2 in a shootout exactly a month later.

**Big story:** Now that Colorado has ended the Chicago Blackhawks' run of 24 games without a regulation loss, the Avalanche have to focus on getting back into the Stanley Cup Playoff race in the Western Conference. The good news for Colorado is that it's in a stretch during which it plays six of seven games at home, where it is 7-2-1 (opposed to 2-8-3 on the road).

San Jose will try to bounce back after a 3-1 third-period lead at home against the St. Louis Blues on Saturday afternoon turned into a 4-3 overtime loss.

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** San Jose looked like it was headed to victory against St. Louis after second-period goals by Scott Gomez and Matt Irwin gave the Sharks a 3-1 lead entering the final 20 minutes. But Vladimir Sobotka scored his second and third goals of the game in the third period to force overtime before Patrik Berglund's deflection at 1:12 sent the Sharks to Denver with one point instead of two.

""That was a tough one to take,"" said forward Logan Couture, who scored in the first period. ""With a 3-1 lead going into the third, obviously you don't want to give it up. It's tough right now to get over but we have a game tomorrow that we have to focus on. You think about the mistakes you made, move on, and get better from it.""

**Avalanche:** Colorado nearly defeated the Blackhawks in Chicago on Wednesday; the Avalanche did the job two nights later before a full house at Pepsi Center, scoring five consecutive goals after the Blackhawks took an early lead and rolling to a 6-2 victory

Matt Duchene led the attack with a goal and three assists, his first four-point night in more than two years.

""Some nights they go in, some nights they don't,"" Duchene said. ""I feel like last game, with any luck, it could've been the same result for our line and for a lot of guys individually, but we didn't get the bounces. Thankfully, tonight we did.""

**Who's hot:** Couture's goal Saturday was his fourth point in the Sharks' past five games. … Avalanche forward PA Parenteau had a goal and two assists against the Blackhawks, giving him eight points during a five-game points streak.

**Season series:** Second of five meetings between these Pacific Division rivals. Michal Handzus notched the decisive shootout goal in a 3-2 San Jose victory on Jan. 29, a game the Sharks tied up with 2:45 remaining on a Logan Couture goal.

**Big story:** San Jose became the last of the 30 NHL teams to lose a game on Saturday, but remains one of two still without a regulation defeat (Chicago, 7-0-2). Anaheim, meanwhile, is off to a fast start of its own -- just four points off the division lead and ahead of both the defending Pacific champ (Phoenix) and the defending Stanley Cup champ (Los Angeles).

**Team Scope:**

**Sharks:** One-sixth of this abbreviated season has passed for San Jose, which has re-established itself as one of the teams to beat in the West. The Sharks might well have made it eight in a row out of the gate if not for Predators goalie Pekka Rinne. After going nearly 54 minutes Saturday night without solving Rinne, the Sharks finally broke through for Martin Havlat's game-tying goal with 6:21 left, but Rinne didn't let anything past him in the shootout and they suffered a 2-1 defeat.

""Once they scored that first goal -- we were coming, we were coming,"" center Joe Thornton said of San Jose's response to Sergei Kostitsyn's goal 59 seconds into the third period. ""Marty's goal was nice and we had some good chances after that.""

**Ducks:** There's no shortage of offensive weapons on Anaheim, from the ageless Teemu Selanne to up-and-comers like Kyle Palmieri, and the Ducks are getting contributions up and down the lineup in averaging nearly four goals per game. And don't forget former Sharks draft pick Nick Bonino. He recorded his first career hat trick Saturday to power the Ducks' 7-4 win over the Kings. Palmieri, Ryan Getzlaf and newcomer Sheldon Souray all beat Jonathan Bernier, and Selanne finished the scoring with an empty-net goal.

""I hope it does a lot [for his confidence],"" coach Bruce Boudreau said of Bonino, who had just six career goals in his previous 91 games over parts of four seasons in Anaheim. ""He was smiling pretty good and he was happy. I was really happy for him. Your first NHL hat trick doesn't happen very often.""

**Who's hot:** Sharks goalie Antti Niemi ranked fourth in goals-against average (1.80) and fifth in save percentage (.936) heading into Sunday's action. … Bobby Ryan has two goals and five assists during a four-game points streak for the Ducks. Palmieri has three goals in the last two games. Emerson Etem assisted on two of Bonino's goals Saturday for his first NHL points.

**Injury report:** San Jose remains without defenseman Brent Burns, on injured reserve following offseason hernia surgery. … Anaheim defenseman Cam Fowler left Saturday's game in the second period with an upper-body injury and Boudreau was unsure as to the severity after the game.
