1369074014.0,67,self.debian,1epi9r,Debian wheezy makes a surprisingly awesome desktop :),69,2,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1epi9r/debian_wheezy_makes_a_surprisingly_awesome_desktop/,"I've never really tried pure debian before, and definitely never considered using it as my main desktop operating system, but I recently gave the newly released wheezy a try and am loving it 

It is a little trickier to install and setup than ubuntu or other similar distros (but not really that difficult at all, I found the installer to be straightforward enough and things worked reasonable well out of the box in debian. I did have to make a few tweaks that I don't need to do in ubuntu such as adding my user to the sudo group, adding myself to the lpadmin group, installing system-config-printer, and tweaking font rendering so it doesn't suck).

The thing that suprised me most was how well wheezy works for multimedia. Out of the box it played mp3, aac, and h.264, this is even better multimedia support than ubuntu has out of the box! I wish more distros would follow suit here.

The desktop is very stable and quick, it seems lighter than any other full gnome distros that I've used. The version of gnome it comes with is kind of old already, but I've actually come to really appreciate that it comes with gnome-shell 3.4. IMO gnome 3.4 has been the only gnome 3.x release thats been fully usable and doesn't have a bunch of annoying bugs (for example gnome 3.6 has a lot of weird little issues with network shares, like randomly crashing when mounting/unmounting them or sometimes giving pointless gvfs errors when unmounting shares. ubuntu's patched nautilus 3.6 is even worse, its introduced a bug that upstream nautilus doesn't have where it randomly ""loses"" my bookmarked shares. And nautilus 3.8 has a bug where it randomly crashes gnome-shell and sometimes even totally crashes gnome). Wheezy's gnome 3.4 desktop has been super solid for me, I've noticed no annoying problems with gnome-shell or nautilus. And honestly after using debian's gnome 3.4 for a week I can't think of a single thing I really miss in 3.6 or 3.8 that really compels me to upgrade from gnome 3.4.

Everything that I use this laptop for is working wonderfully in debian 7, and I've had yet to run into annoying ""showtopper"" bugs that I've constantly been hitting with all other recent distros. I think I can finally stop distro hopping for now, and I can wait things out in stable debian land until unity-next, gnome-shell, kde etc... become bug free enough for me to use without pulling my hair out 

The only problem I had with wheezy is that it came with a very old kernel that hates my ivybridge graphics, and the system would randomly lock up. luckily installing kernel 3.8 sorted that out for me, and now all my hardware (brightness keys, card reader, etc..) works just as well in debian as it does in 13.04, and an official kernel 3.8 backport should be available soon.

I didn't expect debian to be a good ""desktop"" experience, but was pleasantly surprised.

declining number of bug reports, concerned about loss of momentum of
Debian,

&gt; Christian Perrier noted that Debian bug #690000 [3] was reported last
&gt; Monday, three months and eight days after bug #680000. This led to some
&gt; interesting reflections on the decrease in the bug reporting rate in
&gt; Debian: according to Christian, this could be related to the freeze of
&gt; ""Wheezy"" but could also be the symptom of a decrease of the overall
&gt; activity in the project [4]. Don Armstrong sought a confirmation of this
&gt; theory, analysing the data from the Bug Tracking System [5] and found
&gt; that while there certainly are specific periods of time with a decline
&gt; in bug reporting, ""there's an even more alarming trend of a decrease in
&gt; bug reporting in Debian which has been happening since 2006"".
&gt;
&gt; 3: http://bugs.debian.org/690000  
&gt; 4: http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/10/09#690000  
&gt; 5: http://www.donarmstrong.com/posts/bug_reporting_rate/

According to [the graph in link 5](http://i.imgur.com/g13dN.png), this
is actually an on-going 6-year trend. I honestly believe Debian is the
greatest OS there is -- truly *the* universal operating system -- and
I really depend on it for my productivity, so this has me
concerned. What can I do to help reverse this?

Is this really a sign that the project has been losing momentum? Or is
it a sign that the core packages have matured such that bugs are fewer
and less severe?

I wonder if Ubuntu has something to do with it. Perhaps more bugs
being reported to Launchpad and fewer of them are falling through into
BTS.

First off I want to premise this why my linux experience.  I'm really savvy with computers and I've completed 2 semesters of Computer Science at my university.  I switched to Ubuntu on both my desktop and laptop and I've had a very pleasant experience the past 2 months, but I want to switch to something slightly more advanced.

Debian seems to be the best second choice, but I'm having difficulties with packages (ubuntu software center is very easy to use) and I can't seem to get wine configure properly.

I play a lot of games on my computer and it is important to me to have this working.  Any suggestions for becoming more familiar with the 'debian' way to manage my packages?

I may just be too inexperience to be able to use debian and if you think this may be the case I would appreciate any distro recommendations you can offer.

I've tried it out several times before and never gotten into it because I've always missed applications from Windows, but lately I've wanted to give a proper shot, switching applications I used to something that works natively on Linux:

* Adobe Photoshop - GIMP

* Adobe Illustrator - Inkscape

* Notepad++ - ~~gEdit~~ Geany

Since I use Steam I use a virtual box til' it's released for Linux (i know wine would work, but I'm not sure about it and it might be easier to understand why later on).

Even thought I've been on and off using distros like Debian and Ubuntu several times (using wubi, virtual box) I have some very basic experience using terminal (nano, apt-get) I don't have a hard time installing applications, the thing that pushes me towards the edge a lot though is ""**how do I know what I've installed?**"". For example I installed Dolphin-Emulator to play gamecube games on my PC (since they are blurry on my hd tv on my regular gamecube) so I downloaded the files from git and installed it, but how do I know it is installed? Where do programs get installed?

I've installed several libraries (for example gcc) as well, but I'm not sure how to keep track on what I install and if they are used at all or just collecting dust and this is what bothers me a bit. It's easy on windows to check whatever is installed since I know where the files usually go, but on Linux it's a whole other world which I'm a lost wonderer in for ""stuff like this"".

Don't get me confused, i'm here to stay, but a nudge in the right directions on guidelines would be nice.

**EDIT** I'm also a bit bothered with having to run this everytime I mount something and havn't figured out how to auto mount stuff.

    mount -t ntfs DRIVE /mnt/DIRECTORY_NAME_FOR_DRIVE

For another example, some commercial non-free software just works on Ubuntu, gfx driver binaries and Spotify namely.  How about on Debian?

It's unusable on the command line. No major programs use it. The fact that some dev from there managed to get into the repos and call ffmpeg ""depreciated"" is plain humiliating when you see that ffmpeg is about three times as active as libav in development.

Take for example the simple task it should be to record a screen-cast, something that I could manage in Arch and Gentoo(!!) without any effort. The default tool is record-mydesktop-gtk, the output is a .ogv. So far so good. But because of the situation with ffmpeg no program can even open the output correctly, that bears repeating: not one program on the official repo can open the output of the defacto standard screen casting program without errors.

If you're smart, have a few hours to burn and know what you're doing you might find about the codec situation, find where debian multi-media is, find the correct codecies there and install them. Now the output is viewable. 

But god help you if you try and edit the file before running them through a converter or 5, because none of them result in files that can be opened in any of the major editors (blender and Cinelerra) without a mismatch between sound and video. This happens to be unfixable (or not fixable after 12 hours and a recompile later, which is essentially the same thing).

This isn't something new, it's been broken for two years now and no one is fixing it. This isn't something that should even need fixing. It works out of the box if you don't let vandals the run of the official repositories.

Anywayssssss.... I burned a minimal installer .iso, and before starting I found out that I would need two files for my wireless card to work (iwlwifi-3945-1.ucode and iwlwifi-3945-2.ucode) which I downloaded after a quick search. I saved them on a jump drive, plugged the jump drive in the laptop, loaded the CD, and pretty much followed prompts.


   I was really impressed that the installer picked up the wireless files off the jump drive without any extra prompting or help.

  
Everything seems to be working great; I ""introduced"" the machine to my home wireless during the installation, and the only glitch I have is understanding how to connect to other wireless networks. 

  I took the laptop to work and tried to connect, but I couldn't figure out how. I believe that I need another app to do that, so once I get back home, it's off to apt-get and looking for a wifi picker sniffer thingiemabobber.
Sorry for rambling. I am excited. I like sharing. Good times. Carry on.

As you can see, I like to experiment with different CPU architectures, but unfortunately Arch's lack of architecture support (oh, the irony...) has forced me to use unofficial ports, and rather than having all the packages maintained by one umbrella project, I have to use three separate projects, each of which will refuse support for the other two projects despite being almost identical technically.

I've had minimal experience with Debian on my friend's home server and for a little bit on my old server, but ultimately it wasn't enough to judge it in comparison to Arch. I can see that Debian supports a wide (*really* wide) range of architectures, which is great. However, I've heard a few rumors about Debian from Arch users; can someone please debunk these so I can understand Debian further?

1. Does Debian often drop support for an architecture? I may buy some obscure computers down the line expecting to run Debian on them -- It would suck to have to use a deprecated version.
1. For MIPS and ARM, are the Debian packages usually just as up-to-date as the x86 packages? In Parabola there is usually a considerable lag between when new versions of packages get pushed to x86 Arch and when they finally get compiled and packaged for MIPS.
1. One of the most common complaints about Debian from Archers is that the software is old. I've been told that even in wheezy, pretty critical packages like the Linux kernel often lag a few months behind upstream, in part due to the feature freeze I'm sure, but the packages are old nonetheless. Is this true? If I use sid, will my packages be just as up-to-date as Arch's? Will I still be offered as much support on the mailing lists / IRC if I use sid?
1. One thing I like about Arch is that they in general make as few as possible changes to packages from the upstream releases. This makes getting help from upstream a lot easier, and also makes it a lot easier to understand upstream documentation. Is the same true for Debian? 
1. I can see that Debian is currently a long way from becoming a FSF-endorsed free GNU distribution, perhaps not software-wise, but documentation-wise at least. Are steps being made to get on the list of free distros? Do most Debian developers/users even *want* to be on that list? (for Arch, unfortunately the answer is probably ""no""...)
1. I read once that most Debian mailing list posts are responded to within 15 minutes. Although I prefer to use IRC for support when possible, a response time like that might make me change my mind. Can anyone attest to that? 
1. Arch has a large ""hip"" following, and although I wouldn't call myself a hipster, I'll admit that I kind of like that, and it makes me feel like I'm part of a community more. Maybe this is just my high-school sophomore self speaking, but Debian's community seems to be much more serious in general; is this true?  
1. This a more specific question, but how is Debian support for the Yeeloong specifically? I use the Parabola port because it was made specifically for the Yeeloong, and they supposedly used Yeeloong-specific optimizations when building packages that make it only suitable for Yeeloongs and not general MIPS systems. Debian seems to take the generic approach here (with reason); can anyone attest to the speed?
1. The home server I built was technically a gift to my brother, so it goes in his room (although we both use it regularly). I connect via ssh to do server-side things, and he logs in to the GNOME 3 environment I set up for him and plays games via Wine and Steam for Linux (that I also set up for him). Steam being prepackaged and in the official repositories on Arch makes things a lot easier for me. Is there a Steam package for Debian in nonfree? If not, is getting it to work and updating it that much of a pain? Is gaming on Debian as easy as it would be on Ubuntu?
1. On our amd64 box we have an NVidia GTX660, which kind of requires the proprietary nvidia driver for good performance. Are proprietary drivers easy to set up and maintain on Debian? 

That's all I can think of for now... Sorry for my many questions and thanks a lot for taking the time to answer them.

EDIT: I'll put questions I think of after the OP here.

1. I find that often times, some pretty popular WMs and other system applications are developed and released entirely on the Arch Linux forums (see monsterwm, cdm, etc.). Is the same true for Debian packages?
1. I've heard that really popular packages like MATE and Cinnamon aren't packaged for Debian -- Why is this? Is this a case of them not being packaged for stable only (understandable IMO) or for all versions? Is there a better way to install these packages other than installing from source code directly?
1. If I come across a program that hasn't been packaged by Debian yet, can I package it? In Arch, I can just throw together a PKGBUILD script and throw it on the AUR with just an archlinux.org account and orphan it right away (in fact, most people prefer that you orphan a package if you're not going to actively maintain it) -- Does it require any reputation in the Debian community to add a package to the repositories? I don't really have a lot of time to maintain packages myself -- Would it be looked down upon in the community if I orphaned packages as soon as I put them up?
1. Arch build scripts (PKGBUILDs) are pretty much just pure bash scripts, and they're very easy to change if you want to do so. Are Debian build scripts easy to change? If I want to make a change to the build script to install a custom version of a package in the Debian repositories, would that be easy to do?

I've been using Linux systems since late 1999, and for many years I was a Debian user.  Eventually I switched to Ubuntu because that was the new, cool thing, then Lubuntu when I realized that the first thing I did after installing Ubuntu was to remove 25% of its packages.  I find however that as Ubuntu ""evolves"", the quality of my experience goes in the opposite direction.  I've had more crashes, slowness, and excessive memory usage in the past months than I can ever remember.  I've decided that I want to go back to Debian, but I'll need some refreshers on some things if you don't mind:

1. I know stable is considered rock solid, but I like to have somewhat more recent packages, so is testing still considered a solid choice for someone who wants pretty up-to-date packages?  In particular, Firefox, Chrome and Emacs 24 are at the top of my important to be recent list.  I don't recall having done it in the past, but I think you can specify which branch (here, unstable) to get some packages from, can you not?
2. Because of Ubuntu's rising popularity, it seems that a lot of proprietary software package for Ubuntu specifically (e.g. steam).  Are those packages usually really dependant on an Ubuntu-specific architecture or have you found that most of the time it's just marketing (people know the name ""Ubuntu"" and not ""Debian"")?


**UPDATE:** so I went ahead and downloaded the Debian 7.0 LXDE Live CD.  Since that's the environment I used with Ubuntu, it made the most sense.  The installer was pretty much the same way as it was back in 2004, which was a nice surprise.  Installation was quick and it seems that pretty much everything works out of the box (except the non-free wifi firmware).  

At the suggestion of some people in this thread, I have added backports to my sources.list configuration, the Emacs snapshot repository and downloaded and installed Chrome by hand.  In less than two hours, I am back with a complete system!

Only thing remaining: trying to get fonts to look a little nicer in Chrome.

-After I've run a command in either root terminal or regular terminal, I can no longer run any commands in that terminal, I have to open a new terminal window just to run another command of any sort, or to even get a response from terminal ie typing gibberish and telling me it doesn't recognize what I typed.

-Can't install steam because of the 'jockey-common' issue. did a google search and found this page;
http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/828935361285535308/
which then pointed me here;
https://github.com/GhostSquad57/Steam-Installer-for-Wheezy

The problem with that page...I have NO idea what to do there. I clicked both links on there, one takes me into a directory, the other gives me an error.

-Again, about the nvidia driver thing, I did ask on /g/ and someone told me to type this in terminal;
chmod +x file
sudo /path/to/file

which I did, but I assume I change file on the first line to the complete file name of the driver file? which I did, and then the path to file part, I attempted many times to write out the path to where the driver is located, never successful.

Sorry about this all, I am completely new to Linux, obviously, I just can't figure out probably the most simple things right now..

Now I wonder how do you guys handle some situations...

Do you use third party repos? For example, I looked for Pragha music player in repository and it is not there, it was not supported by Arch also but Arch has its gold mine, called AUR. How do you handle that? Do you compile it yourself or use some third party repo?
One more program I would want to have is cairo-compmgr, but git snapshot, which was also in AUR, and debian does not even have it in repo.

When you compile on your own, how do you setup GCC flags? Do you have something like /home/user/bin for such programs or you build your own .deb packages? If you make .deb packages, how to do so?

One more thing, I have to say that Debian feels really polished, in terms of packages and config files. Everything feels smooth and there was no problem so far, I really like it. Nice job.

Hi Debers? Debianers? Debianists?

I have a bit of a problem. Apparently somebody decided that 'make' should not be included by default (unless you download 25gb of DVDs?). Questions aside about who could make that decision, I have to build my ethernet driver (which is no problem) to get apt to work.

I can't build my ethernet driver without make.

I can't get make in Debian without downloading 25gb of DVDs or manually downloading 500 dependencies. 

I'm attempting to move from Slackware to Debian because I want to try the automagical package and dependency handling.

Anyone have any ideas? Thanks! :)






**EDIT**: Many people have given solutions and I think I should have no problems getting things moving this evening. Thanks for all your suggestions!

**EDIT 2**:
_Outcome_: Okay so eventually got this working. As people were pointing out below the DVD included build-essentials... but its something you have to install separately after the initial installation.

_Remarks and Going Forward_: Coming from my previous distro (and only experience with nix) it didn't even occur to me that one would have to install it (make) separately -- let alone there exists an entire repository of *unused* debs on the DVD. The only nix system I've used before is Slackware and there exists at most several ""extra"" packages on the install media. It seems I've equated its install process as being characteristic of nix distros in general which was certainly not the case here.

My original post could have been more helpful (mentioning I was x64, on the stable channel, installing from usb, etc) but was initially only aiming to get general ideas on where to go and was not expecting such a large community response.

But I want to install Debian. Ive used this image:

firmware-7.0.0-amd64-netinst

The installation starts correctly, and I've used unetbootin to put the iso in the USB.
But when I arrive to the step configuring packet manager, it stops there. If I select that step again, it just appears the same step over and over again, as if the menu wasn't working. If I press ctrl+alt+F4, I arrive to what I guess is syslog, where I can read:
lilo-installer: LILO not usable on EFI PCs without BIOS compatibility; use grub-efi

I cannot do the next step either ""select and install programs"". I can continue to installing grub in a hard drive. It then continues the installation and finishes. I then boot my computer, but grub doesn't load.

I've been able to install wheezy on a virtual machine without any issues, but not in the host. I don't know what else to do. I think it is probably a bug, but I don't know how to contact Debian about this.

The hardware i'm on (disk controller) has their drivers in kernel versions 2.6.33 and up. Debian-stable's current kernel is 2.6.32.

Is there a way to modify the net-install-firmware image to include a newer kernel? I read the debian docs regarding compiling newer kernel versions, but i have no idea how to reauthor a debian install disk.

Bulding the drivers afterwards is not an option because the controller in question holds the system disks.

Any hints?

Update: I almost managed to do what I wanted. Here is my rundown:

* Boot with wheezy beta2 net-install
* Expert/Rescue mode
* Don't select root drive
* Drop to shell
* Partition / LVM manually
* follow [this guide](http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap)  (chroot stuff)
* add [stable-backports](http://backports-master.debian.org/Instructions/)
* install linux 3.2

I have recently acquired a laptop wich I intend to experience linux on. I have managed to install debian so far and I already feel like I'm in way over my head. For example I had to press all the buttons on the keyboard just to find the / button. No biggy though, I probably just need to setup the OS to recognise my strangly formatted dutch laptop keyboard. However There are some problems with hardware that might not be as easy to resolve. This laptop, the compaq 6720s respectivly and it's wifi adapter don't do very well with linux it would seem. I need someone to translate this into terms a former windows (and to a lesser degree DOS) user would understand.


* The Intel 3945ABG wireless controller uses the iwlwifi or the older ipw3945 module. Most recent Linux distributions should support this controller properly.
* The Broadcom BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 02) does not have a properly working native linux driver, so you must use ndiswrapper in distros like Feisty, and Gutsy. In Hardy Beta if you want make it work, you must patch the linux kernel with a proper patch (see forums), or the other, TEMPORARY, way is to remove the b43 nad b43legacy module with `modprobe -r b43` (i don't know why, but blacklisting just don't work), so you must do this every time you start ubuntu hardy and want to use Wireless, without the patch of course), and then use ndiswrapper. 

They lost me at NDIS wrapper. Now I understand you have better things to do then talk me through this step by step, but I need some pointing, preferrably in the right direction!

I tried to bring my Debian install over from my old laptop, which was a llano based laptop, but it seemed to have a mess of issues with various drivers needing to be updated, so I netinstalled from a flash drive.

Debian was installing fine until the installer tried to install Grub, at which point it kept erroring saying that it couldn't write to the MBR or something similar, and upon trying to install LILO, I encountered the same error once again. 

I do have a bit of an odd setup, with a 60gb SSD for debian &amp; a 1TB HDD with the original Win8 install from Asus, so there probably is a conflict caused by that bootloader wise (although I did enable BIOS emulation, so no need for a signed bootloader or anything), but I'd prefer to have Grub or another opensource bootloader while maintaining my current install of Win8. 

I'd really prefer to keep windows 8 installed, partially due to a desire to play certain older videogames that break in WINE, kvm &amp; other virtualization applications I have tried, and in part due to family/friends who are employed by MS, who I'd prefer not to piss off.

I'd love to get this working, any recommendations/ideas to get this working would appreciated greatly.

Update: Tried to reinstall Debian 6 Unstable, it installed fine but then refused to boot when the laptop was in BIOS mode, and thanks to [this commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/15zckw/debian_cant_install_grub_on_a_uefi_machine_with/c7rg9wi) I [opened a bug report](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=697486) on the issue.

1348392195.0,14,self.debian,10c4h3,I'm having a hell of a time getting Realtek RTL8188CE wifi chipset to work...,18,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/10c4h3/im_having_a_hell_of_a_time_getting_realtek/,"I'll keep this short and sweet:

* Debian Squeeze
* During install, warned about missing proprietary firmware which it conveniently couldn't pull over the network despite other packages being automatically upgraded

* I read that support for this chipset was available in the 3.2 kernel, which I upgraded to through backports.
* Added non-free and backport repos to apt's sources
* Confirmed kernel 3.2 up and running
* Installed firmware-linux-nonfree, firmware-realtek packages, with no ostensible changes.
* The following did nothing:
    modprobe -r rtl8192ce &amp;&amp; modprobe rtl8192ce


* Only things listed in iwconfig are eth0, pan0, and lo, all with ""no wireless extensions"".

What in the devil do I have to do to get wifi to work? And yes, I've rebooted multiple times during this process with no luck. (Everything had been done over eth0 which works fine, but for obvious reasons I'd prefer wireless to be working, it's a netbook).


**UPDATE, SOLVED:** Thanks to user sgcb, I've finally managed to solve this problem. Here's a full rundown from start to finish of everything that needs to be done on Debian Squeeze 6.0.5 to get Wifi working with a Realtek RTL8188CE:

* Do all of the following as root:
* Add 'non-free' to the end of the main Debian repo in /etc/apt/sources.list
* Add the backport repo in sources.list (including non-free at the end of this one as well), should look like: 

    deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main non-free

* Run: apt-get update
* Update to Kernel 3.2 by running: apt-get install -t squeeze-backports linux-image-3.2.0-0.bpo.2-amd64
* Reboot into Kernel 3.2, if you're running Grub it should be the default now
* Run the following:

    apt-get update

    apt-get install firmware-linux

    apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree

    apt-get install firmware-realtek

* This is where I got stuck and confused because nothing was working. In my case, however, it turns out that that last step didn't actually install the right realtek firmware. What I needed was here: http://packages.debian.org/squeeze-backports/firmware-realtek

* Download it using wget:

    wget http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/pool/non-free/f/firmware-nonfree/firmware-realtek_0.35~bpo60+1_all.deb

* Install it using dpkg:

    dpkg --install firmware-realtek_0.35~bpo60+1_all.deb

* Reboot one last time
* wlan0 should now show up in iwconfig; Wicd or whatever network manager you use should now be able to see it and connect to networks.

I'm thinking I will go with a full 3TB partition and ext4. (This is just a file storage drive and not the boot drive/partition.)

Since I have an inherent dislike of software ""layers"", I don't like the concept behind LVM, and would prefer to keep partitions more plain and raw. Okay, that's fine, so I figure I can use *parted* to create a GPT partition on the new drive. I won't need to expand/contract partitions and I can handle editing /etc/fstab.

Not having used GPT's partitioning, I did some reading on it, and basically came to the conclusion that it takes the normal disk's MBR and ""extends"" it for new functionality. (Correct me if I'm wrong on that.)

* Kernel: 3.10-2-amd64

On to my issue; as you can see I should have no problem running this game based on my hardware. When I start LFD2 everything loads up just fine; I never had an issue with that. My main issue is and this is random; when I go to load into an online server it's 50/50 whether the game will crash or not. If it doesn't I can play the map until the end at 60 FPS, PING 50 or lower; all settings set to recommend (even went lower; still happens). When the game does crash I don't get any errors. At first I believed this was due to my add-ons because of [this](http://imgur.com/a/JwhT0); I disabled my add-ons but the issue still persist. I even went as far as uninstalling and reinstalling the game twice; still the same exact issues. 


So this lead me to believe that I am missing an important lib file and/or another package. The reason I say this is because before I could install the nVidia driver I had to install ' **lib32z1** ' so I could install the 32-bit OpenGL files; and had to install ' **lib32gcc1** ' so Steam could utilize the 32-bit gcc files.


I searched for the last few days looking for any other libs and/or packages I may need; but I can't seem to find any and that is why I am here. I would just like to know if I am correct; and if I am how do I figure out what package and/or lib file it is I am missing. If I am not correct where should I direct my attention to?


Please let me know what other information you may need and I will happily provided it. I am still very new to Linux (only about a year and a half in) so please be gentle.


Thank you for taking the time out of your day for reading this. 
 

P.S. I searched online (first rule) and just could not come up with anyone else having this problem. All my other steam games work just fine; no issues; but then again they are older than LFD2. 

Also I am running Debian on a 128 GB SSD (6Gb/s; Read/Write over 500 Mb/s) so I have this game installed on a 1TB HDD (7200 RPM 130 Mb/s read rate; don't know write). Don't know if this factors into anything.

**EDIT:** Grammar and Spelling

**EDIT2:** Thanks to /u/Delinquenz I found the solution to my problem; it was a flash related problem. I created a syslink from my libflashplayer.so and put it in my ~/.steam/bin/plugin folder. Gave myself the user the permissions to use it and now all is working fine.

Now I just need to fix my add-ons being displayed incorrectly; but that is for another topic

Thank you all for reading this and thank you /u/Nemoder &amp; /u/Delinquenz for your time and help.

**EDIT3:** I was still experiencing the crashing; but not as often. So I dug a little deeper knowing what my issue now is.
I found that it is best to put the syslink libflashplayer.so file in ~/.steam/ubuntu12_32/plugins then making it executable.

I did as mush rigorous testing as I could by joining a lot of servers and so far not a single crash. Will keep people posted if any new issues arise. ",,False,,t5_2qhkk,1376437471.0,,,True,t3_1k9jdp,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1k9jdp/needed_files_to_run_left_4_dead_2/,

If I understand correctly any recent ATI/Nvidia/Intel chips have issues running on Linux (and Debian's strengths lie elsewhere than keeping up with the bleeding edge).

My current Dell laptop has a NVidia card mainly because Intel cards at the time had next to nil 3D support, but it's been kind of a bumpy experience: no KMS support, the nvidia-graphics-drivers package lagged quite a lot behind the kernel, and I had to pick between using the nouveau driver with no 3d support and the proprietary driver with buggy behaviour.

As far as I can tell most current models use the Optimus technology which until recent was a deal-breaker for Linux users, but I'm told the Bumblebee project has taken great strides in providing support. How stable/functional is it? Is it worth the trouble of tracking non-Debian sources for that?

In short, I'd like recommendations for what to look for in a modern laptop in order to run Debian testing on it. I'm a pretty advanced Linux and Debian user, but I'd rather use those skills for work (I'm a sysadmin) rather than fixing my machine every few weeks.

**SOLUTION WAS TO DISABLE PRIVOXY AND THEN RESET THE CACHE MEMORY**

Ever since I ditched Ubuntu and installed Debian I've had problems with gifs whenever I use Iceweasel. Most gifs, say about 90%, are static and corrupted whenever I access them with Iceweasel.

So anyway I did a little experiment and something seems to have come up.

The first thing I did was to access a gif on the net that didn't work on Iceweasel. I then saved it to my desktop and used Ristretto and Image Viewer to access it. It was still non-working and corrupt. I then pasted its desktop location into the URL field of Iceweasel. Again no workee.

The second thing I did was install Chromium and go to the net URL of the gif. It works. I save the gif to my desktop and then open that new gif with Iceweasel. IT WORKS. It also works in Ristretto and Image Viewer.

So obviously what is happening is that Iceweasel is unable to properly access working gifs from the net, but is able to properly access these same gifs when they are saved to the desktop via Chromium.

To make things even more interesting... I use the Iceape Navigator (Debian's Seamonkey) and, like Iceweasel, cannot properly render the net url gif.

I use Privoxy. So I disabled it on Iceweasel and thus had the net being accessed without a proxy. I clicked on the gif's net URL and... it still didn't work. So it doesn't have anything to do with Privoxy AFAIK.

So I would imagine that there is something between Iceweasel/Iceape and the world wide web which prevents properly rendering gifs. Whatever that thing is, it doesn't stop rendering of gifs that have been downloaded and saved by Chromium.

I run Debian Stable (Squeeze) 6.0.5 and Iceweasel 3.5.16. I'd love to use the most recent Iceweasel backport but I can't seem to install it either in Synaptic or via a command line apt-get.

I also have some media files sourced from Debian Multimedia, though these don't include *ffmpeg libavcodec52 libavdevice52 libavfilter0 libavformat52 libavutil49 libpostproc51 libswscale0* which are sourced from stable.

Maybe another solution would be to upgrade to Wheezy unstable and see what happens. How do I do this by the way?

So after a few months here without signing up and lurking I figured I could gives this a go.

This got me thinking of getting a comletely new system. 
My ISP has of course blocked my port 25 for outgoing mail, but told me I could use their smtp-server.

Basicly I need a system that allows me to use another host for outgoing mail.

(I have ACPI_SLEEP=true in /etc/default/acpi-support).  This seems to work.

I am fairly minimalist and I use Awesome, without any desktop environment or anything like that.  I am fairly sure that if I used Gnome or KDE, I'd have been able to get this behaviour using checkboxes and drop down menus in some pretty GUI somewhere.  It feels pretty unlikely to me that those GUIs would work by directly editing scripts in /etc/acpi (though I could be wrong), so I'm wondering if there's some other way to hook into the ACPI system to control this stuff.  For example, I imagine when you set this using Gnome/KDE the settings are per-user, right?  Editing /etc/acpi definitely isn't that.  Is there some way I can do this just by sticking stuff in my home directory?

This question is related to: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2070.

Does anyone know why this issue has been patched by RedHat and Ubuntu but hasn't been patched in Debian?  I unfortunately don't know enough about programming to understand if the discussion surrounding the GNU complier is a case of the aforementioned distro devs being too hasty or if the Debian patch is doable but extremely overdue.

Or on production system is it better to install from the nginx repos and compile in naxsi, or backport nginx-naxsi from Jessie or Sid?

And I notices that I had a continous 4500 kbytes/s going out. Checked that I had no torrents going on, but still had the traffic. So I checked /var/log/apache2/*.log and holy shit. 

After some panic googling I removed about 90% of the traffic and now /var/log/apache2/*.log is little above normal.  
Hit a lot of ip-adresses using fail2ban and now iptraf -L -v looks like this: http://pastebin.com/f0Wm13p9

And according to netstat -atun | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sed -e '/^$/d' |sort | uniq -c | sort -n

this ip range 217.163.21.0/24 hit me the most (around 700 times before cracking down on the ip's) 

Here is the fail2ban jail.conf stopping most of the traffic: 

[http-get-dos]
enabled = true
port = http,https
filter = http-get-dos
logpath = /var/log/apache2/access.log
maxretry = 5

[Definition]

# Option: failregex
# Note: This regex will match any GET entry in your logs, so basically all valid and not valid entries are a match.
# You should set up in the jail.conf file, the maxretry and findtime carefully in order to avoid false positives.

failregex = ^&lt;HOST&gt; -.*\""(GET|POST).*

# Option: ignoreregex
# Notes.: regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
# Values: TEXT
#

Now, all of this produces a insane /var/log/fail2ban.log seen here:
http://pastebin.com/0xdZ7Kzk

My /var/log/messages,syslog had a few of this: 
kernel: [164483.471462] TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.

And now this is what 5 sec of /var/log/apache2/*.log looks like now :

http://pastebin.com/W1KLzBwm

So what caused this sudden flood of crap? Im not quite sure, but I know that I changed the /etc/resolv.conf on my server to match unblock-us.com. This to allow me to watch netflix in norway. And I have been checking out some proxy stuff on the server. 

So are there any other ways of firewalling this kind of flooding? 
(I have done a few changes to sysctl.conf)

The installation went really smooth and I have what I believe to be a rock solid setup. I am afraid that I may mess it up. I need some tips and guidance on certain do's and don'ts. I also have some questions which I have listed below.

1. I have added the mozilla repository to get the latest version of Iceweasel. Does mozilla provide all the necessary packages in its repos or will I have to all add the wheezy backports repo in case newer version of iceweasel depend on certain packages not present in both the mozilla and wheezy repos?

2. How do you maintain debian in general? I am guessing as time passes by a cruft of unwanted stuff may start to pile up like old kernels, apt cache etc. Any advice on this?

3. I have added spotify repo. However while trying to install the spotify client, I couldnt install it since it depended on libssl0.9.8 (spotify hardlinked library versions) while debian wheezy only had libssl1.0.0. On reading certain blog posts, the instruction was to install libssl0.9.8 by downloading the deb manually from squeeze repos. So at the moment I have both libssl0.9.8 and libssl1.0.0. I know that this is a bad way of doing things. What is the correct way to do this? 

4. I added oracle java repo (from external blog) since I needed it inorder to install a program for my university called Matlab. When I upgrade to the next stable (in another 2 years) do I have to remove oracle java and the spotify repo before proceeding with the upgrade? Would these repos cause any issues?

Thus far, I've managed to get xorg up and running, have a basic GUI, and now I'm a little lost as to where to go next. I figured I'd try getting Nvidia drivers setup by following this [guide](http://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#Installation)

I went ahead and typed apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nv and it's telling me it's teh latest version, so I'm assuming that I have gotten the latest nvidia gfx driver and cannot upgrade further?

No other ejabberd was installed on that vserver before.)

So below is some info on the system, I'm looking for some advice on how to get the system setup as best as possible. And looking forward to rolling releases on a system where I decide how it works/acts.

It seems that most new relevant Linux server installations are based on Ubuntu LTS or RHEL/CentOS. A few years back, Debian was used more. Since then Ubuntu has worked its way through the market and eaten Debian's share and perhaps more.

Why the shift? Most certainly because of predictable long-term support (5 years after release), and Canonical's commercial support.

Now, is it in Debian's interest to be a worthwhile server OS? If so, how can it make itself relevant for the market? All Debian currently offers is more or less 3 years of (community) support for each releases.

I was looking up methods to update my kernel for my system (running wheezy) and I've come across apt pinning for installing packages for when you want to stay on stable but want some newer software. I would like to stay on stable if I can.

What I want to know is whether it's a safe idea to use this method to update to a newer kernel. I notice that Jessie has the 3.9 kernel in it's packages. Does anyone else do this? Has this caused issues?

For some background, I have downloaded the kernel source and compiled before. While that seemed to work, there were some hardware interface issues which I ran into which I don't have the know how or patience to address properly. 

As to why I want a more recent kernel, I have noticed that newer builds seem to support my hardware better, especially my Radeon HD graphics card. Looking ahead the Linux 3.11 kernel looks to have major improvements on the radeon power management front so being able to install the latest kernel to gain those benefits would be fantastic. I don't want to wait 6 years before Debian 9.0 includes the radeon power management improvements.

And when i need to touch the scrollbars there is always a handy handle.

But why isn't this package in debian? I can't find dependencies which would make that impossible. 

Is there any reason?

I am not that sure if this can go in here, but I'll ask just in case: Is anyone having trouble with this USB Wi-Fi card like I am?

Back in Squeeze I made it work just blacklisting rt2800usb driver, but in Wheezy, it keeps asking for firmware!

The system detects it as a valid Wi-Fi device, all it ask for is the firmware although I have already installed 'firmware-ralink'. My built-in Broadcom card worked extracting the firmware with b43-fwcutter with no problem, but not the USB card.

When I blacklisted the module (rt2800usb like I did in Squeeze) the system didn't detect the interface at all, what can I do?

My device, as listed in lsusb is a Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2870/RT3070 Wireless adapter.

Please, if there is a better place to ask for this in Reddit, please point me there and I'll post this again.

RaspberryPi,6,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1cqdly/cannot_ssh_into_host_with_any_username_after/,"I'm posting here because I think this is more of a Debian/Raspbian problem, not specific to RaspberryPi.

I'm a Linux n00b, and I'm trying to learn to be more secure with my devices before I get too deep with setting up services and such. I've been running my new RaspberryPi for a few days with no problems, logging in via SSH and VNC using ssh tunneling.

Today I decided I should ditch the default pi username (which I didn't yet delete or alter in any way) so I created a new username and password. All was fine until I logged out of that SSH session. Now I cannot login using my new username or the default 'pi'.

When I try using TeraTerm (ssh), it prompts for credentials, but when I click OK, it doesn't do anything at all. Using telnet instead, it immediately responds with ""connection refused"".

In Putty, ssh responds with ""Network error: Software caused connection abort"", and using Telnet it just closes the whole program.

Luckily, I can still use VNC to connect, but I'm not sure how to fix this problem. I edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config (if I remember correctly) and added ""AllowUser caveat_cogitor"" but that doesn't seem to have helped, even after a full reboot of the system.

Does anyone know what I can do to fix this problem?

As of now I just downloaded the projects from their sites and installed the forums to /var/www under a folder which my user owns, but when I tried installing the 'phpbb3' package in debian stable, it installs it to /usr/share/phpbb3 owned by root:root.

Are there any standard conventions for which user should own files for a web service in debian? If a regular non-root user is recommended, should it be one made specifically for the service?

I would appreciate advice on migrating from i386 to amd64. I don't want to do a fresh install because I have dozens of packages that would take hours to re-configure on a fresh install. What is the best method?

**Details**

My home server was first installed around 12 years ago with stable/potato. Over the years the machine has tracked either stable or testing and now runs wheezy. Obviously I have upgraded the hardware a number of times. I've also done the manual work to keep the system using most of the ""latest"" advances. eg. LVM, ext4, dependency based boot etc etc. 

The current hardware is a intel 32/64 bit CPU running a 32 bit 686-pae kernel. I'd like to move to a 64 bit kernel (amd64). Re-installing and then re-configuring all the packages I have running will take days of time as I have heaps of services running (apache, courier, openvpn, media sercer etc etc). I figure there has to be a better way to do the migration.

I'm about to move to an SSD drive for the root partition and I figure when I copy the root partition across to the new drive this will be a good opportunity to do the 32 to 64 bit migration. I believe its a good time because if something goes wrong I'll be working on a copy of the system and I can have other drives (/home /backup) physically unplugged.

What is the best way to do the migration?

[This page](http://wiki.debian.org/Migrate32To64Bit) describes a method for the migration in which you overwrite the core binaries with binaries for the new architecture. Then use apt to re-install all the packages with the new architecture. I feel happy attempting this but there may be a better way. 

However, can I use the new the [multiarch support](http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO) to 

1.  install the amd64 binaries alongside the i386 binaries
2.  boot an amd64 kernel
3.  remove the i386 binaries.

Any advice or experience would be appreciated.

I switched over from Xubuntu (XFCE4) to Debian (GNOME3) yesterday, wanting to try something new. Everything seemed to work smoothly, I changed my sources.list to include non-free repositories so that I could install my realtek firmware for wifi. I also changed some of the advanced settings of GNOME3.

Problem I'm having now is that my system tends to freeze/crash randomly/when I open an application. For example: if my network window pops up to ask for my username and password, Debian freezes (or maybe my mouse and keyboard just stop responding?).

I just had it happen again when I opened IceWeasel, I tried navigating to /r/Debian and my mouse and keyboard stopped responding again/Debian froze up.

I've looked through /var/log/syslog and var/log/dmesg but I can't really find anything. The last entry before my system crashed was a DHCPDISCOVER on 255.255.255.255.

Is this more likely to be a GNOME3 or Debian issue, or both? How can I troubleshoot exactly what's causing it? I'm speculating it's because of the realtek-firmware, but I'm not sure, and I don't think I have an alternative to it...

Got Debian Squeeze rock'n'rollin' - but now I'm working on getting Koha (it's library system catalog/backend software) installed on the box. I've gotten to the bit where I'm installing Perl dependencies that Koha needs. 

There were over 30 dependencies and I've gotten all but 3 to successfully install from CPAN. One in particular: 
[PDF::API2::Simple](http://search.cpan.org/~redtree/PDF-API2-Simple-1.1.4u/lib/PDF/API2/Simple.pm) wants to install to a directory that does not exist.

So, I want to try to resolve this issue first. 

Is this a normal thing? How would I even go about solving this problem? 

I have located the Install.pm file that the CPAN install process is looking for but not the place (inc/Module/Install.pm) that the process coming from CPAN is looking for. 

So, again - I'm kind of stuck because unless I have these 3 files I cannot finish installing Koha, etc. 

My guess is that my folder structure is messed up somehow or maybe I didn't probably configure the Makefile.PL in Koha or something else properly.

(Updated question and info from /r/24hsupport, mostly crickets there...)

I am running a 100% clean 6.0.4, only installed nmap and shorewall trough Synaptic. Besides that, it's completely vanilla.

My purpose is to run this machine as a firewall between my LAN and the ISP routermodem.

Anyone have any tips Or have this done before? I followed the docs as well as I could:

Basically, according to the Debian how-to's related to ShoreWall and dnsmasq,all i should do is:

*     Turn startup to 1 in dnsmasq.conf
*     Uncommented the DHCP line in dnsmasq.conf to enable DHCP 
*     Set IP-FORWARDING=On in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf (The default setting was 'Keep'. Don't know what that meant.
*     Run ""insserv -v -d shorewall""

my /etc/interfaces looks like this: 
*(Infact eth0 is eth1 on my machine, writing it this way here since its the most common way of doing it, see clarification below)*

* (the usual loopback stuff dont remember exactly)
* allow-hotplug eth0
* iface eth0 inet dhcp
* allow-hotplug eth1
* iface eth1 inet static
* address 192.168.1.1
* netmask 255.255.255.0
* broadcast 192.168.1.255

And that should be it.

I checked /etc/rcS.d/ and ShoreWall is started *after* Network Manager. (Though both eth's are unmanaged)

Since I followed all the Debian howtos for ShoreWall and dnsmasq, maybe the problem is somewhere with a Debian config file. That's why I am kind of crossposting this from 24hsupport into Debian.
I tried restarting ShoreWall and dnsmasq and networking in different orders, always the same results; everything works except that i cannot get my LAN clients to find a gateway. (but they do get DHCP)
I get no error messages either during system startup or during restaring the programs.

What am i missing? Please help! Been working on this for weeks now and I have a feeling it's just one little detail I am missing.

One thing I should mention is that the netinst image of Debian 6.0.4 detected my interfaces and asked which one would be the primary one. I chose eth0 like its supposed to be. (eth1 is connected to the LAN)

But then I went for installing the DVD ISO instead and it too asked the question about which interface should be the primary. Only the DVD version seemed to think *after the installation was complete* that eth0 was the ~~internal~~ LAN interface and eth1 was the external interface.

Is this some sort of bug? Should I reinstall with the netinst version, or just leave eth1 disconnected and then reconnect eth1 after DVD version installation is complete?

BTW:When configuring all this, I've been careful to swap all instances of eth0 with eth1 and vice versa. I am thinking something inside Debian still thinks eth0 is the LAN interface and that eth1 is the SIP router interface, and somehow that makes the port forwarding not ~~now~~ work properly. /wild newbie theory)

Also should mention that I have internet access from the box it self and it delivers DHCP to the LAN, like I said.
                        
I have a working IPCop solution running now but I also want to use that computer for more than just firewall!
Thanks for any help.

tl;dr: Both eth0 and eth1 works out of the box, I ~~have~~ had working LAN getting, but it's still now getting  it's IP's trough DNSmasq. The box gets DHCP from ISP router. The only thing now is that the (Win7) clients does not find any gateway.
 
Edits: ~~Typos~~, *clarifications*

Edit2: To clarify, all the LAN clients report the correct address for the gateway (192.168.1.1). So it must be broadcast in the correct way. Shorewall also spesifically says IPV4 forwarding is turned on when i restart it. ifconfig reports the correct IP for eth0 it should get from the ISP router (a 10.0.0.0 network) and the static one i configured for eth1 (192.168.1.1)

Edit3: At one point i had the LAN clients talking to each other, but now they don't anymore. They would still not get on the internet when they could talk over LAN. (By this I mean i had my Win7 clients seeing it's others shares during this period. But i have no idea how I did that!)

**UPDATE:** Ok, so i thought, why not uninstall network-manager since i am configuring the net work manually in /interfaces.

Then something happened.
It seemed like my LAN clients was getting DNS lookups but the connections timed out. Also it looks like DNS masq isnt running properly, since my clients IP adresses are not the range i've specifed.

I set the range to 20-40 and IPcop has from 50 and up so my eth has just retained that ip. My Windows client still thinks it has no Gateway. But instead of getting ""Server not found"" i got ""Server is taking too long to respond"".... 


**UPDATE:**
Reinstalled clean
Installed dhcp3 instead of dnsmasq, *and is now working*
Shorewall still will not forward traffic...


**UPDATE:**
If you follow me and krakken's thread you will see that I have everything working now EXCEPT for DNS from the LAN side. I can ping and access internet trough IP from the LAN.

Though I am considering trying out Zentyal instead if I don't get this working soon.

**UPDATE April 15th:**
Tried Zentayal on the lappy, did not like my Intel gfx chipset and could not get into X, kernel panic.
Installing Zentyal on a stationary box I hacked together to see if that works better!
Zentyal in VirtualBox was bliss as fresh blueberries though.

**FINAL UPDATE THREAD CLOSED**
I installed Zentyal instead. Worked out of the box. Just had to specify the DHCP range and give ut a LAN domain name.

Thanks to krakken for trying to help me a lot.

The biggest Issue I face is the fact that the WiFi works great until my laptop goes into standby. On resume, I cannot get the wireless to work. Sometimes it reports being connected, though  there is no connectiviy, other times it just reports no networks in range.

I have searched countless forums, tried all the obvious stuff (rmmod, reload the modules, unload modules before standby, /etc/init.d/networking restart, etc). Nothing has worked so far except a reboot of the laptop.

The adapter according to LSPCI:
02:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8188CE 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter (rev 01)

Modules related to it in LSMOD

Here is how to install the Broadcom 43xx drivers during Debian installation, using b43-fwcutter [on a pre-existing debian-based machine]

[or at least, it worked for me on a dell inspiron 1525]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open a terminal and enter a writable temporary directory, then:

$ wget http://mirror2.openwrt.org/sources/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2

$ tar xvjpf broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2

$ cd broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5/driver/

$ b43-fwcutter -w . wl_apsta_mimo.o

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you will have a directory in that folder called ""b43"".  This will contain the firmware files the Debian installer needs to setup your 43xx as wlan0.

Copy this directory in full to a flash drive, then plug that flash drive into the machine where you are installing Debian.  It will read the firmware files and set up wlan0 for you, at which point you can choose between the wireless or the ethernet for continuing installation.

Some caveats:
I am doing this with a debian testing ISO in expert text-based mode, so I don't know how things might change on other setups.

My current situation is an Ubuntu install through the WUBI installer which essentially means that my bootcamp loader goes to Windows' boot menu, which then goes to grub and then boots the ubuntu install. The ubuntu install lives on a loopback device file on the NTFS partition.

This is the best situation for me, and for technical reasons I don't want to go into separating it out to its own partition is either impossible or dangerous for the system itself.

Therefore, what I would like to do is to create another loopback device file on the NTFS drive, and install debian onto it, and setup booting from ntloader.

I have a few ideas on how this could be done, but could use any thoughts from knowledgeable people. I am assuming that it is at least possible if wubi did it for ubuntu. I am not sure if there is any real tricks they did. I intend to do it while booted into ubuntu.

As a requirement for my university, I need to buy a Macbook Pro this summer. Now, on my current computer I have been using Ubuntu, while playing around with some different Workspace Environments (UI's). I suddenly had an idea!

Here's the thing: I need to use OSX, as it will have most of my programs for school etc. However, I am beginning to learn Python (programming language), and I would much prefer to practice writing code, and starting to make simple programs, as well as run certain games from Steam for Linux on a Linux operating system.

My idea was then to invest in a 128 GB USB Flash drive (Approx. $75), and stick Debian on there. My choice of Debian was because of two factors. It seems like a light operating system, very fast, with everything organized in its rightful place etc. If I stick Debian on there, I can put some simple texpad/notepad editing programs to write simple languages on Debian, as well as having a few Linux games on Steam.

My setup would then be: Normal Mac OSX Mountain Tiger Lion Bear or whatever its called for School, then when I get home and want to chill out and code a bit, plug dat babay right in, restart my computer (making sure the boot order is correct 'n stuff), and then VOILA!

I talked with a buddy of mine, and he suggested Debian, since that's what he set up as a server in our shop. 

So I've been using Debian on and off (mostly off, I still use my Win7 desktop for most of my tasks, and I have that Winstall streamlined as all get-out), but I don't really know what to do with Debian. 

Debian seems to run great, it opens the .pdfs of my textbooks great, Iceweasel is a nice Firefox variant, WINE runs Winplot... acceptably. 

I found Eclipse in the Package Manager, it seems fine. I still haven't copied over my workspace yet, though. 

Over the past couple of months, though, I'm at a loss of what to DO with Debian that I'm not already doing on my desktop. 

It seems fine, I'm just not yet noticing any distinct advantages over what I'm already doing on my desktop. 

Though I did like the multiple desktops, that is a wonderful feature, especially when set up with hotkeys so I can pass programs between multiple desktops and switch between them. 

Edit: To give an idea of my computer experience, I'm currently at work removing junk toolbars (read: all toolbars) and fake PC optimizers from someone's laptop. Hiren's Boot CD, to include MiniXP/7, and PartedMagic, is a regular part of our toolkit.

I also do hardware replacement and repair, including reflows and sometimes replacing power jacks on laptops (depends on the model).

Mostly so that I can know the OS is controlled only by the community and not a for-profit company.

Firstly I downloaded the netinst for squeeze. Burned that to a CD and ran it. It said that my network adapter required non-free hardware. After 30 minutes of searching I found a file containing all the .debs full on non-free firmware. 

I went ahead and put those debs in the root of my external HDD in the ""/firmware"" folder as instructed (I don't have a USB stick at the moment) and rebooted the install. I selected that I wanted to install the missing firmware. It went ahead with no complaint. However, it didn't actually install the non-free files. I then made the call to install just the base system and install the firmware post-install and build my desired setup from there. 

The install got all the way to installing grub (which found my Win 7 install) and then inexplicably failed with no ability for me to see logs. I re-ran it with the same result. I then decided to install LILO just to get the thing going. It installed at that point and I booted the system. 

Instead of being greeted with a shell I could use to install the firmware I needed and move forward, I was thrown into a BusyBox (inframs) prompt. I had no idea what to do and my Google searches proved fruitless. 

I then discovered that there exists an unofficial non-free firmware netinst.iso I tried to download the torrent but it failed saying that ""the download isn't authorised for this tracker"". Downloading the iso from debian.org was going to take hours. It was progressing at a very slow rate. 

I needed to have my computer usable again and had to return to Ubuntu for now.

I even hardcoded UUID's in /boot/grub/*.cfg but it still failed.

* run debian/knoppix  live from cd Failed - did not boot.  (uefi/bios)

And to make situation even worse my trusty cd-rom broke down as well. So now Im back to only using usb drives to boot live systems from (if needed)

Edit: Of course I could use dd but the problem with grub/UUID will still be there.

1329872794.0,0,self.debian,q06fv,I don't understand Debian/Linux - help?,8,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/q06fv/i_dont_understand_debianlinux_help/,"Okay, i hate to admit it, but i've got almost zero experience with Linux. I tried slackware as an OS a while back, and it was unintuitive, complicated and frustrating. It was like trying to drink coffee wearing a blindfold and boxing gloves - it made NO sense and i got in a mess.

So, unfortunately, my new boss has decided i need to be 'up to speed' with linux (despite the fact that only one client uses Linux, and the rest are on Windows - which i can handle).

He's given me a list of tasks to accomplish. Now the VPN is running Debian, so that makes it easy, supposedly. But the documentation might as well be written in fucking Klingon for all the help it is - my brain hurts, and i just don't get it. I'm happy with a GUI now - I last used the commandline for something 17 years ago.

Anyway, the list of tasks are as follows:

Install Apache2? Done. Works on SSL too. Took a week of reading and headaches just to understand it. Apache superior to IIS? Maybe, but not in the setup it isn't!

Install CVS? Done. Dunno what it does, but it's apparrently installed correctly.

Install ViewVC. Now i've installed it, the package is there, all the files are there, but i don't know how the fsck to configure it, although i've pointed it at the CVSROOT directory i created earlier. All the readme's/how-to's i've found don't give you a simple walkthrough of *WHAT* to do and *HOW*. I presume this needs to be setup for use with Apache too, but he didn't specify. 

If i don't get it done by the end of the month, i'm just going to tell my boss i can't do it, and to find someone else for the job. No point in being paid to do a job i'm incapable of doing.

I'm seriously fucked off with this crap. Does ANYONE have a clue wtf is going on? :(

I'm not a programmer. I'm not a scripter. I'm the monkey on the other end of the phone when things go awry that notes down the problem, and can fix it if its a windows issue. Mac? No chance. Linux? KILL ME NOW.

It's not that i don't want to LEARN Linux - i don't UNDERSTAND Linux. And how am i supposed to understand how it works, when every distro is different, and the documentation is either sparse, non-existant or written for people that already understand this crap?

On Windows, almost all apps are installed in a single 'program files' directory, with their relevant config files either stored there, or values written to the windows registry. Linux - everything is scattered around, each distro puts things in different places, depending on the package management, config files aren't always in the program directories - IT MAKES NO SENSE! :'(
