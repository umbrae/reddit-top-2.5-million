1342457274.0,65,self.nonmonogamy,wnfmr,Boyfriend and I had our first date with another woman--**UPDATE**   NSFW,76,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/wnfmr/boyfriend_and_i_had_our_first_date_with_another/,"You guys wanted to know how it went...

Ho. Lee. Shit.

It went well.  So well.  Better than I could ever have imagined.  It began with an amazing date, we found a quiet dive bar and spent a good 4 hours getting to know each other.  Everyone was nervous but we never ran out of things to say, and the mood was great from the start.  About an hour into the date the girl revealed that she was incredibly nervous, and we told her how we were also super nervous, and then we discussed whether or not anyone had done this before.  Turns out she was a first-timer too which was really nice to hear, and she seemed relieved that we were on the same page.  It made everyone feel more comfortable and it was nice just to be able to discuss something that we were all thinking about and curious about.  We had a laugh and a toast.

The entire date was particularly great for me because of how nervous I was that I would get jealous, or feel unexpected negative emotions.  The night before, I'd had a nightmare about the date where my boyfriend and the girl were trying to ditch me to be alone...I think reflecting my fear that I would somehow not be a part of whatever was going on between them.  In reality I never felt even a tinge of jealousy.  I saw him flirting with her and it felt amazing: watching the man I love and am so proud of do his thing was so hot and made me so happy.  Then I'd look over at her and think: this girl's so cool, so pretty, so fun, I want to kiss her and talk to her or hear her laugh.  The best part is, every now and then I'd catch my man's eye and know he was feeling all these good feelings too, and I felt so close to him.  I felt safe and loved.
 
Okay, so the sexy part.  We left the bar and walked back to my apartment, where we opened a bottle of wine and talked a bit more.  The first kiss wasn't as nerve wracking as I'd thought--I sat close to her with my legs touching hers and asked her if I could kiss her.  No shit.  I could.  The best part is, after a minute or two of everyone kissing everyone, she stopped to ask us what our boundaries were and what was okay with us.  I already liked this girl so much but it was extra awesome that she was so respectful.  I told her everything was good and we moved to the bedroom.  

And stayed there for hours.  It was amazing.  She was beautiful and great in bed, and she was really into both me and my boyfriend equally which was a huge relief.  One other fear I'd had was that she'd be more into him and I'd be left out, but she was genuinely bisexual.  

I was worried a threesome would be physically awkward but our chemistry was insane.  I can't even write about it without getting butterflies in my stomach.  I loved being with her, and even more, I loved watching her with my man.  He's the best sex I've ever had and I'm constantly in awe of his amazing body, and seeing another woman experience him, seeing her face and hearing her voice when he was fucking her...yeah. Wow.  Just, yeah.  The two of them worked together with hands and mouths to make me come, then she came while kissing me and him fucking her, then he came onto her back while kissing me. 

The next morning when we woke up, she had left but had written us a nice note.  My boyfriend and I had plans with friends that day, but all throughout the day we kept grinning at each other and sneaking off to kiss.  We had lazy afternoon sex with this girl on our mind and it was so fun exploring my bisexuality with him in the context of the previous night.  We talked about our relationship and trust and love and basically it was a giant gushy love fest of warm fuzzy feelings.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it one billion.

I was chatting with an open-minded but more traditional friend about my open relationship - she asked, doesn't it make you feel bad when he asks to be with someone else? And I realized that, while this absolutely would have been true at the start of our relationship (this is my first open relationship), something in my head had finally clicked the pieces together in terms of understanding non-mono, jealousy, and compersion.

Nonmonogamy doesn't make me feel inadequate - my partner's needs have no relation to my worth as a person. The joy he finds with others does not diminish the joy he continues to find with me. In fact, it seems to enhance our time together; when he comes to me after having been with someone else, he touches me as though every part of me is new to him. 

It isn't right or fair to expect one person to be the paradigm of romantic relationships and fulfill all your most important social and sexual needs. There's an instability inherent in this philosophy - lots of scary ""what if?"" moments, but they come less and less. Any time that I find myself worrying, I remind myself of what I feel - deeply in love, freewheeling hedonistic happiness, and overwhelming gratitude for this person who holds so much of my heart, but lightly and gently, instead of squeezing it tight to himself. Which means my heart has room to grow.

We met as freshman in high school when we were taking the same Honors English class. Our big adventure in love began when I had a friend give him a note from me after class one day (in the usual high school fashion.) Since then, we've been on and off at least 6 or 7 different times.. and currently we are on -- very on. He and I have always gravitated back toward each other when we weren't together. Sometimes we wouldn't even be dating but we'd be hanging out everyday like best friends do. Last summer, he and I hung out all the time, and the only thing different about now is that we're intimate. The best part about it, we're in an open relationship, unlike the last 15 times we've been together. 

When I came back from school for winter break this year, we found each other in bed like we used to be. We had a small bout of real talk... he loved me and I loved him. Things had changed since the last time we were together though. Through my experiences at college, I realized that I wanted to try more open and non-exclusive types of relationships. I was scared that he might reject it or think I'm strange, but to my delight, he was relieved that I had brought it up. 

Now, it has been at least three months since we've been officially open, and we are closer than we have ever been. He knows how many sexual partners I've had, all of the awkward sex stories that I tell my girlfriends, and he's very comfortable with my sexuality. I tell him about the guys I think are sexy, he shares his sexual fantasies with me.. there's very little to no jealousy in our relationship, and we pretty much never fight (although we've never really fought anyway.) Essentially, our relationship is awesome, and none of the sexual encounters I've had since we started back up have threatened it. 

I have friends who say 'I don't think you're going to have a normal relationship after this.' 

Excuse me? What's normal? Secrecy? Fighting? Jealousy? What's so great about it? Normal is a social construct. Monogamy is only considered normal because we've been hearing it over and over. My relationship with my boyfriend may not be normal, but that doesn't make it any less meaningful or functional.

I've been in a relationship with my girl (let's call her B.) for three years, and we're engaged with a wedding date next year. We both love sex, generally and with each other, but we like some variety, adventure, and the occasional validation from others.

We've talked about being casually open throughout our relationship. However, aside from a couple of spontaneous group events (having sex with each other, but in the presence of others doing the same) and some casual flirting, we haven't been able to make it work. Several things got in the way: our shared focus on a particular *type* of openness (no poly/emotional relationships and no pickups, only FWBs); social constraints due to heavy work schedules; communication issues; and some really unfortunate timing during a few opportunities.

With all of those complications, it's been impossible to make it click. We were also feeling like time is running out: I'm in my upper 30's, and we're planning to start having kids late next year. So we were both starting to wonder if it was ever going to happen, or whether we were only OK with openness *in theory*...

Last weekend, everything changed.

For several years, I've had a casual and mutually flirty friendship with another lady (let's call her C.) A month ago, C. sent us a message that she was coming to town and asked to stay with us (B. and I have friends across the country, and we often host visitors). We agreed, and since B. had to work most of last weekend, C. and I made friendly plans to hang out. B. and I knew that C. is pretty sexually open - one of our group sessions was with C. and her guy at the time - so it seemed possible, but we had no expectations.

As soon as C. arrived, it was clear that she and I had chemistry. It started manifesting that evening: B. very graciously tucked into bed early Friday (legitimately, as she had to work early), and C. and I spent most of the night making out on the couch. We took it really slow - clothing didn't even start coming off until after an hour of heavy making-out - but it was intense. C. and I spent most of Saturday and a little while on Sunday in full-on hookup mode (while still managing to keep our evening social plans with B. and others).

B. and I sent C. back home on Monday. That evening, B. and I changed the sheets, showered together (she washed me, almost ritualistically - very powerful experience), and had sex. It wasn't intense or prolonged (truth be told, I was a little spent), but it was the emotional reconnection and closure that we both really needed.

Throughout the weekend, B. was AMAZINGLY supportive. She repeatedly expressed her complete comfort with the situation. She made room and privacy for me and C. She even discreetly *handed me a box of condoms* before C. arrived, just in case.

I was deeply moved and grateful for her openness - and I really wanted to return the favor. ""Some day,"" she said, noting that her flirty friendships with other guys had oddly ebbed of late.

But by sheer luck, one of the guy friends whom B. has *most* wanted to hook up with is visiting town tonight. His main plan is a friendly group meetup... but the possibilities seem VERY ripe, and for once, the timing is perfect.

""Would you be OK with me seeing him tonight?""

""YES! Have fun! Be safe!""

We share a car, and I had some afternoon plans out of the house. So this evening, I cleaned up the car for her, filled it up with gas, and came home to turn it over to her.

""I have no idea what to expect tonight. Things might work out, or might not. I don't even know if he's still interested...""

""Whatever happens is fine, but I REALLY want them to work out for you. If you come home tonight, great - we can have a Game of Thrones and sex night - but I won't expect to see you until, let's say, 10am tomorrow.""

I sent B. out the door 30 minutes ago, and I'm feeling... really, really excited for her - and where this is taking us: it feels like we've finally broken the ice on this aspect of our relationship.

Some observations:

1) Timing. Motherfucking TIMING. Like normal relationships, TRYING to make it happen seems to be a recipe for failure - worse, the added pressure actually reduces the odds of having it work out.

2) My hookup with C. kind of flipped a switch in my mind about the context.

While both B. and I want occasional sex with others as a supplement to our relationship, I think that I was harboring some deep-seated insecurity that she might actually fall for another guy. I wondered if I would feel envious or spurned, and I was leery of becoming hypersensitive and mistrusting. I know unquestioningly that she loves me, and I trust her completely - it's just a product of lingering social anxiety that I've been working on my entire life.

Sex with C. put it in perspective. My emotions and mental calculus finally hit home:

*This isn't a big deal.*

To be clear, I really *like* C., and the sex was wonderful, and I'm hoping that we can meet up again - but basically, it was just some friendly, fun screwing with a friend. It didn't change my relationship with B. *at all*. Sex with C. finally gave me a mental framework for totally accepting and supporting B.'s own sexual adventures.

B. has been saying that all along, and I've completely agreed conceptually; but I don't think I was able to let go of my insecurity until I experienced it myself.

3) Sex with C. not only satisfied my cravings - it also strengthened my relationship with B. First, again, her unqualified support was achingly beautiful. And second, the variety of sex with C. reminded me and made me appreciate what I've loved about sex with B. (not as a competition, but simply as recognition of the contrast).

4) Maybe the most important thing that reinforces the OK-ness of this all is: developing a relationship safety net. Throwing a little more time into my relationship with B., before and *definitely* after my time with C., seems like a great way to validate that our relationship is unchanged. And we have date night planned for Friday - it'll be great to reconnect.

We go through phases of highs and lows like many couples— from warm and affectionate to efficient and businesslike, from screwing like kinky rabbits every night to tumbleweeds blowing across the desert for weeks at a time. But overall my relationship with my partner is rock-fucking-solid. I feel incredibly fortunate to have found someone who understands me, and whom I understand, almost perfectly all of the time. 

We have always felt philosophically drawn to non-monogamy. We got together quite young— we were only twenty when we met. I had dated around quite a bit before I found him. But he, probably like lots of introverted and intellectual dudes, only had one relationship under his belt at the time. I had liked dating very much, and had enjoyed the rush of it: meeting new people, flirting, working them up, getting them to want you, pushing their buttons, exploring them, letting them explore you. He was envious of my experience and wished he could share it. But sexual insecurities and worrying about emotional fallout and timing and work and life kept us from actively pursuing anything or anyone else. We couldn't risk each other. But we kept our separate OKCupid profiles up just the same. Not actively looking— but open. Waiting for the right time.

Then last month a person dropped into my lap. Someone kinky and private looking for a no-strings. He pushed all my buttons, and pushed them hard. And most importantly, he seemed sane— he was reserved and thoughtful, he cared about being safe. I wanted to go for it. 

So I brought it up with my partner. I didn't take a single step without telling him. I showed him the message chain on OKC. After the conversation transferred to text message (with my partner's go-ahead), I showed him those messages. He asked me if the new person excited me. If it turned me on. I said yes. We discussed emotional, physical, and sexual risks. I told him how I felt— that this new person was exciting and I wanted to go for it, but I had zero doubt in my mind that no matter how much fun it was, I would always be looking forward to coming home to him. My partner.

I told him that no matter how crazy it got in the bedroom, I would tell him about everything he wanted to know about. I told him that if even I fucked up and broke a rule, I would tell him immediately. I told him that if emotional stuff started happening (which I highly doubted), I would be honest. He thought about it and said okay. That he was still worried, but he trusted me. That he was getting a little turned on thinking about me coming home to him freshly fucked. About me telling him all the details of how I got manhandled by a stranger. Fucking me afterwards himself, in our own bed. Reclaiming. 

I set up the meeting for the next day. My partner had some conditions he wanted me to meet beforehand. First, when I came home from work, I'd come immediately to the bedroom and drop to my knees on the floor. I'd wait for him to come to me and slide his cock down my throat. Then he'd bend me over the bed and fuck me in the ass until he came. After that, I would be allowed to pull my underwear back on and leave for my date.

It all went according to plan.

I got to the meeting place first. I was standing around looking for a table. I still hadn't seen a photo of his face yet and had no idea what to expect. A pair of hands grabbed me hard from behind, around my hips, and pulled me in close against a tall, firm body.

""Hello,"" I said, looking up at him over my shoulder. ""Hi,"" he said. Handsome. Mellow. Nice. 

We talked. Expressed mutual approval of our first impressions. Some getting-to-know-you, so-what-do-you-do chit-chat. I asked what, in his opinion, would be the best possible outcome of this relationship. His answer lined up nicely with mine. Safe, trustworthy, no strings attached, violent, painful, absolutely filthy sex. 

I laid down some limits: no choking. No breath restriction of any kind. He laid down his: no blood, piss, or shit. I brought up sexual health and STDs. Mentioned that I was as clean as a person can possibly be, since I'd been monogamous for 10 years. He whistled. ""Jesus fucking Christ."" He said he got tested a few times a year, but that he was a bit more blasé about it than he probably should be. I said I'd feel more comfortable if we both had a fresh screener and paperwork to prove it before I performed anything other than manual stimulation— I had managed to get a small cut in my bottom lip and couldn't risk giving him a proper blowjob until it healed. He said that was quite reasonable. He was stroking my knee under the table. Grabbing my thigh. We went back to his place. I texted my partner the address. 

When we got inside he popped open the collar of my dress and reached inside. Grabbed my breasts and squeezed hard. Pulled my dress off, threw it aside, yanked off my underwear, slapped my ass, shoved me onto the bed. Pressed his hand into the wetness between my legs and rubbed and pushed inside. His finger felt unbelievably long and thick, he had huge hands— he curled his finger up, pushing hard against the good spot, and then added another, stretching me tight. I must have made a sharp noise because he said ""Oh, does that hurt?"" in a soft, mocking voice. 

He fucked me hard with his fingers. I pressed my face into the comforter, moaning. He popped out and then I felt a puff of breath and then a long, hot tongue was lapping up firmly against me, long slow strokes, dipping inside, pushing. I think I wailed at that point. He laughed and grabbed my ass with his hands and licked my asshole once, hard, and then his tongue pressed in. I gasped and arched upright and he reached out and pushed me right back down again.

Side note: holy fuck I have never been rimmed before. I did not know what I was missing.

After his tongue withdrew from my ass it was replaced by a finger. A long, rough, thick finger. I privately thanked god I'd been well-fucked beforehand and that my ass was still very relaxed. After a minute or two of fingering me roughly in both holes he flipped me over and buried his tongue in my cunt again. 

I was there for an hour, I think. It was kind of overwhelming. Everything he did felt astonishing. He was violent, but sweet— always mindful of my safety restrictions and of the still-healing cut on my lip. We never kissed. I actually didn't come— I'm a bit tricky to get off at the best of times, and it was all very new and a bit too fast and I think I was still a little nervous. It felt like a trailer for a movie, cutting quickly from scene to scene to scene. I left pleased, but pent-up. Antsy. Wanting more. Next time. 

When I got home I sat down at my partner's feet in our bedroom and rested my head on his knee. I told him everything that had happened. What my stranger had been like, how his hands felt, how his cock looked. The small miscommunications and ways in which it had differed from my expectations. I asked my partner how he was feeling. He said he'd been nervous while I was gone. But that he was much better now. That he was glad I was home and that I wasn't holding anything back from him, or acting worried about his ego. He admitted he was glad, in a selfish sort of way, that it hadn't been a mind-blowingly amazing experience— but that he was also glad it had been good, and interesting, and different. I smiled and said I understood. 

I told him I hadn't managed to orgasm. He raised his eyebrows. Said ""We should probably do something about that."" I laughed as he pushed me onto the bed. He yanked off my underwear, unbuckled his pants. Stroked his cock twice with his hand, rested the tip against my slit. I was still thoroughly soaked and the head felt slick and slippery against me. He pushed in, slowly, to the hilt. It felt good to come home.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,1371166321.0,,,True,t3_1gabdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1gabdo/field_report_my_first_extracurricular_activities/,
1360603936.0,31,self.nonmonogamy,18bh1c,Happy Monday Story of our 1st swinging experience,40,9,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/18bh1c/happy_monday_story_of_our_1st_swinging_experience/,"Been lurking for a long time and finally wanted to create an account because I have a great success story to share.

My wife and I are celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary today. We’ve always been very much in love with each other, while also being very accepting of our individual needs for outside relationships. Though our relationship has been mostly monogamous, discussions over the years have revealed that we are both very open to sex with outside parties.

A couple of years ago, we found ourselves in a situation where a mutual female friend joined us for a threesome and was later given permission to have sex with me on our own. That was a great experience, but I felt like my wife wasn’t getting as much benefit from the new openness of our marriage as I was because I had another woman, but she had not slept with another man since we’ve been together.

That all changed this weekend. A few months ago, some fairly new friends of ours revealed that they were swingers, and interested in becoming closer with us. We were out this past Saturday night at dinner celebrating our upcoming wedding anniversary, and decided we’d have an adventure with them. We planned to hit a local strip club after dinner and invited this other couple along to join us.

There was a great chemistry between my wife and the husband of the other couple. While his wife and I were hitting it off as well. At the strip club, we talked, kissed a bit, and flirted a lot. After spending about an hour there, focused more on each other than watching the entertainment, we decided to move the party to our house.

Everything happened so naturally. Before I knew it, I was naked with another man’s wife, passionately kissing, touching, laughing, tasting. It was a really great time! We were quite intimate, but also very playful. After a couple of hours, she got a text from her husband in another part of our house that things were winding down.

We got dressed and I drove them home, feeling like our anniversary celebration had gone really well, trusting that my wife had as much fun as I did. What I didn’t realize was how that night’s festivities would have effected us.

After only a few hours of sleep, my wife and I were up talking about our experiences; Sharing sexy details and giggling about our adventures. Before long we were making out, touching and having some amazing morning sex. My wife confided that it was weird, after all this time, to be with another man, but she really enjoyed herself. They had sex a few times, as did I the night before, but it clearly wasn’t enough for us. We were very revved up all day. We got out of bed near noon to have something to eat, then went right back for a quick nap and some more fun in the mid-afternoon.

The rest of Sunday was spent talking about our experiences, joking about future adventures and generally reflecting about this wonderful discovery we’ve come across. We are both excited about the future. My wife has already suggested that she’d be interested in trying a MMF threesome as well as playing together with another couple all in one room.

After this experience, I feel our relationship is stronger than ever. We’re just as attracted to each other, if not more so, after getting a taste of something different. I couldn’t be more pleased about how things went.

**TL;DR – My wife and I each got to bang someone else after our anniversary dinner and it made for a great day of sex and love between the two of us.**

1375197953.0,27,self.nonmonogamy,1jcplf,Sent my girl off for a night with another guy - terrifically positive experience! (update),36,9,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1jcplf/sent_my_girl_off_for_a_night_with_another_guy/,"An update to the [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1izzb9/just_sent_my_girl_off_to_spend_the_night_with/)...

As my girl, B., was preparing to leave our apartment to spend the night with a guy (let's call him D.), I was riding an emotional high - this was exciting, and I really enjoyed supporting her adventures. But I wasn't sure how my emotions would respond.

I made one request of her: Please be back by 10am. (We had a 1pm obligation that required our mutual attendance, and I knew that I wanted just a bit of time with her before then.) This wasn't a demand or requirement - it wasn't about control - it was simply a request: the certainty of seeing her again the next morning would calm my nerves through the night.

She agreed, and I kissed her goodbye for the night.

My evening apart from B. started out fine - ordered some pizza, dug into a free-time project. But after a while, irrational doubts started creeping in and tinkering with my emotions: What if B. likes D. better? What if she really enjoys sex with him more than me? What if she doesn't come home tomorrow? What if, what if, what if...? Of course, it was all nonsense - my relationship with B. had been rock-solid, and our sex life was consistently great - and I knew better than to give them any credence, but the buzzing in the back of my mind was becoming a nuisance.

Two things helped.

First, I reminisced about my weekend with C., and I found that it had a calming effect: it brought back perspective. It reminded me that while B. and I are committed for life, I don't depend solely on her for my needs. The weekend with C. was fulfilling for many reasons: developing a closer relationship with a friend; the basic pleasure of physical contact; a reminder that I am desired and desirable; the feeling of personal growth into a new area; and of course, some great, fun sex. In addition to simply enjoying the memories, it reminded me of what the weekend had been about - and that that's the experience that B. was having with D. that evening.

Second, I called a friend and just talked for a long while. Specifically, I called C., because I really wanted to talk to her and I knew she'd be up late. Our discussion neither avoided nor focused on B.'s evening with D.; we just talked about everything - life, work, hobbies, the past weekend, future plans to see each other. Feeling the strength of a social connection further steadied my nerves, and when my thoughts returned to B. after our call, the emotional tinge was attenuated; it just felt, again, like *this wasn't a big deal.*

Our bed felt huge and empty that evening, and when I awoke at 8 am, my nerves were buzzing again - right up until 9:30, when B. texted me:

*I'm coming home.*

A sense of calm and happiness washed over me, and I knew that everything was going to be fine.

Bless her heart, B. walked in at 10 on the dot. Then she made a beeline for the shower... mostly to rinse away the clinging odor of the  cigar bar where their evening had started.

I joined her, and as we washed each other, we talked excitedly about her night. It had been fun! I was surprised at how natural it felt to talk with B. about her night with D. without a shred of negative emotions. We both love sex, and we love *talking* about sex, so this was just a sharing of experiences. That these experiences were brand-new, and had arisen during our relationship, felt... completely irrelevant, actually.

(Sadly, the rest of B.'s weekend kind of fizzled. She wanted to find time with D. for a second evening or a brief hookup, but his plans during his visit had to take priority. Also, D. admitted that he's having a bit of difficulty with the situation: he would really like to *date* B., but that's not what she wants, and he wants to be careful with his emotions. Props to him for recognizing the difficulty; B. is giving him space to work through it.)

Going forward: B. and I are talking a lot about how where things might go. Our circumstances with C. and D. are different, and it leads to some interesting options. C. and I have been talking a lot and developing a deepening friendship, and we'd really like to see each other on occasion - maybe a weekend visit every few months - but it's always going to be long-distance. On the other hand, B. and D.'s relationship is more casual - closer to a booty-call relationship - but D. may be moving to our town for work, so it could be more common. Because of the differences, B. and I are talking constantly about these relationships to ensure that we're still on the same page, and still OK with each others' actions.

I'm sensitive to all of the ways that we could fuck up this arrangement: neglecting each others' needs and our relationship; letting our other relationships become serious; a relative imbalance in our side activities; etc. Seems like good communication can mitigate those problems.

**tl;dnr**: Everything that I'd *hoped* would happen from the first post has come to pass. B. and I each had a great experience that satisfied some deep-seated needs and desires; our relationship feels stronger and more interesting; and we have some new friends and fun thoughts of future adventures. Pleased to report that it's possible to have your cake and eat it, too.

My husband and I have evolved over the last year from swinging to non monogamy / poly  (I hate labels). We date women both together (you know, that unicorn that so rarely exists!) as well as separately. 

Long story made much shorter:

A woman he recently met has decided she likes us both and wants to be with us / hang out with us as a couple.I am over the moon! (we will continue to have 3-person dates as well as seeing her alone, without the other spouse) ...

I didn't mean to sort of 'butt in' and half steal her, but she and I met one day and instantly took a liking to the other Thankfully he is okay sharing as long he gets his alone time too. 

Last night she came over for some sexy times and then we went out for some much needed dinner after that. I am completely smitten. I love to watch them together, sexing, making out, caressing, holding each other, talking, laughing. It is GREAT! I can't wait to spend more time with her together and one on one. 

It gets easier over time 'sharing' my husband - I want the focus to be all on her when she is with us because I get him to myself all the time. I can reconnect with him in bed with more sex, or talking and cuddling and loving. She doesn't get that, so I want her to know she can have that when she's around. For me, reconnecting when she (as a general term not just for awesome-girl) leaves is huge. It offers a somewhat silent reassurance that we are still good, happy (giddy!), and on the same page about our relationship together and with her and that our love still exists. 

So yeah.. She is awesome. We have a great time together, we seem to all flow well in bed together, conversation is easy. I. Am. EXCITED!!!!!!

This weekend, I, with the help and coaxing of my husband (who is overseas right now), hit on a man we had been fantasizing about for months. I went to his tiny hotel room (that he had for a completely nonsexual reason). We hung out on the bed for a few hours, laying there, occasionally touching. I wasn't sure if he wanted sex or not, and at first he wasn't sure if I was. Through conversation and the occasional touches, I ended up with his arm around me. He started rubbing my back, and I made some little noises to let him know I was pleased. From there, it was only a few minutes before I was mostly naked (according to the rules my husband and I agreed upon) and he wasn't wearing any pants. The actual act happened pretty quickly. Afterward, I laid in his bed, our legs were touching, nothing else. We watched TV and chatted for 45 minutes or so before I got up to leave.

Saw him the next day, it wasn't awkward.

Talked to my husband about it. First he got off. Then he started acting upset. We're having pretty decent conversation, but because we're on opposite sides of the world, it's hard to know for sure if I believe him when he says he isn't sad or angry that it happened. I had fun, but not so much fun that I want to do it again if my husband is sad about it but doesn't want to admit that he's sad about it. Mostly he seems to think there was too much intimacy and bonding that happened. I didn't feel like we were intimate or bonding, but I could definitely see a problem if we had been.

Overall, I think the experience went pretty well, but I was wondering if any of y'all had any advice for me.

I'm 23 and bisexual; he is 27 and straight. We live in a small American college town of about 30,000 people.

On to my question/rant: I'm a reasonably attractive woman, I'm well-liked and level-headed with few vices. I assumed that when I came out as non-monogamous, I would have plenty of choices available to me. Not so. 

Other women seem to be interested, yes; they aren't bothered by the fact that I'm not single and are often interested in my partner as well. However, other men are really anxious and hesitant about my situation. ""What about your boyfriend?"" ""I'm not really comfortable with the fact that you're in a relationship."" ""Nonmonogamy's not for me.""

I respect their right to make decisions about what they will and won't do, but I can't lie: I'm disappointed. I'm honest and forthright about my situation, I make my intentions clear, and I don't play games. I don't expect any sort of wine-and-dine treatment, although I would certainly be pleased. I do everything that men say they want women to do and yet, it doesn't work out.

When I'm feeling cynical, I wonder if everyone sees me as my partner's possession and not as my own person, with the right to give myself to whomever I choose. When I'm feeling optimistic, I wonder if guys just prefer monogamous relationships and don't want to get physically close to me because they don't want to get emotionally attached. Either way, it's pretty frustrating.

Have any other women here been in this situation? Is it possible to play it cool and disinterested without being vague and ambiguous? Should I just give up on other men all together?

Not sure how to approach women as a married man.,27,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1bnmfy/new_to_nonmonogamy_not_sure_how_to_approach_women/,"Hi. I now have permission to be sexual with others but I'm not sure how to approach women about it, both while out in real life and online, like a dating site. Ideally I'm open to meeting someone for casual sex or friends with benefits but ideally finding a sex partner and hopefully one who would like to explore by looking for threesome situations or group sex, but that's probably even a harder thing to find. 

When out and about; I'm very honest and I don't want to remove my wedding ring or deceive woman by letting them think I'm single. I assume most women have a problem with hooking up with a married guy, even if I tell them I am in a non-monogamous relationship. I'm sure if I speak to enough woman and casually mention it, I could get a positive response but other than that, I'm not sure where to begin to look. 

Online; everyone on reddit suggests okcupid but I'm not sure what's not working with that. For one, I do mention in my profile what my situation is which could be turning women off, even though I only sent messages to women in open relationships or ones looking for casual sex. And secondly, I have the top of my head cut off in my photo and wrote that I will send more photos upon request because I don't want people to see my face due to career concerns. That's probably not helping either. Just not sure it's a better idea to be less descriptive in the profile while leaving the relationship status and letting them figure that out and waiting to explain in a private message.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. ",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1bnmfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1bnmfy/new_to_nonmonogamy_not_sure_how_to_approach_women/,

* Been dating for 2 years
* We live in a medium sized college town in Midwest USA
* Decided we'd like to be non-monogamous and occasionally sleep with other people.
* We've tried online, and there isn't that many options at all. So personally I'd like to think we could hook up with some of the other college kids in town, just like all the single people do. Our single friends meet people at bars and hook up up all the time. But I never really hear about non-monogamy people doing this and I could see a lot of ways this could backfire. 

So I guess my question is, guys of non-monogamy, how do you meet women who'd be interested in sleeping with you? 

* Do you tell them you have a gf/wife? 
* Are the women you hook up with/date non-monogamous as well, or are they just interested in NSA sex? Do you convert them to non-monogamy? Do you have to explain non-monogamy to them? Are they in a couple as well? Or are they single? 
* Do your friends know that you and your partner are non-monogamous? 

I ask this because me and my boyfriend go out to the bars a lot with the same friends. So, I know that if he started hitting on other girls while he's out there with them, they'd think he's cheating on me. Also, there really is just one bar district that all the college students to go to in my town. So even if he went out all by himself (which is sort of awkward to just go by yourself), he's going to run into people we know. So I don't know if we should tell them, or maybe we should just tell them we're looking for a girl to have a threesome with so it's fine if he's hitting on other people and how do you tell your friends something like this? I don't know. :/

We've tried along the years to do have couple swaps but have never had a good experience. A few months ago, it was revealed that a long time friend and her husband were swingers. One night, my husband and I had a threesome with her. The sex was great for him. 

After a few weeks, we decided to try swapping with them. It was fun and the only good experience that we've had with a foursome. 

Now, we have given each other permission to sleep with them without the other person present with 2 conditions: the other person is told about it as soon as possible and condoms are used. 

Yet, the past 2 times my husband has been alone with her, he has deceived me. The first time, he slept with her while I was away, he did not tell me. She started talking to about the experience as if I knew. I felt left out and it hurt to hear it from another women first. My husbands excuse: he was going to tell me when he came home from work the next day (even though we had multiple text/phone conversations throughout the day). I let it go and I thought I had made my point to fill me in on what's going on. 

Last week, while I was working 3rd shift, I get a flirtatious text from the other women ""I'm in your bed!"" WTF! I was so upset I had to leave work. When I asked my husband why he didn't tell me, he said it was a spur of the moment and was going to tell me as soon as I got home. I looked through his texts to find that this date had been planned for well over 5 hours before she even got to my house. I asked if he at least used a condom and he said yes. Once again, I forgave the situation. 

However, I found out through the other women's husband that they ""tried"" to use a condom and my husband ended up taking it off and having sex without one. I called my husband out once we were alone and he blew off the situation and acted like it was no big deal. As I tried to explain my feelings, his replies were only ""whatever"" ""if you don't wanna do it, we won't do it""

We have been dating for about a year, have been friends for six years, and are very much in love. He really is the most amazing person I could ever hope to find. 

I had never been in an open relationship prior to this one and was not necessarily comfortable with it, but it was a part of my SO's lifestyle so I was determined to be open-minded and give it a try, thinking I could probably learn something and maybe even end up preferring nonmonogamy to monogamy. 

This does not seem like the subreddit to admit this to so please don't crucify me, but after several months of an open relationship in which both of us saw other people, I went to him and admitted that it wasn't something I could see myself doing permanently. I explained that I didn't mind it, that it had its benefits, but that for me, nonmonogamy couldn't be anything more than a stepping stone towards a monogamous relationship. 

I'm sorry if that offends anyone here. I recognize that it is a good way to live and a great choice for many, but after giving it a fair and open-minded shot I've learned that I'm simply not the kind of woman who is hardwired for it. In life, and love, and bed, and everything, what I really want is a mate. 

I was scared this would be a dealbreaker but SO was actually super understanding when I told him. He said that he loved me, and that if monogamy was what it would take to keep me, it was more than worth it. But he asked if, instead of becoming monogamous immediately, he could take the time he needed to continue being open before committing to me exclusively. That sounded pretty damn fair to me and I said yes of course. 

That was a few months ago. We have now been dating for about a year and are still open. I am trying to be supportive of him because I know he is making a huge choice for me. Even so, it is hard not to feel jealous, insecure, and when other women are around- especially an ex of his who has broached the subject of getting back together- very territorial. 

I know it is unfair of me to be this way, especially since he still has every right to pursue other women AND he is sacrificing so much to be with me. I guess I just need some advice on how to stay a good partner and be there for him. I want to support him while he takes his time to say goodbye to this part of his life.

[x-post from r/sex],23,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/12boaw/how_to_get_comfortable_with_my_partner_having_sex/,"Hey r/sex. I've given a fair bit of advice here in the past on another account, and now I'm looking to see if you can help me out in return. In particular, I'm looking for folks with experience with open and/or poly relationships.

The gist of my problem is this: I'm in an open relationship with an amazing woman. I'm all for being open in theory, but the prospect of her sleeping with other people continues to rub me the wrong way, and I want to get over that.

We've been dating for about half a year now and we have a solid foundation. We communicate well, continue to satisfy each other in bed, and have a compatibility that I've never felt before. On every indicator I can see, we have a sound, strong relationship.

We decided to be open when we started dating. She had experience with a failed open relationship before (failed on her ex-boyfriend's part), and wanted to try to do it better. I didn't have any experience, but had spent the last year thinking about my approach to sex and sexuality, and had come to the conclusion that I also wanted to try an open relationship.

Theoretically, I'm all for it. I've read *The Ethical Slut,* nodding my head all the way through. I see sex as something fun for people to enjoy consensually with whoever they want and however they want, because why the hell not? I don't feel any right to tell my girlfriend what she can or can't do with her sexuality, partially because I wouldn't want to be subjected to similar restraints by her. And I've even already had sex with someone else while in the relationship, and she was totally fine with it.

But when she tells me she's going to make out with and eventually have sex with a close friend of hers... I get incredibly uncomfortable. When she goes off to explore some rope play with a friend who's into it, it leaves me feeling off. (And when both are in the same day, they kinda compound each other.) Even when she just tells me about all the pretty people she wants to have sex with, though my brain is shouting, ""Awesome! Have fun! Be you!"", my heart is distinctly unsettled. I've spent the last few days in an odd, slightly ill-feeling space.

I *so desperately want* to just be okay with this all. I want us to have a relationship where we can validate and enjoy each other's sexuality, even when it's with other people. After all, we are both very sexual people, and I want to be able to recognize and appreciate that. And theoretically, my brain is behind this 100%. But not all of me is cooperating, and it's becoming an issue for me.

This *is* something we talked about. Like I've said, communication is something we're good at. But as I see it, this is *my* problem to get over--she's not at fault in any way here.  I don't want to restrict her options arbitrarily, not when I *want* to be okay with this, and not when I've already taken advantage of the openness of our relationship. My current plan is to just let her do what she wants to do, and go however far she wants (within our preestablished rules, of course), in the hopes that I'll realize in the aftermath that I don't have anything to worry about.

Does anyone with experience have any advice for overcoming this and getting my heart and my gut to get in line with my brain? I really don't want to just blame this on the openness of the relationship, because I don't think that's it.

Even just some encouraging words would be appreciated. I've been unstably waffling between a Zen acceptance and absolute freak-out on this issue for the last few days, and right now I'm on the ""freak-out"" end. It's not fun. Any advice or encouragement would really help.

One oddity I have noticed along the way is that whenever I've been with a woman experienced in the ways of non-mono she has certain expectations... And those expectations are that I'm going to bang the bejesus out of her.

I'm not really about crazy rough sex, I like slow and intense, where both partners pay attention to each others needs, but the impression I get from the women I've been with is that all the other poly or swinger men basically just bend them over and fuck them doggy, that the sex they get from others is usually just as rough and hard as possible.

My wife has actually reported something similar from the guys she's been with.

There also seems to be a strong tendency to connect BDSM with the poly lifestyle. Sometimes it seems like unless you're into whipping people you're on the outside looking in.

What's the deal? Am I just imagining all of this? Why must these two things go hand in hand?

**EDIT 1** It's interesting to me that every single comment below seems to agree that this is definitely a thing, and that the focus is on explaining the cause and not disputing whether it's true.  I guess that's perception confirmed?

**EDIT 2** So since almost every comment seems to agree that yes, being non-monogamous means having really rough, doggy-style, bang as hard as you can sex or BDSM... what should the handful of us who really aren't in to that supposed to do?  And what does that fact that this is the case say about the poly and non-monogamous communities?  Any chance that this is turning off people who might otherwise by non-monogamous because out in the mainstream most people are not really into BDSM and are never going to be because it doesn't do anything for them (personally I find it boring and tedious... if you're into it that's fine but it does nothing for me).",,False,self,t5_2rc24,1345152602.0,,,True,t3_yb596,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/yb596/is_nonmonogamous_sex_always_rough_sex/,

He has slept with only one other person, but does sometimes casually date a bit if we talk about it and both feel good about the person and the situation. I want to stress that we've agreed any openness to our relationship is purely physical; we are not polyamorous. Also, we'd agreed that nothing would be done without the consent of the other partner. 

Long cheating saga starts here, feel free to skip to TL;DR:

In September, he started talking to a new girl that made me uncomfortable. She was out of state (in our home state) at the time- he'd met her in college eight years prior and had always wanted to sleep with her. Something just seemed off about the whole thing to me; they texted *constantly*. She started posting things publicly on his Facebook page that seemed ""girlfriend-like."" Then, the kicker- I find out that that he never told her about me. She didn't even know we were living together. I flipped when I found that out and said that was completely inappropriate. He said she didn't know because they ""didn't talk that much."" 

I started getting incredibly anxious about the whole situation. He told me that my anxiety was completely unfounded and almost scolded me for not trusting him. ""I take care of you first. If you're upset, I'll take care of it."" I asked what taking care of it meant, and he said he was going to stop talking to her. I asked once or twice afterward if he had, and he was angry both times that I was even asking. I decided I was being overbearing and that I had no reason not to trust him, so I let it go. I let it go even after she sent a puff-painted envelope to the apartment that we both live in and only I pay for. It had a little loving note inside and a present for him. It was post-marked from before he said they'd stopped talking, though, so I just trusted him that it was over. 

When he was back in our home state, he cheated on me with her. He saw her multiple times and lied about it. He brought her to his apartment where a mutual friend living there saw her in the morning, which is humiliating to me. He did end up telling her about me and that what they were doing wasn't within the bound of our relationship, but neither of them cared. She thought she was in love with him and wrote all about the whole thing in a blog. He started sleeping with her two months after telling me he cut contact- he'd been talking to her the entire time. He slept with her regularly for a month while I was in a different state. He slept with her the final time the night before he left to drive home to me. And he'd been talking to me the entire time this was going on without ever hinting at what he was doing. He only told me because I just had a *feeling* that something was off and I asked him directly if he had seen her. He told me about it like it had been a one time thing. I found out three days after he'd come home that it had actually been on-going for a month. I was furious that he didn't tell me the whole story to begin with. 

Now that I've told you the whole nasty story, let me get to my point. He said that ""all he really did was do what's been fine our entire relationship, just without asking."" He's also scoffing at the discomfort I feel when he tries to touch me sexually, because I'm clearly fine with him being with other women or it wouldn't have worked for the last year. So, he's basically telling me I'm being too dramatic and claims I'm punishing him. After two weeks of thought, I told him I want him out. He says I'm ""tearing down the relationship"" and that no one reacting like this could really love him. Other couples weaker than us have gotten through infidelity, so we apparently weren't that strong to begin with. Etc. Alarm bells are going off in my head that this is manipulation, but I'm still worried that I'm being too cold or too harsh, and maybe I'm freaking out over ""cheating,"" which isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things... or something. 

I know what the responses would be from anyone in a monogamous relationship on this one, so I want to make sure I'm getting opinions from people in non-monogamous arrangements. 

Sanity check, please. 

**TL;DR** - Boyfriend in open relationship slept with woman repeatedly after telling me that he'd cut contact. I'm leaving him and he's furious about me ""overreacting."" Please give me a sanity check. 

EDIT: After finding out that I still wanted him to leave, he became openly hostile and refused to speak to me. When I asked why he was being so hostile toward me this morning, he said very calmly, ""I hate you. I'm not being nasty, I'm just trying not to display how much I hate you. I want no connection with you, so I feel no need to respond when you ask me questions."" I ignored this and asked if he'd found any places, and he reminded me that I'd said he had two weeks. I didn't realize when I'd given him the date last night that he would be making the apartment unlivable; I have a job that I need to function in every day. I said if he's going to act nasty to me every day then he needs to leave sooner rather than later. ""Oh, so you're just going to go back on the decision that you made now?"" He was getting progressively more aggressive, so I just said, ""Yes. Please leave by Saturday. That's one week; I can't live like this for two weeks."" He told me that it's ""all about me"" and on his way out the door said, ""Fuck you!"" and added ""go fuck yourself"" for good measure. 

I don't deserve to be treated like this by someone in my own apartment, and I can't take it for two more weeks. So, I think a week is more than fair. If he comes back tonight and acts like this again or worse, I think I might end up having to just put his stuff in our foyer and change the locks. He's getting really aggressive.

(longish)",25,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1b507c/couples_dating_not_really_swingers_not_really/,"In the past year, my wife and I have moved from a poly-ish relationship with another woman to now dating a couple (entirely different, not the same woman).  The couple identified as swingers.  We don't.  

The main reason for the first poly thing was my wife's attraction to the woman and her interest in seeing me with her.  I was never motivated to have sex outside my marriage.  I didn't have qualms about it, but I was happy with the loads of sex I was having with my wife.  She wanted that to work.  They hit it off for a while, but then fought.  I worked well with her and developed an emotional attachment (which the wife was happy for).  When that all cooled off, I certainly didn't need to try anything again.

Then we met the wife of the new couple.  She's amazing.  I sort of have a non-standard type, and she fits perfectly.  And she likes my wife. The difference this time is that she has a husband.

The husband is a good guy.  My wife likes him, he treats me with respect, and he's really into having group sex with all of us together.  When we pair off into cross-couple couples, he's a little jumpy.  But so am I.  OUr rules so far have been 'no piv with the other wife' and thats not been a problem.

He's out of town for a week or two at a time for work.  He doesn't want us seeing his wife while he's gone.  But he does want to text my wife. Last night, I was asked by my wife if she could ""sext"" (awkward term, that) with him.  It wasn't easy for me, but I agreed.

I'm working here on my limits.  I'm trying to stay on the team.  The whole thing is not easy for me.  And if I weren't trying to be a super guy, it wouldn't be worth it to me.  But god dammit, the other wife is incredible.

I don't think the other husband is playing fair.  He was the one who talked about me having sex with his wife.  He was all ""We're swingers!""  Now he monitors the text conversations between me and her, and yells at her if we're too friendly.  He's really pissed that my wife and I met her and their daughter for lunch one day.  

My thing is that, though I respect the guy, I am getting a strong sense that he's taking it much easier than I have been.  Much easier than he's been asking of me.  If he's really hitting up against some hard walls in himself, I get that.  But I'm not convinced.

So it turns back to me.  Why, then, am I pushing myself so much?  Why am I giving my assent to crap I don't like?  Because of his wife.  Because she's amazing.

I haven't had to cross any hard lines in myself here yet.  Everyone is willing to respect them if I make a point of it.  But I'm walking a fine line of being true to myself and getting with a beautiful wife of another guy.


**TL;DR:  I'm not sure the other husband is a team player.  I'm uncomfortably cooperating to get at his wife. **


EDIT UPDATE:

First I want to thank all of you who responded.  It gave me plenty to think about and to look for.  Things have progressed pretty nicely.  The other husband had a bit of a change of heart.  He has accepted, and actually now started to like the idea that we can all be friends. 

More than that, he has revealed that he is really into me being with his wife in a more complete relationship.  Still no physical contact when he's away, but we're free to court pretty much as we want to.  He even emphasized that the remaining rules are ""for now.""  I think he really likes having some control over the process, and also likes the outcome.

I think it helps that I have been scrupulously careful with his boundaries as he makes them clear to me.

It also helps that we hauled everybody out to near where he was working so we could meet up at a hotel this weekend.

There is still some uncomfortable stuff, but my sense of it has changed as things have progressed.  I'm now feeling that I am probably hoping for too much, not that he is being unfair.

Weird note (at least for me): his interest in this arrangement seems to now be at least as much about seeing me with his wife as it is about him getting with my wife.  They had a good bit of fun together this weekend, but my wife felt like a side show.  She's not used to not being the center of attention, but she's embracing it as an opportunity for growth.

About six months ago, he had a fling with a girl who did the bait and switch thing and tried to break us up so she could have monogamy with him.  It ended up being this huge horrible event, because when she laid down her ultimatum, he actually spent weeks openly debating which woman he was willing to lose.  I was just floored and devastated, because the only solid rule we *had* was agreeing that we weren't replacing each other, and he kind of caved the first time he got high on NRE with someone.  We've talked a lot since, and adapted the relationship to prevent that happening again...

But I can't get over it...  He's been nothing but patient with my feelings.  He gave me space when I needed to take a break from the relationship.  He gives me all of the reassurance and affection that a person could possibly ask when that's what I need.  But...  He likes to stay friends with his exes.  And all of that stuff is in the past.  It was just a dramatic crush that's blown over now.  They're friends, and I know he doesn't make friends easily.

Apparently it's his ""lifelong dream"" to have a threesome with two girls, as he's never done it before. I have had a mfm threesome before, three years ago when I was single.

It's always been my hope that we could try it and get it out of his system and never have to do it again. While I'm not completely opposed to it, (I consider myself straight-ish but I do enjoy playing with women on occasion) I'm not thrilled by it either, which I've made perfectly clear to him.

We ended up having a foursome (for lack of a better word?) with another couple (male and female) several months ago. My SO went down on and then had sex with the girl while I played with her and while she performed oral on her male partner.

Her partner started showing me some attention and my SO immediately stopped having sex with the girl and took me a few feet away. The girl started playing with me, as SO started having sex with me. She went back to her partner and they did their own thing while we did ours.

I was hoping that would cure his desire for a threesome. But it didn't. Now he's hounding me again about having a ""real threesome."" 

A few things are upsetting me about this.

1) He would NOT allow me to have a mfm threesome. He is jealous and possessive and can't stand the thought of another guy touching me, which he has verbalized before, and made obvious when he took me away from the other guy at the foursome.

2) He is acting like it's my responsibility to find another girl, and has even said things to make me feel bad about not making it happen yet. He claims it's easier for me as a female to find another girl than it is for him.

3) I made it clear that I was hoping the foursome would satisfy him and we wouldn't have to go through that again but he says it wasn't the same and he insists on a threesome with only two other girls and no other male present.

So I feel like I'm being a bit petty but 1) I feel like he basically got what he wanted already, and knowing how I feel about it he should be happy with what he got and move on and 2) it makes me mad that he is expecting me to be ok with him doing things with other girls that he would not be with me doing with other guys. 

He says it's not fair that I have been able to experience having a threesome and he hasn't. I said I did those things when I was single and I didn't have to take my partner's feelings into consideration, (which I angrily added that he wasn't doing anyway, even though he did have a partner).

He is aware that I am ok with never having another mfm threesome again; it was fun but it's not like I am craving to do it again, and knowing how he feels about it I would never ask that of him. Not that he would let me do it anyway. But I feel like if he was accepting of a mfm threesome, or another foursome where I was actually able to have some interaction with the other guy, I might be a little less resistant to his desire to have a threesome with another girl. But I feel like he's being a hypocrite expecting me to just bend to his will and do something I don't really want to do, and something he flat out wouldn't let me do.

So I guess my question is: am I being petty and ridiculous here? He keeps saying ""I don't understand why you have a problem with this. You like women."" I tell him ""You don't want me to have a threesome with another guy, how is it so difficult for you to understand that I don't want to have a threesome with another girl?"" But it's like talking to a wall. He says he understands my feelings but obviously he does not if he can't grasp why I have a problem with it. He is allowed to be jealous but I'm supposed to set my feelings aside, I guess?

Sorry for such a long post here but I need to know if I'm being as ridiculous as he's making me feel or if I have some valid feelings here.

(edit: should I also mention we have sex at least once a day? We miss a day here and there when I work an especially long shift and I have to catch up on sleep but that only happens maybe 2-3x a month. So it's not like he's being deprived, and I don't say no to anything he wants to try with me in bed)

My partner (M) and I (F) have been in a relationship for nearly 2 years. For the most part it's been open to varying extents. About a year into it after I had a solo play session my man suggested that we become closed to solo play. So the only times we sleep with others is during group sex or threesomes etc.

This part has been re confirmed recently, 2 months ago we checked in to make sure we were on the same page. 

We have another rule which is honesty and transparency. 

And I'm also the breadwinner, I work long hours where as my man only does part time.

So in oct last year, I was working very long hours 100 plus a week filming a new show and growing my business. My mans behaviour changed, talking was not working so I snooped to confirm my fears. He had set up Internet dating profiles and went as far as arranging a date for whilst I was at work. 

This nearly destroyed us. But we talked through it, agreed to open Internet browsing and sharing passwords to get the trust back. 

In jan/feb after another work trip I find he's been on Craig's list. Discussion lead to him admitting to deleting Internet history due to his shame of his porn habits. We renegotiate our arrangement, he still wants shared play only, still going to be transparent.

May this year we have Internet deleting issues again and I become aware of him having a secret email account. We discuss this, he really is ashamed of his porn, privacy is a big deal. So I drop my trust issues, we reaffirm no solo play. 

Get to the best place we've been since the first issue. I was so happy.


Now I'm away for work. He's at home. He went out on Friday with his best mate, and a female friend. He was drinking. We were texting, I was happy that he was having fun. 

He calls me the next morning and confesses to drunken sex in my house. Turns out he invited his mate and the girl to sleepover at our house. 

He's saying that I've always said mistakes happen and I would be forgiving. And that he told me as soon as he could.

I feel so betrayed, I feel that despite our openness he's found a way to break our trust and agreement on so many occasions. 

His friend says I should get over it as we sleep with others anyway and he was drunk. 

I keep going back to our agreement that solo play is not what we are doing now. I'm having a hard time focussing on work as I can't trust him when I'm gone. 

To make matters worse for me, I love this guy so much I really thought he was my ultimate partner. I'm devastated but I'm thinking of leaving. 

So if anyone can share their view on this that would be amazing, I'm having a hard time getting opinions from people. And I'm really quite lost and confused.

 His reason was because it would 'ruin' it (their relationship) for him and that if he met me the situation would be 'real'. I find this REALLY stupid and juvenile of him and it kind of bothers me. We realized my gf and I that she forgot to mention to him at the beginning that we like to date people that would be comfortable meeting our primaries.

So, I was curious to what you guys thought about this. I know my reasons for being annoyed also it makes any situation or interaction where we would possibly meet ULTRA awkward.

I might just be jealous or feel like I need to be involved, IDK.

Or should we approach people we find attractive?

Are there any tips from people who have experience with clubs about what we definitely should or should not do at these places? My thinking is that the wife and I will drink some, dance some, watch people, and probably bang each other somewhere we can be seen by others, unless we really hit it off with a couple we just met.

Once my boyfriend knew that I might be hooking up with this couple he ended up sleeping with one of our mutual friends.

He told me this morning and at first I thought I could get over the weird feeling I had about it. But then I just started to feel hurt and very distant from him. 

If he had slept with someone who I didnt know I think I would feel differently or if we had slept with this friend together. I have to see her every weekend because she hangs out at where I bartend and Im not sure how to handle seeing her knowing that she slept with him.

Now him and I are stuck. I know he didnt do anything wrong - we hadnt made a rule about mutual friends.  But, I feel hurt and he feels terrible for hurting me.

Update time! After reading over the wonderful advice everyone gave in my last post, the SO (f) and I (m) decided to make a play date with the friends of ours we played with briefly in the hotel a few weeks ago. I'm going to call them Anna and Mike for the purpose of this update. We had them over for homemade dinner and board games. We put a movie and traded some massage, and then at some point in the evening Anna and I headed to the bedroom to play, followed later by my SO and Mike. We kept it relatively low key - fingering and toys, except for the oral that I got from Anna at my SO's encouragement.

All went well! We were fooling around, talking, snuggling, and fooling around again until almost 4 AM when we went for a Denny's run prior to calling it a night. We definitely plan to do so again. My only regret was not going down on Anna, since she and Mike had not been screened recently and while they've each been with very few partners I insisted that we all be up to date on screenings before the point of unprotected oral sex. No one was really interested in dental dams, so there you go.

The other gentleman was in fact larger than I am, but I did not feel any jealousy or competition, which was great - I thought I might feel a little intimidated by having another naked man involved but apparently not. Huzzah for self-confidence! We're planning to have another play date sometime soon'ish, after screenings are done. And in the interim I've bought a new mattress (something I've been needing to do anyways), and it's a king size :D [SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FpBjN7MYSuw/UL0xDilZ9fI/AAAAAAAAAe0/u0EchNYIINM/s320/tumblr_mded1mklTP1qfvgpgo1_500.jpg)

Additionally, I find myself having developed something on a crush on Anna. This is interesting and unexpected. I love my SO to bits, and of course have told her about the crush and she is not intimidated at all. I love my SO and am deeply devoted to her, and she trusts this deeply enough that she's not worried, which is fantastic. Anyone else find themselves in this type of situation (unexpected crush after playing with someone) that could share their thoughts?

Through this lifestyle I have met some of the most amazing people I have ever known and had some truly wonderful experiences, inside and outside of the bedroom. As a sexually open and aware person, I could not be happier that I discovered this lifestyle. 

The problem comes in when trying to date in the vanilla world. I'm unsure of how to approach the whole thing. I've lived in a space where there are hardly any limits, people walk around naked at parties, flirting and sexual debauchery are standard behavior. My friends and I joke that the swinging lifestyle is like Hotel California....""you can check out, but you can never leave."" I've found that being in the lifestyle has totally changed my mindset on things like sex, love, and relationships, and it is truly difficult for me to ""transition"" back to normal vanilla dating. I know that in dating, it's not necessary to lay it all on the table initially, but my lifestyle friends are so much a vital part of who I am now, I honestly feel like I am lying by omission by not mentioning it to someone I am dating. I don't want to freak anybody out, but at the same time I believe that if someone is going to like/love me, they have to accept all parts. If I were to not tell a guy I was dating about my lifestyle, how would it look if the issue ""popped up"" months down the line?

I could definitely be getting way ahead of myself here though. At the end of the day, I would genuinely like to be in a relationship but honestly have no idea how it would work out given the life I live. I am in my early 20s and realize that I have a whole lot more to discover about myself before even considering getting serious with someone, but I have been single for the past three years and....it gets old. I've had many conversations with lifestyle friends who would love for me to find a great guy, but they are just as baffled about how to approach it as I am, seeing as most of them came into it as part of a couple.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation or know someone who has? Advice on how to find a guy who will accept me and my lifestyle?* And how to go about dating..? I realize that there are no simple answers here, and there is no one way to do things but all constructive advice is appreciated.

*As an aside, single lifestyle men are pretty much off the table. None of them wants a relationship lol

I still have a lot of questions about a wide variety of things dealing with non-monogamy, and particularly with opening up to your monogamous partner about non-monogamy.

My wife and I are in a monogamous marriage. We've always been monogamous together. I've always been monogamous in past relationships. She's had one or two threesomes with a past boyfriend, but has otherwise been monogamous. I don't think those were good experiences for her; I think she was manipulated into doing it by her ex-boyfriend (who's a bit of an asshole, obviously). She doesn't really like to talk about it. Anyway...

First, I'm not sure how, or even if, I should talk to my wife about my newly discovered non-monogamous leanings. I'm not the best communicator when it comes to relationship stuff, and I don't want to trigger any insecurities or jealousies (which most of us have to some degree) my wife may have as a result of her past relationship and bad experiences. Maybe I shouldn't bring it up at all? I want to be clear that I consider our marriage -- as a single entity -- to be more important than my individual desires, and maybe this is something I just need to let go?

Some of you have recommended books to other posters in a similar situation, and this could help, but we're not really the types of people to sit down and read about something like this. Talking it out is probably the best for us... that is, if I decide to bring it up with her.

Second -- and I'm probably jumping the gun given the above -- is my confusion and fear about getting involved with someone else. A part of me believes that I'm capable of loving another person in addition to loving my wife, and the other part of me believes that I'm not able to love more than one person and if I fall in love with someone else, our marriage will suffer for it. I DEFINITELY don't want that. So, how can I get some definite answer as to whether I'm capable of polyamory, without jeopardizing my marriage? 

I probably have a hundred little questions and ""what-ifs"", but this post is already long enough. Thanks for reading and taking the time to respond -- I've lurked here long enough to know you're all awesome people!

That being said, nonmonogamy has been a problematic issue in my life.

What I would like: A professional, cute woman with a great intellect and her own thoughts and ideas.  Someone who is open and social with all different types of people, and who also happens to be very sexual and free spirited.  Someone who wants the safety, security and love of a committed relationship, but knows that they couldn't last their whole lives without the chance to try fun and meaningful things with others.  Someone who wouldn't judge me if I'm not having as many partners as they are (I do honestly think it's easier for women to meet guys open to this than it is for an equally cool and attractive guy, plus I'm career focused right now in my late twenties), but instead would want me to join in with kinky stuff (MMF, MFF) and her.  Someone calm, rational, but full of life and sexual adventurousness.

What I've found: Immature people.  Women who are holding onto guys in these kinds of relationships while they see if they can land a better guy for a commitment.  Weird issues (I have my own issues, but I try and be real about them)  Women who do this kinda thing just cause the guy wants it, and they are desperate to hold onto him... etc, etc.  Just messed-up-ness.  I've had at least one awful experience over the years, and I'd say I'm disillusioned, not bitter.  The fact that I couldn't tell my professional/technical friends about it doesn't help.  I'd say on average 25% of people think it's cool, 50% are indifferent (whatever works for you dude!) and 25% freak the fuck out and if they're the opposite sex they think it means that because they're your friend, you want to fuck them... which in most cases would be nice, but I don't like hurting people and causing drama in their lives...

Backstory: we’ve been married 9 years.   In 2011, I developed extremely strong feelings toward a mutual friend of ours (there was no sex).  We hid our relationship from my husband, spending time together &amp; messaging in secret.  When we were caught, my husband threatened to leave.  To keep him, I agreed to completely end that relationship, and husband &amp; I began the process of repairing our marriage.

Since then with a lot of talking, I’ve told him I’m not good at monogamy, and that – while I know I fucked up 2 years ago by having a relationship without his permission - I would really like to explore non-monogamy.  We’ve had a few MFF threesomes, which have been enjoyable for both of us (though more his cup of tea than mine) and now have a regular female FWB.  I’m constantly tempted by other men, though, and broached the subject of a hall pass.  He’s been clear that he has no interest in sex with others that doesn’t involve me in some way, and I think he’s hurt that I still have a desire to pursue others.  

Hence the hall pass – he doesn’t want to hear about anything I do, which still leaves me feeling like I’m doing something really wrong, even though I have his permission.  Added to it that he has no interest in exploring for himself, and I’m not sure this solution is working.  Has anyone tried a situation like this?  Has it worked?  Any advice? 

TL;DR Cheated emotionally years ago, led to me asking for a hall pass.  Got permission, but still feels like cheating.

We both agreed to a one penis policy and I'm fine with that.

It's also a litte disheartening that he spends so much time looking at other women even while we're together. We only see each other once or twice a week at most since we both work crazy hours.

A couple years ago, my girlfriend and I (M) got a bit tipsy and had an FFM threesome with a friend (F) of ours. It was great fun, everyone had a good time, just oral/fingers/toys, no PIV. We hooked up with this friend a few more times under those circumstances, then circumstances changed with that friend so no more adventures happened there. Figured that it was a fun time and we wouldn't be going down that road again.

Fast forward, and a few weeks ago we shared a hotel room with another couple (F and M) who are friends of ours, and some barely clothed massaging turned into a makeout and mutual masturbation romp cut short when some others ALSO sharing the room returned. This renewed both my girlfriend's and my interest in outside play.

See, my current girlfriend was my first, and I am her first partner that actually gave a shit about her, and despite being VERY committed to each other at almost 7 years together we both have confessed to curiosity of what it's like to ""be with"" other people in the PIV sense of the word, and in our romps thus far she's had very little opportunity to fool around with another man at all (basically limited to a short bit of time in the foursome, mostly I've been the lucky guy since she likes playing with girls). While she likes playing with women she also wants a chance to play with men in general. While I have some trepidation about including another man, I want to think I can get over this and give her the same opportunity I've had (via an MFM, or MFMF/variant) even if I'm not interested in playing with another man, and prefer to focus with another man on my woman or his woman. And like I said, we both are curious about PIV sex with other partners.

So my dilemma is not an original one, and I could really use some advice. TL;DR:  I am happily married, and love my wife dearly, but find myself very attracted to a new female friend, who I have been flirting with. I don't want to cheat on my wife. I'd like to keep my new friend. I'm wondering if and how it is possible to get past the attraction?

So, some details. I will try to be completely honest here. 

I am a 41 year old guy.

My wife: I have been with my wife for ten years. I love her with all my heart. She is the kindest person I have ever met. She is beautiful and smart and incredibly understanding and patient. She is there for me when I am down. We communicate well. She is the great love of my life, and we have a up and down sex life, as you might expect after ten years, but it is varied and our kinks match and we have occasional threesomes and have played in swingers clubs and all that. I say this to clarify that we are reasonably broad minded, are not chained to convention, and also that I'm happy with what I have and don't need more. We are child free.

My friend: we met three months ago through work where I am in a senior supervisory capacity to her. We hit it off right from the start. She is outrageously younger than me (20 years). We have been talking outside of work, and I feel a special connection with her. I don't have many friends, and friendships are special to me. She brings a lot of great stuff into my life, a whole new energy, and I would like a genuine friendship with her that will last a long time. She's a great person. The problem is, I am really attracted to her as well. She is very beautiful, and has admitted that she is really attracted to me too. Our chatting turned into hardcore flirting. I shut that down, as there are ethical conflicts at work here as well. I stop supervising her in a few weeks, which removes that constraint. The possibility of flirting more is there when that ends, and I find myself, in moments of weakness when I am tired or stressed or tipsy, feeling drawn to that dynamic.

What to do? Ideally, I would like *to get (edit:typo) past my attraction to her and just have her there as a good friend of the long term. I care about her. The attraction is, if anything, an annoying complication. My wife is fine with that friendship.

I'm playing with fire here, I feel. The rewards of a good friendship would be worth the risks involved in working this out - but I am human and clumsy and, as I said, I'm very attracted to her. Ultimately, my relationship with my wife comes first. I couldn't forgive myself should I hurt her. When we play with a third, it is in a NSA, one night stand kind of capacity. My wife would not be OK with me (or us) sleeping with someone I have an emotional connection with. That is where our lines are drawn.

My wife is going through a period of illness, and I feel it is my responsibility to get my head straight before bringing this to her.

Any advice? Particularly from the 30+ crowd? Any questions I should be asking myself? I want to be thinking clearly.

In that, we've been cool about having sex outside our marriage both on our own and in the same room with each other. Until last night, she and I had only had threesomes with another woman involved. Never a man.

So we ventured to a swingers club. Booked a hotel close to it, so we wouldn't have to drive. I asked here a few days ago what to expect, and honestly going in I thought a bunch of wild things, none of which actually wound up being how I pictured.

This place was BYOB. So we brought a bottle of vodka and a bottle of rum with us. By the end of the night, my wife had single-handedly finished the rum and I had about half the bottle of vodka. We were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. They gave us a tour of the place. Basically it was a small bar area with a dance floor, surrounded by a maze of rooms with mattresses, couches and showers.

I had expected to chat with other couples, flirt and find people with whom we clicked to go to one of these rooms for some fun. It turned out quit different. We did a bunch of dancing. I got close with a few ladies on the dance floor, but nobody really seemed to be chit chatting. As some point my wife and I took a lap, found a room where some interesting stuff was happening. We started fooling around with each other in that room as well. Then the other parties were done and left. So we were by our selves.

Later we ventured into a larger room where there were more people. Again we started kissing, touching, licking each other. This time there were other couples starting up around us. My wife, being quite drunk and daring, started touching others around us. Soon she was a third person in a number of threesomes while I was sort of left alone. None of the girls in the couples she played with seemed interested in me. This was a bit of a blow to my ego.

After a short while, one guy my wife was fooling around with, moved her back in my direction. She gave me a blowjob while he put on a condom and fucked her from behind. She seemed to really enjoy that, as she had been talking about the idea of being with two guys for a while. But it was over pretty quickly with him. She later told me that she pulled away from him when he poked her a bit too roughly, so the other couple left. There was barely any verbal communication

The problem I ran into, was that I could not maintain an erection in these rooms full of people. It was exciting, but sort of intimidating at the same time. So, though my wife and I were very steamy with each other, there wasn't much action on my part. I know it was purely a mental thing because, as soon as we got back to our room, I had the most raging hard on. We had sex in the jacuzzi, on the floor, on the bed. It was awesome when we were in private. After sleeping for only about 5 hours we woke up and had even more sex. Both of us are completely sore now but we had a lot of fun.

So I guess I'm not sure about the whole ""orgy"" thing anymore. I thought it would be really cool to fuck a bunch of people in a group, but my penis seems to disagree. My wife on the other hand, seemed to have a way better time than me. Could this have just been the first time nervousness or should we not bother trying again? I'd love to read some of your experiences with this and see how it went for different couples in similar circumstances.

TL;DR - We went to a swingers club. My wife blew a few dudes, fooled around with some chicks, and got fucked by a stranger. I groped a stranger's titty for a minute but mostly couldn't get it up. :/",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1enie0,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1enie0/our_first_experience_with_a_swingers_club_the/,

My partner and I have been poly for about 1-2 years, monogs prior to that. She and I have pretty clearly established boundaries about our relationship, who else we see, how it all goes together... the usual guidelines and communication to keep things healthy.
Despite this, I'm currently sitting at my computer feeling betrayed. She and I are both seeing people out of town, and I've known of a few interests of hers that didn't work out. There is a friend of hers who lives out of town that I've never met. She has always maintained that there's no romantic interest, although she is attracted to him. He doesn't believe in poly relationships, and may not even believe in pre-martial sex. Anyway, I've suspected that this guy had an unhealthy infatuation with her, trying to be a platonic friend but secretly hoping that one day she'll see the light, break up with me and her OSOs for him, etc. This bugs me, but not in a way where I'd stick my nose in her business or try to control who she is friends with.
However, I've lately found myself troubled. I feel more and more like she's encouraging these feelings. I initially thought this was simply her looking for the extra attention and flattery (I love my partner, but acknowledge her faults where I see them). Then, I became suspicious that she was actually into him too, and outright lying to me about it.

Before people accuse me of reading too much into it, this happened before. There was a guy I knew she was crushing on, she stated it was only friends. When the guy later propositioned her (he was also poly) she then came back to me and admitted she was interested. I asked her why she had denied it when I knew all along and was ok, and she said it was simply nervousness and apologized for the deception. In her defense, this was before she had ever slept with anyone outside the relationship, and it we've heavily discussed all other crushes/hook-ups since.

Back to present situation though, as my suspicion/jealousy grew I began noticing things. Skype windows being minimized when I got home or muted, her switching to text-only chat ""to not disturb me"" when I was at home. Finally I did a bad thing and I checked a recent chat history on her PC. I felt like garbage for doing. But, I saw her sending him messages like ""I think you're amazing"" and earlier ""Psst I'm totally naked right now ;)""
What do, reddit? I feel like this is a far worse betrayal than simply *""I hooked up with someone without asking""*. Am I crazy?

In fact it helped me a lot in solidifying some things I've been learning about myself in my current relationship.

I've been toying with the idea of a nontraditional relationship for a few years, and have always felt like something was a bit ""off"" in previous monogamous relationships.  In my early 20's I thought a lot of it was the desire for other men (I cheated twice in a 5 year relationship).  The thought of my then-boyfriend with another woman turned me on when I was masturbating, but in earnest he wasn't that into it, so I didn't desire him.  I know now that I wanted a man who wanted other women, and men who don't want to leave me by the sidelines to fuck someone hotter just don't arouse me.

I am currently in a relationship with a man who clearly desires other women, and would not be happy with one woman forever (though isn't in love with the idea of sharing me with men).  I think part of my attraction to him stems from this fact about him.  I make myself come 3-6 times a day, always thinking of him with beautiful woman, specifically women with traits I wish I had.  Younger, better body, you get the idea.

I understand that my fetish comes from fear, and that I'm fantasizing about situations that scare me.  And yeah, deep rooted self esteem issues, etc.  I'm aware.  

My problem is this:

I sometimes think I genuinely, really want these fantasies to be real.  When I'm caught up in the moment I actually find myself ACHING to have these fantasies playing out in reality in front of my face, and feel frustrated that they are only in my head.  It's not hot to me knowing that he won't ever get to have these women I want to see him with.  The real excitement comes from knowing that they're real, that he really is fucking these beautiful girls, and that he's more turned on by them than he is by me.  

Another note: We've been together over a year so the NRE is gone, at least for him--not for me.  I still get wet from something as simple as his fingertips grazing my skin.  I feel embarassed about this fact, and wish he had this energy for me.  But also I know that my excitement for him stems from his lack of excitement for me.  The less he wants me, the more he must want someone else, and the more he wants someone else, the wetter I get.

It's a constant conflict.  My biggest problem is the pain that comes with it.  Sometimes I think about it and I'm dripping wet....and other times the same thought just hurts so much.  Like a knife.  It breaks my heart.  I don't know how to get over that pain, and I am worried if I can't, neither one of us will ever be satisfied.  

Sometimes I do think part of my problem is the lack of commitment, there is a very real fear of losing him because he is very reluctant to commit (doesn't want to get married or move in together etc) so when I think about sharing him, I immediately associate it with the fear of losing him that comes with his inability to commit.  

So I guess my question is...Can anyone relate, or help out?  How do I navigate the paradox of my fetish?  What is a good course of action here?  I am lost, and can't really talk to anyone about it except my boyfriend, but I think I need outside advice esp from women who can relate.  For now I'm just taking my frustration out on my dildo and then falling asleep worrying that I will never feel balanced.  It sucks.

But as thing have gotten more serious (we moved in together), I think she's started to feel more secure. We had an MFF threesome with a woman she met (non-sexually) escorting.

So, a couple months ago, I (32F) confess to my husband (34F) that I'm interested in a threesome. We've been married for 4.5 years, together for almost 6. Things are good in the relationship -- we're stable and happy. But, y'know, we fall into the category of ""normal"" married people right now. 

We were excited about the idea of having a threesome and experiencing that together. I was also completely drunk when I told him about it. 

So we continue having the discussion over the next few weeks. How would we pursue a third? He suggested going somewhere like the Bunny Ranch and doing that together. 

I posted an ad on OKCupid...then realized a couple things: 
a) Unicorn-hunting is a thing.
b) I've never been with a woman. This could be super horrible.

So that prompted another discussion: maybe I just look for a girlfriend? Maybe I get to see what all the delicious hype is about? 

Except then I'm just looking for dates...and I just feel weird about that. I want to share with my husband. He's of course ""allowed"" to date as well, but expresses discomfort and anxiety about that -- he'd already found someone who gets him (me) -- finding someone else to be with just intimidated him. 

So then we thought we'd kind of shift gears and just try meeting people in the poly community. I found a group on FB, through some OKCupid friends. 

We went to an event -- just an open mic night, but there were a lot of people in the poly group that went. 

It wasn't our style - lots of extroverts, everyone acted like a big family, but we didn't feel like a part of it - we weren't comfortable. 

So, okay. I'm starting to even second guess having a profile up on a dating site. I don't get the point of it anymore. I'd rather have something happen naturally - but you have to MEET people for that to happen, and both of us work from home...and it's hard meeting people. 

I know that just sounded like whining. I was kind of whining. 

I guess I'm posting this because I know this is a journey -- that the point of all of it is to explore, and to share with each other. 

But what are we looking for and where do we look? Are we talking about swinging? Are we just ""open?"" Am I poly and my husband is just a supporter? Do names even matter?

How do I make this easier on him?",22,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/10xxo5/going_outside_my_relationship_for_bdsm_play/,"First off, I'm cross-posting this in r/polyamory, and also r/bdsm, as it's a major part of this. It's also going to be a bit of a wall of text, so I'll make sure to put a TLDR at the bottom.

Second, I want to be very clear that when I got into the relationships involved, I was quite specific that I was not going to be monogamous with anybody involved, that it was important to me to have multiple
sexual/emotional relationships, and all parties readily agreed to the arrangement.

So back in January, I got involved with my dom, who I'll call John. The sex is fantastic, we click emotionally, and I do love him. Very soon afterward, however, I met my partner, who I'll call Danny. He's definitely my primary relationship-- John left the state all summer, and Danny and I got very close in the meantime. I ended up moving in with Danny a few months ago, which caused a major rift in my relationship with my dom. Recently (as in the past month), John and I renewed our relationship and it's been going very well with him.

The thing is, Danny has been very upset about the circumstances. Even though he specifically said at the beginning that he was more than okay with me having multiple relationships, he's gotten very uncomfortable lately. I'm very much into BDSM as a sub, and while I more than enjoy the sex I have with Danny, I very much need BDSM to be happy. It's more than just a like/hobby: I crave it and if I go without for any extended period of time, I get depressed and stop enjoying any kind of sex as much, which is something that's usually very important to me. That's the main reason John and I got back
together, as while I do love him, and he loves me, we work more on a dom/sub level than as a couple.

The problem is that this makes Danny feel inadequate. He's very vanilla: while I like beatings and torture until I bruise and bleed, he can barely bring himself to spank me half-heartedly once a month at most. I don't want him to pretend for me. It would make him feel very uncomfortable and half of the enjoyment I get out of it is the other person involved loving what he's doing to me. I can't just ignore the fact that he'd be gritting his teeth and bearing it. His inability to give me what I need sexually, though, is making him feel like I'll never be happy with him, that I'll always need more.

I love Danny. He's so good to me, we support each other, we get along great, he's helped me through very rough times and I've done the same for him, and we don't fight about anything but this. I don't
want to split up with him, and he doesn't want that either. I'm just terrified that he'll decide that it's more trouble than it's worth to keep it going, and he's afraid that I'll be unsatisfied and drift away from
him to my dom.

I get angry sometimes. I was so clear that this was what I wanted from the start, and it feels like he either lied or is going back on his word. I know that he can't control his emotional response any more
than I can control the fact that I need this, but I don't know what to do to make this okay for us. We already talk in depth about our feelings, I never have sex with John in our home, I let him know when
and where I'll be out, etc. But every time he sees bruises, what is in my search history or I come home slightly after the timetable, he feels betrayed and gets very depressed.

He says that he's absolutely convinced that it will get better with time, but is there ANYTHING that he or I can do now to make it smoother? I feel selfish and, frankly, dirty that I can't just be a good little vanilla girl for him and make him happy, because I love him so much. I want to make things good for him, but I don't want to stop seeing John, get depressed, and resent Danny for ""making"" me stop and be monogamous. Danny doesn't want that either. I just don't know what to do anymore.

TLDR: I’m kinky, my partner is not. I’m going outside the relationship to fulfill my kinkiness and desire to be non-monogamous, which was agreed upon early in the relationship. This makes my partner feel
depressed and inadequate. How can I help make this easier on him and myself?",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_10xxo5,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/10xxo5/going_outside_my_relationship_for_bdsm_play/,

We're both on OKC but not terribly out about being open. I'm willing to change that, but I kind of get the sense that a married guy looking for extramarital fun is perceived as a creep or a cheater. Married women too, maybe, but that doesn't stop guys from trying, so she gets enough traffic to pick and choose.

But I don't. My new fun has been with a small number of women I've known forever who let their hair down very occasionally. Very nice, but probably not sustainable. And I do want to play, too.

Our rules include honesty all around. We tell each other everything (that the other cares to hear)--that's bedrock--and neither of us wants anything to do with someone else's cheating spouse.

We're both GGG, but except for the nonmonogamy, generally pretty vanilla. While we're not really seeking long term serious poly, we'd probably welcome the right unicorn, and I imagine I might find a good beer buddy in one of the dudes who's banging my wife.

This urge of mine has caused some problems for me, which I kind to cope in silence on as trying to push him to bottom just makes matters worse. 

Because he won't bottom I've considered having an open relationship, the problem is however he refuses to have threesomes as well. We never talked about having threesomes though but it came up in conversation over another friend's relationship and he was very adamant about being against the concept. 

I love him very much and want to stay with him, however I just can't shake this urge, it's maddening. Should I approach my boyfriend on it? If I do, how?

1360891959.0,12,self.nonmonogamy,18jywv,How best to deal with issues or complications while swinging?,18,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/18jywv/how_best_to_deal_with_issues_or_complications/,"I posted Monday about a great experience my wife and I had following our anniversary dinner. Since then, we’ve had some terrific conversations, fleshing out our feelings and boundaries on these developments. We both feel happy and excited about how things went. So much so, that I had a second “date” with the wife from the other couple yesterday. My wife was home and left us alone when clothes started coming off. It was very exciting!

I’m going to name the characters for the sake of clarity here. The husband we’ll call Rick, his wife; Lori. My wife Maggie, and I can be Glenn. So Lori and I have been texting each other and we get along really well. We’ve hung out platonically a few times leading up to this weekend and always have fun. Maggie and Rick have not had the opportunity to hang out. They have seen each other during parties and texted back and for a bit. So on Saturday when we paired off and hooked up, Lori and I had sex after some courtship. Rick and Maggie had the equivalent of a one-night stand.

My wife is feeling a bit of insecurity about her dealings with Rick. She told me he confessed to having never been with an Asian before (She’s half Asian). He hasn’t been very responsive to her texts after Saturday night and he was in a rush to leave after the sex was over. So she’s feeling like he was maybe just trying to check off a list and move on. Maggie says she’s okay with that, but would like to hear that from him so she doesn’t convince herself that she must be a terrible lay (which she’s not, believe me!).

I had a small issue with Rick as well, that might have been a big issue if things went differently. After the fact, my wife informed me that during their second time going at it, he wasn’t able to get things going for a bit and wound up removing the condom to continue. He pulled out at the end. His wife Lori informed me that this is exactly how she got knocked up with their first kid. He had pulled out but she got pregnant anyway. So, disregarding the disease risks for a moment (assuming they’re both clean) I think it was pretty disrespectful to risk getting my wife pregnant without any predetermined consent to take such a chance. Luckily, my wife is not pregnant. So it isn’t a huge disaster, but I want to make sure that something like that doesn’t happen again.

I’m not blaming my wife for this transgression because she’s a novice at this, and was trying her best to please, a guy she was attracted to. Given that she hasn’t been in this situation for about 18 years (that’s how long we’ve been together) I think the experienced swinger should have been more cautious with her.

So in summary, communication is great between my wife Maggie and me. Rick and Lori have been at this a while but they don’t seem to communicate as well. Lori and I have great talks and have defined some very clear rules on how we proceed from her. My wife likes Lori so much that she said she’d be perfectly fine with me continue relations with Lori even if Rick isn’t interested in anything further with her.

How do I bring up concerns and talk things out with Rick? Should I stay out of it, or do I talk to him about the lack of communication between him and my wife?  I feel like he’s got the high ground on how things are done because of his experiences and because he initiated this whole thing, but he’s not acting appropriately. Maggie and I are both okay with the two of them getting to know each other better and fooling around again. I just feel like the rules need to be more clearly defined. Since the rest of us all seem to get along great, I don’t want to bring up concerns when the four of us are together because he may feel like he’s being attacked or singled out. I’d love to get some feedback on this situation from folks who’ve had to navigate these waters before.

My girlfriend [22f] and I [22m] have been together for about 2 and a half years now. She was always the one that was ""ahead"" in our relationship; said I love you first, knew she wanted to be with me long-term first, etc. I have (and sometimes continue to) struggle with feelings, be it sexual or romantic, about a couple of my good friends (my closest friends are girls).

For the longest time my girlfriend could not understand why I would be curious about other girls. She's always had a heavy connection between love and sex; she didn't believe one was possible or good without the other. She's had a few partners (all in relationships), she's been my only sexual partner. I never really had my phase of hooking up, and sometimes I regret that. However, this isn't really about that.

Sunday night my girlfriend confessed that she has very intense sexual attraction to a guy in one of her classes (I work, she's a grad student). In addition to that she told me she's been listening to some of her other classmates and their lives, and that her ideas and conceptions about sex are changing/have changed; she would like to try an open one-night stand sort of thing. We'd both be able to hook up with someone, but she'd have to approve the girl (she kinda has someone in mind already).

I guess I'm just concerned about what it means for us. She had always, ALWAYS told me she could never do something like that. It was kind of a shock when she told me. I'd like to think I'm a little more open. I don't necessarily link sex and love, nor do I think one is more fulfilling than the other (somewhat biased, I guess, since I haven't experienced it without love). I'm just not sure what it could do to our relationship. How we'd view each other after. It took us a long time to get on the sure footing we're on now, partially because of my feelings, partially because of other girls that had feelings for and were kind of pursuing me, and partially because even the girls I know that aren't interested in me like that she used to be very jealous of.

I'm trying to keep an open mind. Part of me would like to do it, mostly because I don't want to regret anything once the time to settle down comes. The other part of me worries; what if she realizes how rubbish I am? What if instead of bringing us closer it drives us apart? What if she does it, then freaks out about me doing it (her prospect is in the same city as us; the likely girl for me is about 3 hours away and BTW, neither of them know about this)?

What are some of your success stories? Failure stories? Is this a reasonable thing to do? Really, I just need people to tell me about their experiences. It's not something I know much about.

We defined this as being allowed to have sexual relations with other people and though it wasn't exactly stated it was implied no continuous hook up buddies, just one night stands. We go to school about two hours away from each other and have for the majority of out relationship excluding summers. 

So over the summer at a family get together my cousins best friend who I have known for several years admitted to being interested in me and I told him no relationship but hooking up in the future is a possibility. We go to the same school and once classes rolled around we started hanging out and talking much more than before. We hooked up once - told the SO he was cool. We hooked up again about a week later and had some of the best sex I've had - told the SO and he wasn't so cool. He felt we were forming a relationship even if it was just physical. I told my SO I wouldn't hook up with him again and told my friend no more hooking up. 

The problem is my SO is two hours away and this friend is a great guy who I love spending time with. There is so much sexual tension when we are around each other and I am worried I am going to pounce on him if we're alone. I am also worried my feelings towards this friend are developing past friendship. My SO knows I had a crush on him previously. Do I tell my SO how my feelings are developing for this other guy?

And I may not have many posts because honestly this would be a throw away userID.
Ok that may be a trick question. But lately I've been contemplating why monogamy. In the modern scientific age I can't come up with a non religious reason to practice monogamy. 

I've been married for a very long time. I think we've both had ""emotional affairs"". I know I've fallen in love with one or two (or maybe even more) people over the course of the last 21 years. I know he's fallen in love with at least one other person that I know about. And each time it almost destroyed our marriage. 

Now I'm considering and have asked my husband if he'd consider opening our marriage to both sexual and emotional nonmonogamy. 
He's very nervous about the idea. He also has self esteem issues. I personally think if he got a girlfriend sexual or non it would help with that, but I digress. 

Is it too late to open our marriage? How can I convince him this may be a good thing moving forward for the next 20 years? In other words can I get him on board? 

I should also add that I've always been a bit kinky and would take what I could get within my marriage. But I/we've really started to explore the local kink/bdsm/powerexchange community.

The overview: 
My wife has a good friend who’s been dating a guy for a year or so. Her friend has expressed that she loves this guy and is patiently enjoying the relationship with the positive outlook that it might progress into something more serious. (As any single woman in her late thirties who’s considering having a family would understand, there’s a time limit to merely dating; it's expected for it to either develop into greater levels of commitment, or call it stunted and move on).  We both like this guy, and not surprisingly, my wife is somewhat attracted to his quirky charm.
Driving home from hanging out drinking with them at the bar the other night, my wife told me that he had followed her into the restroom, where they had a somewhat spontaneous, drunken make out session. My wife felt awful and distraught about it. Not only does she feel tremendously guilty and fears that telling her friend will end their friendship, but the disclosure may also end her friend’s promising, potentially long-term relationship with this man. The quandary: Tell the friend about this drunken encounter and risk the above, or excuse it as a drunken blur and pretend it never happened?  

Regardless of my wife's guilt or fear of losing a friend, I believe her friend has a right to know what kind of man she’s dealing with: A guy with a potentially hurtful “bad boy” streak - one who would make a reckless move on a married woman while he’s in a serious, assumed monogamous relationship himself. 

We believe he doesn’t know that my wife is sexually “available”, I grilled her on what she has told her friend about our relationship (in case it got back to him), and what kind of subtle signals my wife was giving him. She claims innocence, but I have no doubt that they were flirting in some way. My manstincts tell me that she was broadcasting tipsy signals that she was not just attracted to him, but also had a naughty side. (Sure, he was drunk and men are stupid, but his move involved a premeditated, calculated risk of success/failure). 

We've assumed that they don't also have an open relationship  ..it's possible, but not likely. My wife is very paranoid that her friend could eventually hear about this encounter from her boyfriend, be understandably enraged and hurt, and dump her as an untrustworthy slutty-bad-friend-boyfriend-seducer. I've promised my wife that I'll keep my mouth shut and not to get involved in any way, or confront him for making a move on my wife behind my back (I haven't seen him since the incident, but I'll have a very hard time refraining from doing this).  

So, what do you think is the best way for her to handle this? We particularly would like to hear women's perspectives.

TL;DR: My guilt-ridden wife drunkenly made out with a good friend’s boyfriend: Should she tell her friend, or just pretend it never happened?

Here's the sitch: I am an early 20th bi female, dating a mid 20s straightish guy. Theoretically speaking our relationship is open, but in practice, neither of us can get it on with anyone else. Most specifically, we would really enjoy a threesome, but the issue arises that we don't know others who would be for it or are available for it, and (at least for me) I don't think I'd be comfortable having sex with someone I wasn't at least friends with. Obviously the gender we share a full interest in is preferable, but I have confirmed with him that another guy would be okay, as well. Neither of us tend to go ""out"" to bars and the like, and we don't have any experience ""picking up"" anyone. The logical solution would be to go online, but we're both concerned about privacy: we don't exactly want to go out in public with our sex life, and with our many internet traversing friends, putting up pictures of ourselves might get us recognized. 

The other issue (which is probably a fading option) is a (bi) girl that I am interested in, but is in a relationship with a guy who is jealous of her near other men. Long story short, she kissed me (enthusiastically) during one of those party games that's supposed to devolve into sexual tensions. My boyfriend is completely okay with me getting in her pants without him there, but I've got no idea how to bring up that I find her attractive and would gladly make out and more with her if she wanted to without feeling like a drooling idiot. Unfortunately I think I was too closed about the fact that I'd be interested because I think things have cooled off too far.

Update #1 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1iujui/update_28f_with_38m_the_latter_wants_to_have_a/)

Thanks again to all who have read this mess and contributed.

Apparently as soon as he left my house earlier today after what transpired in my update #1, he called a mutual friend of ours, we can call him Scott (I called Scott about an hour later, which is how I know about this). I'm glad they got a chance to speak first because I didn't want my side tainting Scott's opinion of the matter. 

So basically what my SO said was ""She was willing to have a foursome with me but she isn't willing to have a threesome and I don't know why. She likes girls, why won't she have a threesome with another girl?"" He conveniently left out the fact that I *didn't enjoy the foursome* which to me was really a threesome, as I had no interaction with the other guy thanks to my SO, and I had no desire to do it again.  /head desk. 

Understandably, Scott did not understand my resistance for a threesome either until I told him how I felt about the foursome and having no desire to do a threesome, and then of course he understood.

My SO also mentioned the part about how I was willing to do it in the past but not now. Luckily that didn't require any other details and Scott (who, I might add, has been friends with him for about a decade longer than I've been friends with him) told him exactly what I told him: it wasn't the same, she was single then, and it's different when you're in a relationship. You can't use that as part of your argument now.

He still wasn't getting it. I think at this point he is *choosing* not to get it because it invalidates his argument and he is clinging to straws.

Scott (at least according to him) told my SO he was wanting to have his cake and eat it too. Open relationships can't be one-sided like that and he can't ask things of me that he isn't willing to do himself. If he wants me to do a MFF threesome he should be open to a MFM threesome. He ended the conversation by telling my SO that regardless of anything else, he needed to drop all of this right now if he cared about our relationship (this was even before speaking to me and getting the full story). Maybe we could revisit it sometime in the future but right now it was only going to lead to our downfall.

So we shall we what happens. Ending the relationship is a very real possibility to me at this point because as many of you have pointed out, his attitude and actions go beyond just the threesome. He is blatantly disregarding my feelings and I'm not sure if that is something that is going to change. 

I haven't spoken to him since our discussion earlier. I'm not reaching out to him because I am still pissed.

tl;dr He spoke to a mutual friend of ours who backed me up and told him to drop this. Haven't heard from him since.

I've never been good at making monogamous relationships work, nor have I been honest with myself or my monogamous partners about my proclivities. For a long time after a debacle of deception that hurt someone I loved, I avoided serious relationships altogether. Then a girlfriend got pregnant, and wanting the best for our child, we decided to get married. My wife had a miscarriage 2 years ago, but we love each other, and have been mostly doing well together since, with one area of notable exception.

I haven't dabbled in extra-marital affairs, and I don't want to go down the path of deception again. That said, the big challenge in our relationship is sex. She isn't interested in sex, just isn't a very sexual person in general, and I'm quite the opposite.

I've realized that I'm just not an exclusivity-oriented man, I never have been, and I feel a strong urge to explore this. There is also the fact that I'm quite sexually frustrated with the current situation.

I've been a long time lurker of reddit in general and have visited this subreddit a lot. I'm in a polyamorous relationship with my girlfriend of 6 years. 

Anyways....tonight at a local craft beer bar a couple came in and sat next to me at the bar. We struck up a conversation and they said ""we've been dating for 4 years and we are in an open relationship"". This got me pretty excited to meet other open relationship type people in the wild. After I said that I was in an open relationship with my girlfriend of 6 years they said ""Oh we were just joking .. you're so weird I can't believe you are serious"". That got me a little down but I was being as polite as possible.

Over the course of the night the girl made a bunch of pot shots at me. For example I said I wouldn't want a tattoo because it is too permanent, she said ""yeah you have comittement issues"". There was about 5 or 6 remarks similar to this over the course of an hour. 

In the end I was super polite and said thing to the effect of ""I totally respect your relationship and your lifestyle, I just want mutual respect and I'll leave it at that"". 

In the end this experience left me really depressed and made me want to post on reddit. Any advice on how to deal with these issues in the future would be really helpful!

This evening however my wife brought the subject back up. At first it was just like all of the other times we had spoken about it, but after a few minutes it became clear she was much more interested than before. She admitted that our sex has become a little stale and that she had been thinking about finding other partners for some time.

This readily explained the dry spells as she wasn't interested in what I had to offer sexually.

We decided that was the best shot for keeping together without denying her impulses and leaving me sexually frustrated.
We are now in that stage of figuring out boundaries, what each is interested, and how to find someone to engage these desires with. We have already agreed that any experimentation should be done together at this point to keep the trust and communication strong. Her dad has always been a cheater and so we discussed this early on in our relationship anyway and came to the agreement that 'If you ever think you want to be with someone else, come talk to me first.' so this wasn't a big stretch for us.
As far as who we're looking for we've come to the conclusion that a true bi-sexual would be best since we will both be involved, but that seems to narrow options down and we're not sure where to look in our somewhat conservative area.

My husband and I were hoping to find a couple we could have a friends with benefits thing with, but it seems this is leading to something beyond that.  It feels like we are dating and possibly moving more toward an actual relationship with them.  

I don't know what to think.  Part of me is excited.  I'm definitely feeling the NRE.  I am very into them.   But I also find it to be scary.  My husband and I have had many conversations about how polyamory isn't for us, and that we want any sex with others to just be sex.  I don't have anything against polyamory for other people, but I really felt like I was meant to be emotionally monogamous.  Honestly, I think I still mostly feel that way.  Yet here we are dating another couple.  

My husband is totally smitten and excited and seems to share none of my reservations.  I really shouldn't be surprised.  I have always known that he isn't really a casual sex person and is much more about relationships.  This is probably a better fit for him.  

So I've decided to give this a shot.  I spoke with my husband about my feelings and to make sure he is OK with me calling it off at any time.  He was understanding and agreed right away.  I'm not feeling jealousy or anything like that.  I'm just really nervous about trying this out.  I'm just not sure that I am meant to have an actual relationship with more than one person.

I am particularly interested in responses from people who are practicing this type of relationship. What are some things I can expect/wont be expecting and does anyone have any tips to make this work right. I love my wife and the last thing I want is to have a failed marriage because of this.

Back Story -

So without going into too many details to help you guys understand how we came to this discussion I'll explain a little.

My wife started dating my best friend originally but I always had a thing for her and he new it going in to the relationship. He was pretty much a dick/asshole to her all the time and would drag her to my house to play video games. After a while he stopped giving her the attention she wanted and she found it with me as she always had. One thing led to another and I no longer have this best friend. (I know shitty but thats just the way things worked out). During this transition period however she was seeing the both of us until she broke it off with him completely. Which was a very weird position for me to be in during the start of our relationship...

Fast forward a couple of months and we are well into dating when she gets pregnant at 19. After we had our daughter, I went through a very rough time with my life (employment, where I was living - at her moms house do to losing my job in the recession) and fell into a type of depression. I then made the mistake of cheating on her with a co-worker. She found out and it took quite a while to repair things.
Now, almost 5 years deep into marriage she starts bringing up the possibility of having an open marriage. She told me that she always felt this way in her past relationships deep down but was never really able to express them until after she had gotten over me cheating on her. She actually admitted to me just the other day that me cheating on her was probably a good thing in the long run since she can now feel comfortable with the way she has always felt. She says the idea of me being with other girls excites her as well as her being able to be with other guys.

Now I'm not really a jealous person and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to ""date"" other women (just not seriously of course). I think this could work for us if we did things right. We are just both the kind of people that feel like monogamy might not be for us.

It's a small system of several couples, a triad and some acquaintances who sometimes wander into and out of our lives.

The gist of it is that while we consider the family/tribe to be a somewhat static deal, the comings and goings add a level of casual to it.  Within the tribe, we have some people who date consistently across the ""normal"" pairings/groupings, but the flexible nature of those not in a set relationship is what makes it harder for us to say ""Yes! This is swinging!"" or ""This is polyamory!""

I mean, semantically, I know it *is* polyamory, but we were going for a little more precise.  Something along the lines of ""we have serious and somewhat stable relationships, but also bring in random club friends or people at cons because fun.""

The thing is I threw out a word and we were both ""wow - perfect!""...then promptly forgot it.  I *think* the word was something I read in a poly-related book (I've not read many, so it was probably a well-known title)...but gah! It's been on the end of our tongues for months now!

I put this out on fetlife a while back and people came back with good suggestions (I'll add it in a reply to keep things a little shorter).

I’m dating a girl who doesn’t believe in monogamy, which I knew from the start. I didn’t think I’d have jealousy problems with the whole open relationship thing, but the whole thing is making me incredibly insecure. I’ve always been really insecure and generally adopt a ‘fake it till you make it’ strategy. I’m used to being the ‘filler’ friend, the person people hang out with when all their others friends are unavailable, and people pretending to actually like me just to get something they want from me. This changed when I went to uni, but I still feel like I’m disposable to people. This week the open relationship thing went from theory to practice, which I knew would happen, and I feel like all my fake it till I make it barriers just tumbled down. I get moments where I just can’t help but think that she’s looking for someone better than me, that’s she is probably thinking about someone else while hanging out with me, kissing me, etc (which immediately makes my mind go ‘stop touching me stop touching me stop touching me’), that’s she’ll just use me until she finds someone she likes more, that she will only want to hang out with me when I’m the only one available. I mean, why bother with me when she can be with others? She’s way more experienced in the sexual department (I was a virgin before meeting her, this is my first relationship), so I’m still incredible insecure about that as well and don’t see myself being non-monogamous in the near future because of that. At the moment the insecurities about my place in her life and her intentions toward me are killing me, and I know that I should talk about it to her, but I'm not sure I have the balls to bring it up. Does it get better, or does this mean that at this moment I’m asking too much of myself?

My SO is not interested in her playmate for anything emotional - she just wants some fun time.

I'm excited for my SO, and nervous (for her and myself) too. She's clean, he's clean (tested recently, he's in an open marriage), and he wants to meet me before they do anything more serious than just manual play, so it's not going to be extra hot and heavy between them. I am appreciative of this, since it gives us the chance to do the ""sleep on it"" test and see how I feel in the morning. She'll be the first to get actual solo play, which I think is good because out of the two of us I'm the one more likely to be jealous of the other. This is why I'm glad she gets the the first play date.

I think I'm going to be just fine, I'll come back home, she'll tell me about it, and we'll fuck like bunnies.

I'm writing this because I'm facing a situation I thought I'd never face. First, some background story.

Five years ago, I met the love of my life. At first, we were only friends. Great friends. But he had introduced himself as an awkward, former obese dude who was still a virgin at 24. I was almost 19 and just discovering my sexuality with another guy (a complete asshole.) I friend-zoned him, I admit it. So, my first male best friend had to bear with me until I finally realised I loved him as well. We immediately became a couple, learned how to make love, how to be in a fulfilling relationship and had an amazing first 2.5-3 years. We supported each other through very difficult times. We hardly ever argued, got along great with each other's family, and were extremely happy.

However, neither of us knew I was bipolar. I started doing stupid things like drunkenly making out at a disco with a friend. I always confessed immediately, and he always forgave me. I was misdiagnosed as depressive and given paroxetine (an antidepressant which actually triggers mania.) We were also smoking too much weed and getting tired of each other's shit. I grew violent and despondent. I wanted to sleep around. I proposed we ""opened"" our relationship, basically so I could do that and still be with him. He didn't refuse. I slept with two different guys and told him. He didn't seem too upset about it. Yet, he didn't do a thing, even though I wanted him to.

Long story short, I had a huge manic episode and had to be hospitalised. He was with me and my family through all of that ordeal. But the relationship was over. I broke up with him after I was out of the clinic. We still talked to each other online.

I did what I wanted during the 1.5 year breakup. Even tried to have a long distance relationship. Everything failed. No guy made me feel the way my ex did. I missed him, now that my mental health was much better. 

We got in touch again last January, and started to hang out. We got together to smoke weed, watch series/films, and just talk. We didn't have sex. Nobody understood this. We didn't care. Sex became part of our relationship again in April. And, boy, it was amazing as always. Even better. I started to fall for him again. I lost interest in other guys, or so I thought. We're even planning to go to Europe together.

But he hasn't sleep with or loved any other girl but me, and he doesn't want to miss out on that. I completely understand him. And me, I thought I didn't want any other guy until last Saturday I ran into a fuck buddy I used to have. I realised I still wanted to sleep with him, and so, with my ex's knowledge, I did. Neither of us feels guilt or shame. I had an amazing time, and that was all. I know I love only my ex. Fuck, I'd be his wife if he asked.

The problem is how can we find a balance between what we want and what is ""normal""? Is ""monogamy"" normal? My ex has always questioned that. He enjoys seeing me sexually fulfilled, even if it's not only by him. (But with him, I make love. Others, I just fuck.)

What would our friends think? I may sound stupid but I don't want to subscribe to a ""lifestyle"" and be weird and militant about it. I haven't yet been in my ex's shoes. I wouldn't mind if he fucked some other girl, as long as he didn't leave me for her. 

So, what is the answer, if there's any? What do you guys think of this situation? Thanks for reading this VERY long rant.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1hgemd,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1hgemd/afraid_of_thinking_outside_of_the_box/,

Recently she has been wedging a gap between us and the reason became apparent to me just yesterday. I found out that she has been getting physical with one of her coworkers after repeatedly denying there was anything going on. Her excuse for lying was that she was protecting my feelings and didnt want me to be hurt... kinda lame but whatevs.. She said she is regretting it and doesnt feel like she could be in a relationship with me because she feels unworthy now. She moved out yesterday and I remained calm and collected despite being unable to control my trembling from emotion.


So I have all these feelings like I have been cheated on and feel betrayed but in the back of my mind I think, she has been with me since that has happened and logically nothing has changed but my knowledge of her activities.

 I was reading in a book talking about the concept of Sex 3.0 and how jealousy is unnatural and stems from sexual possessiveness. After reading over how a fenced in relationship can have all these unnecessary limitations on the relationship and your partner is like your property. Made me really examine my feelings and after accepting that sex is only a part of a relationship, the person means a lot more to me than just a sexual object.


So when we split up she expressed wanting to be friends and still being sexual together. I cannot help but think that the feelings I have come off as immature and counterproductive to being able to love a person unconditionally for who they are and accept the fact she still wants me in her life as a friend and companion

I was planning on giving her the last of her things tomorrow but now feel like i want to talk with her about this option. I feel like if she was able to finally be completely honest with me about all of the lying then we can move forward with this and still be able to share our love and affection for each other.

I am just looking for some advice here from someone that can help provide me with some understanding and maybe enlighten me on something I am overlooking in my situation.


btw she has been recently diagnosed with bipolar I and has manic episodes which she also says played a part in this.

I'm a female in my early 20s who is about to get married to my fiance of over 4 years. We have always had an amazing relationship and I have never doubted that he is my soul mate. However, recently I keep having feelings like maybe I'm missing out on something. Our sex life has been ok, but nothing like it used to be, and it has been that way for over 6 months now. We've been talking about it more and he's really trying, but we are both very busy and it has been difficult. 

Since I brought up our sex issues to him, he has been having problems with self-esteem. He is not wanting sex as much because he is worried about how I'm going to react if it isn't mind-blowing. I'm trying to be open about everything, but he becomes hard to talk to sometimes. He is easily defensive and it makes me reluctant to bring things up sometimes. I know that we need to communicate, because otherwise things are just going to build up. 

Here's issue number one: I've been thinking about sex with other guys a lot lately. When my fiance and I have sex, it is usually awesome, but we aren't having sex as much as I want to. I also find myself easily drawn to other men when I go out. I've been really upset about having these feelings, and I've seriously spent days thinking to myself and trying to analyze the situation to stop having these thoughts, but it isn't working.

Somehow I ended up talking to someone and they mentioned that their relationship was a little alternative and they described the situation. (More or less threesomes as long as both parties are attracted to the person). It got me thinking about non-monogamous relationships, and wondering if it could ever work out. 

I've been reading a lot about it just out of curiosity, and playing around with the idea, but didn't know if I should bring it up to my fiance. I told him a few days ago about the conversation with a friend and he asked me what I thought about it and I just said ""I don't know."" I told him that I've never been the jealous type and I don't think it would upset me to know he was with someone else. The conversation ended there. 

Well last night we tried to have sex and he asked me again about the threesome thing, and I mentioned an open relationship and that I had been thinking about it. What I meant was that I had been thinking about open relationships in general, and reading about them. He took it as I've been thinking about opening our relationship because he isn't satisfying me. 

He hasn't spoken to me since then. 

I don't know what to do. I'm regretting that I even thought about it, but now it's going to be this lingering seed that I planted that I'm wishing I could be having sex with other guys and he's not good enough. 

I have no doubt in my mind that I want to marry him. He takes care of me and he fits all the things I imagined marrying in a man since forever. 

I feel like even if we did open our relationship, it would be him agreeing because he didn't want me to cheat on him (which I never have, and never would) and then I would go act on the agreement, and he never would, and then it would ruin our relationship. 

If we don't open our relationship, I need to drop these thoughts and probably go talk to a counselor or something about my thoughts about other men. 

Do any of you have experience opening a relationship with one reluctant partner in the beginning? I have never felt so confused. Thanks for any and all replies. 


**EDIT**: We finally talked about it last night and I was really pleasantly surprised by his reaction. He said he read a lot about open relationships and he said a lot of people who make it work say it was the best thing to ever happen to their relationship. He told me that he is able to distinguish between sexual desire and emotions, and he realizes that I didn't bring it up due to him not satisfying me. He said he isn't sure how open he would be willing to be, and since we have a lot going on right now (which is true) that we should hold off on it, but that he will keep it in mind, and we'll talk about it soon. 

He asked me about having a threesome and said he didn't know if he felt comfortable having a threesome with two guys. I told him I've been interested in having one with another girl, and that I'd be willing to do anything with her. I told him that I wouldn't mind if he also had sex with her during the threesome (with protection) because I know that I'm the one he loves. I expressed to him that what is important to me is that I'm the only person he's in love with, and that it's just playing around with sex for fun. He liked the idea of a threesome and said that he's open to it, needs to think about the entire situation more, and that we will be talking about it more in depth when we aren't so busy. 

I'm really excited that he's open to the idea, and we talked about how we need to talk about things more and that we have to be 100% honest and open when making our decision, and we talked about laying down ground rules. I told him that we would be able to adjust the rules as needed depending on how things go, and he agreed that was good. 

Overall I'm really happy and excited about how it turned out. I'm excited that he listened to me and understood where I'm coming from. I'm excited for a future of sexual exploration with the love of my life.

I've generally kept more to myself, but have found myself going to more parties and experiencing that new environment for some time now. The first party I went to, I was really interested in the idea of just making out with whoever, though general anxiety prevented me from doing so. The key thing here is I didn't see any of this as 'wrong.'

Recently, the topic has come up that she cannot guarantee that she can remain monogamous, which had upset me, for reasons I couldn't explain at the time. The idea of her in physical interactions with others upset me, not through jealousy, rather, through my own insecurities. 

At a recent party, however, I came out of my shell and we had gotten into a 3-person group make-out session, and that was fine. Eventually, a fourth person had joined in, and I just detached myself from the group. I was happy she was enjoying herself, but I felt like shit internally and eventually broke down mentally because of the conflicting emotions.

We had discussed everything and I had said I was much more comfortable with three people rather than four, because I didn't want to feel left out. The other day, we had met with one of the girls we had made out with and had a 'planned' threesome. The girl was someone my girlfriend had been desiring for several years now, so I was glad to help her experience that. 

However, when things started moving beyond third base, I became uncomfortable and voluntarily dropped out and let them continue. The part that gets to me here is that she was eager and completely okay to put herself in a masculine position, something which took months for her to be comfortable to do that with me, and still might shy away from. At the moment, I was happy she was able to enjoy herself, but as I thought about it, I just feel so devalued and unimportant as a sexual partner.

I understand that she can and will desire and enjoy sex with other people more than me, but that makes me feel so inadequate as her partner. I want her to be able to enjoy herself, but doing so right now makes me feel so horrible.

Is it possible for her to have sex with others while still satisfying my needs as a partner? I want to be able to compromise with her, but we can't think of any way how without it being an ultimatum for either of us.

One of my lovers recently volunteered the information that she's sleeping with a married man who has children and he isn't telling his wife. She says he's perfectly happy in his marriage, but it would destroy the marriage if he suggested they should open it. She justifies it by saying they've both fallen in love, but he also loves his wife.

Also the way in which he did it was crappy.  I don't really feel hurt, I just don't want him to continue with this behavior.

There's one couple, I'll just call them Jack and Jill. My boyf has slept with Jill a few times, and I've slept with Jack a few times, but it was all pretty much initiated by the immediate chemistry between myself and Jack. Jill and my boyf get along just fine, but they didn't have that 'click' that Jack and I had.

Jill is such a lovely girl, but very deeply insecure. This manifests with her displaying very controlling behavior towards Jack. He seemed willing to put up with it - however, she went out of town yesterday to party with friends in her old hometown. Since they'd been having some issues (they're always having issues...), they decided not to play with anyone while they were apart. Okay, that makes sense. But she went further and mandated that Jack could not spend any time with me, or my boyfriend, or me and my boyfriend, while she's out of town. 

I had no idea that she was feeling this way. I knew she was insecure, but I thought I'd done everything right... I'd asked her for permission to play with Jack before approaching him about it, I cultivated a very friendly relationship with her - I really, genuinely like her as a person, and I like spending time with both of them. But Jack was complaining to me about her ultimatum, and apparently she feels that he's always choosing to spend time with me instead of her, and that her trust was violated in some way. Basically, I've been majorly intruding in their relationship without even realizing it.

Is there anything I should be doing in this situation? I've already told Jack that play between us is off for the forseeable future, certainly while she's gone, and at least until they iron things out. Should I text her?

I am in a theoretically open relationship with a man I am very happy with. However in practice we are monogamous. In the beginning we both would see other people but quickly other people became boring to me next to him. I have had a lot of lovers and a few significant relationships and my partner is so far the absolute best match I have found sexually and emotionally.

After a while I wanted to become exclusive because seeing other people felt more like a chore than anything. He wants to stay poly but has done nothing to act on that in over a year. I have gotten really comfortable with this monogamy and was completely blown away when I found out a few minutes ago he is on a date with another woman who is interested in having sex with him. I had no warning until now, when he texted me he is on a date with her as a response to me asking if he wanted to hang out. I am kind of freaking out.

The truth is part of me has wanted to be with other people but I have realized the only reason why is so that I don't hurt as badly when he finally sleeps with somebody else. I really am not actually interested in other people and don't know what to do. 

As a side note I am interested in exploring other people with him, esp other couples, and have expressed that I am not interested in being left out of his escapades and am not interested in doing things on my own. I have tried finding other couples but he makes no effort to make time in his schedule to meet with any if these people. I don't understand why he is on a date with this woman and I feel horrible right now. How can I cope with this?

**Tl;dr Though I was the original person interested in polyamory, I now have no interest whatsoever. I don't want him to be with other people and I definitely don't want myself to be with other people (unless we are with other people together). How can I cope with the fact that he'll probably sleep with another woman (maybe even tonight)? I just feel my stomach covered in knots and feel like my heart is breaking at the mere thought of this happening.**

We've always been open.  We broke up a while back but remained friends and got back together.  

Anyway, I don't require much, just that we keep in touch daily, even if it's just a quick whatsapp. It's a long distance situation so seeing each other isn't really an option and the messages really brighten my day.  

She's pretty much a lone wolf and doesn't really see the need to keep in touch, so it's not unusual for her to go a day or two without, which kinda annoys me, but I've sighed and got on with it chalking it up to her crappy social skills, plus I sometimes get super busy and lose track of time myself so whatevs you know. Plus we usually talk more on weekends.  

This weekend though, we didn't talk on friday cos she was tired and then I didn't hear from her at all of yesterday (Saturday).  I messaged her, no reply, even though whatsapp said the message had been read.  I messaged her again this morning, and it wasn't read, which made me panic a little that maybe something had happened to her.  

Turns out she was at one of her lover's places, and couldn't get back to hers in time so stayed over.  I haven't said anything.  I'm a little annoyed, and I guess for the first time ever I've got some jealousy building up.  

I don't want to be all you can't do this or you can't do that.  Especially as I don't have any lovers here so I don't want it to be like oh because I'm not having fun, you can't have any.  

I just want to know where she is, and what she's doing.  And what's the deal with this guy lol.  Is this a big thing to ask?  Am I being unreasonable?

oh and for some weird reason we've never talked on the phone, even when we were in london together, calling each other was never a thing, either sms/skype/whatsapp so it would feel hysterical to do so now.

We've had various ups and downs in our relationship, all of the usual things that break hearts and bring people closer together and difficult life situations that we've been though as well.  We've also cheated on each other, and lied to each other about the cheating.  Everything is out in the open now, and has been for several months.  We have an amazing sex life, and I honestly couldn't ask for more.  

For the most part we are extremely happy.  However, I am making some major life changes and am moving across the country to pursue graduate school in the fall and he has decided not to move with me due to his work.  Right now we are planning on doing the ""wait and see"" thing, possibly trying an open relationship, possibly staying together, or possibly breaking up.  

My problem is that I am really struggling with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy.  He knows I struggle with intense jealousy, but it is really starting to get in the way of our relationship.  Just the thought of him being with another woman makes me want to be sick, and also makes me want to preemptively break up with him to avoid heartbreak.  However, at the same time, I am excited about the possibility of sleeping around, and would like to have casual sex with other men/explore my more exhibitionist side anonymously.     

Does anyone have any suggestions for helping me cope with my unfair and unrealistic feelings?  I am going crazy with jealousy and I feel terrible.  Actually, I feel like a pretty bad person for being so excited about the possibility of sleeping around and for being so frightened he will do the same.

Just discovered this subreddit and I have a few questions. My boyfriend has been wanting me to fool around with other guys, or for us to engage in a threesome or find another couple (mostly a couple we can establish a friendship with first and be open with before moving on to more sexual things, if ever). 

Anyone I tell this to that I know tells me that my boyfriend is weird and doesn't love me (even though I know he does) for him wanting me to fool around with other guys or I'm a cheater for doing this. I've done it once before with a guy (we barely did anything, just made out and touched each other a few times over clothes) but after telling my boyfriend about it he loved it. I regretted this time because I didn't like the guy so it's not that I'm against it, I would just do it with guys that I'm attracted to and more comfortable with. 

My boyfriend and I have a great sex life and I would be completely fine with just a monogamous relationship but he feels that this kink of his (letting other guys be with me) is something he really wants to explore and I'm open to doing it for him, especially since I do find myself thinking about being with other guys sexually. I'm a very jealous person though so I don't want him being with other girls and he is totally fine with that. I feel bad about that sometimes but I'd rather feel bad than regret letting him do something that tears me apart and we can't be together. 

So I'm looking for another person (preferably another girls pov but I would love to read anyone's stories) that engages in this and could talk to me about it, and maybe relate your first time doing it. I don't want this to ruin our relationship (I don't think it will), but I would like more information about it before we pursue it further. 

Also, a questions for the guys. Why exactly do you like this? I ask my boyfriend all the time and he just can't seem to put it into words so curious what other guys think.

Husband (M36) and I (F36) have been together for 10+ years. Swingers for 6 years, open relationship for 8 months (sex-yay romantic-nay style).

The other player in this is my FWB, Sam (not his real name) M35. Met him 4 months ago on a dating site. Really clicked on friendship and sexual levels. I would definitely consider him FWB vs just a hookup.

Sam travels a lot and does not actually live in my state. After the first time we went out, my SO ended up feeling pretty insecure. He wasn't fully able to articulate why and the feeling was specific to Sam. We had a few long talks and in the end, he urged me to go out with Sam again if I wanted to. I ended up seeing Sam several more times before he left, SO did not seem to have a problem with it or a re occurrence of the insecurity.

Present Day:

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Sam's coming back. I've been talking to him off and on since he left, but now that he'll be here soon we've been talking a lot.

Last week, I told my SO that Sam was coming back in town. I asked if he had an issue with me seeing him again. SO said it  was fine. 

A few strange incidents have happened since then. My email being left up on the computer and me not remembering opening it. My phone is open to my texts when I never leave it that way. I find him at my computer when he usually uses his own. Little things that are suspiciously adding up to something a lot like snooping.

Now, the looking itself is not a problem. SO is free to ask for my phone or read my email. With two caveats. He has to tell me that he wants to look and then he has to be willing to talk about why he wants to look. If he is snooping, he's not doing either.

I have nothing to hide. I would never intentionally do anything to hurt my SO, especially in this. He can look at every email I've ever sent Sam, wouldn't bother me at all. In fact, if he was looking for something in my latest string of emails with Sam, he would have been bored to pieces as it was 25 emails of 98% nerdy shit 2% sex.

Since he's not going to find anything upsetting, part of me doesn't want to make this a big deal. If he needs to be sneaky to see that I'm not, I can live with that. Not all the time but I can understand it and even sympathize a bit.

Yet, we talked about this. Has his trust in me faltered? If so, why? It doesn't feel like it has. Other than this weirdness, he doesn't seem upset or angry. After being together so long, I can usually tell when something is up even if I'm not sure what ""it"" is.

Our communication is usually excellent, so it's coming a little out of left field. Very unlike him to do this and nothing like this has happened before to my knowledge.

So, do confront my husband about the possibility of him snooping? I have no solid proof. I could be wrong. I don't think I am though. And if someone has advice on how to do that with a soft touch, that would be fantastic. :)

If he says nothing, should I let it go?

Bonus Question:

Husband keeps saying that Sam's not a problem. I'm getting this odd feeling that just may not be true. Say I don't address the possible snooping. Should I stop seeing Sam, despite what my husband says?

Also wrapped up in all this is my husband's desire to see me with other men. Sam has no problem with pix or vids. Husband gets a lot out of this. So if he really does have a problem with Sam (and I'm not a paranoid lunatic), his boner may be a little confused.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1bq3oy,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1bq3oy/husband_seems_to_be_snoopingnot_sure_how_i_should/,

My wife and I have been married almost a year now, and before that, we dated for 9 years (since Seniors in high school, lol). We're both 26, well educated, and employed.

About 5-6 months before our wedding, I brought up the idea of having a ffm threesome. She wasn't fond of the idea of me having sex with another woman, but she liked the idea of getting to be with one herself. Because of how long we've been dating, she never got the chance to fully explore her sexuality (neither of us have ever had another partner). So, I started looking with the intent that I wouldn't have penetrative sex during the threesome.

As I mentioned, that was 17 months ago. We never really found a woman despite me looking. She didn't want it that badly, and is way too shy to ever initiate anything on her own.

About a week ago, I threw out that I didn't even need to be there. If she wanted the chance to explore sex with women, then she should as long as she didn't form an emotional attachment with them.

So over the weekend, she got a response from a bisexual woman on a random CL ad (named Emma). In their emails, she tried to get buy in for having me there, but Emma is insisting they be alone for the first time. She makes a pretty good case, too - sex with me there, even as a spectator, would be different from them alone.

I encouraged her to set something up, but now I'm feeling very strange/bad/worried about it all, and I don't really know why. They're going to just go and meet this Saturday (nothing sexual - just meeting). Emma has invited me to come along, but strangely my wife wants to go alone (really took me by surprise!)

I also just feel bad because I've been the one pushing it for so long too - I posted most of the CL ads. Heck, she didn't even *really* want it - more of a passing thing. And now I feel like she's actually going to get the chance (and she is very sexually excited by it).

It's just leaving me feel very weird and awkward, especially her saying I shouldn't go on Saturday.

I don't want to hurt her chances, and I want her to explore her sexuality. But I also really don't like these feelings, either. Any advice?

1360708775.0,12,self.nonmonogamy,18eln6,I'm in a poly-open relationship and I want validation from my partner. Advice and opinions sought before I break if off. (Cross post from r/poly),15,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/18eln6/im_in_a_polyopen_relationship_and_i_want/,"Sorry for the wall of text! 


So the story goes like this... Girl meets boy, friends, casual sex,friends who occasionally have casual sex during early twenties when both are single. Mid twenties to mid thirties boy is involved in three long term mono relationships, girl never liked or approved of the controlling restrictive nature of the girls that the boy was seeing. Girl and boy are still friends and catch up regularly. Girl finally tells boy to break up with the last one. He's never loved her, he's not happy with her, says ""you're an idiot, you could be with me"". Boy breaks up with restrictive girlfriend and comes to see girl. 

From here on,the girl is me and the boy is Bob. 

Bob and I have a series of talks before and after having amazing wild and kinky mind blowingly fantastic sex. Turns out the Bob is fairly damaged from these relationships and believes that it's too late for him and that he will never find love. He's not looking for love, he just wants to catch up on the fun that he missed out on in his twenties, while I was running around having orgies and open relationships and experimenting with all that sex and poly had to offer. He's not after a relationship, he just wants to have fun.  

He's not in love with.  Me, but told me that he had three big loves in his life and that I was one of them. (I have had five and he is one of them, but to a lesser extent than I appear to have been for him) he used to dream of us running away together.  He says he has no idea if that's what he will still feel like in a few months but would like to go on this adventure in fun with me. 

I have just broken up with someone and am keen to date him exclusively, but am ok with hanging around to see what he feels like in a few months. A bit of fun and games never hurt anyone I figure, so I go with it. 

We drew up a set of rules. Safe sex with everyone else but each other. No close friends. Always tell each other when you are engaging in saucy behaviour with someone else. Veto rights on psychos (if one of us really doesn't like the other's choice in playmate, we can say no). Lastly, when I'm there, I'm important. 

He and I have found a third person, a lovely poly girl who loves us both and we are both happy seeing individually or together. We have both had a number of flings on the side and have had a lot of fun.

All sounds good so far, yes? 

I'm not happy.   

I guess my problem is that I feel unrecognised in public. I'm proud to be with him and have taken him to a bunch of places to meet a bunch of my friends who all adore him and acknowledge him as my partner. He falls into that role very easily when we are out together with my friends. When we are with our shared extended friend group, I am just his friend, nothing more. He won't kiss me on the lips or hold me hand or put his arm around my waist. I am not seen by the majority of them as anything more than his friend. 

Some of the girls that he is banging on the side sometimes occasionally and sometimes more regularly are part of the group and they have no idea that I am involved with him. He maintains that he is single and playing around. 

He refers to me in our talks as his ""primary"".  I feel like a secret as none of his friends outside the inner circle even know we've been doing this for over six months. I guess I feel that he may be ashamed of me or doesn't want my existance to cramp his pick up style as I am pretty sure that a few of them at least, wouldn't touch him if they knew that he was seeing someone. 

He maintains that we're not seeing each other. We talk or text every day, we are at each others houses thereto four nights a week and sometimes more. We go on camping trips together, talk about our hopes and plans and dreams. We support each other emotionally. I feel as though we are in a relationship. 

I had a nightmare last night. In it, he was ignoring me while I was in trouble to talk to one of the girls that is a friendly us both, that he has slept with. She messages him all day every day and whenever we are together he spends a lot of time replying to her messages and the messages from other girls. 

I was talking to our girl the other day and she said ""He just wants to fuck everything that moves."" She also told me that he had complained to her about a girl on the veto list (there are two on the list for him and one for me). I put her on the list as I think she's weird and I don't like her or trust her and she makes me feel uncomfortable. He was telling our girl that he really wants to fuck her and is frustrated that she is on the list. He tells me that he agrees that she is a weirdo and wouldn't go there again. 

I have been almost breaking up with him for about three months.  This is doing my head in. I suspect that if I bring up the ""I want to be recognised as your girl in an open and poly relationship"" chat, that he will defer to his pervious line of ""I don't want to be in a relationship"" and we will break up. This is why I haven't brought it up as yet. I think I am ready to ditch him, so I am getting ready to take the plunge. I just wanted to ask your opinions on this. All of my other poly friends are in acknowledged relationships or married and I am not close enough to them to ask their opinion. What do you think?

My SO and I have fooled around with this girl. We've met a couple of times for drinks, dinner and sex and it has been great.  She is amazing and I really like her a lot. 
My problem is though, her and my SO have become… close. In a way, I like this because this is all I wanted for my SO. He needs a close friend, and they've really gotten along well. I'm glad, but I also feel left out. I try to talk to her as a friend, but I feel I have too far to go to be on their level. When I come home, he talks about what they have been talking about. We used to have a chat room for all of us and a group for texts, but they've left that and when I come home from work, I'm updated with what they have been talking about on their own.

Of course, we have been talking boundaries. That went well, until this week when I said Id rather not see him do our female friend anally, since that is something I feel is special for us. He said he was disappointed to hear that. When he asked me about it again, I couldn't help but to say yes. I don't know how you feel, but there's nothing worse than having your SO disappointed in me.

We all just had sex. It was meant to be the last time. I think it is, but it fucking crushed me. I can't sleep because it fucking kills me. Our last time, he wasn't even inside of me once. 
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. I've spent the week reading poly guides about insecurity and 2+-relationships, but this feels like it will be the death of me. I've always felt as if I can trust my SO, and still sort of do, but the insecurity is killing me.

What can I do? How can I tell him this without it sounding as if I'm accusing him of anything?

(We started off agreeing to be open, later decided to be closed with the possibility of re-opening things, and are now looking for a MFF threesome).  We're reaching the 10 month mark, and I'm noticing that our sex life isn't the same.  We used to be totally unable to keep our hands off each other, and would NEVER go to bed without having sex for at least 20 minutes.  Now, sex is much less common, quick, and it's been a while since he pulled me into the bedroom because he just couldn't resist me.  Most of the time he's too tired, which is fair, we both have crazy work schedules, but still. It hurts.

I know logically that this is totally normal, has nothing to do with me, etc. I KNOW this, and the scientist in me can understand and accept that this is the way of the world.  

But no matter how much I understand that this is normal...I'm in pain.  I imagine the burst of energy and lust he will have for a new woman, and realizing that he can't really have that for me anymore hurts like hell.  I don't know if I can handle watching him have that for someone else knowing it's gone (or severely muted) for me.  It breaks my heart.

I guess I'm looking for some advice, or asking if this is a common feeling for someone in a nonmonogamous relationship, etc.  What has your experience been, Reddit?

We looked all through the sheets, behind the bed, inspected my twat, and came up empty. Figured it was flung somewhere and would turn up. It did turn up, *but the next morning, when I reinspected my twat.*

Kind of gross, but at least it was found relatively quickly (the [internet](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=lost+a+condom) tells me this has happened, and even for multiple days.)

It was only there overnight, and he didn't cum in the condom, I'm also on BC, so I'm not too terribly concerned for my own exposure risk. We've both been tested in the last year, and our respective primaries have as well. When I discussed this with my husband he was mostly just really amused &amp; curious about exactly how such a thing happens, and not terribly concerned, but there's other people involved that I feel might need to know were maybe/possibly/low-likelihood-but-still-might-be exposed. People like my husband's girlfriends, or people like my boyfriend's wife's boyfriend, or his wife, *or my boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's girlfriend*? (Yeah, and then she might have other partners, I don't know her too terribly well).

Really, who am I responsible for informing of this slightly embarrassing and a little bit gross instance? It feels like something that can mark me for the ages if it gets around, but I'm more or less ok with that, and am pretty sure I can cope with a little bit of FRIENDLY ridicule so long as it's not mean-spirited. What I'd really hate is for someone in our poly-cule to find out in a way where they thought we'd kept this possible-fluid-mixing instance from them, or were trying to hide it. 

So, I'm trying to decide if I need to make a face to face ""oh yeah, this thing happened"" retelling to **all** the people who are (even remotely) connected to us, or if I can just assume that the word will get around from partners telling partners? Part of me wants to try to take the reigns of the story so people won't think I'm trying to hide it, and part of me wants to never speak of this thing ever again (and hope my friends and partners partners are polite enough not to bring it up.)

So I sent him an OKC message last night and expressed how I felt about the situation - I like him, but I don't like feeling guilty about seeing him, and that some sort of confirmation from his girlfriend (specifically a video) would help me feel better about the situation. 

I put the ball in his court and he was pretty great about it. I woke up to a message this morning saying that he's glad I shared my feelings. We are postponing our date until he's able to talk things over with his girlfriend about a means of confirmation, per his suggestion.

Next to that, we were in talks to live together since this long distance relationship was so frustrating for the both of us. We hadn't seen each other in 6 weeks, last time, I met her parents.

In those 6 weeks we didn't see each other we only had contact online with each other, I was busy studying for exams which I failed and I had to dropout, she met a few friends of mine and made out or slept with them.

The day I arrived after 6 weeks at her place, things seemed off, only later, I would hear she called a girlfriend of her saying that she ""fucked up horribly"" (her words) while I was travelling towards her. That night it felt there was a gigantic distance between us which wasn't the case online. We had sex and had pillow talk about that we need to talk since there was something off. The next day she left to work and I was just out of my mind what was going on, I had no clue but I suspected she had fun with other people.

A few weekends back we had a long online conversation by chat over that she gave me permission to sleep with other girls, I declined, I'm not really build for this, and if I would do this, I would like to involve her. She then mentioned it was always perfectly ok in her mind she could sleep with other people because it was just sex and not a relationship.

That night after she came from work she told me the entire story. About how she can't commit to one person how much she would love that person, even if it's that one special person you would only find once in your lifetime. It just doesn't work for her how much she tries. Every relationship of her has ended because of this issue. She also told me an open relationship wouldn't work for her because she can't let me actually be with other girls.

We are luckily still friends and maybe we can get it to work in a different relationship model.

So.. I have a few questions:

* What kind of relationship model does she describes?
* How can I point her to online resources to discover herself regarding non-monogamy?
* She describes herself panicking about the thought spending the rest of her life together with one person even if it's the one. Why?

I would do it more often, except that were dating non-exclusively and he has been upfront about being non-monogamous (well really it was after I initiated the talk but still fairly early) and I figured since he's the one who wants to juggle multiple girls, that he should be the one initiating (since he knows his schedule better). I guess I think if he wants to see me, he'll make plans. If he has time to see me in addition to whoever else he's dating, he'll make plans. And he does, consistently. A month-and-a-half into dating he had to leave for five weeks to another city and even then he was consistent about emailing me around twice every week and even made plans to see me the week before he was back and went straight from the airport to see me (this was two weeks ago). He's always the first one to text and set up plans after we hang out. I figure this is how he likes things to be. 

However, it's been four days now since we've last hung out and he hasn't texted me at all to make plans for this weekend (he normally does around two days after we've hung out).

I obviously want to give him his space to spend time with other people, but at the same time I can't help wondering if maybe I'm playing it too cool. I honestly don't know how to do this non-exclusive dating thing. He knows I'm seeing other people and we're still active on the dating site we met on.

At the moment I am transitioning between college graduation and getting a job/my first apartment with my partner of 7 months while trying to find a way for my English boyfriend of 4 years to get a work visa in the US so he can live with us too. Complicating matters is the fact that my boyfriend is thinking about going to Australia instead (he has family there, but it would set back our efforts to get together) and my partner's mono girlfriend seems very on-and-off about my partner being poly. I've been handling things well for the most part, but this weekend my boyfriend is away on vacation with his family while my partner is visiting his girlfriend in his hometown and suddenly I have a lot of fear and insecurity bubbling up. There are two separate issues going on:

1) My boyfriend is a very in-the-moment person and sometimes I think that he enjoys having a long distance relationship with me because it's easy for him. While I know he is serious about me he hasn't put in any real effort for us to get together in the long run, partly because he's content where he is and partly because his family does all his planning for him and he expects things to be easy. He is a great companion but I get frustrated with him often because I feel like we're not on the same page. My main concern is that me living with my partner will make our long distance relationship harder to maintain. Luckily my boyfriend and my partner get along great, but I want to see an equal amount of both of them to keep things from going out of balance.

2) My partner is more emotionally supportive and on the same page as me, but I don't know about his girlfriend. I sense that their relationship got off on the wrong foot since he didn't tell her he was seeing me at first, and because of that I'm not sure if she will ever really be OK with our poly relationship. Sometimes I feel like I'm the other woman, like when they post lovey-dovey things to each other on facebook for their friends to see. It makes me feel guilty and lonely, maybe a little jealous too as they seem to think of him and his girlfriend as a mono couple. She is genuinely giving it a try but her friends and family are very negative about the situation, and since I haven't met my partner's friends or family yet, I wonder if they think of me as the other woman too. When I'm with him it's like we're in our own little world, but then I see glimpses of his hometown life and friend circle on facebook and it seems like a whole different world that I'm not at all part of.

Anyways, that was a bit longer than I intended but I don't have anyone to talk to about my poly problems and I could use some feedback. I'm not sure if or how I should talk about these issues with the guys since I've been really emotionally charged the past couple days (PMS'ing really hard too) and can't sort out my emotions from logic. Has anyone ever done long distance with one person while living with another? And has anyone dealt with feeling like the other woman? Thank you in advance for your help!

I have been going under stressful ups and downs the last few months and I'm sure its been affecting her. She goes through them too and I'm expected to just grin and bear through it. 


I need sex. I hate that its true. Because one day I'll feel asexual, like nothing is going to ever get me excited, then I see her. I feel her touch me, and I get excited. I don't want to live in a situation where the only thing that excites me is her. I'm tired of feeling like I'm addicted to her and that I need her just to exist. 

I'm tired of dealing with my heart feeling like its being punched in the gut and attacked. I had a panic attack today when I got my car after work. I didn't want to go home. But I did. 

I get home and I see all the full bore evidence of their love making and it makes me feel jealous. They don't even hide it. But she'll tell me she doesn't want sex from me one moment then force me between her legs to eat her out the next. 

I fucking hate this. So I've made up my mind. 

Right now, I can't just move out. I have a court date pending for the county she lives in dealing with my full legal name change. Its next week on the 22nd. Once its over with, I'm going to move back in with my mom temporarily until I can find a place to stay closer to work. 

This is the only thing I can think of that will work for me. Every time I explain my relationship to anyone they tell me its abusive and that I need to get out. I'm going to. I promise I am. I'm leaving. I'm crying while I write this because I think my heart finally made up its mind over it. 

I think my heart finally decided it doesn't actually love her. I fucking hate her in fact. I hate all the pain she's put me through.

I'm not sure where I'm going with all this. I'll probably chicken out of actually moving. OR she'll do something to lock me back into what ever this mind fucked state of being is that she keeps getting me into.

However my wife was a virgin when we met and it takes her a very long time to feel comfortable with anyone sexually. To the point that while she will argue till the cows come home, about how important it is to be in a non-monogamous relationship, she's never actually had sex with anyone but me.

I find this a struggle for 2 reasons. The first is totally selfish. When people ask me about our relationship they very quickly ask ""Does Mrs neb8neb sleep with other people too?"" - the insinuation being that if she doesn't, I've some how forced her into a situation against her will.

When this happens, I'm sorry to say, I've lied a couple of times and said she has. It's usually at the tough end of a conversation where I've been constantly on the defensive and I just can't be bothered with more disapproving looks. I also hate the fact they're suggesting that she's somehow less mentally strong than me and easily controlled. She's the most mentally strong person I've ever known and it hurts a little to have people suggest that. However, the evidence isn't exactly on my side as people roll their eyes at our 'situation'.

The second reason is a lot less selfish - I want her to experience what I've experienced! I want her to feel the amazing outcomes of non-monogamy rather than just the theory. I feel she's missing out and I want to help her.


We're currently listening to the sexisfun.net podcasts together and I know she's looking into /r/TwoXChromosomes for information around fear of men, fear of sex, etc.


I don't want to rant at her because I know I'll just end up crushing her confidence. She wants to get to where I am, and I know I need to be patient, but it's driving me crazy and I don't know what to do.

I'm happy with just him, though he needs a little extra companionship, which I understand (having been in that position myself).  He tells me about relationships he's interested in pursuing, and 90% of the time, I say yes to them.  However, it rarely ever even gets that far because...he keep choosing the wrong kind of women.

He keeps falling for women who are single and monogamous, and then gets upset when they end up leaving him for a guy who will treat them like their one and only.  It's starting to make him bitter and just a little bit misogynistic from his frustration.

I tried to explain it to him like this:

Woman A likes cake.  You go to her and say ""Hey, I already have some cake at home, but I know you like cake and so how about we go out and split a cake together and each have some?""  She agrees because without you, she has no cake, and since *some* cake is better than *no* cake, she agrees, and is even happy with the half of the cake she gets with you.

Then, some guy comes along and says ""Hey, I heard you like cake, so here's a whole cake, just for you.""  Since she really loves cake, she's going to choose the guy who gives her a whole cake, rather than part of one.  She appreciates the piece that you had given her, but it left her unsatisfied, because really, she wanted a whole cake to herself.

The cake in this metaphor is, essentially, a relationship.  A non-primary member of a non-monogamous relationship is getting, at best, a part time relationship from you.  If they're naturally monogamous, they will settle for that in a pinch, but will always hope that someone will come along who will give them a full time, committed relationship.

In my eyes, thinking that someone who is monogamous will be happy as a tertiary member of another relationship is just naive.  I think he really should be looking for women who are themselves already part of a non-monogamous relationship. That way, they're already getting the bulk of their fulfillment elsewhere, and will be okay with being only a part-time partner, not to mention the fact that they will already be familiar with the dynamics of non-monogamy.

My SO seemed to sort of understand this explanation, but he still keeps making the same mistake over and over again.

He didn't say much about it and we moved on together and got married. I never acted on it because I respect him and wouldn't lie to him. 

However, unbeknownst to me, my suggestion upset him. He was bothered by the idea that I might want to have sex with other men. He was bothered by the possibility that I might leave him for someone else. He felt rejected and unloved. He never told me any of this.

A year and a half into our marriage, he started an affair. He came clean to me after a month and told me that he was thinking of leaving me for the other woman. I was heart broken. I never cared about him having sex with someone else, but to have him hide a relationship, lie to me, and then tell me he might leave just devastated me. I'm still hurt and reeling from the secret. 

After about a month, he ended the affair and decided that he wanted to work things out with me. We've been trying to patch things up, but all I feel is hurt and betrayal. I always felt that he KNEW that I was the one for him and that he'd be there for me and support me through everything. But he didn't do any of that, so I was becoming uncomfortable with an open marriage. 

Following more lies and secrets, we are now on a trial separation to have a break from each other. We are each allowed to date other people as long as we talk about it, but I keep having that nagging feeling that doing this is worse for the time being. I keep thinking that I will never feel like I am the most important person in his life, which really, is what I used to feel and what I've always wanted.

I want to thank everyone for their comments. It really helped me stand my ground today when we discussed this because now I know I'm not being unreasonable.

Basically the crux of the argument: it hurts my feelings for him to want to be with another women, in front of me no less. We tried that during the foursome, I decided I didn't like it, I don't want to do it again. His argument is it hurts *him* that I've done threesomes in the past (when I was single, in case you didn't read the other post) and was willing to do that ""with and for other people"", but for not him.

I tried explaining that it was a completely different situation because I was single, I didn't have to set aside feelings of jealousy or hurt in order to have the threesome. I said he was comparing apples to oranges.

He disagrees, says it is not different and he doesn't understand why I would do those things for other people (I said it wasn't for other people, it was for me) and not for him. Just kept repeating that it hurts *him* that I would do what he's asking of me for other people but not him.

I kept trying to explain that it didn't hurt me in those situations because I had no romantic feelings for any of those people. I was not dating any of them. I was single. I was only thinking of myself. He still wasn't getting it.

I asked him ""Do you want to see another guy have sex with me?"" He said no. I said ""How do you not understand that I don't want to see you have sex with another woman?"" He said he understood that but just kept going back to his mantra of ""It hurts me that you will do those things with and for other people but not me."" 

I told him, ""Basically your fantasy of being with two women is more important that my feelings. You'd rather hurt me and get what you want than be satisfied with what you have and move on."" He just kept asking ""Well what about my hurt feelings over you doing things with other people that you won't do with me?"" Which to me is completely illogical because I was single when I did those things he is talking about. Does that not make sense? Please feel free to tell me if my argument is invalid.

It's like talking to a brick wall. He is not a stupid guy, which makes this even more frustrating. 

edit: I also mentioned it irritated me that he had such a double standard about it being ok for him to do whatever he wanted with another girl but it wasn't ok for me to do the same with another guy. He didn't have much to say in response to that.

tl;dr He thinks because I have had threesomes in the past (while single) I shouldn't have a problem with having a threesome with him.

When she told me that she didn't have time to see me and that she was going on a date, I expressed that I was again disappointed and that I was going to find a date for myself that night. 

Our rules dictate that we let each other know before we get physical with anyone, whether it's a text or a conversation. I followed the rules, sent a text saying that I was going to bring x home and it was probably going to get physical. I wanted someone to pay attention to me, and help distract me from the fact that my SO is going on a double header.

She has a live in boyfriend (M) who is fine with her having other paramours as long as they prove their STD status as clean. 

We had met over a year before we started dating, at the time I found her intriguing, intelligent, delightful company. She had been with M at the time for over 4 years, and the first night we met she Bit me with his permission. This left a majorly good impression on me (Me being a very primal person who enjoys biting and clawing during sex.)  Back then, she was also dating another guy (C) who I found disgusting. He was grossly dressed, a drunk, a deadbeat dad, chainsmoker a huge list of various adjectives that just make you want to vomit in his presence. 

His proximity to her in her life made me avoid her. Not because I wasn't attracted to her, but because he scared me. Then they broke up, and she disappeared from the local scene. I didn't see her for a while, I even sent her a message now and then asking her how she was doing with no response. 

Then magically she shows back up one day. I was currently in a open relationship with two other women, one who was madly in love with me, but had other relationship obligations that left me feeling like a involuntary female cuckold and the other enjoyed my sometimes submissive cancerian side that drove me to take care of my loved ones. Both relationships were rather toxic.

So W showed back up and discussed them with me, I found myself becoming more and more fascinated with her, and she was showing me signs of affection and interest. With her point of view I saw how toxic my current relationships were. Both were preoccupied with other lovers to the point that I was being left out, I wasn't getting my necessary affection that kept me sane and happy. 

So I met up with both of them at the same time and dumped them both together. Proud, I told W and she took me out to dinner to celebrate. We had long talks, we started doing kink related activities but always stopped before sex. She had always wanted a girlfriend, she had always wanted someone like me who was primal. M was apparently not performing oral on her, so she also desired someone who liked doing that. Chaching, she kinda hit the jackpot with me. 

I LOVE going down on girls. To the point where I'm sexually satisfied when they orgasm from me just doing that. Someone once called me Stone because of this, and I suppose that is a good descriptor for me. I don't like people touching my genitalia, if I have to be penetrated, I prefer it to be anal. She was up for that, using a strap-on on me etc. 

But we hadn't had sex yet. I wasn't even touching her naked body until after we got our blood tests back. Almost a month of us dating without going to the sexual. The most we had done was sat on my bed in my apartment and when she fondled my breast for the first time she had an explosive orgasm. She is very sensitive. It was beautiful, unexpected, and I've never experienced anything like that before or since. 


After the STD tests came back clean me and her started having regular trists in my bed, sometimes in her bed at her house where she lives with M and her son (M is not the kids father but acts as a reluctant surrogate). We continued to experiment with the kink/bdsm stuff for a while. Going to parties where she would all but tar and feather me. One night I was so badly beaten that just pulling my clothes on and sitting down was painful, and one of my shirts was bloodstained later. I loved it. I love that feeling. My body broken by someone else's hands. 

Then my world exploded. I was making a decent living, probably making more than her and M combined monthly. But while they paid minimal rent and no car payments. I was renting an expensive place and had just bought a new car that drained half my paycheck each month alone. Tack on the costs of my phone, insurance, etc. And my living expenses were covered while giving me just enough to have an interesting time entertaining myself and taking care of her romantically (taking her on dates and out to events.) But I lost my job, and suddenly my income was cut in half, I was living off unemployment and it barely covered my car payment, let alone my rent. 

So she offered me room in her home. 

We had been dating for two months, I should have turned her down. But I didn't feel like our relationship could deteriorate any from what it was at. We had already calmed down a lot from how we were when we started, the NRE having already settled down. The energy that had made her seemingly needy of me had disappeared. With me living with her the roles reverse. Suddenly I was needy of her. I realized this too late. 

Her and M had a pre-organized arrangement that any time he wants sex, if shes in bed, even if shes asleep. He can just take it from her. At first I was a little put off by this, I'm not attracted to M. Though his personality has worn on me and I can honestly as I love him almost as much as her, I will never been sexual WITH him though we on occasion were sexual with her together. Those times were always amazing, for me, for him, for her. We all enjoyed our little V. 

Then she dropped another bomb on me one day. She outright said she didn't love me anymore, she felt no sexual desire for me, no romantic desire for me, and she wanted me to move out. It was sudden, I wasn't expecting it, and it all exploded out of her after she came home and found I had done her laundry for her. This apparently let something inside her snap. I questioned her, wondering where this came from. Wondering why. Our relationship wasn't that stressful, While I was needy, I didn't appear to be half as needy of her as M was. 

She couldn't tell me, so for thirty minutes I ranted to her without her talking or telling me anything or replying to anything I was saying. 

I told her that I loved her, that I loved M, that I loved her son like he was my own child. That anything I did around the house to help her was out of love. That anytime I said something critical of her, it was not meant to be an attack on her, just an observation. I had no desires for her to change for me. I love her how she was. I loved taking care of her while she let me live there. 

She looked me in the eyes and I asked her if she really didn't love me. She said ""Ha, I don't love you."" then blinked a bunch and turned away. She then snarled at me. ""See, I blinked, Which means I lied."" Then proceeded to stare at me for a minute blinking her eyes as fast as she could. 

I'd had enough of the whole night, so to get some peace, I packed up some clothes and decided to head to my moms for a few nights. I told her I'd be back by the weekend to either resolve our issues, or for me to move out. Which ever one she decided. The argument had woken up her son and now he was crying, over the last 4 months of my relationship with her, he had bonded with me. He felt close to me, one day he even had tried to call me his other mommy, I laughed and told him no. That was inappropriate right now. 

I took him back to his bed, laid him down and cuddled with him. I told him it would be ok while his mother stared at me in bed soothing her sons hurt feelings. He screamed he didn't want me to leave, and it was Her that said I'd be back. That it wasn't forever. That made me feel like maybe we did just need a few days away from each other to cool off. 

I spent a week at my moms, and on that Friday, I got a job. I just hadn't known it yet. The recruiter was excited, was trying to get me to send him more information about me, about my experience. His excitement, had me excited. And I couldn't hold back my own excitement. That night I drove back to W's, and talked to her about it. She was happy for me, but for the foreseeable future, we were not in a romantic or sexual relationship. She didn't want me leaving though. She did indeed see me as part of her family, and couldn't stand losing me from her life forever.   

I stayed, now I think I shouldn't have. Every time M fucked W I felt jealousy, the same involuntary female cuckold feeling I had when I was in my last relationship. We've had our downs for almost a month now, It has been a month and a half since I touched her for more than a hug. Yet suddenly shes touching me again. Trying to grab my breasts, being super flirty, I called her on it and she balked. I told her I couldn't stand her mixed signals they were driving me nuts. 

It seemed like every day it changed, either she was ignoring me, or she was being overly affectionate to me. I was going mad. She was suddenly telling me she loved me every day, sometimes without provocation. 

One day she came home and wrapped her arms around me, whispering ""I hate you, how did you weed your way into my heart again."" I didn't answer, I simply stood up and hugged her. And she bit me again. Like she had that first night. Grabbing my hair roughly, pulling my head aside, and gnawing her teeth into my throat. She chewed until I cried Then we cuddled for a while. 

I've been working for two weeks now, and decided to celebrate by taking her out to dinner. I treated her like a queen, the same way I had before I lost my last job. I splurged, took her to a nice restaurant and spent more on dinner for us than I had any previous relationship. She was happy again suddenly, giddy to be near me. 

We got home and laid down in bed, I wasn't expecting anything more than maybe a kiss on the cheek and some cuddle time. We were reading different books. 

M Got home and she jumped up all excited, telling him about her date with me. And he fucked her while I laid in bed crying. I had never felt so used. I had gotten her into a happy excited mood, and he reaped the benefits. After he was done she rolled over and fell asleep, so far from me that I couldn't even touch her. So I cried more. I tried to keep it quiet, and I'm sure none of them realized I was actually crying. But my pillow was soaked. I hate this feeling. My heart all tangled up and broken. My intestines locked up till I can't even eat. 

I know what the majority of people are going to say. WHY fucking stay. 

I'm not sure why. right now I feel broken, broken enough that running away is probably the best option. But I can't stand what happened last night, I can't go through that again. I'm sitting here at work having a hard time wanting to leave and go home. I'm having trouble wanting to see her again. My hearts broken, I keep telling myself we're not in a relationship, but it doesn't help. It just confuses me more with how she had treated me up until we got home last night. 

I don't know what I'm doing. I love her so much, I don't want to leave, but she has driven me mad.

In the past 7 years my fiancé has made it possible for me to enjoy the being the center of attention in several MMF threesomes but we have not had the opportunity to play with another woman for a long time.

1350442464.0,9,self.nonmonogamy,11lxf4,Needing advice on open relationships.,13,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/11lxf4/needing_advice_on_open_relationships/,"It was suggested that I crosspost this from r/sex.

TL;DR: Skip to the last paragraph.

My boyfriend is amazing. Smart, funny, engaging, ambitious, handsome, and our sex life is great (thought lately, not as frequent). We complement each other well, and learn from one another. I have been holding myself back from making plans for the future with him, but we've non-seriously talked about ""what if we got married"". He's great and I have no reason to break up with him.

Except that he wants to have sex with other girls. I'm only his third, while he's my thirteenth. I kind of had my ""crazy slutty phase"" several years ago. I've had sex with another girl, and I've had threesomes, and I've made some drunken mistakes that left me regretful. He hasn't made mistakes like this yet. I want to be open and inviting, but I know from experience that it can lead to more harm than good if you're not careful.

I understand where he's coming from. I want him to experience more and have fun. We've talked about having threesomes, but I honestly don't know how to go about it. Advice on that would be appreciated as well.

We almost broke up a few months ago, but I told him in a moment of extreme vulnerability that I'd do anything to keep him, including making an effort to satisfy his sexual whims. But nothing has really changed, and I can tell that he's not 100% happy. I don't really know how to go about finding someone to join us, and it makes me feel like we're a middle-aged couple trying to swing. Shouldn't this be easy?
He brought up having an open relationship.

Okay, so I have a problem with jealousy, not that I act on it inappropriately (no slashing tires or anything), but it consumes me and makes me miserable. For example, there's this girl that he briefly dated and had sex with once, about a month before he met me. Long story; I've had issues with her because he's gone on very date-like outings with her, and it makes me feel disrespected. Also, she's skinnier than me, younger than me, and the one time I met her, she seemed immature and vain. I know she wants him, and I'm pretty sure he wants her, but I seriously don't like her, and will not accept her as a part of this. I can't tell him that he can't hang out with her, but he knows it makes me unhappy.

He's talked to some other girls on OKCupid, and wanted me to meet them too, which is much more appropriate in my opinion. What bothers me is when he takes other girls (Julie) to things that have to do with his friends, because I wonder if they think that this is his new girl. I wouldn't take an ex to a party with my friends, because I know what people would think. It wouldn't be a big deal if they were old friends from high school, but he met her right before meeting me, and he had sex with her. I can't abide it, and I wonder if I can ever deal with other interests, or if it's just her.

I've recently updated my location on OKCupid, and garnered more attention from the locals. I've also been thinking about what it would be like to experience something new, but I don't have the desire to start a new relationship. I'm happy where I am now, although I do need new friends in the area, so I'm hoping to meet new people. When I really think about it, I just wouldn't know how to begin that type of relationship. The relationship with my boyfriend is the best I've ever had, and I don't want to give that up. I'm not done with him yet, and not sure if I ever want to be.

So, I need advice on how open relationships work. I know one thing: I'm his girlfriend, and I should act as such, with no one else playing that role (with the same going for him). I don't care if he goes out on dates with girls alone, but I don't want him parading them around in front of his friends. I don't want people KNOWING we're in an open relationship. Is there such a thing as a ""closed"" open relationship? Or am I too jealous for this ever to work, and should we just break up? I fucking love him, but I don't want him to be unhappy and I don't want to hold him back.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_11lxf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/11lxf4/needing_advice_on_open_relationships/,

We were both raised pretty religious, but aren't so much now. We definitely feel like some of the guilt and shame from that upbringing is holding us back from exploring our sexuality.

I am open to her having a physical relationship with another woman, as long as it doesn't become serious and she is OK with that in principle. She is also open to finding a woman to bring into our relationship,

But we are both just so new at this. How do I proceed with this without totally screwing the whole thing up? I want her to be able to explore these parts of her self, I also want to be a part of it and we are both curious as to how to go about this.

My wife and I have been looking at a swingers club near our area. Last week the owner offered us to stop by during their off-hours to check it out. The place was pretty nice and the owner told us it's a very respectful clientele and couples only night on Thursdays.

Thursday night comes. There were a decent amount of people but they were all much older and-I don't know a better way to describe it-not good looking. I hate judging people by their appearance, (my wife and I aren't exactly supermodels ourselves) but the older and out-of-shape people weren't exactly what we were looking for. To be fair, they were very nice and understanding about our boundaries.

Finally, we managed to run into the only other couple that were our age. For the purpose of the story, let's call them Tony and Sabine. They were much more experienced in the lifestyle than we were, and I think Sabine was hoping to play with my wife. We told them about our boundaries and they completely understood. We chatted for well over a hour and had quite a bit in common. Sabine and I are in the same line of work and Tony was extremely funny. I know my wife is attracted to the funny men so I could tell she was comfortable. We went into one of the empty rooms and Tony and Sabine started getting frisky while we watched so we could get comfortable and get into the mood. Then my wife and I started making out and getting undressed. They stopped to watch us. No touching on their part, even though Sabine was enamoured with my wife's breasts. Soon, everyone is having sex. It was really hot and I could tell my wife was getting into it. Unfortunately, there were other people coming into the room and wanting to join us. Tony was quick to tell them no. They were polite about it and didn't try to force their way in, but it did get annoying to constantly break the mood just to tell others no. On the last one, Tony said to the guy, ""Can't talk. Busy fucking."" My wife and I bust out laughing and it took us a little while to get back into the moment to finish.

After we were done, Tony and Sabine mentioned heading home. My wife and I were thinking the same thing. The club wasn't as great as we thought it would be and the idea of having to constantly reject people the entire night wasn't appealing. We exchanged phone numbers and they promised to call us if there were any private parties they could bring us to. 

My wife and I had a great time and hope we can meet Tony and Sabine again. I have a bit of a desire to see my wife with another man and I think Tony would be a good fit. I know she found him attractive and I felt comfortable with him. I have no idea if Tony and Sabine would be up for it and I haven't talked to my wife about this fantasy yet. I don't know what she would think, and I have to think about it some more to see if it's something I really want. For now, we're just living off the high.

**TL;DR** Went to the club; mostly a disappointment. Met a nice couple, played with them, and exchanged phone numbers in hopes of future parties.

Now trying to find a balance between him and my fwb.,10,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/vjgph/my_new_bf_and_i_had_our_first_indepth_talk_about/,"Perhaps a long-winded story here, bear with me.

I met one of my closest friends (henceforth known as Z) a bit more than a year ago, when I was in a monogamous relationship. I was attracted to Z right away but very committed to my ex. Z never said or did anything to make me uncomfortable and was respectful of my relationship, I don't think he realized how interested in him I was at first. After I broke up with my ex in October, Z and I started sleeping together in November. 

At the beginning of April I started a temporary job where I met another man (G) with whom I hit it off right away. G had just left an engagement and was really on the rebound, which I was aware of and expecting to maybe find a second fwb in him, but as we started to hang out more we found it inexplicably easy to be close to each other. After talking it over a few times over a period of a few weeks we decided to enter an open relationship.

I have now been dating G quite successfully for about two weeks. Yesterday he and I talked about our comfort zones and the boundaries of our relationship. In a conversation that we had before we started dating I had told G that recently I had mostly been hooking up with friends rather than dating, but yesterday I felt I had to clarify that I had one paricular recurring fwb. So I told him that I had been having sex with a friend casually for a few months but I didn't specify who. I asked if this made him uncomfortable and he responded first with what I would describe as a troubled noise before telling me that he was perfectly okay with my having a friend with benefits and that he did not even mind knowing who that person was and spending time with them, but he very adamantly insisted on not hearing any details of my intimacy with that person. He also said that he most definitely would not be comfortable, at least at this time, with me having a second boyfriend. He said that after breaking off the long term commitment to his ex fiance he is still trying to get back into the mindset nonmonogamy.

So my issue really is whether or not I should tell my boyfriend that my fuckbuddy also happens to be a very close friend of mine, one of my best friends in fact. It seems like it might make him uncomfortable, and it might even bother him enough to want me to stop, in which case I would certainly want and need to hear his concerns. It also seems that maybe as time goes on and G becomes comfortable once again with nonmonogamy, he might be less bothered by the nature of my friendship, so I don't know if ""waiting it out"" a bit might help him take the information more calmly. Since he said it's fine for me to have a friend with benefits, I don't know if he even needs to be told who it is at all. What do?

I can't say that I would definitely refuse if G asked me to stop having sex with Z, but I also don't really see why sex with him would need to be treated as different from sex with any other friend; even though I am closer to Z than most both platonically and sexually, we are by no means a romantic couple and that is really what separates him from G. I don't know if I should try to explain that to G now, or later, or not at all.

Here's my deal:

We've been married for over a decade and have two kids, and on the balance we're a fantastic pair. I love her and she loves me, we have great communication and want to stay together. Sex is awesome when it happens, but life, kids, fatigue, etc., often get in the way. 

Until we had kids, she was the adventurous, boundary-pushing one, and I only experimented with her because I wanted to make her happy, and because I didn't want to be a drag. Pre-kids, we did a little swinging, a couple threesomes, a little light poly living, but we never actually slept with anyone else. 

Then, with the kids, her sexuality went through a pretty major change and she sort of went dormant for a while. 

Because of this, I hooked up with someone else when the first baby was brand new (acting on our ""old rules"" and believing it was OK, because all previous experiments were fine). Anyway, my wife freaked. It took a long time to repair the damage. 

Now I'm in a strange place, and this is where I'd like some advice from the community. She is starting to come out of her shell a bit now, at last, and has expressed a desire to explore other people. She hooked up with one guy and she traded a lot of really hot sexts with another guy. She doesn't see either of these as a problem, but I kinda freaked out on my own now. 

I don't want to restrain or ""own"" her, but deep down I think I really just only want HER, and I really wish that I, alone, were enough for her. I doubt that I am, though. In some way, I think it would be easier if she would just sleep with someone else behind my back and I wouldn't have to know about it. But that doesn't seem like a very positive or easy way to live either. 

Have any of you married couples dealt with this? Please share stories.

Longer overview: Sure, we've had major snags: he wasn't very committed for the first 2 years and even said he wasn't sure if he could marry me 2 yrs into our relationship (which was a bit strange since it's not like we had been talking about that, but there was some pressure from his family to make a decision by graduation..) anyway, he broke up with me last year when he was abroad but came back saying that was the worst decision ever and he didn't want to live without me. He wanted to try an ""open relationship"", which I was reluctant to do but the idea was he wanted to get some experience before settling down because he'd only ever fucked me and his one previous girlfriend. We try that from September last year to now, it's alright but he's very jealous I get laid much more than he does (calls me a slut twice to grind my gears, then feels bad about it and apologizes profusely.) Ugh. Anyway we finally have 3 weeks in the same location before I leave on an international trip (tomorrow) and I find reams of sexts sent during these three weeks, including ""I miss you"" texts and plans for an actual date (certainly not ""fucking only""). He admits to ""fucking up"" but begs me to stay on, saying he'll change, he doesn't deserve me but he'll never do it again and this open relationship thing is over if I want it. Also says he was just trying to get into her pants and he didn't mean it, that she means nothing… I'm not disinclined to believe him on that. I'm torn--on one hand we're great together, I'm super comfortable with him, and I really want a family with this guy but he cheated on me and it's just one more sign of not being committed to us, to me.

So ever since I can remember, I've been a very sexual person. When I was in high school I was looking at all kinds of ""different"" porn and I'm very interested in roleplay, dressing up, toys, switching partners, and the like.  Just basically trying to new things.  I am ready to pretty much try ANYTHING once, or maybe even a few times. I just wanna get out there! Most of the girls I've dated have been very close minded, yes of course we have sex, but it is usually just boring old sex.  Not to say I don't love sex.  We change positions and get rough and bite and talk dirty.  My current girlfriend really isn't satisfying me as much as I really want.  We don't even do oral, because she's not down with that.  Been together for 4 months and it's never happened once.  I go down on her once in a while but she doesn't even like it, she just lets me do it for me.  I want to bring stuff up and say I wanna try new stuff, but she doesn't even like it if I smack her butt in public.  How could I tell her I wanna fool around outside, or try other new things? There's no way.
 How do I find more people with my interests and kind of just dip my toe in the waters of adventure? I want to meet people that are just as curious as I am, even just as friends, and just kind of want to get started but I'm scared, I have certain concerns. I'd more preferably like to meet these people JUST as friends. Obviously I want to be safe, and I want to be anonymous, at least at first.  I'm afraid of somebody I know finding out and judging me.  I don't even know what I want. Maybe find one friend (male or female) that has the same interests, and just like talk about it and stuff.  Perhaps later on hang out and look at porn until we get comfortable enough to branch out?  ANY advice? I'm very happy to expand on any questions anyone has.  I just wanna talk about this with anyone.

TL;DR  I want to branch out sexually. I am curious and willing to try things. I just don't know how to get started and it freaks me out.  Anyone else out there?

Background info here:

My [19F] SO [21M] of 4 years and I have been monogamous from the beginning, which is the way we both wanted it.  We have an amazing relationship, lots of communication, great sex, great social life together and apart from each other, all in all I wouldn't trade him for the world.  I definitely need a few more years but I would love to marry this guy, one day.

 The issue:

We got together when I was fairly young, when I was 15.  He is my 3rd serious relationship, 2nd (male) sex partner.  I have no problem with this, as I feel that I am fully satisfied with our sex/love life.  But I do wonder about hooking up with other women.  I have done it in the past twice, once before being with my SO and once while we were together (He was okay with it and was present in the room, along with the girl's boyfriend, and they watched).  I also have a lot of sexual fantasies about women.  I feel like I may be bisexual, but I'm just not sure because I haven't really had a lot of time to experiment with these feelings.

So, about 6 months ago I was at a bar with my boyfriend and a friend of mine who is a lesbian showed up, whom I hadn't seen in years, so I ended up spending a lot of time with her just talking and catching up and stuff.  After we left he was making jokes about how she wanted to steal me away and this actually opened up a conversation about my sexuality.  I told him (and this is how I still feel) that I don't see myself in a relationship with another women, heck I don't see myself with anyone other than him, but I am sexually attracted to women.  He pretty much told me that as long as I tell him about what I'm doing, he doesn't mind if I want to play around and have sex with other women.

Now, he has made it fairly clear that he has no intentions of having sex with other women, nor would I ever want him to.  The idea of him doing *anything* remotely sexual, even kissing, another women makes me feel sick. --

**[Some people may point out here that it isn't fair that I want to hook up with other women but don't want him to- but since he has assured me that that is *not* what he wants, I feel that the scenario is fair.  If hooking up with other women/people was something we both wanted, if I am not comfortable with him doing it, I would not want to do it either.]**

-- I feel the same way about the idea of me being with other men- it just makes my skin crawl and my stomach hurt.  I honestly wouldn't care though if he wanted to try anything sexual with other men, so I can see why hes okay with me being with other women but not men- although he says he has no intention of trying anything with other men.  Fair enough. 

I just have so many apprehensions about starting to hook up with other people. Since except for the one time I hooked up with another girl while we were together, we have always been completely monogamous.  I know he says that he doesn't want to sleep with other people now, but what if he decides after seeing/hearing of me doing it he wants to as well? I know for a fact I will never be okay with him sleeping with other women.  I just wont be, its a deal-breaker for me. I'm really glad he's open to letting me explore my sexuality, but I'm really worried about the ramifications of actually doing this.

I just really wish I could have met this incredible guy a little farther down in my life, so I could have gotten to know myself more first.  But now that I have him, I definitely don't want to lose him.

**TL;DR: My amazing SO of 4 years has told me that he is open to letting me sleep with other women to explore my sexuality, but I'm worried about the ramifications of this on our relationship, and I am worried he will eventually want to sleep with other people too (even though he has expressed that he does not want that now) somewhere down the line, as that would be a deal breaker for me.**

We went the swinger route almost a year ago and had a few fun experiences but found we don't connect with the party/club scene and much of that community given the prevalence of more conservative politics and attitudes on sex as I am a bi male with an interest in kink. 

We looked at polyamory and it has great appeal to me, we both enjoy the poly community, but my wife is concerned with me forming other relationships and doesn't desire one for  herself.  I understand this and get that not everyone is wired for polyamory.  

She is into the idea of us playing with other committed couples (oral, touching, no penetration) and is opening to threesomes with limits on which sexual acts we share with others and what we don't. 

While I appreciate the openness after 20 years of monogamy (during which I repressed my bisexuality and interest in non-vanilla sex) I find it odd that with all these concerns and limitations, she has been open to and encouraging me to see a man, on my own, to fully explore my bisexuality for the first time.

I was wondering if any other non-monogamous bisexuals here have experienced this where their SO is open to you being with one gender while totally against the same with another.

I only felt minimally jealous, and it wasn't a problem.

Now that we are back home, my bf would like us to have MFF threesomes regularly (like maybe once or twice a year ideally), contingent on the availability of partners, of course.  He says that it would give me more opportunities to explore my attraction to women, it would be fun for him, and it would ensure some variety in our sex lives, especially since we are planning on staying together for the long term.

I see his point, but I have mixed feelings and I'm having trouble figuring out what I want.  It was one thing when the other woman was someone we would never see again, but I worry about feelings developing between the other woman and my bf if it's someone from our home city whom we could be in regular contact with.  Like you can't control those things right?

I also wonder if only doing MFF threesomes would be too one-sided.  He would have the opportunity to be with other women, but I wouldn't be allowed to be with other men.  To be fair, he's not interested in other men, and I'm not interested in casual sex with men, just women.  He's very willing to compromise, e.g. I can choose the women, date them without him there and he wouldn't even have to touch the other girl during a threesome, although I would feel selfish not letting him touch her at all.

I would be posting in /r/polyamory, but due to recent events, I'm going to try and avoid there for identity sake. At any rate, I'm lost and looking for suggestions.

Backstory: Heterosexual couple, on the younger end of mid 20's; we've been dating for 6 years now. Her parents are divorced. Her dream has always been to go to Europe, she got the opportunity for some study abroad classes and so we worked very hard to get her pay. Adding insult to injury, we had found out her grandfather unexpectedly passed a month earlier and his body was just discovered. As she is packing, I offer that she bring one of her nicer sex toys, but since dealing with the TSA is a crap shoot, she was fearful that her very nice sex toy would be potentially lost/stolen/removed. I suppose that I'm to blame for not insisting.

Fast Forward 2 weeks: She's horny and perusing craigslist, and begs to have a fling. Unfortunately, I'm against a rock and a hard place: do I say 'no' and she will likely cheat on me (she has a history of non-sex sexual favors), or say 'yes - so long as there is complete transparency and safety""? I opt for 'yes' - my uncle died from AIDS related Sarcoma when I was very young; he was a great guy and it left an impression on me to be open and honest all the time. Turns out that the guy she hooked up with was awesome - of course. I feel slighted because there was no way for me to capitalize on the temporary open-relationship status - I'm stuck at a largely stag school, doing summer research for graduate studies. My naivete hoped that she wouldn't fall for him.

Fast Forward 2 weeks: They hooked up, yes they were safe.

Fast Forward to when she returns: She realizes she's fallen for him, yet she still loves me.

Fast Forward to Today (3 weeks after return): I still feel slighted that she forbids me from dating outside the relationship. She has repeatedly stated that she doesn't want me dating because it obviously won't be temporary, like her situation. She catches me looking at /r/polyamory, and asks why I'm interested in a PA relationship. I have to defend myself that **she** is the poly-amorous one, and that I still feel slighted. Perhaps I should have been lurking here at the time.

The best part: we found out last night that she has to return home because she is nearly the sole recipient of her Grandfather's assets; we both assume, enough to make an ocean trivial. She had stated numerous times prior to this, that she would love to go back there, and certainly would love to see him again.

I'm pretty new to non-monogamy (1 month out of a 4 month cohabiting FWB relationship) and this sub, so please forgive me if this an old topic. I'm wondering how you all feel about dating someone whose other partner doesn't want to know about their outside activities, even the very fact that they went on a date? I've just started seeing a guy (A) who has a serious girlfriend that has allowed him to seek casual sex outside of their relationship due to her issues with experiencing pain during sex. Operating under the assumption that what A has told me is true, I shouldn't have an issue with this arrangement. 

However, I still feel vaguely uneasy about the hidden nature of our date, probably because I'm a very honest person by nature. My partner and I are super open with each other about our dates. I do understand everyone has different comfort levels and I respect his girlfriend's point of view though. Once I process these feelings and find some words for them, I'll bring it up with A if I'm still uncomfortable. The stakes are pretty low because we've only been on one date, but he's otherwise a lot of fun to be around. I was just wondering if anyone had any input or similar experiences they might like to share.

Edit: typo.

UPDATE: 

Oh, damnit. Not what I was hoping for, but I didn't come here for people tell me what I wanted to hear. I appreciate all of your input. I've already mentioned to him that I am not comfortable being complicit in his lies to his girlfriend about where he's been, but it seems I really need to push harder and get some sort of confirmation from his SO before anything moves forward.

It's really weird to deal with feeling rejected when I am happily married. My husband is super supportive he took me out for ice cream the day I was feeling bad about getting stood up to make me feel better.

I (M) recently began to spend time (only a week! ... though we have known each other as poly people for years, we'd only talked openly and held hands until she came to visit for this week) with a woman who is married and also in some kind of undefined relationship with another man -- who for the sake of disclosure has shown abusive and manipulative behavior as well as moments of seemingly extreme and objective clarity, the latter seeming to be what always draws her back ... anyway -- and in the course of that week, and the weeks that followed, our conversation developed in a way that we decided to attempt the action of sexual and social monogamy. She told me she didn't think of other people that way (sexually), and I know from searching my own self that I did not either. So I thought we were on the same page.

However, a day after that conversation the boyfriend pressured her to drink (alcoholic tendencies) under the pretense that ""she loves him more when she's drunk"" (his words). And they ended up having sex. I am separated in proximity from that situation by about 1500 miles, so distance is at play here too.

There is some toxicity and negativity here. I want to move on, but I feel heartbroken. Betrayed a little. The trust is shakenm and the boundary, the agreement between her and I as equals, was broken. This just happened yesterday, and In my attempts to be honest and explain my feelings (of which there are a lot and powerful ones), I am being made to feel both like I have an invalid point, and that I am now acting in a possessive and controlling way; that if I was truly poly, I would have already let it go. But I just honestly want to understand what the terms of the relationship are going forward, but there seems to be no effort on her part to reestablish new boundaries around the new behavior and new situation.

Am I fighting a lost cause? Is it just too soon for us to have this conversation without defense mechanisms interfering? Or is she shutting down on me? I'm lost and confused here, and the person I should be talking to seems somewhat unwilling to hear me right now ... any perspective would be valued dearly.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,1372690688.0,,,True,t3_1hfdd2,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1hfdd2/broken_boundaries_worth_fighting_to_reestablish/,

My wife and I have been married 5 years and been together 7.  We're both still very much in love with each other.  When we first started going out, she felt comfortable enough with me to finally come out of the bi closet, and I was accepting of it and even encouraged her to pursue women without my involvement.  (I know there's just some things women could offer her that I can't, and I'm okay with it, and I'm not going to scare any potential gf's away from her by demanding to be involved in any trysts they have.)  

Fast forward to last year, and she admitted that she was also interested in finding other men for hooking up.  The way she explained it to me was that she's in love with me and still wants to be with me, but she misses ""the hunt"" of attracting and then enjoying a man.  She insists she's not trying to find a replacement for me, and I believe her in that.  She just wants to broaden her experiences some more and have a little extracurricular fun.

We tried it for a few months last year, but I kept getting stressed out about it, to the point I started not wanting to touch her or look at her for a day or two after she came home from a ""date.""  I hated being like that.  She also insisted that I play around, too, which I did, but I didn't exactly enjoy my experience.

I don't want to deny her something she enjoys, especially if, in the end, it's just some harmless fun.  I want to see it like that, but she's having a difficult time explaining it to me in a way that I can relax and enjoy it with her.  I'm willing to give it another shot, but I want to make sure I don't end up making us both miserable with my reaction to it.  She's being patient and not insisting on anything, but I can tell she's feeling antsy to get out and play some more.

He doesn't believe in monogamy and after being with him for quite some time I realized monogamy isn't ideal for me either. So, we enetered an open relationship.

Today I realized that is relationship status is no longer on his FB. When I asked him he said he hid it because it makes hooking up with other girls difficult. That it makes initial contact hard.

We've been together for 15 years, have 2 wonderful children, and have been through hell and high water. We have been together for the best and the absolute worse, and come out victors. Part of coming out of those times as victors has lead us both to believe that we will always be best friends and together. We want to grow old with each other. However with her new lease on life, she wanted to experience more. Being a ""man"" I was excited about the possibility right! I mean it was like a free pass right? WRONG

She wanted an emotional connection outside of our connection and I have quickly come to the realization that having that connection, makes the physical part of non-monogamy better IMO. However here's where it gets worse / Jealousy rears its ugly head.

All was well and good with her as she had friends online that she was interested in but had not acted until we agreed, The first didn't work out and the second she is currently dating. Well with the first I went through all the different stages of jealousy, and got that processed, some things were easy others much more difficult. The second one I've been able to deal with better, but still feel the green monster time and again, especially right now as she is spending a few days with him. Not so bad so far right? well in the beginning I had trouble and she tried to hook me up with one of her friends, it didn't pan out but then I met someone myself. We too are now dating and jealousy has reared its ugly head on my wife's side.

She has admitted that in an ideal world she would like to do as she pleases while i stay home and be a good boy. She admits that this is not a fair feeling and she does not enforce that. However when i speak to her she gets jealous and angry and lashes out, then in an hour or two comes back calm and collected. I has to do with the perception of me picking someone else over her, even though that is not the case. I just got done reading the [Broken Fridge](http://www.xeromag.com/fvpolyrefrigerator.html) analogy, and see a lot of her issues as well as mine. It really is eye opening. 

The result is we are still best friends but she tends to put up these walls so our intamacy and closeness is a little less lately as I think shes pulling away cause shes hurt and not dealing with the real issue of why she feels that way. Is this common? Do you guys have this when you started? Anything i can do to continue to assure her that I'm not going away I always do, Just not sure how to help her calm her fears and face her jealousy.

Recently, we've met a couple at a local BDSM club that have taken a shining to us. We've played with them several times and have even gone into public and done vanilla things with them, as well (going to a fair, eating dinner, etc..).  They're a delightful couple to be with and are very fun. He's an older gentleman and she's his collared submissive, 25 years his junior. My wife and I are around her age. They're also very open about their relationship in public, despite the fact that it is far from the accepted societal norm (which I certainly take no issue with).

Part of me is interested, and I can definitely see myself developing real, serious feelings for both of them and wanting to spend more time together, both in and out of the bedroom. Another part of me is nervous about doing something like this. I wonder how this could possibly successfully work in the long term, how we'd be able to present this type of relationship to our family/friends, and how it would work out should things grow even more serious (co-habitation, sharing a financial burden, etc..). My wife is considerably less nervous than I am. In fact, she really likes the idea of becoming more serious with this couple. Then again, she's always been more of a free spirited, impulsive, shoot first and ask questions later type girl. An almost perfect counter to my cerebral, plotting, worrisome, overly analytical personality type, haha.

Anyways, any advice as to how this should be approached? How can I go about showing my affection to them without feeling judged or embarrassed by it? Are there any types of landmines that should be avoided? How does one deal with differing levels of attraction/attention?

One of the things that we've decided for sure is that we'd both like to be involved somehow in the other's relationships -- kept in the loop, allowed to get to know the person who the other is having sex with if it's not a one-night stand, or just talking it out with each other beforehand if it's a one nighter.

In any case, one thing that ladyfriend brought up is that she thinks it'd be hot if I spent some time hooking her up with someone, and though we haven't gone to any great depth as to whether she's more interested in a short-term affair or a longer one, she's mentioned that either would be interesting. I think it would be pretty exciting as well! I know that my partner has all of these wonderful traits, that she's got a lot going for her, and the idea of showing her off and seeing her have fun with someone I recommended for her tickles me. It also gives me a chance to personally screen folks I don't think would be right, which helps regarding being in the loop.

My question is this: how on earth should I go about advertising for my gal? I don't know if I've heard of this sort of thing anywhere. We're both fairly introverted, in the sense that we find it tough to make the first move, and we both tend to stick close to home.

Should I be taking control of her account (with her permission, of course!) and sending out messages for her? Should I be doing such through my own account? Are there other methods of going through this process that don't require dating sites?

As a secondary question, does this sound like a viable option? As an outsider looking at this, does it sound like something that might have more trouble getting off the ground than anticipated?

Both have primaries, both those primaries know about me.  I've know some poly groups and so I've got the theory of it all.  I'm not jealous of their other interests, I don't want to be ""the girlfriend"", but ...

I'm dating, but I'm almost guaranteed to be entertaining myself on Friday and Saturday nights (because those are reserved for the SOs).  I was one of the few people at my birthday party without a date of my own.  The only birthday present I got from one of them was intimidating-level sex toys and erotica -- which left me wishing that he'd give me a book or something.  I end up feeling quite non-special and not valued.  That's not their intent, I know.  They are both my friends first.  

What I am having problems with is feeling good about myself in this context.  Society wants to label what I'm doing as either ""the other woman"" or as something utterly disposable.  I guess I'd like to think of myself as a GREAT friend with GREAT benefits, but ... it's not working. 

It doesn't help that I'm trying dating, kink, and nonmonogamy all at the same time.  I don't really have footholds in the kink community, and for all that I have friends in open relationships, we don't really talk about sex.  So I'm left without any context except what I get from mainstream society -- which is not helpful.

I understand that a lot of NM/poly guys steer clear of partners without a primary because they don't want someone who'll want more from them than they can give.  I don't want to be *that* person.  But I'm unclear what I might reasonably ask for without being greedy.  

So I'd like some stories, if anyone would share.  If you've been the person without a primary, what left you feeling good about yourself and your role in your partner's life?  If you've been the person with a primary, what might you be willing to do to maintain the happiness of a FWB or maybe something just a bit more?

I'll give a little more background. I'm 28 and my girlfriend is 31. We've have been together for 4 years and have lived together for 2. We're highly compatible in most ways and have discussed marriage.  

However, something that gives me pause is not having had more sexual relationships. This is something I've told her that I want to explore before making a decision about marriage or starting a family. I'd like to know whether we can make an open relationship work. We both read *The Ethical Slut,* did a lot of discussing, and decided we would do it.  

That's all well and good. The problem is actually making it happen. Apart from being new to open relationships, I have no experience with casual sex/FWB type situations, only long-term relationships. I'm quite secure in myself, but I feel like my status puts off potential partners, and I'm not really sure where to look or how to present myself to do this successfully. Whereas it's seemingly easy for my girlfriend to find willing partners, male or female, despite being in a relationship, I'm kind of at a loss.  

I tend to be introverted, hence the OKCupid, and I thought that would make it easier to be up-front about my status. But that doesn't seem to be particularly fruitful so far. If I were single and looking for a new girlfriend I don't think I'd have a hard time, but I'm not sure how to do this. I'm planning on making more of an effort to go out without my girlfriend, which is something I haven't been doing much of, but as above I've never had a one-night stand or picked somebody up at a bar or anything like that, so advice on how to handle that sort of situation would be great, as would any other tips from anyone who has been in my position.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1iym2u,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1iym2u/advice_for_a_guy_in_a_newly_open_relationship_how/,

My SO and I are very open with each other.

We recently considered opening ourselves up to multiple partners. It's not new so much, since after a year being together we agreed that doing stuff with other people is okay as long as we talk about it first and that we get permission.

I never really took advantage of this since I didn't feel the need to be with anyone else, but he did because there are just some things I can't do sexually that he has a need for.

Lately I've been getting severely clingy, I will admit I'm pretty needy. I want to cuddle constantly, I am always bothering him while I'm at work, and I just feel like I need attention, constantly.

It's suffocating him and I can't stop. I get so depressed when he doesn't pay attention to me, and the more I push for it, the more he pushes away from me. So, I've been leaning on a friend of mine for support, because I like him and he's very nice. Recently I've been getting very flirty and close to him because the attention is nice.

When we were saying goodbye one night he showed me a text and my SO jokingly asked if he was trying to have an affair with me. Which led us to talking about actually opening up our relationship, to which he told me he would be okay with me having another boyfriend.

So, I thought about it, and I like the idea too, I feel bad being so clingy to him and it would be nice to have someone to spend time with that isn't him.

My SO said time and time he doesn't care, six months ago he even told us we should do stuff together. So we'd been dancing around the subject for a while.

Finally, we spend the night together and some stuff happens. My SO knew about it, he was okay with it, and he keeps tell me it's okay every time I bring it up.

Yet I feel incredibly guilty when I think about it, I just don't know why. Whenever we text, or are around each other I feel guilty about how happy I am.

Of course we all get hung up on labels, so rather than label myself, let me just describe.

I'm in a long-term marriage with kids. Originally mono for a very long time. We have explored non-mono together for a while and are only fairly recently exploring separate dating relationships. 

I am involved with two other men whom I very much enjoy in entirely different ways. We confide in each other and provide emotional support to one another. We hang out together alone or with my husband and possibly kids and/or other friends of mine. I don't want to fall in love with anyone and I don't want them to fall in love with me. I don't want anyone to be attached to me or rely on me, and I don't want my husband to be in a relationship like that either. I feel the need to protect my primary relationship and my nuclear family. 

I love the sex both in groups and 1-1. I love the more platonic dates that only include kissing or none at all (around friends and kids). I love the emotionally intimate conversations. But I purposefully avoid having feelings of NRE. I keep the flirting to a minimum. I don't gush when I like someone. I don't stoke the fire. 

This all makes sense to me and my partner (though he has more difficulty finessing the subtle nuances of this relationship structure.

(X-post from r/polyamory)",9,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1754l9/long_post_but_new_to_this_and_questioning_if_our/,"I (24f) been dating my boyfriend (32m) for four months now. I've had difficulty staying monogamous and I'd resolved to be more open with potential partners rather than lie and cheat. He lit up when I told him that, because he's been involved for 7 years with a married couple, two of his best friends from college who live abroad. When he first told me about their relationship, I asked if he was in love with them to which he told me he cared deeply for them, but no, is not in love with them. I was wanting to try monogamy as this is only the second relationship I've had where I've confessed past cheating (last one was while I was traveling and we opened up the relationship while we were apart) but he was very clear that because ""who he is"" is polyamorous, he didn't want to be monogamous at the start and open up later. I've been struggling with not having a firm ""base"" with him with which to feel secure. I accepted his relationship with this couple, only later to find out that they were visiting for the whole month of December and then he had been planning a trip to visit them for 2 1/2 weeks in January. I found this out during Thanksgiving. He then asks me if I would go on his trip as he can't imagine leaving me behind. Since I happen to have an former lover from my travels living in that country, I started to get excited about the prospect of going--he wanted to be able to have time on the weekend when the wife was home from school so all three of them could be together without me there and I planned on seeing my friend. I met his couple. They're lovely and I completely understand what he sees in them. I struggled with feelings of jealousy, especially when he went to spend alone time with just the wife as he sees her less often, leaving me at home, but he assured me that it's not all about her. We had lots and lots of talks about my jealousy, started reading the Ethical Slut, and I drop all three of them off at the airport so they can have a few days together before I fly there.

A few days later I fly out. The first night, my boyfriend tells me that the husband is upset that at a party on New Years, I (very drunk) apparently upset the husband by referring to my boyfriend as my boyfriend and when the husband said, ""He's my boyfriend, too"" I scoffed. This is because we'd never referred to my boyfriend as their boyfriend. Honestly, part of me figured that he was with them more as an outlet for his bisexuality (this is the only man he's ever been with) but as it's come out now that it's a relationship. The wife is in school most days during the week, so I don't see much of her. What I do see, however, is the incredible amount of care and attention she gets from both of them. It makes me really jealous- I was pretty attention-starved as a child and it's one of my major issues-I can't help but feel competitive. When we first were discussing how we wanted the time there to go, my boyfriend had suggested them watching us have sex and vice versa and I told him I thought it was ridiculous. What I failed to mention until later was that I thought it was ridiculous because group sex is something I really enjoy and why wouldn't we all just have sex together? Once I did tell him it was just me saying that I'd sleep with both of them, to which he replied that was good to know and nothing ever came of it. At one point, I was sitting at dinner with them watching the body language and conversation and it hit me like a ton of bricks that it appears that my boyfriend is in love with the wife, the husband is in love with my boyfriend, and the wife is the only one that seemed to be aware of the agony I was in being left out of the whole situation. That Saturday I left for the night, spent it with my former lover, and it was great to see him. When I returned, my boyfriend didn't want to hear about my time away and that hurt, since he often shares with me about his time with this couple. I felt like he was pretty dismissive.

We'd been planning to take a trip together to a neighboring country for a few nights, but the day before we were set to leave he got the norovirus and we stayed. This took away any pre-planned alone time we had and turned into more time hanging around the house. I ended up getting pretty upset and crying about how disappointed I was we didn't have the time together, which turned into a long conversation in a pub about our relationship. I'd been harboring a lot of resentment because I didn't feel like our relationship was strong enough yet after four months for me to not feel insecure about his relationship of 7 years- I'd been feeling like the secondary. The communication broke down horribly in this conversation and he became very defensive, telling me he's been open with me the whole time about who he is and maybe this isn't what I want and I said, for the umpteenth time that it WASN'T what I wanted- that I wanted to be monogamous at the start and open it up later because it was really hard to try to build up a new relationship and focus on nurturing old ones and what the fuck I was doing here with all of them, anyway?? So, we're having this really shitty conversation and then he asks me what my plans for the weekend are because I have to leave so that he can have alone time with them when the wife is home from school. I wasn't sure what the weekend was going to look like partially because our plans away had been changed and I thought the couple would be understanding about their weekend plans changing, too. He starts freaking out that I have no plans and being like, ""Well, then we need to leave and stay somewhere else because it's unacceptable for us to stay at their house like that for so long without them getting time with me alone like we'd originally planned."" And I was like, ""Why is the solution for us to leave all together so you don't see them at all?"" I really think it was just intended to make me feel bad. When we went back, I immediately called a friend who lives in the country and ask to visit her for the weekend and booked my ticket. He gets upset about that, saying I didn't consult him about being gone for so long and he only wanted me gone for one night- I reply it's ridiculous for me to spend 7 hours on a bus for one night. Then we stayed up until 5 am just talking the same crap back and forth- angry words, defensiveness, accusations. Finally, I was like, this is ridiculous---why don't we stop this shit and just be nice to each other again? So we cuddled and held each other for a while, but it was a short reprieve. We usually have sex every morning. That morning, nothing. He barely looks at me. We went out for the day by ourselves and ended up fighting more- same stuff back and forth. He's worried I'm going to break up with him because this isn't what I really want, he's pushing me away, I'm already feeling neglected and so pushing me away is making me feel even worse. We made up before I left, agreeing to talk more when we got home.
I worry that we are fundamentally different. I think that my approach to nonmonogamy is less polyamorous and more about sexual openness. I love the idea of him and I having sex together with people, of group sex, of swinging. I'm adept at sex without love, but he doesn't really understand what I'm talking about because he can't understand how I can have sex with the same people multiple times (FWB) without developing deeper feelings. I can't imagine being in love with multiple people. He has a few long-standing sexual relationships, both with this couple and with another woman from college who also lives far away. My impression is that it's just the distance getting in the way of him being in relationships with these people, whereas for me it's the fact that I don't want to be in relationships with people I've had FWB situations with.

We fly back and then on the train home, end up arguing more. Go to sleep, wake up, argue more. Finally, he came over last night on my request and I mention being worried about the fact that his couple is going to be moving back here at some point and I'm not sure what that will look like- I'm worried that our fundamental approaches to nonmonogamy are different. He then wants to talk about the terms of our relationship- as it stood, he had told me he just wanted to be with the couple and I could be with anyone I wanted. Now that he's away from them, he's telling me that he either wants monogamy for a while or wants the freedom to be with whomever he pleases, too. I'm resenting the fact that it seems to be about HIS convenience. When I wanted monogamy in order to get a solid base, it wasn't convenient for him because he had plans made already with this couple. I'm not even sure why we were discussing changing the terms in the same breath, but he told me that it was all the same discussion about us wanting different things. I'm not sleeping with anyone else right now, but I resent him trying to limit that since I've been very accepting of the relationship most important to him.
My question is, is this salvageable? I've gotten more comfortable with his relationship with the couple but when I think of us all living in the same city in a couple of years, it scares me. I tried asking him to clarify his feelings for them, asking him once again if he was in love with them, and he told me that, ""He doesn't even know what that means."" I just want to focus on building us up right now, as I did at the beginning, but now when I think about being monogamous it makes me feel really constricted, but I don't know if that's just coming from a place of wanting to get back at him for how hurt I felt during our time away, wanting for him to know how it feels to be left out. I don't want to operate from that place. I've been pretty open with him about all of my feelings. I'm not necessarily sure he's been open with my about his feelings, especially for the wife, and he gets really defensive and resentful when I ask questions about them.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1754l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1754l9/long_post_but_new_to_this_and_questioning_if_our/,

We are in a long-term, long-distance relationship while I'm away for school.

Given our distance and high libidos we decided that overcoming any jealousy was greatly preferable to celibacy.  But navigating how and what to communicate to each other, alongside simply missing one another is not without difficulty.

Initially we started with a ""don't tell me until I ask"" policy, but we decided this felt too much like DADT.  For the sake of transparency we moved towards a ""tell me if you're going to see someone, just so I know"" thing, but this is where things got hairy...

While well-intentioned, we've both told each other that we're about to play with someone when the other is feeling down - making them feel even worse.  We want to maintain honesty, but also make sure we don't spiral each other into a foul mood when the time is wrong.  Honesty dictates a certain timing, but sensitivity dictates another.

A couple of days ago, I was at an event where I bumped into a handful of long-ago (middle and high school) classmates.  When I was last around them, I was not one of the popular kids, and I was very shy, so I never dared to ask anybody out.  As far as I can tell, I was fairly blind to many social cues at the time, so if any girls showed coy (or maybe even fairly blatant) interest in me I didn't see it.

In the intervening years, of course, we've all changed a lot.  I'm not as shy now, I've done fairly well for myself, a bit more competent socially, yadda, yadda.

So I find myself talking to one woman in particular for a while, and enjoyed it quite a lot.  She was always nice to me ""back in the day,"" but I don't think she ever saw me as anything other than a good friend.  This time around it seemed that I was a *lot* more interesting to her. As it happens, I'm married, so I behaved, except for some light flirting. If I'd been single (as she is at the moment) I would have asked her out without hesitation.

I love my wife.  She's awesome, I get along with her better than anybody I've ever met, and I have no plans to jeopardize our relationship for a fling (or anything else) with an old friend.  

But I've had a really difficult time keeping this other woman out of my head for the past couple of days.  I presume it's because I suddenly found being myself flirted with by somebody that was (in my mind) unattainable the last time I saw her, and it was really flattering.  I expect the effect will fade away over time, but right now it's front and center, and it's been shocking to me how strongly it has impacted me.

I was curious if this kind of thrill is something that people practicing various forms of non-monogamy find exciting and healthy, or potentially dangerous.  For those of you in a non-monogamous arrangement, would knowing that your SO had this kind of strong reaction to an old friend concern you?  How would you hope your SO would approach you about it?

For clarity: please don't interpret this as me asking for strangers' permission to do something inappropriate.  My wife and I have talked about non-monogamy over the years, but never acted on it, so I'm taking this experience as one of those things that will just have to be filed away as a fun, if frustrating, memory.  I'm just looking to understand how poly/open/etc. folks would handle this sort of thing if you'd already made the decision together to be non-monogamous before the situation arose.

We have a strong, trusting, communicative relationship and we feel comfortable talking about our future together in the long-term.  He’s mentioned on several occasions that he gets turned on at the idea of me having sex with another man and enjoying it, and until recently (about two months ago) he had never expressed any real interest in pursuing sexual relationships with other people outside of our relationship.  He’s been reading this subreddit as well as r/polyamory for a few months now and the more he reads about openish relationships the more he wants to try it out.  My reaction to all of this has been very up-and-down.  I am committed to remaining open minded but I feel as though perhaps I’m just inherently more monogamous than he is.  At this point, I am barely able to browse this subreddit without feeling overwhelmed and anxious and it’s very difficult for me to imagine my boyfriend having sex with another person who isn’t me..especially when I’m not there.

He has been very receptive to my concerns and encouraging me to communicate all of my feelings to him and I am doing the best I can without letting my emotions run away with my jealousies.  I asked him what his long term ideal situation would be and he’s said that our relationship would still be the priority but he would like friends-with-benefits situations with others.  Obviously, we still have a lot of talking and taking of baby steps to do if we want to progress to this point, but I’m still struggling with the talking part as of now.  

I honestly feel as though given enough time to do some reading and process things that I could at least work towards opening my perspective.

He’s said that I have to want to do it for myself and I know he’s right, and if I get a handle over my emotions I can see myself being in this situation and enjoying myself, and I think overall it would have a really positive impact on our relationship.  He has said that there is no time limit on how long it could take for me to be able to talk about it and consider rules and boundaries.  Also, is it weird that I feel like I would be more comfortable with this idea if we were married? I guess if I were to sum this wall of text up in a single question it would be this: has anyone who has been in my situation and feeling like they are inherently monogamous been able to change their perspective and enjoy a monogamish relationship? 
At this point I’m basically just looking for any advice on people who have been able to successfully change their way of thinking.  Any help is appreciated!

tl;dr what is the best way to go about introducing myself to the idea of sexual sharing and get a handle on my emotions?

Never having been in one before, I left it open as to the organization (V vs. Triad, etc) and purpose (platonically intimate friends who have sex vs. romance). And right now I'm pretty glad I was up front about all that, because I got a response, and now I don't have to awkwardly explain to them that I'm new to all this.

One of them has been texting me for a couple evenings, and while we haven't had any deep intellectual conversations, we seem to be sexually compatible (I don't think they're looking for anything deeper than that, judging by what we've been talking about). But it just struck me today: I don't really have a clue what I'm doing.

I like to think I know the basics, and all that, but I feel more comfortable being told so by people who actually have some experience. If this works out, it's a lot of firsts for me, as it may be my first casually sexual relationship, as well as my first non-monogamous relationship.

Since they seem to have some experience with this, I'm going to let them kind of lead, and try and figure things out as we go along. Though what I want to do, before things get serious, is meet somewhere in public first, perhaps get to know each other over a meal or drinks. But that's where things get a bit fuzzy for me, because their cell number is an area code that's not too local. In fact, the area code covers a vast swath of my state, stretching from the south west end to the middle-east end, like a broad, 100+ mile wide brush stroke across the state, with the biggest population center being 90 minutes away. That may not work for me, in the end, and it certainly would make a casual, no-pressure, no-strings meeting for a couple hours a bit trickier (especially since the area in between us is a vast wasteland populated only by corn and soy). But then again, they haven't *told* me where they're at, and I'm drawing all this from the area code of their cell phone, so there's the possibility they've moved closer but got their number before they moved.

I'm not entirely sure if this is the appropriate place to post this, so let me know if this is better cross-posted to another subreddit or something. Thanks!

---

**Some background:**

I'm a virgin, and have only had a few girlfriends in my time. I have had some close female friends (with which nothing sexual has happened) who have been very open about sex and their sexuality. While I am sexually inexperienced I do not consider myself sexually naive. I've also done a lot of reading on feminism, consent / rape culture, and general sexuality.

My best friend is a girl (call her S) whom I had off and on romantic feelings for while she was dating other guys, and in watching the failures of some of her relationships I (and she) recently realized that a polyamourous relationship what what she needed. In coming to this realization my views on sex and relationships has changed a lot. I more or less consider her family at this point and am not seeking any other sort of relationship with her.

**Current situation:**

I have been dating a girl (call her C) who is polyamourous for about a month and a half now. We met over OKCupid and we have been extraordinarily open with each other from almost the very beginning. We're done some... I guess what might be called ""heavy petting"": making out nearly naked and some nipple play, but nothing further yet. C has stated that she isn't looking for a relationship with someone as inexperienced in relationships as I am, and I fully understand that. But we both really enjoy each others company and feel some connection (so far as I can tell); aside from sexual matters we seem pretty compatible. She is dating several people right now, and while I've found that I've had no problem with her meeting and sleeping with other guys, I'm getting myself tied in knots over the idea of her falling for another guy. From a sexual point of view I think I'm perfectly fine with her seeing other guys, and I think I would be in a longer term relationship, but from the emotional side of things I'm not yet sure I can handle poly.

I know that I need more experience in relationships, independent of my interest in C. I find I'm getting a bit attached to C (maybe too attached), but I'm not sure whether that's due to the excitement of a new relationship, the incredible level of openness and comfort I've had with her, or if I'm just genuinely falling for her. My inexperience is a pretty confounding variable here.

I'm not sure whether I need force myself to emotionally disconnect a bit, or if I should keep on and try to see how things play out. S has suggested that I find some casual sex partners to get over my inexperience, but I'm very shy and not sure I'm able to just put myself out there like that. I kind of feel like I'm out of my depth here.

I guess what I need to ask is:

1. Does anyone have any advice / insight for an inexperienced person in a poly / nonmonogamous relationship?

2. How do you manage the emotional side of things? Are poly relationships usually emotionally open?

We're just friends with benefits. His husband got drunk and tried to rape me, and started an orgy without my consent and I went into shock and got traumatized from it. 

OK but the thing is I am suffering a lifelong battle with anxiety and aspergers syndrome. (That's how I get into situations such as this in the first place.) I live on my own. I've exhausted all options for therapy in my area and trying to find therapy all my life has given me post traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety disorders in the process. I had to live in very dangerous places. I was abused emotionally and forced to do things I was living with people who tried to kill me and kill themselves on a weekly basis. So I am very fucked up.

When I got out of that situation I wanted to have sex and always had an older guy fetish and I got into the situation I did. I got carried away which is an understatement. But really I've always wanted to be with more than one guy as more than friends, either sexually or emotionally.

So I mean what am I supposed to do if one of my only supports is both detrimental to my health but one of the only people I have in my life who supports me right now? He does not do anything wrong or malicious at all, it's my post traumatic memories resurfacing about how his husband mistreated me. I can't handle the emotional fallout from that but I have no other supports. Really right now the only people I talk to are my mom and dad, and my friend whose husband who mistreated me and treated me like shit.

The subject came up again recently. We have grown a lot in our relationship in the past few years. I now feel like I want to pursue no strings attached fun outside of our marriage and that we are mature enough and communicate well enough to make it work. My husband was completely supportive of this and after several long discussions we have decided to try non-monogamy. We are still figuring out all the details of what we are comfortable with and how exactly we are going to proceed. 

That being said my husband and  I both created OKC profiles with no pictures or anything that could really identify us just to kinda see who is out there in our city which is not very big. My husband and I are very private so our intention was to try to keep this decision between just the two of us. 

So we have one couple we are close friends with that are swingers.  My husband and I have already decided close friends are off limits.

Throwaway here. Here's a bit of backstory: 

I'm in a really great, trusting relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years. We've always been very open and communicative about our kinks, and my one big fantasy has always been to experience a MFF threesome - mostly for the thought of the two girls really enjoying themselves, not just for me (though that undeniably sounds great too!) Until recently she has said she wouldn't be interested in bringing a third into our bedroom - not due to jealousy or anything, but due to issues of being too self-conscious and worried about her 'doing things weirdly.' She had a conservative, very sex-negative upbringing, (though over the course of our relationship she has been blooming into quite the exploratory, sexy thing.) 

Anyway, we had a sexy-times encounter with one of her friends, which we both really enjoyed. My GF now says she's pretty interested in the idea of experimenting more in this vein with me, but there's one problem: due to her shyness, she says she'd be way too self-conscious about actually bringing it up. She says it would have to be someone really close to her to have her be comfortable with the idea of a threesome, but she's just really afraid of making things awkward and being embarrassed for bringing it up with anyone. 

**Important Clarification*: I think the real trouble for her is about knowing whether or not *they* are interested in it - it sounds like once she knows that this is something the other girl would like to do, she's totally on board and ready for the good times to roll...I think the issue comes down to fear of making her friend uncomfortable or awkward if they *aren't* interested!




We're in the same friend group here at college, and we have plenty of very sexually-open-minded friends, to the point where my GF and I have actually built a pretty strong reputation for being 'That One Super Monogamous Couple' of the group...Because of her background, my GF's public persona has always been totally non-openly-sexual (though she's quite the sexdemon in the sack!) I, on the other hand, have always been quite sexually open and am known for playing that up along the rest of the guys socially (I've enjoyed living the life of a crazy swingin' charmer vicariously through my friends so far :P). It's for this reason that I feel pretty strongly that it'd be the much more appropriate/correct/less-creepy/polite thing to do to have *her* be the one to bring it up to one of her friends (we have two in mind currently), since I think it's pretty clear already in everyone's mind that I'd be totally down with such a thing and it would be her consent/interest that's in question - and as I've always heard anyway, it's usually most important to have the same-sex-as-the-third partner give the invitation to join. 

What do you think we should do? Is there any advice you could give my GF to overcoming her fear of bringing it up in conversation (she's a Redditor, and I'll be showing her this thread)? Alternatively, if that's not an option then how do you think I should best go about bringing it up to a friend? This is something we both are interested in pursuing, so it'd be great to find a way to make it work!

I've been intimate with a guy for 3 years now. It's to the point where he phones me literally everyday and worries about me if I don't answer or I don't phone him. It's not even text messages it's a full on conversation. We talk about personal things a lot and I can talk to him about literally anything and everything including all the issues that I'm going to bring up. I would consider him a good friend with benefits and I think he would consider me the same. Even though we talk everyday I only see him about once every two weeks. 


My friend is in an open relationship, although he doesn't have sex with his husband anymore. He's been married for at least 20 years now. He has a few friends who are intimate with his husband too. I tried making friends with his husband and an extra partner they had. I ended up being mistreated heavily by his alcoholic husband and friend. (It wasn't rape but it was pretty complicated and emotional. It was definitively some form of abuse.) I talked to my friend heavily about what happened, but I don't talk to his husband or friend at all.

I decided to stay friends with my friend but it's really difficult because I can't visit him at his own home anymore since his husband is almost always home. I tried to visit for a few minutes back in 2010 and I ended up crying after 15 minutes of being in the same room with him. I can't phone my friend either because I'm afraid that his husband will pick up. When I first got to know my friend I tried asking my friend over for the night and he refused. He said that he didn't want to leave his husband at his house. I respected that for 3 years and it's getting to me right now. I talked to my friend about this and he said there's nothing really stopping him from doing so right now since things changed...but I don't have a bed right now...I'm sleeping on my couch. I still find it uncomfortable for me to ask since he made a big deal about him leaving his house.

I know his other friend who has sex with his husband spends a lot more time with them. I'm really jealous. He even went to gay pride parade with them both. I rarely leave my house let alone leave with them to gay pride parade. I'm really jealous that their friend was treated nicely by both of them and didn't end up getting mistreated and abused. 

I mentioned poly offhandedly and he said he doesn't believe that it could ever work. I just mentioned it though, I didn't mean to imply anything about us when I did. I would feel extremely guilty if I actually loved him though. I am not ""in love"" with him. I think that if we were to actually be in a polyamorous relationship then the deep seated issues I mentioned would not be absolved at all. Thte issues I have with what happened is what needs to be worked out and no amount of ""official love"" would really fix that. These are things that *make me feel more depressed though.* I mean, just it's just a really depressing thing to realize. It's like the polar opposite to the beatles song ""all you need is love.""

It's just depressing that so much of our friendship is hindered by what happened when his (drunk) husband got involved. On one hand I wish things between me and my friend were official, but I know that wouldn't fix anything at all. I just wish that I could physically see my friend more than once every 2 weeks or that he could spend the night and make me feel like he was spending time with me. I wish he could see me in real life as much as he made time for talking to me on the phone. It's like he doesn't want to see my face or something. It makes me feel awful. 


I appreciate any and all advice, but I appreciate anyone who read this just as much. I just needed to get that off my mind more than anything right now. I'm not expecting quick answers.

I'm interested in poly, I have been for most of my adult life, but I haven't had any experience with it, so I'm pretty much a total n00b. My relationships have all been monogamous (I was even married for 5 years) so it wasn't anything I serious considered pursuing as a possibility. 

I'm currently in a relationship with a lovely young lady and we've been seeing each other for almost 5 months. We're in love, share many common interests, and get along great.

About a month and a half ago my roommate expressed feelings for me. I've known her for years and have always been quite fond of her, but she was in a relationship most of that time, so nothing came of it. And now my girlfriend and I were exclusive, so I instinctively declined. I told my girlfriend about it, and she was generally nonchalant about the whole thing.

A few weeks later, I discover my girlfriend is into other women in the bedroom. We've spent some time talking about it and even had a few close calls with almost bringing other women home, but we're also taking it slow. I mentioned the fact to her that I felt I was poly and would prefer that this other woman was someone we had a meaningful relationship with, but she has trust issues with a past boyfriend sleeping with the another woman they brought home behind her back. So we agreed that if we involve other women, it's only when we're both present. I am ok with that, but I still feel the same about it.

So now a few days ago my roommate is back saying she's still interested in me and is having trouble getting over me. I declined again and told her I wouldn't leave my girlfriend, but she's persisting and is willing to even be a secondary relationship. And of course now things have changed with my girlfriend and new information that has come to light there, plus I know my roommate has also had intimate relationships with other women in the past. My girlfriend and roommate both know each other and hang out frequently and get along well. It seems like all the pieces might be there, I just don't know how to put them together.

I can't express in words how awesome it could be to get to have serious relationships with both of these sweet women together, I just don't know if they're open to it or how to get there, or if there may be other options. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR; I want a poly relationship with these two great women, who may or may not be poly, and don't know where to start.",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_177bar,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/177bar/i_31m_want_a_relationship_with_my_girlfriend_25f/,

So far we've played with one other couple, which unfortunately didn't turn out so well. We're both still very positive about having an open relationship - they just weren't a good fit for us.

I've also started sleeping with a long-term friend(We shall call him 'A') and my partner is courting another mutual friend('B). He's quite shy though and has yet to make a move, I'm really excited for him - I'm pretty sure she's into him(And if not, a good flirting/tickling session never hurt anybody).

But here is my dilemma:
Next week a large group of my friends are going to an outdoor movie. At this movie everyone brings bean bags/pillows/blankets and lies around outside watching a film.
A and B are both going to be there, and as B lives kind of far away this is a really great opportunity for my partner to have some ace cuddling time(And if he plays his cards right, bring her back to our's!!)
I'm also looking forward to seeing A.

The majority of our friends know the score with our relationship, and they're all awesome and supportive.
However my partner's sister is also going to be at the cinema...

I've briefly talked with her about open relationships/polyamory and she has a very hard-line attitude of, ""No. That's disgusting and wrong. Anyone who does that obviously doesn't love their partner.""
I didn't want to put my partner in an awkward situation, so I dropped the conversation before digging myself too deep of a hole.

I was wondering how many of your families know about your lifestyle? Did it put any/much strain on your family ties?

My opinion is that the sister can get stuffed, she has no say in our lives and we're happier now than we've ever been. My partner has the same attitude. but he also cares deeply about his family and I know that their disapproval would hurt him(Although he has a hard time admitting it). 

Do you think it's worth her finding out at the cinema, or should we just cool it on the night?

I have an old friend outside of my relationship that I'm becoming more attracted to. I know he considers himself non-monogamous and I would really like to explore non-monogamy with him. 

Beyond a friendship I don't want to be emotionally involved with my friend, and I want to keep my current relationship healthy and stable. I don't think these feelings are just a phase because I've always craved some variety.

Since people regularly post both sorts of things here, personal stories and information about general nonmonogamy subjects, I figured it might be appropriate. And I'm always looking for more feedback.]

Like many of my writings about my decision making process, value system, priorities, and thoughts, this one is about planning ahead. I like to make broad categories of decisions in advance so that I don't have to make them on short notice. I have more time right now to think about these things, to collect the views of my friends and peers, to weigh consequences and repercussions, and generally to make a good decision than I will when it comes time to put that decision into action.

You probably think this post is about sex and cheating. You probably think ""don't be involved in other people breaking the rules of their relationships"" is a pretty straightforward statement, and a good rule to live by. I'd like to disabuse you of that notion. You need to think a lot more broadly about rules that might exist in a relationship, and the myriad factors that might affect your decisions and lead to those rules being broken. It's rarely safe to deal in absolutes, so let me start by thoroughly stepping outside that box. My take on this whole concept is a work in progress, but more often than not my reaction to such situations is going to be ""She knows more about her relationship than I do. I'm going to let her make those decisions and she is responsible for the consequences. I may impose honest communication requirements on her as a condition of my participation."".

[note: I'm going to use gendered terms here and talk about a hypothetical girl and her boyfriend, because almost all of the people I play with are female, and almost all of them have other male partners. Everything I'm saying here applies to other relationship combinations as well.]

First and foremost, we need to explore what ""rules"" might mean. How are they stated? Are we talking about him just saying ""don't do X"", or her also saying ""I won't do X""? What happens if the ""rules"" are broken? There are big differences in ""we will break up if you do X"" and ""we will fight if you do X"" and ""I will complain to my friends if you do X"" and ""you owe me Y if you do X"". The second and third ones are the most common. The fourth one gets tricky, especially if the she isn't actually willing to Y when she does X, but at that point it degenerates to one of the other three cases. The first one is actually the easiest, because then they both have a simple way out of the relationship, although in reality the first one rarely exists without being surrounded by the second one. The possibility to renegotiate actually changes the nature of rules significantly, as does her willingness to communicate about them to her partner or to me.

Another factor that plays a key role here is initiation and intent. There is a difference in her asking me for sex and me asking her for sex, if we both know she's in a sexually exclusive relationship. That difference, and the difference in impact, changes as the importance/significance of the rule changes. There is, hopefully obviously, another difference in me asking, depending on whether I know or not. For the sake of this discussion, let's assume I know at least something about her rules (communication problems are covered later).

There is also the consideration of timing. How is the situation different if what I am doing with her is ongoing, but a new relationship or new relationship rule comes into play for her that would require us to change our behavior? I have, multiple times in the past, permanently shared a room and a bed with a monogamous girl with whom I was, completely or to some significant degree, not intimate. If she entered a new relationship and her partner tried to create or enforce a ""no living with another guy"" or ""no just-sleeping with another guy"" rule, is that different than if she asked to move into my house or room with me after their relationship and rules already exist?

Plenty of people will try to break this down into a discussion about how she should deal with the rules she doesn't want to follow, within her existing relationship. That's a wonderful conversation to have, and I'm no stranger to giving tough relationship advice, but it's moot in this context. No matter what I say to her, and what she says to her partner, their relationship might still exist with the rules unchanged afterwards. If the nature of the relationship changes, great, but for the sake of this discussion let's assume that it doesn't. So if your response to this whole post is ""tell her she should renegotiate or break up"", that's unhelpful, because when the renegotiation fails and they don't break up (which is, by far, the most likely outcome in my experience) we are right back where we started and I've still got the same decisions to make.

Just to ensure most of you have left behind the ""breaking her relationship rules is always bad"" idea, let's start with something relatively ""innocent"". If I have a female friend and her boyfriend tells her ""never talk to other guys"", I have absolutely no problem talking to her if she wants to talk to me. I'll talk to her. I'll aid and abet her in talking to other guys. I'll probably commit lies of omission by not going out of my way to tell her boyfriend about our conversation. If he catches us talking, or someone snitches on her, I'll defend our actions to him. If someone else insults her for talking to me, I'll defend her to them, as much as I'll defend my own choices in discussions about this post. All of that also applies to ""never be alone with other guys"" or ""never be out in public with other guys"" or ""never ride in another guy's car"", which I am happy to bundle together into a category about which I'll have no second thoughts and can't think of any exceptions to, in every permutation of all of the considerations mentioned above.

If you wouldn't talk to her, and/or you think less of me for my willingness to do so, then we have a fundamental difference in values and priorities regarding freedom, friendship, and relationships. You can keep reading, but I don't think there's much to gain for either of us in discussing anything I'm going to cover below if we can't agree on the above. If you want to debate me on any of this, it may prove more productive to limit our conversation to the earliest point on which we disagree.

Now that that's out of the way, for anyone still reading, let's talk about deciding which rules are OK to break and which aren't, and in what situations that line moves. At the other end of the spectrum (you know, because relationship rules lie on a number line, in a monotonically increasing order... right...) we have the rules ""don't fall in love with other people"" and ""don't engage in [some degree of] sexual activity with other people"". These rules, and the breaking of them, are very different, including different practical and emotional results and different concerns in the decision making process.

If she is falling in love with me (or with someone else, but in a situation where I have some important influential role to play in her decision making process) while she is in an emotionally committed and monogamous relationship, I'm going to have some very tough advice for her. I am not going to tell her not to follow her heart. I am going to insist that she tell her current partner how she feels. As soon as she is honest with him, I'll be ok with pursuing a relationship with her. If he doesn't want to be with her because she wants to be with me, he can break up with her, or she can break up with him, or they can even maintain some turbulent ""maybe we can work this out"" sort of arrangement. My only requirement is that he be informed and that she be honest with both of us about what's going on. If she can't do that, then we will remain friends, and our relationship won't progress in the direction she wants it to.

Another consideration that has some weight is how rules change in the telling. It's like a game of telephone. Her boyfriend wants to establish the rule ""don't become physically intimate with other people"" but what he says is ""don't sleep with other guys"". The message that reaches her brain is ""don't spend the night with other guys"", but what she says to me is ""I can't have sex with you"". At every step of that process, some information was lost, and in some cases gained. To some people, the original rule would seem mostly intact at this point, but to someone for whom bedroom (or elsewhere) play time means a lot more than intercourse, almost everything has been lost. If she appears willing to do things other than having sex with me, and what she's told me is that she can't have sex with me, I have no way of knowing that what we are doing will appear to her boyfriend to be breaking their relationship rules. I will always make an effort to suss out the real rules, as far as my potential partner knows them. I apologize in advance if it appears that I don't trust her, when in truth what I distrust is the reliability of information transfer from her boyfriend's brain to her mouth. I cannot control how successfully things are communicated from her boyfriend to her, and can't take responsibility with those parts of the communication process fail, but I can do my damnedest to make sure that any obvious intent behind his words gets to me. The best example of this is a girl who gave to me her sole intimate relationship rule as ""my panties stay on"", when what she really meant was ""no activities leading significantly toward orgasm for either of us, and no penetration"". It only took a few questions for me to narrow that down and illustrate some of the relevant differences to her, and I'd probably have had a bit more fun immediately if I hadn't, but now I've got a stronger, if slightly more constrained, relationship with her and can look forward to playing again in the future.

The final major consideration for me is long term practical consequences. Everything above is about dealing with interpersonal consequences, emotions, feelings, etc. All of that is also related to decisions that can be changed on a moments' notice (you can stop sleeping with someone at any time). Separate from all of that is another category that includes objective matters that can't be conveniently dismissed. I've had trouble writing some of the guiding rules for this category, so I'm going to fall back to examples here. I will never get a girl pregnant if her other partner(s) don't want that. I will not enter into important legally binding contracts, including business partnerships or marriage, with a girl who I have a relationship with, who is also in another relationship, if there are significant unresolved issues related to conflicts between those relationships. I won't allow the two of us to expose a third party to life changing legal consequences that they haven't consented to (getting a ticket because we were naked in your car, not particularly life changing). I won't expose a third party to STD risk (except kissing diseases) without their knowledge. I'll probably add more items to that list over time, and I hope to be able to distill out broader and more effective base rules for this category in the future.

Now, all that having been said, we come to the most divisive part of this subject. We lost a few people at the beginning with the ""don't talk"" rule, and a few more will have breezed through all of this with no qualms about ever respecting others' rules, but most people reading this article will have, at this point, put roughly the same selection of things above into the ""ok"" and ""not ok"" boxes. Where that consistency is going to break down is with regards to physical activities, particularly intimacy. Some of you are going to say that breaking almost any rules about physical intimacy is bad. Some of you are going to say that it's not. Plenty of you are going to draw the line somewhere in the middle.

As I said above, it's impossible to put all of this in a strict order. Some people place more importance on certain aspects than others. So I'm going to throw these out there in a rough order that approximates the priorities of most of my social circles in terms of relationship exclusivity.

Some activities may seem intimate to one person, but not to another. Some examples of this would include living in the same house (but not the same room or bed), celebrating holidays together, or participating in therapeutic/medical things like exercise, yoga, massage, meditation, etc.

Some activities can be intimate, but might not be explicit or obscene. Hand holding, hugging, kissing, massage, being naked in each others' company.

Some activities can be intimate, explicit, and potentially obscene, but might not be sexual. This category includes a wide range of fetish and kink activity, far more than I could enumerate here.

And, finally, there are sexual activities. These can range from erogenous sensation play while fully clothed to orgasm-inducing stimulation to penetration of various sorts to more depraved acts.

I'm going to end this writing in somewhat of an anti-climactic manner. I explicitly can't draw a bright line dividing all of those activities by acceptability like I did with some of the items at the extremes earlier in this post. For every act that I just described I have both broken and repeatedly chosen not to break someone's relationship rules under different circumstances. Every factor I mentioned above comes into play in how I make decisions about physical intimacy, and every situation is different.

I (24/f) have been dating a great guy (24/m) for 2 years, but I've always had an inkling that I will never be able to commit to a monogamous relationship. I have brought up opening up the relationship several times, but he was always pretty opposed, due to jealousy. I struggle with this a lot because I'm bi and I have been craving sex with a woman for quite some time. But, besides the sexual differences we are a great pair so I did my best to let it slide. Our families are really tight, our friends are really tight, his dog thinks I'm the momma, and he's the only one who sort of ""gets me.""

I'm a traveler, and a month ago I moved to another country to volunteer for a few months. We didn't break up beforehand, but as soon as I got there he started getting really clingy and depressed. He was making me feel guilty for going off and chasing my dreams while he was stuck at a job he didn't like. I started realizing we weren't going to work out. I am too much of a rambler and he is too concerned with stability. I want to help people, but he is concerned with money. The sex had been stagnant for quite some time, and I was really frustrated and a little angry. Also, I will be leaving our home country for two full years after this current stint, and I know I could never maintain a closed relationship for that time. I had had ""that feeling"" in the pit of my stomach for quite some time.

So, I stayed at a hostel with some friends one night, and we met some really fun people and had a bunch of drinks together. I slept with a guy. We used a condom the whole way through and I'm on the pill. I'm not pregnant and have no mystery rashes. I will never see this guy again, and have no lingering thoughts about him. But still, I cheated on my boyfriend of 2 years. I used to have nightmares about this, but at the time, I was so frustrated that I didn't even feel bad about it. WTF?

My friends here (not our mutual friends, my new traveling friends) told me that there was no reason to tell my boyfriend, that it would only hurt him more. I am usually 100% honest with him, but I decided to make an exception (and now I'm regretting it). I called him and told him that I just couldn't do this closed relationship anymore... that I needed to explore myself... that it didn't make any sense with all of our time apart. I figured this would be a break-up call.

Well, it turns out that after he thought about things, he agreed with me. He was ok with opening up the relationship to a certain extent: no p-in-v, no emotional attachment, but do whatever you want with ladies (!!!). He had also had a complete revelation about his direction in life, and was volunteering on his own and searching for a job that he is passionate about. He wants nothing more than to travel with me. He is coming to visit me in a little bit. He is actually growing with me, which I had given up hope on.

He will never find out unless I admit it. I have to tell him, right? Yeah, I do. But when? When he is here visiting me? After, when I'm back home? I really messed shit up, huh? Does anyone else have any stories like this that ended well? I love him. I just had to fuck someone else to realize it. Or maybe, I am delusional since I haven't seen him in so long. Maybe he is just pretending to be the person he knows I want. GAH. Thanks for reading. I don't think many of my friends would understand.

So, I ask her out. She says that she'd really like to go out, but they have a lot going on, company coming into town and so on.  I suggest we just get together briefly then, just meet up for coffee or something, some time, without our spouses. She says she'll get back to me.

She gets back to me a day later and says she can't do it right now. She says it's because she and her husband have a rule that when things get really hectic in their lives they shut down outside activity and just focus on kids, company, work stress, etc until things level out.

I am not at all the jealous type, so I have been very open since the beginning of the relationship about the fact that I do not care if he looks at/flirts with/sleeps with other women, but he has had no interest, as he had never even considered anything but monogamy before. 
We have been talking more and more about the idea of flirting with other women, with the idea of perhaps having the occasional threesome or fling (again, because of his trust issues, women only, which is all I am desiring anyway). 
Then comes along: my friend B. B is a very close friend from childhood. We grew into our sexualities with each other, and eventually were in a relationship for about 3 years. It didn't work out because of differences in lifestyles, and we are still outrageously attracted to the other. The last 6 months or so, my partner, M, and B have been getting to know each other and flirting pretty good. Recently, B and I hooked up (with full permission by M). Hot sex goes down, and passion reemerges. B and I have talked about the fact that our relationship would not work with it just being us; but it would function entirely differently, and seemingly better from our current perspective, in a three-way relationship with M. She and M are liking each other more and more, but the whole thing is currently unfeasible to pursue, since she is in another state for school. (Note: M and I are no longer in school.)

The issue at hand: B has recently got herself a girlfriend. A NONSEXUAL girlfriend. All the cuddling and kissing you could want, but the girlfriend is bi-romantic, heterosexual. Blueballs the shit out of B. And here is the catch: for the first time I can remember, I feel jealous. I am jealous of B's girlfriend. I am freaking jealous. Not sexually, but romantically. Why does this girl get to cuddle and have the relationship label when she doesn't even LIKE girls sexually? It isn't fair. 
I know I am being ridiculous, since I can't pursue anything other than flirting for the time being. I dislike hearing stories about the girlfriend, especially ones that get recognition from her parents or the public (B was not out when we were together). B talks about wishing we could hook up again, and flirts, but is dedicated to her partner. 

Dear r/nonmonogamy, how does one deal with jealousy? What stories do you have that might lend some insight? Any advice on how to continue this?

I've been thinking about things recently and after reading the book Sex at Dawn and other articles, I've opened myself up more to the fact that monogamy honestly doesn't work for most people. Personally, at this 
point in my life, my ideal relationship would be where I only had eyes for my partner and he only had eyes for me and we were completely compatible and monogamous. However I realise that this is not realistic. I understand that some relationships are like that and monogamy comes very easy for them but for most people there are still temptations.


I'm demisexual myself so I don't feel sexual attraction unless I'm already in love and it takes a bloody long time to come around. Therefore I don't really understand the whole 'I really need to fuck this person even though I don't love them' thing that people often go through in relationships. A strong emotional connection and sex are completely linked for me as I cannot separate them however I understand how other people can. This led to me rethinking what I thought was important in relationships and honestly, sexual exclusivity isn't really topping my list anymore. 


Due to this epiphany of sorts, I've come to realise that my new ideal relationship would be a technically open relationship. My partner and I would both be free to have sex with other people outside of the relationship if we chose to but there would be full disclosure and lots of honesty between us.


Obviously there would be rules but my new ideal would involve neither of us taking up the opportunity because we were satisfied with the relationship we had. The open relationship part would just be there to take the pressure off of the relationship. It would allow both of us to be able to pursue small flings if we wished or allow us to explore different parts of our sexuality that the other partner might not want to indulge. 


I definitely know that romantic connections would be off the table because I don't know if I could handle my partner falling for someone else. I'm monogamous in the emotional sense and technically in the physical sense unless I was extremely good friends with someone. 


I feel fairly comfortable with the idea and although jealousy would be an issue, the communication and rules laid out would help that. I just feel that now I value the love and honest communication of a relationship more than sexual exclusivity of it. 


However most people I have talked to this about have either laughed at the idea or thought it was wrong and unnatural to think a relationship like this would work. Right now I feel like I'm a bit of a freak for thinking about this and having the view of not wanting to limit my partner too much if they really wanted to have sex with other people. I just feel like this kind of a relationship would be healthier because the monogamy would be a choice but not essential.

So is this weird? Am I strange for thinking that having sex with someone else while in a relationship doesn't diminish the love you have for your partner? Polyamory's not for me but I still feel like I'm strange for thinking like this.

Anyway, I have a couple of questions on where to find partners, and how to screen out ""undesirables"".

First, where should we be looking? We're both into the BDSM scene already, with profiles on Fetlife, and I've suggested that we both have a profile section that mentions it. But Fetlife isn't really a dating/hookup site, more of a kinky Facebook. Swingers' websites seem like the other obvious option, but it's a question of which to use. What I've seen looked fairly US-centric, and we're in the UK. Also, I get the impression that the swinging community trends much older. I'm 23, she's 21, and we'd rather get involved with people closer to our own age.

Second, after discussing what we're looking for, it seems like we'd both rather play with a couple, as a couple. Failing that, we're both bi, so bisexual men and women are both options. But how do I distinguish between those who genuinely want to play with a couple and those who are willing to accept the inconvenience of another man to get to the woman? Given the profiles I saw on sites I looked at that stated that they're looking for either a single woman or a couple, that seems worryingly plausible.

I'm a person that will only be comfortable being monogamous in a serious relationship. The thought of sleeping with someone besides my partner or my partner sleeping with someone else give me equal amounts of stomach pain. The thing is I'm starting to wonder how unreasonable that is.


I feel that Nonmonogamy seems a little more natural then a two person sexual relationship. When you mention an open relationship most people think about their SO having sex with someone else and have a negative reaction, but i believe those same people actually are not disgusted with the idea of sleeping with other people if their partner allowed it.


I think it comes down to three things religious beliefs, moral beliefs and how your emotions will be effected. Some people will religiously and morally just disagree with the idea of their partner sleeping with someone else but the rest are just motivated by feelings of jealousy and inadequacy.


What I'm trying to say is that I'm starting to feel it's unreasonable to expect anyone to desire wanting to have sex with one person for the rest of their lives. 5 years, 10 years, 20 years eventually things will get stale.

You often hear stories of people opening up their relationships or deciding that the type of relationship for them is a nonmongamous one. Never the other way around nonmonogamy is a step forward in sexuality, self confidence and trust.

Whether or not the person I'm with realizes that they want a more open sex life it will still have an effect on the relationship. Resentment can build, tempers can shorten and the option to cheat will seem more attractive even though there is a viable solution.

Even though I'm not comfortable with the idea I feel like i should be. As if i should begin this journey where the destination is sexual acceptance

Of course there are people who only want monogamy but because there are people who are better suited in a nonmongamous relationships that don't even consider it because they have never been told that it is an option.

There are people in open relationships that dont want to be there. People are in monogamous relationships that want out. There are people who know what they want and people that don't. You should always consider your options.

Is it reasonable for me to start to change myself in order to become someone that can be able to make that transition when it does arise?

We (25f33m) have been together a year. I am very sexually experienced, have tried everything that has come my way (no pun intended) and am still experiencing new things with my partner. He is also very experienced. I guess he slept around a lot and experienced a lot, but has had 3 long term mono r/s. 

Before him, I was in a MFF r/s. It was a great experience. The other girl involved was with various other people but he and I just stuck with her and each other (me seeing anyone else was taboo I think). 

So a year ago I meet my man and it's unlike anything else. I had never been **SO** compatible with someone in every facet and it was really deep love really early on. Still is to this day. He still gives me butterflies and I light up when he is around. We were open about our sex lives in the first few months. I told him about my poly experience and he totally understood but it was never something he'd try even though he is open to almost everything else? I would love to talk to him further about my experiences (just to shed some light and because it turns me on) but I think he'd rather not hear indepth history. That's fine.

I told him I am fine with mono AND poly but I would be entirely faithful to him as that was very, very true at the time. I think that was a mistake. I still fantasize about women, and always wanted to try MMF - badly. I have no intention of cheating on him, or even introducing him to the idea... I know I can be totally devoted to him but still have my fantasies. He knows I get off on the thought of women and he pleasures me more than anyone else ever has so I doubt I'll ever get bored with him.  
However, what if in a few years from now, I regret my choice?

We were so loving, so close, and were even talking about marriage.

She never knew about a side of me that I had been combatting since I was 17 years old. I had and was still having sexual conversations with men and women on Plenty of Fish, Craigslist and other random chatrooms.

Rewind to when I'm still loving with my mother, before I met my girlfriend. I had turned 18 and moved from my little tiny town to the city. That dark side of me knew that I could finally encounter people rather than just talking. But I put that off for as long as I could because I was scared.

Fast foreward half a year of me living in the city. I meet a girl on nexopia that I become pretty serious with. Very serious. Serious enough that I spend the 200 dollars to see her in her hometown 9 hours away. This is the first time ive met anyone that ive talked to online in person before. It's one of the most amazing times of my life with a woman. It felt so right.

Just back home after the trip, I am really combatting my tendacies to talk to men and women online because i'm now in a serious relationship. There's phases where I CAN control myself, keep myself away from porn and sex chatting... but they dont last for long, and I end up repeating the same behaviour, and feel extremely guilty for caving back in. This goes on over and over again and becomes more and more physically exhausting.

One day, for now known reason in my mind, I make the step and encounter a man for recieving oral. Nervous as hell and knowing that it is extremely wrong for my relationship, and my confusion in my own head as to why I am doing this, I still let it happen. Extreme guilt afterwards. Confusion about my sexual orientation, confusion about why I let it happen, about whether I should tell my girlfriend... But No. I keep it inside, hoping I can just make it go away.

These encounters happen again and again for months, during my relationship... now meeting women as well.

Then, the day where all my lies of saying that i'd never hurt her start to crack... I call her by the wrong name, I forget to respond to her texts. She can tell somthing is not all quite right with me, and that our relationship had changed, became more distant.

The last time she came to visit me, it all started unhinged. My phone made a notification that i had an email, and it was from someone i was sexting a long time ago. Ashamed, i dont try to justify it... theres no justifying this as if it were right. I tell her how i've been chatting with men and sending pix... but that's it. I left out the fact that i've been meeting them AND women for over half of the time I was with her. I thought that leaving out some of the more harmful things would keep us together, have her at least keep SOME of her trust and give me some time to fix things without her knowing.

I've nearly lost all her trust by now... But now that i'm contronted with having to find a reason for this behaviour, i'm seeking out counselling. Not out of guilt for being caught and to humour her, because i'm genuinely wanting to find out why I let this behaviour happen and carry on.

After a trip home to see my family and tell them what i've told my girlfriend, as well as all the other things i've done behind her back, I recieve a text from one of the women I slept with, saying she might be pregnant. While texting her, i mistakenly send a text to my girlfriend. I make up some bullshit story about how its a friend asking me for advice and how this friend might be pregnant... I know deep down that my girlfriend doesnt buy it.

My girlfriend says she wants to ask my ""friend"" what her side of the story is. This is where I now know that keeping up a charade and continuing to lie is useless now, and come unglued.

She now knows everything. Every detail, how i've been meeting men and women, how a woman i slept with might be pregnant. She doesnt understand how I could tell her i truly and honestly love her and want to be with her, and do all these disloyal things behind her back... And neither do I.

In the situation of seeing the MEN though, it's an impulse unpredictable, really... I'm not romantically attracted to men in any way, it's just while i'm aroused and watching porn or I randomly think of it, I end up talking to men. Any other time than that, Theyre not on my mind not even when I was having sex with my girlfriend. If i'm bisexual deep down, thats fine, but thats not the point.

during Every encounter I had, every time I sent a picture, I knew it was wrong and knew what the consequenses would be... for some reason, they never stuck strong enough to really MAKE me stop this behaviour, even though I would have given the woman I was in a relationship with the world and everything.

I'm now taking sexual addiction counselling, after going to Mental Health and having them explain that this behaviour sound like a sexual addiction (Implulsive, uncontrollable behaviour even though you know its wrong, and feeling unfathomable guilt afterwards, yet repeating it).

So, my question is... Why do I do this? What dark, confused, emotional depth of my brain is so lost or disconnected that I Tell someone I love them, have true, deep feelings of love for them, and yet commit such disloyal, painful, backstabing acts, without fully grasping the consequences?

He was okay with it, being not interested personally in a real relationship at the time.
My BF and I have been together for 8 years. We talk about everything, and we both agreed that one person is never going to satisfy every our each and every need, both emotionally and physically. We both have no problem with the thought of the other being with someone else.

I don't see why I have to tell him that I have another physical relationship occurring right now. It feels like that if I told him it would be for my own peace of mind. I have no idea how this information would ever enrich his life or be of any value to him. I mean, this information I can compare with having a shower or making abed or something (basically just a part of some sort of routine) so why is it important?

Yet I feel compelled to let him know! I don't know what it is, maybe it's because of ingrained cultural guilt over a non monogamous relationship. It wouldn't bother me if he was with other women, or if he never told me.

Please, feel free to comment with your rules or lack thereof.

Because I am newly sober, there have been breaches of trust in the past, and because I want to avoid falling for just anyone, my partner and I have agreed I should restrict myself in these ways.

Casual sex: penetration only if the individual is well vetted. Oral sex, kissing, groping with strangers as long as contact info is not exchanged. May not move into the dating zone.

Kink: no sexual play. No bottoming without partner's presence and consent (or just consent). In general, anything goes at kink parties (which so far have been devoid of sex) and with pre-approved individuals. Topping is fine.

Dating: I am seeking an emotional attachment, but I have a history of making everything just about sex.Dates have end times. No orgasms. No kink play. If building an emotional attachment with a kinky person, I may not play outside of parties and we must not include even light kink in our date/alone time. Holding hands, hugging, snuggling, wrestling, kissing, backrubs etc are fine. Touching boobs and genitals are not fine. Disrobing is not ok. I do not share any details of sexual/physical intimacy with my partner unless specifically asked. I share if I go beyond these rules.

Time: I put dates in our calendar. As much as possible, I schedule dates/sex/kink for when my partner is at work.

I have no interest in seeking out someone for myself.

I have no problems with the physical aspect of this at all, since I have a pretty low libido level (and I do get to be involved if I want).

I don't think I'm jealous or threatened. So we seem to have a mostly V-type relationship as far as labels go.

But I am torn on being open about this to anyone. On the one hand, it falls under the ""sex life is private business"" category. On the other hand, Friend is a person, not a sex toy, and hubby shouldn't have to be subjected to ""omg he's cheating"".

I don't have anyone else to bounce ideas or talk about this with, because, you know, scared. So I turn to the faceless folks on the 'net.

We are both very very in love but almost entirely straight, and in an open relationship partially due to that but also because we think it makes more sense to us than monogamy would.

In the beginning of our relationship, I was very gung-ho about it, and had lots of fun, but then started to feel less and less okay with the situation, both in terms of seeing him with other people and being with other people myself. After having sex myself with a girl about a year ago and it being awesome, she being super supportive and boundary-respecting and everything, I felt like shit the next day. To this day I've been trying to figure out why. Just something about it didn't feel right.

Since then, we've been trying to work through this issue in baby steps. One of the things I asked of Boyfriend is to a. always use a condom (yes, sometimes he flags, boooo) and b. text me or discuss with me in advance a general description of what he's planning on doing so that my imagination doesn't run wild with some sort of worst-case scenario. (For example, ""On my date with Rachel tonight I'm going to try to kiss her, but if she moves past that, I'm going to go along with it."" Whatever the situation.) My worst case scenario tends to be that it's gonna be way better than with me and they're gonna elope or something. Or that he'll leave me to be with a girl instead. Ridiculous, I know, but it hurts regardless of the sense it doesn't make.

Today he texts me and says he's hanging out with a female friend of ours, which I assume he means as a hook-up type scenario. I text back ""Okay..."" because he hasn't given me very much information to go off of and I was trying to prompt him to be more specific. I assume that they are having sex, get irritated and upset and unable to concentrate for like ten minutes, and eventually calm down and stop thinking of it as a big deal.

An hour and a half later, he comes home with a really apologetic look on his face and a burger for me (as some sort of weird token of apology? I dunno, I thought it was hilarious). He said that he saw my text after they were finished fucking and that he was SO sorry that he hurt me, here's a burger, etc etc. I sort of nervous-laughed and was like, ""What? I'm not bothered at all. I was antsy for 10 minutes and then I realized that I trust you and I trust her so there's nothing to worry about.""

He of course was delighted. I felt a little resentful that he had hung out with her instead of spending time with me, especially because we hadn't had the chance to have sex in a while. I asked him to recount the specifics because the more it's discussed, the less it feels like cheating or dishonesty for me. And then because I thought it was adorable that he was so worried about my feelings, and also adorable that he had succeeded in getting laid, we had sex too. :)

So I overcame lots of things that have been bothering me and I think I'll really be able to be happy with nonmonogamy again.

Sorry about the length of this post, and also if this is posted in the wrong place.

My boyfriend is someone I have known since I was 12 or 13. We met online and I have come to live with him and his family.

My other significant other is my Dominant. My boyfriend met him at school and introduced us. Sir and I have been together with my Boyfriends good wishes since around March 2012.

With Sir, things are great. Sir really understands me. Sometimes I worry that I am burdening him with my depression and emotional issues, but other than that we are great. I feel loved by him and understood by him. In the bedroom, things are equally fine. We have sex fairly frequently. I love my Sir a great deal.

With boyfriend things have gotten more and less rocky on different issues. Recently I don't feel like Boyfriend really understands me or my depression. He has a very cynical approach to a lot of life these days, and he simply doesn't offer any emotional support like he used to when we were younger. I feel like much of this is just stuff I need to get over on my own (the depression) and once I am more stable emotionally, we won't have this issue of me feeling neglected emotionally. I feel like since he supports me by feeding me and letting me live with him and working all the time to support me. . . the least I can do is not dump my emotions all over him constantly.

Then comes the matter of bedroom. Boyfriend and I haven't ever had a stellar bedroom experience. He doesn't have a single dominant bone in his body and I am extremely submissive. He has tried domming me and its failed spectacularly. I just can't submit to his style of domming. When we do have sex it feels very detached, and more ""well, we better get this done"" sort of attitude. Neither of us are emotionally invested in it and its short, clunky, and just barely satisfying enough for him to get him off. He doesn't ever get me off, and it isn't because he hasn't tried to. . . but more because hes tried and tried and we always just both end up giving it up. The result is him and I basically never having sex, and when we DO it only for his relief. It'd far more awkward than just him jacking off in private, so that's what normally ends up happening.

Because of these two issues. . . I feel emotionally distanced from him despite knowing he really does love and care for me. I love and care for him as well. When we hang out and watch movies or tv or play video games. . . we have great discussions about them and really enjoy our time.

But deep in the back of my mind I have this dreading feeling that this is NOT enough to make a relationship around. I feel wrong for sticking around despite actually loving him. I feel like he is only letting me be with Sir because he knows if he says no. . . I will resent him or leave him over it.

I wouldn't leave Boyfriend if he said I couldn't be with Sir. But I WOULD go back to being depressed much more often. This plagues me with guilt.

Boyfriend is a MASSIVE introvert and doesn't know anybody else. And I know if I left he wouldn't put any effort into finding anybody else. He would be all alone.

I don't know what to do. Is it right to stay with Boyfriend if he continues to say he is fine with how things are? I don't feel its healthy to continue never having sex, especially when its something I know Boyfriend would LIKE to have in our relationship.

In the end the anxiety absolutely destroyed me. I also began to realize over time that these two women both had clinical mental issues. After further inquisition, I figured that they both used 'polyamory' (open relationships) as more of a scapegoat for their deeper issues with emotionally opening up and trusting one person in a relationship.

Anyways the question(s): Are there any of you who are polyamorous and in open relationships who are mentally healthy? Did you make the conscientious choice that this relationship type just makes you more happy?

I just need some proof that there are well-adjusted, well rounded, balanced people out there who are! I hope my question doesn't insult anybody. It's blunt, but I do not mean it offensively.

In high school and college I put my school work ahead of my personal life, to the extent that I didn't really have a girlfriend until I was a sophomore in college, and then after that I kind of buried myself back in work. I didn't really have a lot of success when I did try dating, and I really enjoyed the stuff I was doing in school, and the work tended to be life-consuming, as a curriculum, so I focused on that. After that, I was a broke graduate living with his parents desperately searching for a good job for two years, so combination of personal poverty, a full-time job search, and middling-levels of self-esteem (job rejections do a wonderful job of taking the wind out of your sail) left me ignoring the dating scene yet again.

Now I've got a full time job I'm happy with, I've got some money, I've got free time, and hopefully I'll be moving out on my own before the year's end. Problem is I can't ignore my sexuality any more. Came to terms with my bisexuality a while ago, and now I'm finding myself strongly drawn to a nonmonogamous lifestyle. Either something polyamorous or something with a nonmonogamous couple. It's what I really want, but I feel that the deck is stacked against me.

Frankly put, I'm a twenty five year old virgin. Things got serious with my girlfriend, but penetration was extremely uncomfortable for her. So when she offered, I passed out of respect for her (if she couldn't enjoy it, I couldn't). Things were sexual, but penetration never occurred. I feel my inexperience with men isn't going to cause me nearly as much trouble. I also feel the fact that I'm a single male is going to be a big issue for me too.

Other than that, I feel confident in myself. I've got energy, I've got confident, I'm communicative, honest, open, pro-active. I've dropped 65 lbs (and counting), I'm polite, respectful, well kept, and I'm actually pretty well versed in a lot of issues surrounding sexuality (my non-throwaway account participates in a number of subreddits on sexuality and sex positivity. Just because I'm not having sex doesn't mean I shouldn't know about it).

I suppose **here's my question: is it worth it for me, with the issues I've listed above, to seriously consider spending on an account like Lifestyle Lounge, or Adult Friend Finder**, or am I better off bumming around Craigslist (where I've gotten a few people who were interested, but randomly stop answering messages just when it seems we're hitting it off). I'm not totally against the idea of spending the money, but I don't want to spend on a service that will end up being totally useless for me. Or are there better things I should be doing? I'm not really interested in romance right now, I just want to let me inner ethical slut out, for once in my life. I have the time, the means, I'm out, and this is something I've always wanted to do.

They are now getting divorced.  I am sorry that their marriage didn't work out.  Arguably, they got married too young (we are all just barely 21).  But, it is still sad that they couldn't make it work.

I had a really strong (and purely sexual) connection with her husband, and would have liked to see where it could have gone.

(x-post /r/relationships)",2,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1kotl9/me27f_and_my_so_29m_of_2_years_are_swingers_after/,"We have been together almost 2 years, and lived together for most of that.


We swing (meaning we sleep with other couples, together) usually about once a week or once every couple weeks. We are good at separate sex and emotion, however I'm having a tough time after our last meetup.


I should premise this by giving a little more background: when we were first together, for about 8-9 months, we had sex all the time, like, multiple times a day and couldn't keep our hands off each other. After moving in together, an abortion, my stress being unemployed for almost a year, and the general wearing off of the honeymoon period, we settled in at about 2-3 times a week. When we have it, I think it's still great, but not as great, and I don't get off (I've always had a very hard having an orgasm without the help of toys, but I did have them with him for first 8-9 months of our relationship). He wants us to be having sex much more, and thinks that the honeymoon period should never wear off. I'm okay with settling into a ""companionship"" mode, he's not. The swinging complicates things, because he wants our sex to be the best and most exciting thing, with swinger sex coming in second. I, however, think that it's normal to be excited by others, and that it's fine to be even more excited about swinger sex. He's afraid that if I need to have sex with other people to be satisfied, I shouldn't be in this relationship.


Essentially, our ""spark"" is significantly diminished, but I love the spark I get with new couples.


Which brings me to our most recent encounter... I sexted with the male half for a couple days before we met up with them, exchanging pics, jerking off together, etc. It was super hot, and made our meeting even hotter. Built up anticipation, etc. etc.


When we met them, we had a great time, but afterward I could not stop thinking about the guy. I found myself wanting to keep texting him, see him again by himself...I didn't even really want to have sex with my SO anymore, just this other guy. I felt so guilty about it that I burst into tears when I was having sex with my SO, and broke down and told him everything.


To clarify, the sexting is not allowed. It's part of an emotional connection (or at least my SO sees it that way, and I concede to his wishes out of respect for him and for our relationship), and therefore not appropriate-- we are supposed to meet people, have sex with them, and that's it. If we text, it should be for logistical reasons. Anything else can be said in person, when we are all together.


It's now been 4 days since we met this other couple. I still can't stop thinking about the guy (I had very strong chemistry with him), and it's making me doubt my own relationship. I love my SO very much, and I want to be with him. He cares about me so much, he's honest, he's open, he's so patient with me, he's always there for me...but I'm afraid that I'm not happy. If I were, why would I be thinking about this other guy so much, even when we're having sex? Why do I feel so desperate for his attention and want to keep sexting him?


I know that our relationship has lost its spark, but I don't know how to get it back, or whether I can. I just feel so guilty, and I worry that if I'm not happy, I'm wasting the time of someone who frankly deserves much better. 

I guess I am looking for reassurance that what I'm feeling is normal, and will go away, and there is something I can do to fix my relationship and be better.

I think I'm breaking the theme of these posts of asking for insight, as instead of being the one in the relationship/marriage, I'm the one being invited to be the... 'other'? 2nd? ... I have no idea what it's called.

As background. I'm a gal, my friend is a gal, and her fiance is a guy. My friend and I have been friends since 6th grade. She's always been really open to me and told me in early high school of her being bi, and hinted at wanting to experimenting with me, probably hundreds of times, over the years. 

Back then though I was in a very weird place mentally and didn't let myself open up to her at all. But, do to what could be called a series of fortunately miss-fortunate events, after high-school I've stabilized considerably and have grown up quite a bit. I like to think anyways.

And the Now. We are both 22, best friends, talk regularly, and I'm to be her maid of honor at her wedding. Her fiance(till June) is a relatively chill guy and who has received my 'Night's approval for relationship with her friend' silver seal. We get along fairly well, but it's the level of drink together and argue about last weeks foot ball game/best video game/ect. I myself am single, not particularly looking for someone to date but wouldn't mind someone to mess around with, and I have no issues with non-monogamy. In fact I kind of think it's my kind of relationship, as I'm not overly into sex(I boarder Asexuality/demisexuality, but I have a bit of a sex drive that I find more as an annoyance than anything. I'm curious if a play-partner that I like will make it seam less like a chore and more enjoyable).

Now I'm sure you're sitting there wondering why I'm typing this, wasting your time, and not jumping in.

Honestly, I'm not entirely convened he does approve. I don't know him -super- well, but he has never struck me as the open relationship type. He did strike me as the type to be willing to do things he dislikes to make her happy though. I haven't talked to him directly about the concept, and I'm going off of her word and what I already know/feel. I'm not even sure how to talk to him on it as, again, I don't know him well or how to even approach it. Heck, I'm not even sure if I should involve my concerns into *their* relationship and let them make their own decisions.

I do know for a fact that if the shit hits the fan over the whole situation I will blame me and never forgive myself. I put allot of value on my friendships and there is no way I'd let something like that happen if I can prevent it. Add to the fact that, according to her, he would prefer a 3some kind of setting or him being invited in makes me unsure cause I can't say I'm interested in that(the idea of group sex is very much unappealing to me).

so... **tl&amp;dr: I don't know if I should accept the proposition nor how to talk to him to find out if my concerns are viable and should be addressed. Are there things I can do or say to help him be more comfortable with the idea, or should I respect and trust them both to make their own decisions(or mistakes) and just hope for no nuclear melt down or fall out?**",,False,self,t5_2rc24,False,,,True,t3_1c2ray,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1c2ray/had_a_proposition_presented_me/,

She's rarely ever in the mood. I (m18) almost always AM. This kind of stresses her out, even though I put no pressure on the subject of sex. The thing is, I'm not necessarily sexually fulfilled. In every other respect, things are awesome. We've been together for about a year, a we love each other very much, and connect on every other level, fantastically. She recently offered for me to have sex with other women. The plan is she would remain faithful, and I could sleep around. For a while, months ago, that was all I really wanted: A committed girlfriend, and the ability to sleep around. But now that it's offered to me, I'm kind of confused, and slightly wary. On one hand, it seems like the best offer imaginable and one that could relieve stress from both parties. On the other, it seems very dangerous and like something that may weaken our relationship. There are three things I'm concerned about. One, that she becomes jealous (though she promises she won't because she knows I love her). Two, that we become distant, sexless, and eventually taper off into the realm of ""maybe we should just be friends anyways"" (which she says won't happen because sex means very little to her, and quality time means more). And three, that she begins to think that she can go and sleep around with other guys (though she says she wouldn't do that, cause she's not attracted to other guys) which I would NOT be okay with. She may be okay with it, but I am not.

So, anyways, I'm just wondering what to do. Do I take the offer (she's basically begging me to)? Do we have any people who've tried anything similar? How did it turn out? I really don't want to lose her.

Are there certain rules that we can set in place to make this work out? How can we remain happy?
I really do love her a lot, and have no desire to end the relationship. I think, perhaps accepting her offer may strengthen our relationship, but I also fear it could damage it.

We both agreed that we were strictly FWBs. We would usually get together once a week, the sex was good, all was well. Until around January.

I was really, really busy around this time and didn't have time for Erik. He talked to me about feeling like my SO's ""back-up"" and that I was neglecting him. Okay. He's my friend first and foremost, so I told him I would make more of an effort. 

I did. I started seeing him once a week almost every week since then. He talked to Alan and me about being too couple-y in public (this was valid, we were) so we toned it down. In short, I have been doing my best to make him happy.

Catalyst: He has been having mood-swings the past few days. The three of us were hanging out and Alan and I did our best not to alienate him. I held Erik's hand, I kissed him a few times, little things like that, to make him feel included. Driving home to drop Erik off (Alan driving, Erik in shotgun, me behind Alan), I held Alan's hand and just kind of touched his shoulders and neck, not sexually, just affectionately. When we get to Erik's house, he gets out, slams the car-door, gets his stuff, and leaves, looking very angry while he does it. 

I have no idea what to do at this point. I'm sure he's going to confront me tomorrow, I just don't know what to do about it. If we weren't such good friends, I would have already broken it off, but I do want him to be happy, I just don't know how to make that happen.

I need some advice, reddit.  How do you convince other couples to try it out?

We have tried convincing the other guy to watch me make out with his gf, but they're uncomfortable with my bf watching too (fucked up huh?).  Or the girl is into my bf but too fucking jealous of her bf with me and isn't into girls as much so doesn't want to just have me.

How do we convince other young couples to stop denying their bodies and their desires?  All hope is lost with these two couples we tried with before, but I want to avoid fucking up with future people.

Sorry!!! Please excuse the length, I don’t know how to portray the situation honestly in less words.

TL;DR - Ummm, I got cheated on but I'm better and I have a few questions.

Ok, so I've been in a monogamous relationship for 12 years.  I recently learned that my girlfriend and I had a lack of communication about certain things in our relationship.  I used to have amazingly bad mistrust issues (even amazes me now).  She didn’t really know how bad though.  I always had the fear she might cheat on me or leave me for another guy.  I should specify that I do not have self-esteem, self-worth, or physical appearance problems at all.

Well, I caught her cheating on me as I read some texts on her phone.  She left the phone in the car to charge while we were at her sister’s house.  It went off and lit up and I was in the car first.  Thinking we had nothing to hide from each other, I was going to read it and pass on the message to her, since she didn't have the phone.  Well I found out it was sexual discussion with a co-worker that I'd never met.

No need to get into direct details of what they did or when.  Long story short, she says she was not looking to cheat on me.  It was a surprise to her that she had feelings from their conversations that started at work.  She says he is the only one she has cheated on me with.  She says that it was only going on for about 2 months before I found out.  She started the job 3 months from that time, so she started talking to him 1 month into the job.

After discussing it with her…  I found out that she was unhappy with the relationship for several reasons that I did not realize.  We are high school sweethearts.  I was always loyal, but I managed to give her the impression that I would not always be.  She would see me noticing other girl’s beauty.  While that is exactly what I was doing, I thought I was a normal human for it.  She even told me it is normal.  However, she has had every boyfriend before me cheat on her (all in high school).  She always told me that if I ever wanted to be with another girl to simply tell her first and leave her.  She always said that she could never understand how someone could cheat on someone else and be ok with it.  Well, now that she became a cheater… She still isn’t ok with it.  She apologizes all the time, she is seeing a psychologist.  She isn’t in a good place right now emotionally.

She says that nothing in the relationship is my fault.  I tell her that half of the fault is in fact my own.  I was always really possessive and I’d worry about things like her shirt exposing too much cleavage and ask her in a pretty harsh way to change clothes and stuff.  Back then (many years ago), the thought of any other guy having any sort of pleasure from even looking at my girlfriend tore me to shreds emotionally.  Her wearing revealing clothes (without realizing) used to hurt me as bad as her cheating on me when we were in high school.  Yeah, I told you I was bad about it then.

Well, she eventually (within the first 3 years) told me that she loved that I cared so much about her that I would voice concerns.  She didn’t always agree with my concerns, but respected them and was happy that I would be honest about it with her.  So for a long time, I didn’t recognize an issue in this form of controlling possessive behavior.  A huge mistake.

So 12 years go by and I think we are both extremely happy (before I read that text I mentioned).  She has always had a view that marriage is a bad idea.  Everyone in her family is either divorced or lives together with children and no marriage.  She views marriage as an SO’s way of tying a partner down and then acting the way they always wanted to before...  As if people act different to lure someone into marriage, then apply the ball and chain and turn into assholes.  I could never convince her that this was not the case with me.  I am explaining all this to provide insight as to why we did not marry within 12 years.  I never felt like she didn’t want to marry me specifically, just that she didn’t like the idea of marriage ever.  I was fine with it.  I felt we would always be together and had no issues.

Well, now that she has cheated on me, she has told me about all sorts of possessive things I have done that she always hated.  She only blames herself for never voicing her concerns.  She never truly believed me 100% that I loved her because of how I would look at other girls that walked by from time to time.  I should point out that I never saw it as a problem because she told me within our first year together that she is bi-sexual.  She looks at girl’s beauty too.  However, she has only recently been able to show me that her being bi does not mean she wants a boyfriend AND girlfriend at the same time.  Merely that she is open to a monogamous relationship with either gender.  Well, me being an idiot, I never recognized this.  I used to always give not so subtle hints that MFF threesomes would be fun.  She even liked the idea for a time.  We never did it.  Neither of us complained that we never did it though.

Ok, so for a while I was heartbroken over her cheating.  I felt like I wasn’t good enough for her and that she wanted to drop me.  She said that I was always good enough for her, but that her mistrust with marriage and me looking at girls made her feel that she was never good enough for me.  I believe her.  She has never been a person to lie (just hide things and never mention them).  She has such a huge amount of niceness, respect for strangers, charity and courtesy that I’d dare compare her to Mother Teresa before what she did to me.  She feels terrible for what she did.  We still discuss the situation all the time.  I’m trying to get over it 100% because I recognize my fault in the situation as well as hers.  I want to help her get better too.  I know that only then will we both be able to consider how the relationship will progress from there.  She is far from better though.

I wanted to come here because I find that if she and I are both agreeing that I am normal for looking at girls and whatever…. Well, maybe I deep down wanted to be non-monogamous or poly or open or something.  I never thought it was an option.  I have only recently discovered these concepts existed in the real world within the last week.  I’ve been reading about it on Reddit and OkCupid profiles and stuff like that.

I have been able to completely get over her cheating on me.  I managed to do that by feeling relief from personally being able to blame myself partially for her life leading to this outcome.  I recognize how terribly possessive and controlling I used to be.  I will never ask her to do anything like that again.  I’ve told her all this.  She just says it is her fault for not speaking up and letting it happen.  I prefer blaming myself for ever asking in the first place, and she knows this.  She is such a nice person that she feels I should not blame myself, because I don’t deserve what she did.  I think we are both partially right.  My conclusion is that we both did wrong with not communicating.  She did wrong to be with someone else, sure… But I feel it wouldn’t have ever been possible without me being such a terrible SO to her.

Part of the way I got over what she did includes learning about non-monogamy.  I am not saying that being NM or Poly is at all equal to cheating.  Honesty is the cornerstone of poly and I get that.  However, if I tell myself she was just exploring urges to be NM/poly (since it isn’t a secret to me now) that I am now ok with what went down.  I no longer picture her in bed with him combined with notions of suicide and physical mild heart attacks.  Now, if that image is in my head… I’m excited for her to explore things that she enjoys in the world.  If we don’t end up together… I would probably end up in a relationship with someone who is already open to the ideas this forum is for.

She has not been speaking to him for 2 months.  She knew it was wrong to be behind my back and ended it for me.  However, she says she still has feelings for him even though she never stopped loving me.  Before I read about NM/poly I couldn’t understand that.  Now I do.  I feel like it truly was normal that I noticed other girls.  She has a problem with me not only having eyes for her.  From how she feels now, I imagine she is entirely monogamous at this point.  I’ve been telling her about these alternative love lifestyles that exist.  I told her they helped me get over it.  However, I’m afraid I immediately give her the impression that I’m ok with it because maybe I always did want to be with other girls too.

The truth is; I’m still hurt a little bit if I see her use her phone.  Remember, I found out she cheated using her phone.  Her co-worker lives out of state.  However, she has been to his state and I know they have had sex many times.  She’s sent him pictures that originally made me want to die.  I’m still learning to be ok with it.  I want to never feel jealousy again.  I’m getting closer every day to being like that… Thanks to internet discussions such as these.

So you are probably wondering why I’m saying all this.  Well… I just want to know how the rest of you got started.  Were you born knowing you would never be monogamous?  Did you start with monogamy and have it end badly and then come to this?  I am curious if some people are only NM/poly out of the fear of being cheated on.  You can’t be cheated on if you consented to multiple partners and you think you’ve met all of your SO’s partners, right?
I’m not saying that I’m even sure I’m NM/poly/open.  I think there is a chance that I might be.  However, I still do love the girl I’ve described above.  We are still together as monogamous people.  

She later found out that the guy she was cheating on me with had lied to her.  He told her he was divorced for 2 years.  He is still married.  The wife found out about her and called her.  He didn’t have the balls to fess up.  My girlfriend isn’t the first girl he’s been with behind his wife’s back.  She knew of 7 others.  So my girlfriend is dealing with the pain of breaking her cardinal rule (don’t cheat and lie) as well as being duped by the exact type of guy she always feared I would be to her.  I feel so fucking bad for her that I don’t have any pain of my own over what happened.  She has yet to feel stable enough to have the conversation with him to tell him how angry she is.  I got jealous when I saw her on her phone skyping him last night.  She even pointed the phone cam at me and I couldn’t even speak looking face to face with the guy.  I didn’t know what to say.

I know that I can heal emotionally and move on to any future.  I’d be happy to continue having a monogamous relationship with her.  I enjoy our time together no matter what.  If she decides that she needs to stop dating me as well as cut him off then I understand.  She isn’t sure she can stay with me because I remind her of how bad of a person she was for cheating.  She isn’t sure if maybe she needs to walk away from the whole thing and not even have a relationship to heal.

Thanks to reading about NM/poly for the last 5 days, I’ve been able to heal and come to terms with the fact that I might still lose her now.  I told her I’m even ok at this point if she still wanted to date both of us.  Remember how nice I told you she is?  She recognizes that the other guy has emotional problems.  He was recently held in the psyche ward at a hospital for cutting himself straight up both arms.  She doesn’t want to yell at him yet because she wants him to come out ok too.  He lied to her, cheated on her, made her feel like a whore and she wants to help him.  I could never claim to be so considerate.  I admire her for that strength.

So… How have you all started realizing that you were NM/poly/swingers/open/etc?  Are you with a partner now that you were once monogamous with?  Did you both become NM together?  I want to hear both the good and the bad stories.

Mainly, I’d like to hear any relation to the situation I am currently in.  Can anyone relate to having been cheated on by someone who felt hurt by you?  Where they did not cheat out of sexual desire, but out of the feeling of thinking they were not loved by you and that someone else convinced them that they love your SO more truthfully than you do?

Does it sound like I may actually be poly?  Feel free to ask questions about anything.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I had to talk about it with someone and I feel like this is the best place.

1372711651.0,1,self.nonmonogamy,1hg873,31m - Girlfriend and I are beginners to nonmonogamy... need some advice.,3,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1hg873/31m_girlfriend_and_i_are_beginners_to_nonmonogamy/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years.  We have a very adventurous and healthy sex life.  Both of us have a very high sex drive.  We have very good communication skills, and can easily talk with each other about any topic, regardless of the baggage attached to it. She has always been honest with me about her desire to be with another woman as well.

So that is the general background.  The specifics:

2 yrs ago - 
We discuss opening our relationship.  She approaches me because she is feeling the desire to be with a woman strongly (until this point she had only lightly experimented with girls when she was younger).  She lays the situation out as something for her to explore that side of her and me be the supportive by-stander having no involvement.  My feelings were hurt, and I communicated that unless we both saw the benefits of the openess, that things between us would probably be strained.  We slowly start the search, and she is more involved than me with the interactions.  This slowly builds a lot of jealousy in me, and I eventually attempt to contact someone without her knowledge.  She finds out, things spiral, we stop looking.

I spent the next 8 months to a year building her trust again.  About a year ago, we start looking again.  We discuss both of us being as integral as the other in the search and process this time.  The new strategy worked for a while and we eventually found another prospective woman.  Once the possibility was real again, she again began to communicate her discomfort with sharing me.  She expressed that she would like to spend some time getting comfortable with this person away from me once or twice because being with a woman was new to her.  This felt like a direct attack on me.  All I heard was 'I'm going to fuck this person.  Then I'll see how comfortable I feel with sharing you with her.'  Again, I tried contacting someone outside of her knowledge. She found out, replay spiraling and fighting, etc.

About 3 months ago we were back to the point where both of us were comfortable resuming the search.  Coincidentally, not long after starting the search again, a girl i knew from high school contacted me.  It was harmless at first, but she quickly let on that she wanted to fuck me.  I resisted, and told this girl that my girlfriend and I were looking for a threesome and that I could talk to my girlfriend about that possibly being her.  (I know... really fucking stupid.)  My girlfriend reluctantly agreed, and we began dating this girl.  With my girlfriend having almost all of the interaction with her, conversations and dates.  It wasn't long before I felt left out again, and contacted this girl without my girlfriend's knowledge (which was against the boundaries).  Soon I was fucking this girl behind my girlfriend's back, and the girl and I were lying our asses off to my girlfriend to cover our tracks.  4/20 all three went out with the intention of 'sealing the deal' so to speak.  Problem is that my girlfriend got way too drunk, and ended up sending me to take the other girl home while she was hugging the toilet.  Her final words to me on the way out were 'Please don't fuck her.'  I didn't want to do it.  But I fucked the other girl on the way.  Next day, girlfriend catches on.  My world is ready to fucking cave in again.

The following 5-6 weeks are hard for me to own up to... but I'm going to anyways.

After crushing my amazing girlfriend multiple times I finally start doing a lot of soul searching, and come to the conclusion that I am a sex addict.  In the sense that any time I have negative feelings, I have developed a coping strategy of seeking anonymous sex or anonymous sexual interactions with people online.  I have been going to meetings for two months now, and seeing a personal therapist regularly.  I have made a ton of progress.  And my relationship with my girlfriend, and everyone else, including myself is so much better.

Two weeks ago, we are at a concert, and on the way home my girlfriend brings up the possibility of her pursuing a girlfriend on her own, since I dangled it in front of her with this other girl, and then promptly fucked it all up.  I am reluctant, but agree that she deserves the opportunity, I just ask that we give it a little more time until I am on more stable ground in my recovery.

Last week, she brings the conversation up again.  It catches me off guard since I had only a week before asked for more time.  It devolves into a small argument, but nothing serious.  The problem came in the fact that I was suspicious.  That suspicion, and my familiarity with being deceitful started calling a lot of attention to some of her actions.

To sum it up quickly, she had set up an OKC profile before bringing it up to me two weeks earlier, and assumed I would be against it.  She had been in contact with two people, one I knew of that she had said she met from Girlfriend Social and was 'harmless.'  The other I didn't know of... who wasn't harmless.  It is a woman that she is interested in. And they had been flirting back and forth for a while.  Anyways, I stumbled onto the evidence of her deceit and lies... essentially turning the tables from the usual way things turned out.

We have spent the last 5 or 6 days discussing this at length.  And I am wanting to be supportive of her and this opportunity.  At the end of the day I know that we both love each other unconditionally.  Neither one of us ever wants to lose the other person.  So we have started talking about boundaries that will keep our relationship healthy and positive above all else.

Problem is I'm hurt. I'm jealous. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  I don't know if it is possible for someone with a sex addiction to maintain the type of lifestyle we are interested in.  My therapist and I have talked at length about the differences between healthy and unhealthy sex behaviors for an addict.  I am starting to come to terms with the difference between not using sex to cope with negative feelings, and embracing my sexuality.  I know I can do this, but it is going to be hard work.

So I wanted to share an update on my situation. My SO and her friend have had their first playdate (the previous one had been canceled due to scheduling issues). I have not yet met him in person, but we've chatted a few times and I was confident in my SO's assessment of him so I gave them the go-ahead to play while I was away for the weekend, up to oral. They called me after an hour of fooling around to ask permission for PiV. I realized that at this point I had no crippling jealousy, envy, or possessive feelings - and more to the point, they were perfectly willing to stop things there if I said no, which was reassuring to me enough that I did give them permission. ""Use condoms and have fun, kids"" :)

I got back home and she was absolutely over the hill that she had finally gotten to have a new partner, told me all about the experience. I asked her to tell me about things he did that wound her up so I could incorporate it into our play. We had great sex that night, and again the next night - that's 3 out of the last 5 days for us which is amazing for our normal frequency of encounters! I'm thrilled, she's thrilled, everyone's happy. She's going to plan future encounters with him, and I'm totally in support of this.

In my side, my SO is still supportive of me pursuing a polyamorous relationship with Anna, but circumstances there are complicated so nothing is going forward right now. We've been staying in touch over the hectic summer, getting to know each other and maybe when the summer is over things might be different.

Sorry for the long post. 

We have been dating for almost one year, and living together for the summer in Brooklyn (his place) before I return to graduate school (about an hour away from him) in September. Our relationship started off with the understanding that it was to be ""open,"" which was his relationship style and not mine. I am not at all interested in having anyone outside of my primary, but felt this aspectof the relationship might help me grow as a person. I read a lot, thought a lot, and struggled a lot before deciding I wanted to go for it. I was still slightly unsure but went against my hesitation. We have been together since last September, without any other partners or FWB for either of us. Our relationship has been, by default, exclusive for the last 11 months or so. Not once was actively opening up our relationship discussed or even hinted at, but we have continuously talked about our comfort levels and feelings about the relationship.

He finally brought up the fact that he needed to sleep with other people in early June. I took it really hard and it was really difficult to work through, partially due to the fact that I went into something knowing that I wasn't fully comfortable with its structure. We have been painfully talking through our issues for the last few weeks while almost breaking up several times. Ultimately, he wants FWB and not other partners - the ability to flirt and hang out with people, possibly leading to sex, a few times a month, with different people. After working out restrictions, I finally agreed this week to give it a try, and he is hanging out with someone from okcupid for the first time this Friday while I am at work. I feel extremely conflicted - I am happy for him that he is getting what he needs, yet still overwhelmed with jealousy and frustration. I want this Friday to pass but I also want it to never happen.

I really love him and understand his need for others but can't seem to be comfortable in this situation. I don't know whether to break it off with him or carry on through the jealousy. I got myself into a difficult situation and now I need help.

Thanks for reading.

tl;dr - Got into an open relationship without actually wanting to be in one. Almost a year later he wants to sleep with other people and I am super conflicted.

He's wanted it to be open, I'm assuming the whole time.

At a certain point he suggested a 3 way after hearing it'd been a fantasy of mine; I wigged out a little: I wasn't ready, I wasn't prepared to feel how jealous and scared I was- I thought it would have been easier. In my previous relationship, the suggestion had been eagerly pioneered and supported by me.  But now, with him, it was scary.  I felt suddenly inadequate, not interesting enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, my booty was too small.  He suggested I read Ethical Slut, given that i'd been in a sort of faux-open relationship before.  I was a little insulted at first, but once I got over the pride and got into the book, and then into the blogs, and stalking r/nonmonogamy and then more books and re-watching movies I'd never really watched in this new light, and then commenting, I felt like there was a lot of possibilities for emotional and personality growth that was intriguing and tantalizing.  

Last night, drunk and intoxicated on my post-wisdom-tooth-removal meds, I awkwardly tried to bring it back up.  

The emotions went like this: I had spent the day hanging out with him and his roommate, a beautiful, smart, amazing woman who easily fit under my green gaze after he had made a compliment about her to me a few months past.  I was deep in the jealousy soup for a while.  But then we hung out, we talked, we got cheese together and things were O.K., I started to connect to her and she wasn't terrifying anymore.  I was so happy that I wasn't feeling jealous of her anymore, so happy that i could feel compassion for her and for him and his feelings again.  Swept up in that and the haze, I wanted nothing more than to accept more change into my life.  Even if it was scary and felt horrible for so long, it could get better and I could get more comfortable with other people and myself.  I wanted more of that.

My SO gracefully declined to have serious conversations with me while I was intoxicated.  Most of what I can remember before I passed out included groping him and insisting ""no, but i really want to talk to you about this later, ok?""

We have the night apart tonight (he, and I feel like he stole the idea from my own head suggesting it, has requested a night a week to himself to be alone).  So I can't do much more than to write here about my trepidations on this extra scary adventure I'm thinking of taking.  I'm a very nervous, and often insecure and sometimes antisocial person. but I don't like that about myself, and I know the only way to be not nervous, to be secure, to be better at socializing is to practice it, to work towards it, to work through the nervous, insecure, awkward moments.  

TL:DR - I'm on the edge of opening up my relationship and I'm scared, insecure, jealous, but really I know the only way out is through and I don't like the idea of hiding from or avoiding confronting those emotions and I do like the idea of possible growth.

I've been involved with an older guy for awhile. He's in an open marriage, and is good freinds with someone who is an ex fuckbuddy. I have majornsecurity issues because group sex with them went really wrong. It ended up giving me a massive anxiety attack and I never really got over the emotional issues I manage to keep things together most of the time, or so I'd like to think..  But, this is pretty hard for me to deal with. 

I was on a gay dating website after a few years of not using it. I just wanted to find some friends around here, because to be quite blunt I literally have no friends and it's been a difficult year. My anxiety issues really got the best of me. Anyways, I see my friend's husband, naked, in a leather harness with his ex fuckbuddy. The thing is it wasn't a self pic, so it meant my SO was the one who took the pictures.

Now for about 3-4 years my friend has been tellin me that he hasn't been having sex with these guys, and I think I believe him, but taking nude pictures of your friends doesn't seem completely innocent to me. I don't know if I'm overreacting. I defintively did not know this was going on and I was definitively under hte imperssion from talking openly about this *a lot* that he didn't have sex with them at all. And yet he was taking naked pictures of them together.

It takes all my energy to not go totally paranoid and think they had sex.  




I know I'm just the third wheel so to speak (I do not know the proper terms so please forgive me.) so I apparently shouldn't be bothered by this? But I don't know what to feel anymore. My SO says he's not a jealous person. He's OK with his husband going to have group sex, and having sex wiht other people. But curiously enough I tried adding my SO to facebook and he saw one of my posts complementing another guy and he actually asked me who it was even though it had absolutely nothing to do with him. It was a guy a thousand miles away in america or something. And yet I see him take pictures of two people he lives with, and he tells me it's absolutely no big deal whatsoever. He told me that they're adults so they should be able to do whatever they want. He doesn't understand that it broke my trust and that it really makes me paranoid, insecure, worthless, replacable and we've talked a lot about this, but our conversations aren't going anywhere 


I don't know anyone in my town, let alone anyone who would understand this sort of thing. I appreciate anyone who even reads this post because it's nice to know somebody is listening who may understand. 



**tl;dr:**
I've been involved with a guy for a few years now. He told me he isn't having sex with his current partner and friend (who is there every weekend and during the week a lot so they're good friends.) I have major insecure issues because I found out the hard way that group sex wasn't for me, but decided to keep seeing him. Then I find out on total accident that he has been taking nude pictures his husband being intimate with their friendand posting them to gay cruising sites to get men interested. I feel betrayed and hurt, and although I've communicated all these feelings, he just says that taking pictures like that is no big deal. I don't know what to feal or think. I know that I'm a third wheel, but it really broke my trust and he doesn't care. I just acme here for support. Not sure what I should do at all at this point.

Problem is, we don't want to go to your typical MFT therapist, who might have negative ideas about married non-monogamy. Our experience so far is that they all claim they are non-judgmental and impartial, but they end up being either TOO impartial, ie, overly neutral and passive in their approach; or, if they do engage with actual opinions, suggestions or insights, they reveal a disconnect in understanding or accepting non-monogamy as a healthy relationship option.

While I knew about her sexuality going into things, we started it off as a fling with daily or nearly daily sex. As time went on and we got more serious about the long-term, the novelty and exploration for her wore off, and sex slowed to a trickle.  It became a source of discomfort in a relationship where our non-sexual circumstances have also gotten stressful.

We can adequately deal with jealousy, desire, and the disparity in how we show affection.  However, my sex drive is abnormally high to begin with, and combining that with hers being nonexistent, I've been slowly boiling over.

Recently, we've been talking more and more and agreed to open up sexually, at her insistence.  I've officially changed my long-disused OkCupid and started making use of it.  Frankly, I've never been good at online dating, and am unsure how to proceed there; the majority of the people I've talked to there are polyamorous, rather than open.  It's not what I'm looking for, sadly, and I don't want to lead anyone on.

Everything I've heard about Craigslist sounds like tapdancing in a mine field, and since I am for most purposes treated like a single guy, my understanding is that the swinger scene is not really open to me.  I work from home, so that's out.  

I'm left wondering: how do I proceed with finding potential partners?

I've been with my boyfriend monogamously (but discussing open/poly the whole time, initiated by him) for a year and a half. I'm finally starting to come around to the idea of him hooking up with other people. This is mostly because I have a higher sex drive than he does (it's about once a week, so not bed death status) and I recently started seeing a friend that I had known for years, primarily in order to satisfy the need for more sex, but also because I like him. We are 'dating' and not just 'fucking' - I feel that I require emotional stability/connection to have good sex. 

My partner now wants to be able to 'hook up' with people (he says he is not looking for another relationship because of limited time, etc) in order to keep things fair, and because he needs variety in his sex life via multiple sexual partners. 

He has an ex-girlfriend who he describes as the 'only woman who broke his heart'. It has been several years since the break up. He is extremely open with me regarding all of his past relationships, but one that is off-limits is this one. He will not tell me why she broke up with him. Recently, he has presented the desire to casually hook up with this particular ex. 

I feel uncomfortable with exes in general, while he thinks it's the 'safest' option because he has already dated them and therefore, to him, it is less threatening than starting something new. In this situation, his aversion to telling me why they broke up also fuels my doubts about his being truly 'over her'. 

I'd like input on how other non-mono couples deal with exes in general, and also what you guys think about this situation. I'm trying to keep it short but will answer questions.

We started as a MFF with my then long time GF. It was my current SO's first time in an arrangement like that, and while she was very into it then, I think in retrospect some of it made her uneasy as her and my emotion feeling for each other grew.  Eventually we make the jump to monogamy, my long time gf and I breaking up in the process.

At first this was a breath of fresh air, as my then recent ex and my open relationship could be overly complicated and hurtfull at time. Also for the first time in 10 years I didn't want to share or be shared. I actually would be jealous over men looking at her. This is opposite to my personality in every way. And that is the way it was for a while, but it didn't last. 

About 7-8 months ago we started talking about opening our relationships up some and realized I had developed trust issues and that was the source of my new,unwanted and unfounded jealousy. Relizing this put on the path I am now.

We talked a lot and about who we are and what we are about, how we care for the other, and all the trust problem washed away as if they never existed. I told her how nothing gets me going like the thought of her with another man or woman. She listened to me and was open to the idea even if it wasn't her thing off rip.

Time passed and we would talk about it now and then but no one really struck either of our interests. Fast-forward to two weeks ago when me, my SO, and our married best friends(27m,23f) eat a bunch of MDMA. Thing got savage pretty quick ending basically in oral every way you can put it together. Next day everything is cool,everyone had fun plans are made for next weekend.

Now at this point I'm back to being my old self snapped back from 2 years of dreaming I was in a monogamous relationship. 

A couple days before the weekend my SO says we need to talk...... SHIT!!! She says she had fun fooling around with our friends, but that she doesn't want to keep doing it. I ask her to elaborate, she says she has no sexual desire for anyone but me, and can't stand to see me with anouther. I tell her fine and we all still grab dinner and a movie, no one upset.

At this point for me I can't go back to the it was. It is too important to who I am and it hurts me too much emotionally to repress that. I love my SO to the point of tears, but I am not sure we can meet in the middle.

Sorry for the wall of text reddit I am just at a loss for what to do. She essentially is monogamous and straight, and I am open if not poly, and bi. Is there any hope?

Why/why not?",2,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1fa0x9/are_you_out_about_your_nonstandard_relationships/,"I'm working on a book about relationships that don't conform to the social [relationship escalator] (http://solopoly.net/2012/11/29/riding-the-relationship-escalator-or-not/) norm (two people only, sexually exclusive, with the goal of being cohabitating lifelong partners, kids etc.). 

As I'm processing the nearly 700 [surveys] (http://solopoly.net/survey/) people have filled out about their relationships so far for this project, I'm seeing that a big issue for all kinds of off-the-escalator relationships is *social stigma*.

It's one of the core reasons why so many people in non-standard relationships choose (or feel they have no choice) but to stay in the closet -- either entirely, or to some people or in some contexts.

I want to delve into issues of outness and stigma in more detail, so I'm going to launch a second survey asking people more about their choices, issues, and experiences on this front.

But before I do that, I'd like some help figuring out exactly what to ask.

If you are in an open or otherwise off-the-escalator relationship:

1. What's non-standard about your relationship (or relationship preferences)?

2. How ""out"" are you about your nonstandard relationships -- in what ways, contexts, social circles, etc. (Or: how are you closeted?)

3. What are the main reasons why you've made these choices about outness/closeting? Such as: I don't want anyone to think I'm weird or start treating me differently. OR: I'm generally a very private person. OR: My partner(s) aren't/don't want to be out. OR: Being out makes it easier for everyone else in nonstandard relationships. Etc...

4. How do your choices about outing/closeting affect your relationships, your partner(s), and how you feel about yourself?

5. What kinds of experiences have you had with either stigma or acceptance related to your choices about outness?

6. What questions do you have about people's choices to be out (or not) about their nonstandard relationships?

Getting an initial read on these questions will help me spot patterns and figure out what to ask, and how. Many thanks for your help!

My wife had never really been in a monogamous relationship before we met. We're great together, there's a ridiculous amount of love between us and she's the most understanding person I've ever met. She wants to sleep with other people without me, but no matter how hard I try to be ok with that, I can't be. 

We've talked about it at length on several occasions, she's tried her best to explain that love and sex are separate things in her mind. I understand that you can have sex without love (I had never really cared to be in a long-term relationship with anyone before her, had lots of fun, but tried to not let anything get too serious). However, I feel that there's always an emotional attachment, especially with her because she cares deeply about her friends and some of the people she'd be sleeping with are ex-lovers and good friends. One she'd def. be married to if she wasn't with me. So I have a really difficult time with that. I'm not wired that way, I guess. I'm a really understanding guy and I would do anything to make her happy (especially since we're both queer, I understand the desire for a type of affection I can't give her), so it bothers me that I can't grasp this, but she's let me know in no uncertain terms that she is ok with that.

So, our compromise is that we can sleep with other people together, acquiesce into to it, take it slow. Maybe years down the road I'll understand better and won't get knots in my stomach and crushing anxiety at the thought of her by herself with someone else pleasuring her the way I do. 

I've let her know that I want to sleep with some older people (we're in our early 30's, looking for people in their 40's, maybe early fifties). We want group sex involving either lots of guys or a good mix of all the sexes as well as 3-some etc. We're not sure how to go about any of this though. It was different for her when she was alone, it's easy for a queer female to find partners in both sexes and she knew a lot of people that enjoyed group sex. 

Now, we're a married couple looking for play friends, which can come off as creepy in the wrong circumstances. She's not into going to a sex club at all and it worries me anyway. We've thought about picking up older ladies at a cougar bar, but that doesn't really appeal to her and I suspect I'm a bit naive about it. Finding people online seems risky. 

My questions are these:

1) How do we as a couple find people to sleep with given the above issues?

2) I feel pretty awful about my jealousy and uneasiness with this, I know it's a product of insecurity on my part, but I can't seem to change that. Am I an awful/repressive person, despite my wife claiming the exact opposite?

3) Got any other good advice on how to deal with my brain and how you all did it?

4) Am I basically screwed for life because I'm perhaps just not wired for this?

I love my wife with all my heart, it took a long time for us to find each other and I don't know how I'd live with myself if I screwed this up. I'm really worried about losing her, or irrevocably screwing something up in our relationship, losing some love, or drifting apart. A part of me realizes that this is irrational, but I can't convince myself of it.

So my husband and I have been married for two years and non monogamous for the entire time (with varying success) and I can't seem to get over my jealousy issues.    
    
First of all, I have always felt jealous of other girls, but think that it'a a stupid and useless feeling and only makes our having fun and just general relationship more difficult. We both enjoy having group sex (which is what we do exclusively so far) but he either enjoys it much more or I am just really timid or just find it much more difficult to be intimate with new people quickly (which is likely the case). The end result however is that he is way more excited for group activities and much more aggressive about it than I am. This isn't to say that he's doing something that I don't want, I actually like his aggression about it - it's just that I end up with an annoying nagging feeling that I'm not enough or that he doesn't want me anymore. I know neither of these is true, but I can't shake the feeling. Am I insane? He says that he can't imagine feeling one thing and thinking another~ And it isn't about trust; I don't even kind of think he would cheat on me. I think my worst fear would be that after years of trying to make it work he might sometime realize he isn't satisfied and talk to me about it and that I would realize that I couldn't do any better than I already was...but even that is a useless thought, because it hasn't happened, I have no signs of that happening and it will likely never happen. So why waste my time worrying about it?   
    
My other frustration, and this is kind of spiteful on my part - is that he doesn't experience the same amount of jealousy because the things that would make him jealous (other guys), I never pursue. We only have group sex with girls exclusively up to this point as he is straight and I am bi so that works out nicely for us. This should also not be a thing I feel or worry about - I mean, it isn't his fault that I don't try to pursue more guys.     
    
I feel kind of like an ass, because I encourage him to be aggressive and want to do more group activities, and also somewhat avoid men because I know it bothers him (I mean somewhat - it is also really stressful for me and I think I'd feel guilty for doing it even though he's never given me a reason to feel guilty...just some lingering social guilt I guess?), but then I feel jealous and frustrated when he does pursue girls and doesn't have to deal with the same jealousy I feel.     
    
The fact of the matter is that I want to do more group things, I want to be able to tell him to go flirt with some sexy girl across the bar and not feel any jealousy - but I have yet to get over it.

I posted in the past about coming to an agreement with my wife that we can see other people fox sexual purposes. I haven't been actively pursuing it, but waiting for it to happen organically and now have my first opportunity.
So last night I met someone at a business networking function and we really clicked to the point where you would normally take it to the next level and set up a date. We have tentative plans, but I never got a chance to explain my situation to her at the loud bar we were at.
Now my intentions are to meet up and have a good time, hopefully leading to sex and I'm open to friends with benefits/multiple encounters. However, I feel like I totally need to divulge as soon as possible and at the right moment. I just don't feel right dating and hooking up with someone who thinks I'm single. Especially because she so cool in general and I'm a nice guy. 
Does anyone have experience or advice on how and when to bring this up? I'd rather meet her in person and bring it up rather than on the phone/text! Just not sure how to present it in the best way. And if she isn't into it, there should be no hard feelings about hanging out and having another drink as friends.

UPDATE: She also just texted me and I can't meet tonight, but I told her we should get together soon. I feel like it's not a good idea to let her in on my situation via text, but at the same time I'd feel like a dick if she's expecting a something from me that's not going to happen. Still think I should wait until we meet but I'm not sure. Any womanly advice would be great!

My husband and I have been together for 10 years. Him and I are the definition of opposites attract. I cheated on him w good friend of mine who was very similar to me at the very beginning of our marriage. It started as an emotional affair. We also started swinging in the very beginning of our marriage. Never full swap. Strangely I was never completely comfortable w/ the swinging although once in the situation I always have a great time. I honestly can't remember now if the cheating or the swinging came first but I know that the swinging always made me feel like I was not quite enough for my husband sexually, even though him and I have always had an amazing sexual connection. Eventually the affair ended after two years when he found out. He got over it pretty quickly and said it never really bothered him. We continued to swing every now again  and I was completely happy. We had two children and as with any couple it was a very rough time for us. The children demanded all my time and energy and I neglected him. I didn't want sex as much and what was once a very strong physical bond was severely affected. I always told him I owed him one but I ever thought in a million years he would cheat on me. But he did. Not only did he cheat but at one point he even conned me into having a threesome w them in the middle of their affair. I though she was a girl he had met that he had a ""crush"" on from work so we invited her over but little dd I know this was a plan they had already hashed out together. But there was a horrible undercurrent in my gut afterward and I told him it would never happen again. Little did I know that the two one of them already had an ongoing relationship. Two months ago he  ended a 15 month affair and he was very close to leaving me. At first he said the only way he would stay is if I allowed an open marriage for him to be with her as well as me. I said no and we are still together. But here is my biggest problem. He now says he believes in polyamory and I do not. He says he has had this belief for longer than he has been w her. And I am dieing inside. I think humans are primed to be attracted to others and that it is even possible to love more than one person but I also think love is a choice and you can choose to love one person. I'm not writing this because my husband is leaving me. We are working on it and most days are very good because there has always been so much love between us. I'm writing this just to get others opinions bc I don't know if I can come to terms w all of this or if this will end our relationship in the long term. He called the woman and himself two peas in a pod because they were so similar and I feel like he was closer to her, respected her more, and possibly even loved her more than me and its all been very hard for me to get past.

I am HL, she's LL. We had, at one time, an awesome marriage. Since we've had kids, though, her libido has gone downhill, and with it not only anything resembling sex, but anything resembling affection.

She has, once or twice, thrown out the notion of just letting me get it elsewhere. I don't know if she meant it, if she was just frustrated, if she had thought it through, or if it was off-the-cuff.

At the time, I flat dismissed the idea. I love my wife to death and could never envision myself with anyone else. But at the same time, it is a real need of mine, and it does not look like things with my wife will ever get better.

So here I am, wondering if this sort of thing would benefit us. If maybe I could find someone else to get the affection from, if my marriage would be better for it. Outside of this issue, we had been getting along great. But now this issue has totally consumed our marriage and is eating it away.

MY PROBLEM:

I would think that for this kind of thing to work, it would have to be open to both partners. Is this right? Anyone have any experience in only a half-open marriage? The problem is that I am totally NOT interested in sharing my wife with anyone else. I don't know that she would be into it anyway (she claims to have no sex drive whatsoever), but I couldn't bear the thought of her having a relationship like that outside of me. I'm honestly not really sure that I would enjoy it myself, so if the thing has to be open on both sides to work, then I won't even bring it up.

TL;DR I am wondering if having a 1/2 open relationship is something that could work.

We've been together 11 years, married for 7 and have a 2 year old son together. In the eyes of most sane people, I really like this girl and I'm not remotely going to leave her. We started swinging before my son was born. We went to a couple of clubs and had basically 7-8 swing experiences before we decided to have a kid. Since then we've not had any, mostly due to being so busy raising our kid but also because she was self conscious about her body after birth. One more thing to add to the pile, she has been diagnosed with High Anxiety and takes medication for it.

In the last 6 months or so I've been feeling extra lonely. I work about 40 miles from where I live and my jobs don't often last for more than 9 months at a stretch so finding friends at work doesn't pan out. I've gotten into social activities but my wife isn't interested in joining me for either of my favorites. 

I was introduced to the idea of Polyamory via a friend and everything about it felt right. Sex with other people was obviously something interesting to me and I certainly could use the extra intimacy. Before talking to my wife about it I picked up The Ethical Slut. When the book came in I told her what it was and that I wanted to read it through before talking to her about it. I wanted to make sure I knew what I wanted before I asked my wife for anything. I finished it and told my wife my ""perfect world"" scenario would be to have one or two women that I might see once a month for a date+ night. I thought that would be fair to our schedules and reassure her that I wasn't just trying to find my next wife.

We talked about it and after multiple discussions, she is 100% against anything poly but is still fine with us swinging. Also, one of the things she would like to do with swinging is get to know the couples better and retain some as friends. This is what really got me confused and frustrated. What really is the difference between dating a couple and dating a person? We're both very logic driven people. She is in a Math related field and I'm in software testing. 

She loves me = true
I love her = True
We enjoy Sex = true
I say sex =/= Love
She says Sex = Love
I say ""But Swinging is sex without love""
I say ""you want to date couples aka love them""

You can start to see where I start to have sparks come out my ears and repeat ""This does not compute""

We've had one major on-going problem in the course of our relationship, and I just need some outside feedback about it. We have very open lines of communication and discuss everything, I am very, very straight forward with him. I have to be straight forward. I have always had problems with anxiety and (when I was younger) having an explosive temper. As I've gotten older, and largely before I got into this relationship, I learned how to manage my anxiety and anger by talking about what is bothering me at the moment when it is bothering me, as long as I can do so in a constructive and level-headed way. I feel like he's pretty open with me as well, but overall just a little less in touch with what he's feeling. Can't blame a guy for not being able to express how he doesn't know he feels, right? Right. So, our on-going problem is despite being direct with him, he doesn't act on/deal with the information I give him about how I'm feeling, what I need, what have you. I can tell him what I need/want until I'm blue in the face, and unless I, myself, fully put said action into motion, it will. not. happen. 

For example, at the end of 2011 we found out I had high blood pressure and had to go off birth control. He said he would get a vasectomy. I told him (because he is terrible at making/following through with appointments) that he really needed to take the lead on this, because I can't be the one to lead the way on his potential to have other kids or not. I didn't want to feel like I was forcing him into making a decision about his reproductive health. But he said, time and time again, ""I want the vasectomy, I am going to get the vasectomy."" Months went by, no appointment. We talked about it, and when I mentioned that he hadn't made any move on the vasectomy and that I wanted to get my tubes tied he didn't want to hear anything about me getting my tubes tied, he called and made an appointment right away, was very apologetic. He blew off that appointment. We talked about it again, I offered to get tubal again, he scrambled around making phone calls for another appointment, makes one and then blows that one off. This has been going on literally all of 2012. This has caused a lot of problems that I'll get to in a second. 

Another example that has been more recently problematic is of a sexual nature (and why I'm posting in /r/poly ) is that we started talking about non-monogamy (specifically swinging) about a year and a half ago. He was super enthusiastic about it at first. We started to meet couples online, we met one in person, spent a lot of time talking about it and chatting with other couples online, and as I do more reading on the subject, I get exposed to more new ideas. I was 27 (at the time) and really starting to feel connected to my sexuality for the first time. Truthfully, I've always loved feeling/being slutty. I guess I've just always had ethical conflicts with it. Being introduced to polyamory and non-monogamy opened my mind and my eyes to a whole new world of relationship potential. 

I delved deeper into atypical sex. I discovered my submissive side. I discovered, and acknowledged to myself and my SO my rape fantasy. I told him all about it, excitedly, feeling like I was making sense of myself for the first time. I told him I needed and wanted these things sexually. He was unsure how to make me feel submissive sexually, so I shared some links with him about things I found particularly sexy. He didn't read them. I asked if he would spend a little time looking into it himself and see what he likes/would like to do to me so I didn't feel like I had to coach him through us venturing into bdsm style sex. I would ask him to spank me while he was fucking me from behind, but it always felt more like masturbation. Like telling someone exactly, word for word, what you want done. During all this, I started to feel more sexual than ever. I wanted sex all the time. I'm not going to mince words, I've always felt validated after sex, and I realize that is my problem and not his, but as he knew my sex drive and interests were growing to be more than ever, we had less sex than ever. He said he just felt really satisfied and I had been giving him exactly the sex he has wanted for years and years, and was just rarely horny anymore. We were only having sex about once every 5 days, and I almost always initiated it. I told him over and over again how much it would mean to me to have him initiate sex with me once in a while, and still, practically nothing.  I felt so undesired and unsexy, the opposite of what I wanted and what I wanted with him. He apologized, said he'd try harder, do research on poly and bdsm, still, nothing. This has been going on for the last six months or so in cycles. 

Finally, a few months ago he was getting really into role-playing my rape fantasy with me, but still hadn't read anything about bdsm and didn't really know what he was doing. We had sex where we role-played he 'raped' me and he really felt like he was giving me what I wanted-- by not using a condom when I'm not on birth control. I did not give permission for this. I wouldn't have. I understood he thought it was really hot, and of course it felt good, but afterwards I was really worried, and we ran out and got Plan B so I wouldn't get pregnant. He also pulled my hair so hard during this session that my scalp was rather swollen. If he was going to be that aggressive, it would have been much better in the form of spankings. Anyway, of course Plan B failed, and I got pregnant. We already have two kids, and I in no way (mentally, emotionally, financially) can afford another. He's in full agreement, we move forward and get an abortion. I make it clear that I'm not happy about what has happened, but that I just want to move on. I explain that I feel like this whole pregnancy has come about because he doesn't listen to me or take me-- or my health-- seriously. The vasectomy, the sex, it just could have all been different if he had moved forward on one of these things that meant a lot to me. I explain, as I've explained to him many times before about countless other things, that although it doesn't feel the best to have to lay everything out for him that I want, step-by-step, it hurts more when I lay it out for him and he doesn't act. 

Post-abortion, my grades are suffering. We both take classes online, full-time. His classes aren't going well either. We talk about it a few weeks ago, and I break down crying. I tell him how hard I'm struggling with some issues in my family (my mom and siblings) and how I'm feeling affected by the abortion, even though I feel I made the right choice. I tell him I need to drop two of my classes because I'm going to fail them. He says he may need to drop some but he's unsure at this point. I beg him to drop my classes for me because I can't ... because I just literally can't do it. I feel sooo bad about failing the classes, and dropping them, and it really isn't what I want but I can't deal with the failure. He hugs me and assures me he understands and he'll take care of it. (You have to call in, and he is able to drop my classes for me. It's a small school.) This last Friday, I ask him for the third time if he's dropped the classes. He says no but that he'll take care of it right away. I log into my classes to find that it is now too late for one of my classes to be dropped, I am stuck with an F in one of them. We missed the deadline by a week. I am extremely upset about yet another total oversight on something that I feel is really important to me. 

These are the biggest and most recent examples of our on-going problem, that bring us to where we are now. I want an open relationship. I feel like I have been very patient with him for years, and I've finally figured out what I want. I feel like (I say 'feel' because I can't be certain without exploring it) I am poly. I want a poly relationship. He doesn't. Or he might. He isn't sure, and says he'll put some thought into it. Again, he says he'll read about it later, talk about it with me later, and at this point I just don't feel like I can take him seriously when he says he will do something. In the meantime, he's thinking about it and I am getting no feedback. He has made one demeaning comment to me about my desire to be poly. As time goes on, I feel worse and worse (neglected and depressed) about our situation and like he again, just isn't taking me seriously or understand the scope of what I'm asking him. I'm asking him to open our relationship because I really, really want it. I think I may need it. But I don't think he's listening to me. 


 I just don't know what to do. Am I being too hard on him? I know I can be hard on him, I'm extremely hard on myself and the only person I am almost nearly as hard on is him, I know that. But at the same time, he can count on me. If he asks me for something, I do it. If he needs me in a moment of weakness to do something that he cannot, I'll do it. If I tell him I will do something for him, I do it. I feel like this isn't reciprocated. I'm not asking for an open relationship because I feel like things are unfair, but I am asking for an open relationship AND I think our relationship is unbalanced, especially as of late. He is good to me and our kids, aside from the problem I've described. I am good to him. I am a good wife to him. I don't lie to him, about anything, ever, and I am very open and honest with him and tell him what I want. I feel as though I have done all I can do to make our relationship work and that I'm just.... out of patience, I guess. While I'm waiting for his answer about considering opening our relationship, I am just trying to make sense of this and discern whether or not I've been fair to him. Any feedback would be appreciated. 

tl;dr-- Married woman who is extremely direct with her spouse. Time and time again, despite being clear about what I want or need, he doesn't deliver. Now I'd like to have an open relationship and he isn't responding about it, making me feel more neglected and depressed. Am I being too hard on him? Any idea what I should do? 

Anything helpful or even just uplifting or funny to share with me? I could use a laugh.

The only portion of our relationship that is suffering is the sexual side, as he has reverted to having a very low-libido now that the initial high of the relationship has worn off, whereas my libido is still very high. This can be very frustrating for me on many levels, and I find myself very sexually frustrated. He is the only person I have ever been with, which also bothers me because I could go the rest of my life never experiencing much sex.

Several people have suggested the possibility of opening the relationship (sexually but not emotionally,) and I was wondering what you all thought about this; is it an appropriate solution to this kind of problem? 

Secondly, if it does seem like a plausible solution, how would I approach him about this?

Half of them we've had an open marriage. At first, it was so we could have a 3some (I was curious and he was thrilled). Then he discovered he liked the idea of me with other men. At first I was really weirded out by it, then jealous of him with other women. Eventually I realized that this was just his kink--who he really is. He's a great guy and I love him, but it definitely changed our marriage. Not all in bad ways--we learned how to talk much better than our other married friends, but to me it somehow diminished the feeling that I'm his wife. 
I always chose men that I wouldn't attach to emotionally. I was also sexually abused as a preteen/teen, so I have the terrible ability to shut down during sex. Sometimes it was good and I enjoyed it, other times I would pretend so that way I could go home and see how happy it made him. I realize that this was terrible, and I did a lot of therapy. It's been a while since I've wanted to see other men, so I stopped. He always said ""only do it if you enjoy it"" but I know how much it meant to him so I felt pressured, even if it was just in my head. 
Also, once we started having an open relationship I wasn't jealous of him with other girls at all, but I would get jealous if one of my playmates was dating someone else. Which is really weird as I wasn't emotionally attached to them--at least I don't think that I was.
At any rate, I've done a lot of soul-searching and realized that I want to experience a sort of ""domestic discipline."" I've always felt out of control and I like the idea of someone outlining the rules. It makes me feel safe and happy, and to know that someone will be ""you are MY wife"" makes me feel like I'm truly cared about. My husband's attitude is I'm great enough to share, as long as I only emotionally attach to him. I've been able to do that all these years. However, I went online and met someone for a DD experience with my husband's blessing. He's happy I'm willing to go out and meet another man after this ""dry spell."" We've spoken a few times (me and the online guy) but haven't met since we live far apart. We're currently making arrangements to do so. The thing is, just the convos we've had make me realize how much something is missing in my marriage. I want that strictness, that jealousy, but to tell my husband that would be asking him to change who he is. And I think if I keep going like this, I'm lying to myself and that's not fair either. I do love my husband and he's my best friend, but I'm not sure that after all these years we've changed in the same ways. Is this feeling normal after a few years of openness? Is it a phase?

So my lovely girlfriend and I have recently opened our relationship, and although neither of us has successfully acted on it yet, we are both very excited.

My question is about finding more obscure kinds of poly/swing/non-monogamous community. We live in New York (Brooklyn specifically), and it seems like most of the public resources lead in the direction of either the more new-agey ""hippie-ish"" polyamory community, or they're more older and professional, or they're younger but more geek-centric culture, or BDSM or LGBT-focused or what-have-you.

I've been to a few events (meet-ups, seminars, swing clubs, etc.), but so far between that, and online research, we haven't really been able to find people of similar age, interests, and taste. Honestly, not to sound like a snob, but we're having trouble finding the kind of people that we're attracted to, both in spirit and appearance.

We're both younger (20s) and more geared towards artsy-fartsy, fashion, left-wing youth culture. You know, tattoos and punk and indie-rock type shit. I feel like our kind of community, or at least like-minded people have to be somewhere out there, it's fucking New York, after all.

So I guess my question is, how have you managed to find polyamory and/or non-monogamy community on your own terms, with the kind of people you're interested in connecting with?

Either that, or how have you managed to build your own small community?

Can someone please tell me how to feel? ,3,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/10junr/do_you_that_i_have_a_right_to_be_angry_in_this/,"**warning long post. will try to summarize it in comment**

I was meeting up with a guy in an open relationship for 1 on 1 sex. His husband thought it would be a good idea to start a drunken orgy to spice things up. So yeah it went horribly wrong. It traumatized me because I was (and still) recovering from PTSD, so my anxiety reaction is automatically high. I went into shock and all that fun stuff so I couldn't really move my body to escape the situation. The fact that I had to watch my friend sex with 3 other guys and it deeply disturbed me It doesn't help that at the time this was the only guy I have had regular sex with. I still don't, actually. 

He explained to me that it was a one time thing for him and that he doesn't really have sex with anyone else, including his husband, anymore. However, he is close friends with one of the people I saw him have sex with. They are pretty open sexually. He even took pictures of his friends naked. (Pics showed up on a gay dating site.) Although he doesn't have sex with them, I get the impression that they are pretty open with each other sexually. He is comfortable enough to buy him sex toys and fetish gear. It's hard to not get jealous, or even depressed because of what happened. I'm almost exactly the opposite. I don't bring up sex at all. I wouldn't dare ask my friend to buy me sex objects. I have never asked my friend to take sex pictures of me or any other friends. I don't bring up sex. I don't want to interfere with their relationship at all because I feel it is not my business. 

My jealousy is pretty deep seated and extended way beyond the physical aspects of our friendship. The close friends that I associate with the orgy and sexuality go with him to gay pride parades every summer. I live in a small town. I would kill to be somewhere where I didn't feel like people were going to beat me to death for being who I am. It's full of rednecks here. The friends who I saw my friend have sex with, get to go with this guy to gay pride parade. I can't express in words how jealous I am. I'm an agoraphobe right now. I don't leave my house. I want to go to Toronto to get therapy. I want to be somewhere where I can express who I am without fear of being hated. I might even to express not being hated for liking older men. Or just not hated in general. 

I don't expose myself his friends and husband anymore because of the stress. Put a stop to that a few months after it happened. I was an idiot, and I was in shock so I could not judge properly. I was in the middle of dealing with more taruma and did not expect to be sexually traumatized even more than what I was already dealing with. 

I can't visit my friend at his house, adn that causes even more jealousy because he doesn't want to leave his husband to sleep alone. I tried to respect that but it made me feel just extremely lonely. I spend a lot of my time alone and I know I could be relaxing with my friend...if his friends didn't abuse me and all that. 

 His husband was extremely disrespectful to me because he would also brag about going to these gay pride events. He told me about a lot of his sexual encounters, even when it has made me visibly upset and cry. His husband told me that the close freind and the husband went to gay bath houses, gloryholes, and told me a lot of their sexual encounters. The husband told me that he has sex with the close friend a lot.  I was reliving emotional trauma about what happened everytime he did this, which was almost everytime I visited. I cried my fucking eyes out when I went home and went into shock each time so I didn't know how to deal with it sometimes I didn't even remember what happened.  I kept exposing myself to this because I was a lonely fucking idiot who was in shock. I can't articulate a reason for my own stupidity really. I put a stop to that about 2 years ago or a few months after it happened. I didn't understand it gave me PTSD at that time.

Fast forward to 2 years later. I talk to the guy literally everyday for as long as we want. He actually is a nice sweet guy. He has put up with a lot of my anger. We can talk literally for hours and hours. He can tell me about anything and I can tell him about anything. He would do a lot for me. Since I've been sick he has helped me do a lot of things around the house. I don't visit him at his home due to the trauma, so he tries to compensate for that by talking to me on the phone. It's hard to not to feel attached to this guy. Especially since he is a friend who I have shared so much of what happened in my life and spent a lot of time talking to. I would have quit talking to him if I understood I had PTSD and what hapepned when it happened, and if he was disrespectful. But he is quite the opposite. 


I found out the guy was actually still in contact with one of the other guys who were involved with the orgy.. I didn't deal with that very well. It feels like he kept him secret from me. I know that I don't have the right to know what goes on in this guys life, and I know that it shouldn't be my business. But this guy disclosed the entirety of his situation and who he has sex with and who he talks to and who he doesn't and the specific relationship of him and his friends to me to help me deal with my issues. It feels like he has omitted important details. He didn't tell me he was friends with someone who was involved with an issue that severely traumatized me. I just feel so betrayed. 

I don't even know how to express my paranoia. 

 It almost feels like we're in a relationship in the sense that I talk to him everyday, and he talks openly about his situation. We're pretty close too. I really don't have feelings for this guy at all. I don't have any feeling which remotely resembles the emotion of falling in love. But, I still feel really hurt and betrayed even though I know his life is none of my business. But that thought makes me afraid of how jealous I am becoming. I feel bad about asking. I don't want to ask. But I those logical thoughts don't end my depression and anxiety because they are so deep seated and tied to trauma. He gave me the impression he was open with me, but he omitted details. Details about people I saw him have sex with that traumatized me. I thought this guy was just a random stranger that they never meet before. But it turns out all this time I have had 3  guys instead of 2 to try to not severely jealous over? It's too much.

I'm sorry if that didn't make much sense or if I'm rambling. I am very emotional and I am trying to vent. I'm sorry if any of my replies are emotionally violatile. Putting this much information causes a great deal of vulnerability and defensiveness sometimes. I feel like I don't need people to tell me it's none of my business, because I know it's not my business what he does in his life. I just expected him to be open about what was going on in his life. It feels like he betrayed me, but he sort of didn't even though it feels like he did.. I don't know what I should think really.

My bf and I have a straight, long-distance relationship of 3 years. In May, I embarked in my first same-sex experience with another girl(with the bf's constant consent). Needless to say, I had to break it off shortly after because she didn't really respect the boundaries I set with us and with my bf. 
 The whole story can be read here: http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1dv9jv/my_first_experience_gone_terribly_wrong/

After thinking about it for many months, I have come to the conclusion that I made big mistakes with how I treated her. Although I told her that I was new to non-monogamy and couldn't offer her a relationship, I did things that according to my friends are things that should only be done with people that you are intimate with. For example, going on picnics with wine at the park, bringing sex toys in the bedroom, taking showers together. When I think back, I also realize that I shouldn't have tried to calm down her insecurity about our fling by saying that she shouldn't worry, that I wouldn't abandon her like the other girls in her past. 

I really meant well, and I wouldn't have minded if our fling became something more. I just wanted her to be happy. However, I cut it off when she was asking me to take my bf's name off of our facebook relationship status, and to pretend to not be dating him at our graduation ceremony, because she told her parents(who met me when I slept over at her place) that we were seeing each other. I felt like she wouldn't be able to share me like we had agreed to in the beginning.

Unfortunately, this girl and I still share a social circle so I still see her at events constantly. We met up a month and a half ago to try to be friends, but it was just awkward and painful for me. When we see each other we are civil but still cold. She asked me to meet up for coffee last week, and when I said yes, she went cold and stopped texting me(My bf was always informed of all of this, and he consented that I met her if it meant I could get some closure). I know that she might rightfully still be angry at me, and that I shouldn't have broken the no-contact rule, but it still hurts that we will never be able to be friends again. It all sucks even more because I have to go to this event on Monday, and I just found out that she will be there too, and I don't know how to approach it without hurting her even more. 

ANYWAYS my point is, I still feel so guilty and selfish about what happened. I can't let go of the fact that I toyed with her emotions and it makes me feel inadequate to have any partner at all, let alone ever opening my relationship again. I feel like if I still can't get over this 2-week fling months later, how can I give my bf the girlfriend he deserves? How can I ever try to get involved with another girl, and satisfy my bisexual side if I can't even be careful with how I treat others? I can't help but feel greedy and selfish every time I consider getting involved with another woman again..:(.

Thanks for reading!

TLDR: I can't get closure for my first fling in my open relationship. Feeling guilty for having been the one to break it off after leading my fling on and not delivering. Also feeling guilty because her memory is interfering with my long-term relationship.

So, being in a nonmonogamous relationship has potential legal ramifications if caught. This means no talking about it, no dating while TDY, etc. For those that choose to live on base it even means people scrutinize who visits your home, especially when a spouse is deployed or TDY.

My question is for anyone in a similar situation. How do you find new friends? Most people we know are in some way connected to the military. Nearly all our friends are. So going to a bar or something with the intention of meeting people has to be alone.

I just want help and suggestions, even if it's to drop it/forget about him because I'm so young.**

Problems: 

I'm usually shy and nervous, but I am so attracted to this person (physically as I don't really know him.) 

He's shorter than me by a few cm (I'm about 5'7""-5""8). I don't mind, but he might.

I'm so much younger than him.

I don't have a lot of confidence in myself.

I don't know if he's in a relationship himself, or if he'd even be interested in me.

Would he be okay with the whole ""I have a partner at home"" thing?

I'm going crazy, spending most my day thinking about him fucking me on one of the benches, then telling my boyfriend all about it.

My partner is very okay with this, we have talked about it a lot, and he's all for me trying to do this. He like stories when he's trying to get off, and the last few nights I've been telling him about how Scott and I would fuck, how often, where, how I'd make him listen, other times make him watch. He cums more than usual when I tell these types of stories. His first relationship was also a lot like this. He would be happy having sex once a month, yet I would be happy with once a day, so me finding someone to have sex with would be amazing, especially with someone I'm so highly attracted to.

The situation is that I'm doing a one year course at a polytechnic, mostly to do with professional cafe, bar and restaurant. One of the training rooms is joined to the kitchen, where Scott mostly works. I had an opportunity to work in the actual bar last night for two hours. This will be going on for the next few weeks, but it may be different people from my course doing it. No pay, but good working experience, as I don't have any. 

What happened yesterday was I went to inform the manager that I'd be the only one working that night as the other girl was sick. Scott was standing at the bar with the manager, and Scott tricked me into giving me a piece of ice. I threw it back at him, and we kind of smiled/laughed at each other when I missed and he kicked it under the bar. Later that night I spent about 45 minutes in the kitchen polishing some utensils, while Scott was doing some work about 3-4 meters away. We didn't talk that much, since I like to work in silence, but I really couldn't keep my eyes off of him. I don't think he noticed. I then spent the rest of the time there serving people and taking food out/in. We shared a few comments and smiled at each other. At the end, when I was leaving, he came out of the kitchen with the manager and his boss, and I thought pay back was in order, so I grabbed some ice from the bar and made him take it. Maybe that was inappropriate to do in front of coworkers, but I was nervous and excited. The manager of the restaurant is also only allowed to hire students, and his main server will be leaving this year, so if he likes me, there's a possibility that I will be hired.

I have an interest in all three girls who will potentially be involved, and I get the impression that they also want to get with me. I'm just not sure their husbands are on board with another man doing their wives.

Without getting into all the complications I think are involved in this scenario, I'd like some general advice. I've never been involved in an orgy before. I have pretty good self confidence and I don't think performing in front of others will be an issue because I'm a bit of an exhibitionist. So I'm looking more for any sort of general protocol or standard practices that I should be aware of. Like, I remember reading somewhere that you should ask permission before touching anything that's not yours. Should I be asking that permission of both the wife and husband? Just the person I'm touching? What other stuff do I need to know?

Even if we all just wind up having sex with our respective partners, is it okay to look at what the others are doing? Interact with them either verbally or physically? I like to have an idea of proper etiquette before entering a situation. In this one, there doesn't seem like anyone to ask...but I want to be a part of it, none-the-less.

I say poly-like because they are emerging polyamorists and I am in a ""sometimes"" open marriage.

  I have only just recently come clean with my husband about the continued sexual nature of this other relationship, which originally started out as a swing between us 4. My husband and I are both aware of why and how things developed for myself and the other couple and we are deeply commited to strengthening our marriage. 

  Although I know that this is the best course of action, I cannot stop my heart from breaking over the loss of this other relationship. I would prefer to continue on more balanced ground, with all parties involved which I believe is a possibility once the damage is repaired. The passion, support and general enlightenment I personally gained from the other relationship has been unparalleled in my life and their love and support has always been returned wholeheartedly as well.

Love was never one-size-fits-all. Generally, outside of forums like this we don’t hear much that’s positive (or much at all) about significant intimate relationships which don’t conform to the *two-people-monogamous-shared-household-kids-til-death-do-us-part* model — or at least, relationships on a clear path toward that goal.

So far over 2500 Reddit users have read my [Relationship Escalator] (http://solopoly.net/2012/11/29/riding-the-relationship-escalator-or-not/) article posted a couple days ago to r/polyamory. I really appreciate that support!

If you read that article and liked it, you'll love my upcoming book. And you can help!

**Please [take this survey] (http://solopoly.net/2013/01/13/survey-for-our-book-how-are-your-relationships-off-the-escalator/)**

I'm working on a book tentatively titled: **Off the escalator: great relationships that don't follow society's rules.** This survey gathers people's stories, as well as some relevant data to use in writing this book and developing posts for my [SoloPoly blog] (http://solopoly.net).

This book will of course cover polyamory and other approaches to honest, consensual non-monogamy. But it will also cover options like primary partners (even monogamous ones) who choose not to live together, kink/scene partners, friends-with-benefits, indefinite dating, and more. 

The point is to show that people who are willing to step off society's relationship escalator have a wide array of options that can be equally ""serious,"" valid, and fulfilling. We'll talk about what this means for these people, their partners and families, for their communities, and for society at large.

Also, taking a page from ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" we hope to create greater general awareness that the relationship escalator model is a choice -- it's not mandatory, it doesn't work for everyone, and it's never anyone's sole option for ""real"" or ""good"" relationships.

My co-author is **Lily Lloyd**, author of [The Black Leather Belt] (http://theblackleatherbelt.com) blog and the new e-book: [Discipline: adding rules &amp; discipline to your BDSM relationship] (http://theblackleatherbelt.com/discipline)

Thanks in advance for your help, and please tell your friends and share this survey with your communities. 

Anyone is welcome to take this survey -- but obviously we're especially keen to hear from folks whose current or former relationships are somehow off the escalator, or who might want off-escalator relationships in the future.

We would love to have input and support from all groups that practice tolerance and equality. Following is my introduction. If you are interested, write me and I will give you the name.
I am kjwism I have started this subreddit because I want people in the area to be able to find support and information specific to polyamory and other forms of open relationships. I welcome anyone who can be supportive and civil. I especially know we need to form a larger community with the local LGBT, BDSM, Atheist and Swinger communities.
I hope that people can find support a little closer to home than may be provided in the other polyamory/non-monogamy subreddits which I love well. I also hope we can foster poly friendly businesses, organizations, groups, visitors, and new residents to our wonderful city. As a new resident to Charlotte, I look forward to all the things I have to learn.
For the curious, polyamory promotes ethical non-monogamy by teaching those interested how to be fully honest in their relationships, self-analyse and ""own"" their personal feelings and actions.
As a community we DO NOT promote unhealthy relationships or sexual encounters, dangerous sex practices or cheating. As a community we DO NOT pressure others to be non-monogamous. I vow to moderate anyone who I feel is in danger of promoting those unhealthy agendas. I invite you to ask questions, learn and share thoughts and experiences.

Despite reservations everything went really well.


First and foremost, I know she's young … too young at my age for some probably. Just want to say I took the utmost care, physically and emotionally. And she's fully in the know about my relationship status. She's also a Redditor, so if you read this sunshine, thank you :)

My wife was concerned when I started chatting online with a young woman. I have to say, I was wary, too; she was very private, and not very forthcoming. Plus there are all the societal pressures of an older man creeping on a sweet, innocent girl … what if people found out I was *taking advantage* of an intelligent consenting adult who happened to be young. I understand it could have been a very bad situation, but she sounded so interesting and she kept hinting that she found me really attractive. And no offense to the teenagers of the world, she didn't sound overly dramatic. It took some doing, but we finally set a date to meet and I couldn't have been happier with the results.

Yes we had sex later in the evening, yes it was good, and yes there will be more to come. The last time I was with an 18yo woman was when I was also 18, and very inexperienced. She's not innocent by any stretch, but damn it felt good to hear, feel, and see her mind being blown by every touch. I've been with multiple women, I'm very competent, but holy hell… I've never felt like such a sexual god in my entire life.

She spent the night, shared some cuddles and talked over coffee in the morning. All in all, a very human experience.

To my loving wife, thank you for trusting me. It truly means the world. And to you, sweets … you're so smart, funny, beautiful, and caring. I truly hope the world for you.

Compounding that problem, many men are looking to eventually settle down, to find somebody that they can have a long-term committed (if non-monogamous) relationship with.  

That's fine, but it means that the first step of the solution was ""be a player"", most men would reject it.  In their minds, developing the relationship should come first.  

Unfortunately, that's not a very effective strategy.  

This is what I do, and it works really well for me.  I've seen other men swear by it, but it goes against everything men have generally been taught about how relationships work.  

Start by having sex with a woman relatively quickly (4-10 hours total elapsed time and 3 dates max.) in order to engage the woman's emotional reasoning rather than her logical reasoning. If it takes longer than that, move on to somebody else.  Jokingly deflect conversations about the status of the relationship for the first few months, massively limit the amount of time you spend with her (once a week would be appropriate), and never put the pressure on her to settle down or develop the relationship in any way.  

Paradoxically, all this behavior will make women want you more. A cool guy who gives her good sex, gives her all the space she wants, and doesn't create any pressure for her to settle down?  
She'll be trying to rope you into a relationship before you know it.

I've been introducing my ""vanilla"" (monogamous) friends to swinging, and to polyamory at various times. This would be separate from my coming out to them, I mean, introducing it as a possibility for them.

I've kind of had a sense as to what they'd be more interested in, but I'm trying to figure out where exactly that's coming from.

I get the -feeling- that friends of mine that are more sexually liberated, sexually expressive, are more predisposed to being interested in swinging (though not exclusively that), and that friends of mine that generally kept their sexuality and their sexual expression closer to their chests are more predisposed to polyamory.

As much crossover as there is between the two distinct styles of non-monogamy, you kind of have to start somewhere. So... how do you determine what exactly to introduce people to?
