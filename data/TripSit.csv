Current features:

* Live Chat: **This is the pinnacle of TripSit.** The ability to talk with people in their homes from hundreds of miles away. Instant communication and therefore instant peace of mind. The IRC is where most of the TripSitting happens and is VERY active. **I'm proud to announce** that TripSit manages the /r/drugs IRC room as well, and /r/drugs mod /u/Borax is part of our team! 

* Nexus: **A social network for psychonauts.** Much like facebook but without the privacy invasion. It has blogs (trip reports), questions, games, and discussion pages for pretty much everything. 

* TripRadio: **Webradio station with live DJ's playing whenever they feel like.** Currently using Icecast but looking to move to Shoutcast very soon. **Comment if you'd like to DJ and I can get that set up for you.**

* Wiki: Ever wanted to have a place to post your personal information on your favorite substances? Check out the wiki and add your thoughts! We have a lot of information on ethnobotanicals (plants) and could use some good editors to flesh out the rest of the pages. 

* Flair! We now have awesome TripSitter flair for TripSitters on this subreddit. If you want the flair please **post a comment** and ill take care of that. I realize we have **many awesome people** but i dont keep a tally of who posts in the sub, so if you feel you should have the flair then just speak up!

I feel like I'm annoying the community with my self-posts and would appreciate any help i can get.**

Hello all! I hope you've noticed the changes. Since the last post the IRC has grown to see a bunch of regulars. The subreddit is being reformed to being more calming pictures, peaceful thoughts and chill music, rather than 'im having a panic attack and need someone' type posts. **Immediate assistance and live communication can be found instantly by going to the IRC room, the link is in the sidebar.** I feel like self-posts requesting help are obsolete now that we have the chat room. 

Today I have a favor to ask. Tripsit has grown bigger than i hoped for but im not done with the mission yet. However, i am but one person and reddit is so large. I feel self conscious about annoying people or being spammy with my self-posts advertising the sub. So my favor comes down to this: I humbly request YOU tripsitters to help spread the subreddit. As you're going through /r/drugs and your favorite subs, mention this subreddit to draw more people here. Please mention that we have a Live IRC room that can be accessed from the web. Don't shove it down their throats, but mention it when you see the opportunity. 

The last thing i want is to become 'That guy who wont shut up about his subreddit'. I firmly believe in what tripsit stands for and ive gotten a lot of positive feedback. With your help this could become something epic. :)

2. **Consider your audience.** Politics, debates, conspiracy, and conservatives all have their own subreddits. We could argue back and forth forever, so dont. 
3. **Be down to earth.** If this is your first time on a drug, you do not belong here.  This is for people who are comfortable where they are at, and want to talk with other like-minded people. 

Finally, if you are on the verge of a psychotic break and need immediate attention: call emergency services. There is nothing someone on the internet can do for you if you are at this point.

I can't stop thinking about her. I don't want this to ruin my trip. How in the hell do I stop this?

UPDATE: Well, I made it through the rest of the night with a lot of special thanks for the tripsit IRC. Especially ProButcher and Reality. I kept denying that my friend's death was really affecting me, but now that I'm sober I feel that it heavily influenced the theme of death that centered around my trip. It was the worst night ever and the death of my friend wouldn't allow me to enjoy myself.

As soon as I'd start dancing, or smiling, I'd think to myself, ""What the fuck is your problem, dude? Your friend is dead and here you are tripping and dancing?"" Which lead to a lot of guilt. Then, I started vividly thinking about her bloody, lifeless body being pulled out of the car which really tore me up.

Suddenly, the thought crosses my mind that there was a mislabeling incident and that what I took wasn't 4-aco-dmt and that I took some unknown chemical that probably takes a couple of hours to kick in and that I was going to overdose and I was going to be the new posterchild for why RC's are bad.

Middle age guy here, family is out of town, no responsibilities for the night, so I thought I'd drop some E we had hiding in the house.

I have quite a history with drugs, starting with LSD in college, then we moved on as a group to E and shrooms. I was fortunate to have a small group of like-minded friends, and I have to say those were some of the best times of my life. Having a bar full of people all on E, all who know each other, all who know everyone else is on E. Well, there's just nothing like it. You're happy and safe and warm and cuddly and everyone is hugging and talking and friendly. If you can ever get into a safe place, whether it is a house or a bar or out in the woods, and get as many people as you can all on LSD and/or E at the same time, DO IT. Plur.

Starting to peak on one nice hit of E here at home now, feels really good. I loaded up on vitamin C and 5-HTP when I dropped, very smooth and very powerful nowI feel like sometimes your brain just needs a reset. I'm a ridiculously positive optimist most of the time, and legendary for pep talking my friends. But, over the past few years I sense myself getting more and more negative. I think E at it's best reminds you about what is good in life.

I have two books I'm pulling out now and I'm going to read them for a while. One is 

http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-Plain-Simple-Steve-Hagen/dp/0767903323

Buddhism plain and simple by Steve Hagen. Really an amazing book. If you want to cut through the bullshit of buddhism and see it for what it really is, which is a guy saying ""hey, don't worship anyone, take care of yourself"" then this is the book. I've given many copies to friends over the years.

The other is 

http://www.amazon.com/The-Voice-Knowledge-Practical-Guide/dp/1878424548

The voice of knowledge by don miguel ruiz

I'm a skeptic by nature, and don't buy into new agey stuff, but Don Miguel Ruiz hits on a fundamental truth here: your voice in your head isn't you, and you think other people think about you ISN'T what they think about you, it's what your inner voice tells you. Your inner voice lies.

Oh, and one more:

A mandala coloring book

http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=mandalas+coloring+book

the one I have isn't in print, but there are lots of others. Best. Trip. Entertainment. Ever.

Anyway, that's all for now. One-time throwaway. I might pop back on to answer questions if anyone has any, or I might get distracted.

Huggles. :)

Sitting here. Alone. My family photos hugged against the walls. I have come to a conclusion. A conclusion that no matter how much you sleep, how many videogames you play, how many books you read, no matter what happens you will not live without it. It is something omniscient. It sits with you when you are quiet. It will visit only when it pleases. It searches for those who are hungry. Hungry for everpresence and knowledge. To know is all you want, yet it only lets you have a drop when you want the entire oasis. Please, oh please Alfather, I want to be beyond this infernal prison. I want to sit above necessity. I yearn to be in the cocoon outside of time and shape. I want to want what I want without the constraints of this mundane plane. A place without words or emotion. A place where I have peace and understanding. Silence is what I want most. I want to be God. 
If one object is to exist in the everscape, no other objects exist, does it itself have a shape or size? Does the object even exist at all? Without the comparison of other objects it itself isn't. Now let's say the object is - you. (Take a deep breath and relax, find yourself in these words) You. You are an only object. Do you feel lonely? How could you without even knowing what you are, where you are, or even what other objects are or even that other objects can exist. What do you do? Are you capable of doing? Do you make yourself capable of doing by you're own accord? How do you interact when you know not of interaction? 
You decide to create. Creation is what you want. You create a magnificent playground of wonderment all procured from the limitlessness of your imagination. No limit is known to you, the very first being. You know the secrets of time and dimension because you are the creator of them. Time, Space and Dimension only exist because you allow them. You want more, you feel a longing. A longing for the absence of creation. You are living in a world that you have created... and you don't even know it. You're sitting there, reading this and listening to some morose orchestral music. It has crossed your mind before, the thought that you're the only existing thing, that all exists just for you. You thought long and hard about it. ""Maybe everyone else is like a robot or just like not even real."" You were naive and young then. Can't you see? You are God. You're the creator of this place, you only wished to be in the playground you created. You cast your powers into the ether from which you were once the one and only. You then were born into this awful, smoldering pile of rubbish. 
You live your entire life living among those you have created, funny part is - you don't even know it. That was the point, you wanted to teach yourself a lesson. You wanted to know it was like to not know. Even in the void where all knowledge existed, you didn't know what it was like to be unknowing. Everything you are doing right now is what you were meant to do. It is what your formal self intended, you wanted to see how life played out. Whether you had a family or hung yourself in a gastation bathroom. You wanted to know no matter how gruesome the outcome.
You get things. You get a house or something akin. You try to find someone to love. You do what you want or if you choose you can not do what you want which is till doing what you want. You're trying to make sense of everything happening in you life but, no matter what you still feel as if you don't know enough.
Rest assured, know that you will know - One day you will finally understand. You will understand what it means to be.

Additionally, I fucked up big time by taking a pill which I thought was a Benzo... only to realize that it was in fact a Ritalin. This trip overall, was a VERY big wake up call in regards to my regular life.. and I have to be much more responsible for my own actions. I'm hoping to make this difficult trip into a positive effect in general down the line, and hope that the right time comes again (with the necessary preparations!), after I've improved various aspects of my life.

I had taken K2 for the first (and last) time ever and had an absolutely terrifying bad trip. Since then, it's happened on small scale occasionally when I smoke marijuana. Last night (2 am Wednesday NE time) I smoked weed and for the first time, had an absolute repeat of the K2 trip. Not the same trip, but exact same feelings.

It's a long shot but here's my best explanation of the feeling: I feel like I'm Being sucked out of reality into this other world where only pain exists. It's absolutely terrifying and I wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemy. During the K2 trip I fell asleep and entered that other world and it was ... I can't even explain the terror... So what keeps the panic going is me worrying I'll fall into that world. I call it a panic attack when talking to people but I don't think it's anything like normal-people panic attacks, like people who have never done drugs and have them.

So it's been almost 24 hours since it began and I still feel pretty weird. If last night was an 8 on a scale 1-10, then I'm still at a 3. I just want to feel normal again and being alone is unbearable. My parents are asleep and I feel like when my girlfriend falls asleep and stops texting me, itll happen all over again.. I have 4 pills Ativan, but really don't want to fall asleep, as is obvious from above words.

I have with me my wife as a sober babysitter.  I want to have this thread going to come back to and check in with you guys.  I will try and stay as up to date on it as I can.  

final word: ok so I want to rap this all up in a neat little package. I am 100% sober at the moment in fact you might say this is the most sober I have been in months. As the trip began to subside and I knew it was drawing to a close I noticed that it had started to get lighter outside. I decided to drag my porch chairs out into the middle of the yard and watch the sunrise. Best decision of the night/morning! It was amazing!!!!! I felt like I woke up with the world. I felt so interconnected and alive. After about 40 minutes of this I went ahead and lit up a ciggy, this being one of my absolute favorite things to do in the world. As I watched it burn the idea popped in my head that I was watching myself burn moments of my life away and that I was being incredibly selfish. I forced myself to finnish the rest of that nasty fucker to really drive the point home about how gross it was. I am happy to report that 12 hours later I have not even had a craving. This is the easiest it has ever been to quit smoking.
There has never been a drug that even compares to LSD. I really would like to drive home the point that this drug is something to be respected. I don't really have the desire to go crazy with it but I do see my self doing this again at least once with my wife. I wouldn't say I had a paradigm shift or came down a different person but I will say I walk a little taller and have a little more respect for the world around me.

316 time is going so slow buty so fast. i know that makes no sense. or, i know that isnt going to make sense tomorrow. half more lucy is being absorbed.
i'm having to second guess myself, but i think that if a LEO were to approach me (sitting clothed, calmly in front of a triple monitor computer) i would be able to act 

coherent, probably not act sober.
I want to confine myself to the chari so i can document every part of it, but then again i want to wander aimlessly in the dark maybe naked or covered in something.hnnnf. 319 

im glad i decided to nevermind i dont remember what i was glad i decided to ... time. yes, im glad im not trying too hard to keep track of it.
after thinking about the LEO situation i have decided that i would need this notepad or some kind of notepad to even stay somewhat on the same train of thought. and you can 

see how well im doing iven with a reference right infront of my eyes.

prtien drink seems to be made of infinity. reading my log. 322 ok about my lifing room experience, the room was completely dark, but i could clearly see the chair and couches 

and they were all illuminated in color.. maybe rainbows. oh god.. i saw nyancat.. the intetubes have leaked into lucyland what have i done. :D if i could capture myt face 

rihght now.. oh wait i can! oh wait that is a HORRIBLE idea. :D you;'re just going to have to imagine it. i feel like i have been laughing for hours and the smile is burnt 

into my face. its wonderful. 325. im going back to the cloud bed goign to turn on music and visuals don't know when i'll be back again.. still 325.... 3:38 that felt like an 

eternity. its wonderful. ipad reddit porn and house classics on the headphones. milkdrop. iVape Tesla with a vivi nova. 8.0w. MFLB. this trance music's scifi quotes actually 

make sense. what the fuck.. lol. 340.. back to the bed/cloud/universe/thing


412. um its good to root back to something is normal for once. i can see how people get lost in lucy. its so ""REAL"" everything i am looking at has its own life to it. its own 

vibration. i know the movement i see isnt really occuring. but i want to believe it is. its hard to focus, i can see why some would call this anxious. i seem to need to take 

""breaks"" and remind myself that i am here, in my room, that to the outside observer i am just a man calmy typing away at a blue keyboard in the dark of night.
4:15p - A sudden need for order. I really want to go make myself a sandwich and a glass of milk. im not sure i can do it before he wakes up to go to work.. in 45 minutes or 

so.... im going to try. i HONESTLY dont know if i will make it back in 45 minutes. hahahaha. ok bye now.. but the colors.... ok. sandwich.oh i can focus much better without 

the music. brb 417.



oh dear god i forgot about this thing. 502a trying to get a sandwich, he has gone finally. can be free. going for sandwich, not looking back. 518 wow, the fact that that was 

anything less than severl hours since i had last been here is amazing.

5:43 love how did you spend your 29th? seating over a dark blue keyboard into the filth of the night.

5:44: i know that as long as i dont do anything, i can not be judged to have done something.



This is the Perfect Sentance was already perfect before you thought it was perfect.

546:
i feel like every moment documenting i should be spending experiencing.

547
nausia. i feel quite dizzy and burpy actually.

That strange moment when you realize there is something beautiful in the world and you want to share it with someone, and then you suddenly realize that you are that thing, 

and then that you are that one. and then that moment. then. I. 


622a

625a


6:32a
6:52a i have finally realized

7:17 i just took a picture of this log so i could remember to remember what i remembered to write. WHAT THE FUCK DID I WRITE? I will never remember exactly what i remembered 

at that moment exactly as i did. and any attmept to do so just distances me further from the moment.


the sad truth is i dont know what i've become. but i want to know. and i want to love it.


all i am is an interface between me and this world. well then what am i? did i mean my body?

726 at some point i went for a walk, it was at sunrise and it was beautiful.

when what pleases my interface to this world and your interface to this world coelesce, a true thing of beauty has been found.

7:44 if LSD really is heaven, and i were to want to experience heaven all the time, what would i need to do to trip on LSD forever? Well, someone would have to make the LSD. 

And someone would have to provide that person with ergot and other chemicals that i do not know. this person would have to be convinced well enough that they would cleary 

disregard the possible bodily and spiritually and mentally i cant do this anymore

is it really that easy? only one way to find out...

		care to try these again? fucking capthca

jkBVRI


where am i supposed to share this on reddit? WAIT.. LSD IS LIKE META. SO META. SO VERY META.

753a why dont i want anyone to know? LSD is so fantastic, it obviosuly outweighs all the potential disasterous 

i must surround myself with people who feel and beleive and BEHAVE like i do. i must contribute to this order. ""just us"" we can work together. this is the foundation of all 

law, all religion. justice.

if i want to reasonably expect society to let me be me then I have to reasonably expect to not get in the way of anyone else. this is the foundation of all society. man i dont 

know if i am ever coming back from this trip, but i feel like i have learned alot.

I have reconnected with my consiousness. I was forced to live and utilize all of my senses, incuding the ones i did not know I had. I know I am not alone. But if that were so, 

then why is no one next to me?

all of this infrastructure what does it enable me to do? anything i want? life? liberty and the pursiut of what? what is it that i want? what will make me happy? I can afford 

to be in any country in the world tomorrow If i needed to be. And all i choose to do is sit here alone day after day, what is wrong with me? I know that there is nothing wrong 

with me just existing.


Oh it feels good to write.

everything in this world has been arragnged by US, the inhabitors. the trees, the roads, the mailboxes, its all because two of us sat down and decided they both liked that

817 i dont know who i am looking for, but if you're reading this please give me a sign. There is so much Joy in solitude. There is so much more in Shared Experience. why cant 

I pick and choose my feelings? What is a feeling? a sensation? fuck. I am the system. How did that happen? I really have everything i could want in life, but for some reason i 

am afraid to even try and tell anyone else about it :D How could any of that be wrong? society, what does that mean?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society

I have nowhere i need to be today. What do i want to do? Everyone else is at work. Its not safe to drive. I am stuck here with my thoughts for now. Oh but how i long for 

sobriety and sleep to take me so that i may meet with my people again. Thank you. thank you. thank you. I get it. I understand why no one should ever do LSD. It could kill 

you. I hereby vow to live my life as I see fit from here on out.

wow. that was a trip. its been atleast 10 years. it was worth the risk to see the edge of reality once again. I should do this again sometime :D With people i love and trust 

or maybe i can just find people to love and such.

this experience was so wonderful, i wish i could have shared it with someone else


there is no going back my eyes have been opened. I am. and I smell. so i'm going to shower.

None of us like tripping alone, so we designate a 'trip sitter' and as time went on I became the favorite sitter of my friends. So here are some helpful hints when your around someone who is in another world.
Familiar setting, make sure that the setting is a place where the tripper is comfortable. Anywhere they have had a good time before, for some this can be as easy as someones house or a river bed. Keep in mind that no matter where you are or how long they will look around like they have never been there before.
No anger, especially for first timers. Being in an altered state of awareness their minds are very fragile and anything that may make them uncomfortable can cause a bad trip. No matter what the person is doing while there tripping you need to make sure that you are calm and smiling to help them feel safe.
DO NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE IN A CONFINED SPACE. One of the first times I tripped on mushrooms my trip sitter noticed that I was in ego death ( a state where you lose all sense of self ) I laid in his back seat for almost 2 hours alone trying to keep myself from losing my mind. No matter what you need to do, if your trip sitting you need to make sure your not away from the person tripping for too long. You are there tie to reality and without you there they have no one to tell them what is real and what isn't.
Music. Having tripped many times I can say with 100% certainty that music makes everything better. I suggest typical stoner music. Its easy to listen to and very relaxing.
Talk to them. Holding idle conversation allows you, the trip sitter, to better understand how the trip is going. Talking to them also keeps them from confusing reality with whats not. Since they're talking to you, chances are they will be making eye contact. So if they see something strange and you don't react to whatever they saw they know it was just in there head.
TL:DR. Familiar setting, No anger, Don't leave them alone for extended periods of time, Music and keep talking to them.

Every single person that is a regular, Vet, or anyone coming in everyday, I just want to say thank you. I don't think I ever would have overcomed my Xanax addiction without it. I don't know if I would even be here if it wasn't for this chat. But I just want to do some shoutouts real quick. 

Twocb, You're mah nigga, you're one of the only people in my phonebook that I know no matter what random bullshit I'm going through that I can just text or call, and just be myself. You've helped me through some serious shit. If I have any way at all making it to the Tripsit meetup (if it happens) I'm coming to get your ass and everyone that is there, and everyone that doesn't have a ride on the way there. Out of everyone in this chat, you've probably helped me more as a person, as like I said before you somehow you awesome fucking guy you, you always know how to make everything seem a fuck ton better than it actually is. 

Tryptamine, I know you don't come around as often as you used to, but you were one of my first friends when I came into this chat, we became really close after use introduced me to 6-apb, and I don't think I'll ever forget your awesome picture taking tasks. 

Teknos, for making this chat, just you made this chat from the ground up. I remember coming in at like 100 subs, and now look at it we're at 1574 SUBS, I remember when we made it to 1000 and everyone in the chat just was so happy. Without you, I don't think the chat would be as active as it is now, so for that we thank you! 

N2oman, who I didn't add earlier because I didn't remember who helped me that night, but this guy, this fucking guy, he is the reason I'm who I am today, because he helped me through my most difficult drug experience I've ever had which turned into my ego death, he was the one who talked to me for hours through it and made me feel comfortable with letting myself flow into my brain, and he's the soul reason I made it through that experience. This guy gets all the upvotes, because this guy is why I'm this happy motherfucker right now.

There are so many more shoutouts I want to do, but I don't have time right now, but seriously every single person that has came into the chat over the past 5-6 months~ I love you. Every single person. I'll leave this off with a quote.

We're going to need to change some things around. I'm going to set into motion a plan, and you all are welcome to give feedback. 

* #TripSit tripsitters will start /invite 'ing people to #drugs and keeping the chat generally chill and inviting to someone in need of help. 

* #Drugs for general drug chat for everything besides trees. Expect sarcasm, crude jokes and general drug talk without needing to slow down for trippers and questions from newbies. 

* #trees is available for tree talk, or check their sub for their official IRC. 

* Tinychat to be used for weekly group. DJ's will play music, take requests and keep a positive atmosphere. Listeners will be welcome to voice chat, webcam and participate in an active chat channel that wont be slowed down by the occosinal tripper neededing help. 

* The requirement for a tripsitter will become increasingly higher, with only the most supportive and responsible trippers being able to qualify. 

* Tripsitters will have to agree to a 'tripsitter oath'. Information below. 

---

**Tripsitter Oath**

By becoming a tripsitter you agree to:

* Talk one-on-one with people who need it. 

* Be patient and non-judgemental of a persons actions.

* Promote responsible drug use in speech and action. 

* Keep chat positive and sarcasm low.

* Enforce the rules of /r/Tripsit on a warn-kick-ban system. 

This 'Oath' will become more elequant as time goes on. If you feel like making a better oath please do so.

I think the one time that stands out the strongest for me would have to be a time when three friends and I took 2ce for the first time. The drug was overwhelming for my friends and it was easy for them to come up with negative thoughts throughout the night. One friend, we'll call him Arthur, was feeling sick and disoriented and would let everyone know this. No one else felt sick until he would mention it then the other two friends had to sit down too. 

I don't think our situation was helped much by having a full case of BudLight nearby. BudLight is not a replacement for water.. We would get thirsty and crack a new one, drink a few sips and forget about the beer. We needed water, but in our state we weren't really thinking properly. Don't let this shy you away from drinking and tripping, I enjoy it when done right. Beer =/= water. Anyways..

After some hilarious events and randomness, everyone was slowing down. This is the problem with starting a trip at midnight. 3 hours in you are exhausted but unable to rest. Around that time Arthur was stuck in loops and asking us questions like ""can you guys hear me?"" He asked if throwing up would make him feel better and I said yes it probably will. He goes to the bathroom and after he's done he comes back out saying, ""guys, I just threw up blood."" So enter panic mode, that's not supposed to happen. No one else felt that bad or off even to puke.. My other two friends had enough and were ready to retire, asked if I could take care of him

They left and I sat there trying to calm him down a little. He said he felt better, I threw on some relaxing music. My mood was killed though and I was a little bit harsh on him, telling him maybe these strong drugs weren't for him because this wasn't his first difficult time. It didn't occur to me until I was sober the next day but we had eaten sloppy joes a couple hours before tripping.. he didn't puke blood it was just tomato paste! Dangit Arthur haha

We are kind of incompatible for tripping alone together though because he needs a lot of stimulation through response and I am quiet and occupy myself in my head or just doing what I want to do to enjoy myself.

A couple things I could have done better I suppose would have been to try to treat him better and tend to him more but I felt entitled to my trip more than taking care of him. I got him pillows and a blanket and stayed by his side until we finally passed out.

My other friend talked me down and got me into having an awesome time. This whole ""freak out"" lasted about 15 minutes. It felt like I was coming up on acid almost. The rest of my roll was amazing: I felt super close to my friends and dancing came very naturally. Then about 3 hours in things started to get a little trippy. There were some light patterns if i focused hard and things seemed a little wavy. I also noticed that I had to find the euphoria and good feelings by myself, where as they're just present on MDMA. I'm on my way down now and surprisingly it feels pretty good. I'm so tired and beat from dancing but it feels great.

1352559920.0,9,self.TripSit,12yqbj,Hi! My buddy had an extremely bad trip last night.,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/12yqbj/hi_my_buddy_had_an_extremely_bad_trip_last_night/,"First of all thank you for wanting to help out. Read my report of last night and tell me what I should have done better/ done differently. I always try to be prepared when it comes to a bad trip, but this is the first time I have seen someone go through one. 

It may be long but I feel like details will help show you the kind of trip he was having. I'm hoping for feedback and some help from the community. My thoughts are still really scattered about the night.
So here's what happens. My buddy Jordan and I take 2.5 tabs of some nbome. It wasn't even a strong trip. I had a very mild trip. Looking back on the night I can tell Jordan was a little off the whole night. Anyway we took it on the way to out other friend Lydnsay's.

We dropped it around 9:15. Had a fun trip for a couple hours. Watched pineapple express. Everything was fun. Then things just got really awkward for some reason. We decided to walk to Jordan's house (we were definitely tripping too hard to drive even though it was close) and chill there. The walk was maybe a quarter mile.

Halfway he started thinking he was hearing sirens. He had his bong wrapped up in his backpack and was like ""fuck I have so much shit on me"" and stashed it by a tree. In my head I was thinking okay that's weird. He then proceeds to run twords his house. I figured that's a good place to go cause I could see his trip starting to turn sour. He then proceeds to yell ""WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE"" and things like that over and over. He also says why am I dailing 911? I took his phone and checked it, he just called his girlfriend. I'm like okay I need to call our sober friend who's house we were at and she can take care of everything. Looking back at phone call records I can see at 12:24 I called Lyndsay and she ran to where we were.

He paused looked at a car passing by, It looked like he was about to throw himself in front of it. We then somehow manage to get him inside. He is completely out of his mind. For some reason Lyndsay puts him in the bathroom and he would stand up and just go completely limp and fall. He was speaking in tongues and becoming unresponsive. This was extremely creepy. I thought about taking a video to show him how fucked he was after he had snapped out of it. In the back of my mind I knew he wouldn't remember it or think he was having an extremely bad trip. But I didn't do it because if I was in that state I would not want anyone taking videos of me.

I tried everything I've read about. I told him it's only temporary and that it would be over in the morning. He would just yell ""I DON'T TRUST YOU, I'M GOING TO DIE HERE"". I was considering benzos but I didn't think he would even take them. He was getting paranoid and may have thought we were trying to kill him.

His girlfriend really wanted us to call an ambulance. But I knew for a fact he wasn't OD'ing and was not going to die. I kept saying this. I didn't want to fuck his life up with a trip to the hospital.
He said he had to puke and just stuck his entire head in the toilet water and I wasn't paying attention. Lyndsay then goes ""Ryan, is he trying to drown himself?!"" and I look and pull him up by the hair and say ""what the fuck man!""

I called a friend of mine, Brian, and he was slipping in and out on K. It took me an hour to reach him. He is an experienced tripper and has gone to many festivals and has handled bad trips before. I pussied out and didn't want to be alone with Jordan so I drove to get him. Lyndsay's sister was there so she wasn't completely alone.

When Brian got there he handled it well. Before he got there we were trying to calm him anyway we could. His heart was beating fast. Eyes darting everywhere. Yelling jibberish. But Brian was really able to help ground him. I'm so fucking thankful he showed up. We had an extremely intense and emotional phone call to get him there. Lyndsay was crying I was freaking out, but trying to stay calm for Jordan. Brian and I's phone call went like this.

Me: ""jordan's tripping out bad. We need you here Brian you're experienced and can help us."" 

Brian: ""hey man I'll text you."" 

Me: ""no you need to be here right now. If you value Jordan as a friend you will be here for him."" 

Brian: ""I'll text you.""

Me: ""fuck you dude""

About half an hour later, he texts me the address and I book it to where he's at.

We got him down to Lyndsay's bed and all layed around him trying to hold a normal conversation and eventually he just snapped out of it. Craziest fucking night of my life.

The creepiest fucking thing is that he doesn't remember much of it. We were laughing and shit about it because that was all of our way of coping with the situation. He seriously thought he had a pretty good trip but was saying they were just strong tabs. I said ""no. I took just as much as you and I had pretty mild trip. Yours was intense because you had a psychotic break."" and he wouldn't believe it was actually that bad.

I'm knowledgeable about this. But no amount of reading could have prepared me for this. The thing that sticks with me most is him staring into my eyes, completely unresponsive.

I'm positive he doesn't have any suicidal tenancies when he's sober. He's an incredibly chill guy. But something snapped. He's fairly experienced but he hadn't tripped since summer.

So now I ask you reddit how can this be prevented/stopped?

What is your first hand experience with bad trips? What helps? Anyway to instantly snap him out?

Would it ever be a good idea to call an ambulance if he isn't getting overly physical and not OD'ing?

Also are the ramifications of taking someone like that to the hospital? It would completely ruin his life right? The dudes over 18 and goes to university but still lives with his parents. Would they ever find out about it?

Most importantly what is the next step? Should he completely stop all use of psychs for the rest of his life?",,False,self,t5_2swvc,False,,,True,t3_12yqbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/12yqbj/hi_my_buddy_had_an_extremely_bad_trip_last_night/,

I have a couple dozen trips behind my back with substances like these, but I still get a bit anxious when I start feeling the effects in 15ish minutes after taking the drugs and know that in another 15-20 minutes I'll be peaking already.

I mean I always know it'll most likely be awesome, and it's a safe and comfortable place I'm going to. Just the sudden and quick onset of the effects can throw me a bit off with doses that pack a punch whereas with psychedelics that have a less intense comeup I have absolutely no problems at all. I guess it's about being able to get used a bit to the psychedelia and effects you're experiencing before it gets stronger and stronger?

How do you deal with anxiety like this? Do you have to, or am I just an unfortunate fellow? Usually putting on The Beatles or something and singing along or talking to a friend really helps. But I'm open to new suggestions. :)

I've always wanted to try DMT as well (though I can't find any right now), but the suddent onset kind of worries me there too.

I got back to campus after my break Sunday night around 10:30 and some friends of mine had just took acid and asked me if I wanted to join them. It has been 2 weeks since my last trip, which was shrooms (I had tripped about 4 times before this, about a week apart from each other, thrice on shrooms, once on acid). I felt like that was enough time had past so I said sure.

My friend gave me 3 drops of liquid lsd, in the nose as I leaned my head back (I'm still unsure about this method, kind of took me off balance, he said it would make me come up quicker). The come up wasn't too bad, I felt a bit nauseous and almost threw up, but didn't. For most of that I sat listening to music and closed my eyes, watching lights shape to the music. 

However, around 2am about 3 hours since I took it one of my friends who wasn't tripping convinced me to take a dab of hash oil (had been about a week and a half since I last smoked, I forgot that smoking can intensify trips too, or so I've heard). This is where it started to get too crazy. 

The music was really trippy and I started to hallucinate sounds and such. I began going through mental loops on one thing or action to the point I felt like I didn't know when the loop had started and I felt like i was falling out of reality and deeper in to my mind. At this point I just had to leave that room, I ended up going to a friends room who wasn't tripping and chilling there for the rest of the night as we watched a bunch of Top Gear. I don't remember when I got out of the loops, but I kind of laid on his bed for hours until I remember coming down and feeling relieved I had gotten out of it. This was around 8 am or so on Monday. 

When it finally wore off I have felt really just exhausted in my head, which I experience last time and I know it's normal. But I wasn't able to get to sleep until 11:30pm or so on Monday (around 36 hours since my last good rest), and I ended up taking one Advil PM to help me sleep. I woke up around 6:30 am or so and went back to sleep again until 9:30am, but I still just feel really exhausted. When I try to sleep I keep thinking about the loops I experienced and I'm afraid that they could come back, like maybe I did lose who I was, and I won't get it back or that I won't stop feeling this exhausted feeling in my head. Just looking for some words of encouragement to get my mind off it.

**TL; DR**: Crazy mental loops, couldn't sleep for 24 hours since I took it. Feel like I could of lost who I used to be and I might not recover. Just looking for help/advice or reassuring words.

Wow!,12,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/1kgv0u/12mg_5meodmt_vaporized_in_gvg_wow/,"Well the trip is pretty much over now, there is no way I could possibly make any sense of the internet (or English for that matter) while in it. I am still coming down but this has been the most incredible experience of my life hands down. 

I used my Glass Vapor Genie to vaporize 10-12mg of 5-MeO-DMT. I got it all in one big hit and held it as long as I could. I don't think it was really that long but I honestly forgot how to count and lost perception of time almost immediately as I slipped away. If you don't know 5-MeO does not have the visual properties of nn-DMT. I normally close my eyes on regular DMT trips but this was so much more intense and there is nothing to see with your eyes closed anyway, I tried. The come up was so instantaneous it was somewhat startling and I don't even really remember it. I cannot recall another time in my life that my heart beat so fast. This was a bit concerning, but I don't think there was any real danger. I am young and healthy. 

All my concern/worries went away within a minute or so because I was dropped into the so called ""void."" Everything looked exactly the same but it was like I was experiencing the world for the first time. I am laying in bed and I could not feel my body at all. At the peak I do not think I could move, but I also did not want to, I was so amazed. The only way I can describe the experience is that everything around me was all one, and I was a part of it. Even though I could only see the walls and content of my room, I could *feel* the entire universe. My mind was completely free from my body and my ego was nowhere to be found. 

Words do not do this experience justice. I understand this is a difficult chemical to find, but if you ever get the chance I highly recommend it. Everybody should experience this.

The weird thing about this drug is it doesn't make me *happy* the way mushrooms and acid do; if anything, it seemed to make me feel almost emotionless.

We originally were given 2 lollies each which we thought had been blotted with LSD, but an hour or so after eating them, we weren't feeling anything so we went and bought some tabs. I had eaten 2 lollies, and I took 2 more tabs when we got back to our cabin. The onset was quite fast, and I found it difficult to keep myself from freaking out. I'm deadly afraid of wasps, and we had seen a few around earlier in the day, so I kept thinking I saw wasps everywhere and it was really quite unpleasant. My friends decided we should change the scenery a bit so we went inside to watch Spirited Away. If you've ever seen that film you'll know that the opening scene is pretty unsettling, and it really seemed to set me off. I felt as if I was the character in the film, and her parents were quite negative to her in the beginning so I felt sad because my parents are usually very kind to me. Then they turned into pigs and I completely lost it. In my mind I had conceded that this was going to be a bad trip. I didn't recognise my friends anymore, they looked evil and menacing. Everything looked kind of like this cauliflower: http://i.imgur.com/gNYXb.jpg [1] but in a bad way. I started thinking I saw crawling insects everywhere and everything felt super sticky to the touch (I should mention that we were up in the loft of our cabin in the middle of the day, so it was pretty hot). I sometimes have this problem where part of my mind thinks of scary things just for the fun of it, and I couldn't get out of that mindset while I was tripping. I started looping over and over and over, thinking that if I completed a certain action my trip would stop being bad and start being good. Simple actions like putting the password in my laptop (according to my friends I would type in the password and log in, then immediately log off and try and type the password again), or drinking lots of water, or picking up all the chess pieces and separating the black pieces from the white pieces. Obviously none of the stuff worked because I wasn't changing my mindset. I felt like the friends I was tripping with (remember I didn't recognize them at all, and some weren't tripping) were trying to stop me from completing the actions to stop the bad trip, when they were actually just trying to stop me from breaking my laptop or pouring water all over myself. I just remember slumping over on the bed in defeat and closing my eyes. When I closed my eyes I felt as if I was under water or something but these faces kept breaking through the surface of the water above me and kept reassuring me that I'll be fine (I distinctively remember seeing Mufasa from the Lion King, but he seemed to envision my mum and dad). After that I got up and I had stopped peaking and freaking out, so the rest of my trip was nice and peaceful (although of course my friends were quite annoyed at me which wasn't a good feeling).

Anyway, I thought I had prepared adequately for the trip (perhaps I was instilling myself with fake confidence), but it didn't go to plan at all. Another one of my friends took exactly the same as I did, but they didn't freak out at all, they had a beautiful trip. A couple nights before we left I read something on reddit about research chemicals and how you hardly ever get actual LSD anymore, so I kept thinking about that when I was tripping.
We're leaving to go back to that same place in a couple weeks time for another trip, so I'm really trying to focus on keeping calm and having a good trip, but I have a lot of unanswered question in my mind. I'd like to say I have a healthy happy mindset, I'm pretty content with basically everything in my life and nothing bad has really popped up at all in recent months. Obviously my mindset going into the last trip was wrong, as I was too focused on not freaking out and I was also concerned that the acid we took was actually research chemicals. I want to be able to not focus at all on ""not having a bad trip"" and focus on all the amazing things I feel and see, but I feel that my mind might now associate those feelings you get on acid with the negative feelings that I remember from the last trip instead of the positive side if you get what I mean. I did take acid again once at New Years at a festival, I only took 1 tab and I was in control the whole time, but I kept having to reassure myself that I'm having a good time instead of having a bad time. You know what I mean? Where you're spending all your energy on telling yourself you're having a good time instead of being completely absorbed in having a good time and not even thinking about whether you're having a good time or not. I'm planning on taking 2 tabs again on this trip, and I really don't want it to go the way it went last time I took 2 tabs. Even if it isn't true LSD that we get this time, even if we get given research chemicals instead (I'm not even too sure of the likely-hood of that happening in Australia) I want to be okay with that, because it's possible to have a good trip on research chemicals as well. So guys, can you give me some advice? I have read the guides on erowid, and it's given me some really helpful information too.

**TL;DR:** I had a horrible trip on 2 tabs last time, and I really don't want to relive that experience. I'm afraid that once I start feeling the effects of the acid I'll associate all those previous feelings with the acid again and spiral down that hole. The biggest thing is the visuals. I've had a couple of bad trips (although I've had more good than bad), but the if I see for example the visuals of a tree's leaves morphing and twisting, I don't want to associate that with negativity or scariness, I want to be able to see it and think ""Oh cool, the leaf is twisting and morphing, isn't that awesome!"" Instead of thinking ""Man, that leave is twisting and morphing, that looks like a scary face if you look at it in that way. Scary faces are bad... now I can't stop seeing scary faces everywhere... oh god my trip is turning bad... aaarrrggghhh!!!!"" etc. I want to be so immersed in having a good time that I don't even question whether or not I'm having a good time. Can you guys help reassure me and give me some specific advice?",,False,self,t5_2swvc,False,,,True,t3_17x864,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/17x864/had_a_very_bad_trip_last_time_need_some/,

I'm writing here ""just in case"", and I'm doing it now, because later it may be difficult to write something with sense in it.

I had experience with acid and mescaline, but never mixed them. My highest dose of Acid was about 500ug, and of Mescaline ~600mg. Both cases with good friends.

This is my first time tripping alone on such high dose (I tripped alone on lower doses; I prefer to trip solo than with people), so you know, I want to be as safe as possible ;). I had few bad trips, or rather ""difficult"" experiences. Now I'm in a good place in my life, I'm happy and see future in bright colors :D.

1h ago I drank Mescaline (synthetic, ~300mg), in a minute I'm taking 5 tabs of LSD (JOR's for those informed :P).

If something won't be ok, I try to write here. But English is not my first language, and, you know... I'm on drugs (yay! :D), it may look strange. Just respond with something right, what you think will be good, what may calm me.

Honestly, I think everything will be fine, but I try to be well prepared for all scenarios ;).

Hope you all are safe and in good places in your lives. And even if not, don't give up. Keep going, keep trying, you'll succeed. [Live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z_Ys3BO_4M)

TL;DR: taking highest dose in my life, alone. Posting while I can, so when something won't be ok, I can do something.

Peace&amp;Love

PS: Mescaline is kicking in :D

**UPDATE:**

Ok, short update. It was the craziest trip I've ever had. While I was posting here some stupid messages I had a really great time. REALLY GREAT. But I had to pee. I live in a college dorm, so I needed to walk outside my room. It was very bad idea, and some bad things happened (I don't want to go into details, sorry). I lost my mind, didn't know who am I, where I am. Crazy. If the first part of the trip was one of best experiences in my life, then the second part was on of the worst moments of my life (seriously...). For some time after the trip I was totally depressed, but now I consider this trip as valuable experience. I think I should try 300ug LSD &amp; 300mg Mescaline at first, and some time after try bigger dosages. I learned that the hard way, heh :P.

In some way I'm even happy that this happened. I think I forgot how powerful psychedelics can be, I think I was too sure of my abilities to control them. And it's good to do some crazy things once in a while, in a time perspective it may be hilarious ;).

Some people would blame drugs for bad things they do. But this is stupid -- I know that it was my idea/fault to try such dosages. Next time I will think twice.

I recommend mixing LSD and Mescaline, but for the first time suggest lower dose of LSD.

I expect the numbers to settle, but we need to form a more concrete structure and policy. A day ago we were just a couple friends talking about drugs and the occasional psychonaut dropping in. Yesterday there a ton of activity and it got out of hand. Today we're working to establish a formal structure, policy, etc.

**Meta-tripsit talk should be brought to the ##TripSit channel, not #TripSit. Please join.**

---

**Rules**

/r/TripSit kindly asks you follow these rules. Rules will be added, removed and changed as this community grows. Infractions will be met with a warn/kick/ban system at the operator's discression. 

* **We have a strict no-trolling policy.** Though trolling can be fun, sarcasm is hard to detect over text and the effect is lost on people who are asking genuine questions expecting genuine answers.

* Be positive, don't be a dick. 

* Give factual information rather than speculation. Admitting you don't know something is difficult but appreciated. 

* Refrain from asking for vendors or how to go about purchasing online. The best way to find a vendor is to use google, safeorscam.com and a bit of luck. 

* We don't judge other people's choices here, we just give the best information and peace of mind.

---

**IRC Stuff**

In the future, I'm considering splitting into #tripsit, #drugs and #drugnerds. Comments on this idea are very welcome. 

**Voice** Regular in the chat channel who has proven to consistently give good advice and compassion. Voice is given to those who regularly show themselves to be good trip companions. These people are open to being PM'd when chat is idle and do their best to give people the help they need, even if it's just chit chatting about nothing. 

If you would like voice, there is only one requirement:

* Register your nickname with snoonet.com. I can't give voice unless you do, and it stops people from stealing your nickname. 

Registering is super easy and is done by saying ""/msg nickserv &lt;password&gt; &lt;email&gt;"". The nickserver will send you an email, and you have to copy/paste the verification code to nickserv. 

**Operator** Administrator of the channel. They help with day-to-day duities of making chat runs smoothly, banishing trolls and keep tripsit what it is meant to be: A positive environment. The goal is to have one operator active at all times that can be called upon to warn/kick/ban people if necessary and to address other concerns beyond tripsitting. 

Preqequisites:

* Same with voice: Be a good tripsitter and register your nickname

* Have an IRC client besides the snoonet.com webchat. I suggest X-Chat 2. 

Suggested:

* Get a 'cloak' from #help to disguise your IP. Do '/join #help' and ask for a cloak. 

**Moderator** A tripsit administrator responsible for helping things go smoothly. They are the people to talk to about meta-tripsit things. 

---

**TinyChat Stuff**

TinyChat turns out to be really awesome for media sharing. If you're looking for more than text based chat, please check out the tiny chat room [HERE](http://tinychat.com/rtripsit). TinyChat is much more feature-rich than snoonet, which has it's pros and cons depending on the situation and substance. For now we will be having both up until one gains dominance naturally. Some TinyChat features:

* Video and voice sharing

* Music broadcasting from YouTube or soundcloud links

* Colored fonts (woot!)

* No signup required

* User-name auto-complete with tab (IE: type tek and hit tab to auto-complete Teknos)

---

**Minecraft Server**

IP: minecraft.tripsit.me
Map: map.tripsit.me

Creative, flatmap, NPC village at spawn. 

Claim a house as yours and play around. 

------------------

**Tripsit.me domain suggestions**

We have a domain at tripsit.me. Currently it hosts a webchat widget that connets to the #Tripsit IRC channel. Future ideas are in the works, including a wiki and other resources for trippers.

---

**User flair and subreddit style suggestions**

I'm cool with enabling user flair if there is a desire to use it. We also would like a custom subreddit style that we can call our own. If you'd like to help designing the tripsit feel then comment below please.

**Edit 2** 10:01pm, I think I should mention I don't feel like eating someone's face, although these past few batches (the last two counting this one) I have felt hunger but cannot eat due to cottonmouth... In fact, I feel like eating but I don't want to because I feel full at the same time... BTW Drinking LOTS of water! To keep myself hydrated because I always pee a shit ton on stimulants. 10:03 end of edit

**Edit 4** Started at **10:32pm**- Time has flown by, which usually happens, I don't remember where the time has gone, it has felt like I have been sitting here for only 10 minutes or so... but I've been here since 9:15pm at the latest... Tweaking has pretty much stopped. Euphoria is not as strong, but still there, head still numb in the back of my head, love that feeling, and my heart isnt beating as fast. Still way up there and still wanting to talk... no one seems to want to :( **10:34pm** end of post (holy shit, it felt like a minute at most went by.... holy shit now **10:35pm** WTF?
**TL;DR** Time has flown, hours feel like minutes, tweeking has stopped at this point, euphoria has decreased, but still present, head numb, heart not beating as fast

**Edit 5** Not as strong anymore... still feel like talking... I have not moved since 9:00pm... Almost forgot to put the time **11:22pm**! Same symptoms, yet I have no more numbness, euphoria doesn't seem to be there... I'm going to try and get up and see what happens... Heart rate seems slightly elevated and head is slightly light... Still down for talking though... but I think my post was made at a bad time... everyone might be asleep since it's a weeknight :( I should also mention I was going to make an update at 10:45 but got side tracked by comments in another subreddit thread... Man... That's another thing, this thing makes you forget shit... end of post **11:25**
**TL;DR** Not moved in over two hours. Heart rate elevated... euphoria almost gone... bad time for post... no one wants to talk :( also it makes you forget shit too...

**Edit 6** Started at **11:27pm** So my tummy is growling... don't think I can eat, but my cotton mouth is basically gone... so I might try and eat some fruit or veggies... gotta be healthy amiright? End at **11:28pm** God dammit stop going so fast father time! No wait.. keep going fast... That way I don't hit the come down at like 1 xD


someone remind me to edit and make tl;dr for each edit! And bold times! (actually ended at **11:30pm**)

**Edit 7** Still gotta do the tl;dr... do it after this edit... **11:46pm**, I forgot to mention that an upset stomach is a symptom, and can last, I enjoy the feeling for some reason... also sweating, not lots of it but a little bit, like a shroom trip, my palms are the sweatiest and I can tell I need a shower... but I save that for the comedown... I always have an epiphany shower after a synthetic coke high :), to be honest I have figured out a lot of my problems in there, fixed my life for the better multiple times and always have one deep huge revelation about myself. Anyway sweating and queezy stomach are hardly noticeable... If you don't like the stomach feeling drink some carbonated water, it will expand your stomach and help you burp, **but the reason it does that is because the chemicals used are drying out your mucus**... aka the lining in your stomach that protects you from the acid... is it safe? Probably not... but hell even weed can kill you **if it is laced!** point is nothing is safe... I could go for some more right now... I'm not tired but I'm not very high any more... which always sucks... Probably hit the comedown soon. **End of edit 11:52pm**
**TL;DR** Sweating and stomach ache are a common symptom... I enjoy a nice shower on comedowns... comedowns suck and I'm **Headed for one pretty soon**

**Edit 8** Started at **11:53**, bold times, make tl;dr... this is gonna be a while... Finished editing bold times and tl;dr at **12:05am!** Today is Weds. the 13th... my lucky number!

**Edit 9** Started at **12:06** Just wanted to point out that the **first feeling I get off my first hit was within a minute**... probably less but I didn't think to time it when I took my very first hit of the day at 5:00pm. (A small hit to get me high, not a giant hit to get me FUCKED! Haha! Doing TL;DR was hard, I still would like conversation and feel that everything is important to say, first sign of comedown, losing my words, can't remember what I was about to do... It sucks even more than the high forgetting, because you remember there is something you want to do... it's on the tip of your mind... but you cannot remember it! End **12:10am**

**TL;DR** TL;DR's were hard to do because everything still seems so important, first sign of comedown is forgetting in middle of shit, it sucks... first hit gets you feeling in less than a minute! **Quick acting stimulant** 

**Edit 10** Holy shit! It's **12:25am** before I forget! I just got instantly high again! Like a roller coaster! I was down and then I'm back up! Not as high as I was but the euphoria is awesome! Talkative again! All thanks to ""Vladamir Putin"" on Omegle, talked to him and BAM! High again! End at **12:27am**

**TL;DR** Thanks to Vladmir Putin (Claimed to be on Omegle, a redditor none the less) talking to him and all of a sudden felt really high again!

**Edit 11** At **12:34am** I should mention that I had about 4 tabs open and they were all of the front page xD... I currently have 7 open tabs, only using 2... can't seem to close the other ones, they might be important later. End edit at **12:36am**

**Edit 12** At **12:51**... Blew my mind on Omegle talking to Vladmir, about the universe being a single organism...[Here is the screen shot!!!!]( http://i.imgur.com/MaP7a.png)! End **12:52**

**Edit 13** At **12:57** That peak wasnt too long... Still feeling okay, my eyes are starting to get tired, but I still feel a bit high, probably close to where I was at edit 9. Either that or I'm just all talked out... but I don't want to be, which is where the problem of saying no starts... at least for me, I always hate the come down, even though it's not that bad. End at **12:29am**

**Edit 14** Think I'm on comedown now.. It's **1:06**... forgot to mention the noise my phone makes... well makes me jump for text tone... I guess it's the sudden change in noise level. Don't really feel like talking... I think I could go to sleep... So I might try to lay down and close my eyes... we will see how this goes... not sure if I want to yet or not xD

That is another symptom of comedown, it makes you motivated yet not motivated to do something at the same time. It sucks. End at **1:09**... Also, I probably won't announce when I'm going to bed, because it will just happen, a thing I've noticed is on the come down you gotta let things happen, don't try and force it, go with the flow. **1:10**

**Edit 16** Final edit, I have reached the max word count... hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it! Come down will last a little longer, followed by most of the day in an afterglow. **1:46am**

At about 6 hours in after letting the LSD and continuous weed smoking sink in, we decided to hit the whippits. One of these girls, F, wasn't familiar with whippits but decided to join in. (I should also point out that this was her first experience with LSD ~200ug).

Some time after F took hit her first, she started acting strangely and looking around us bug-eyed saying 'stop it'. It took a few times of her saying it for most people to notice but sitting directly across from her I saw it straight away.

Not really knowing the girl well, I was hoping that her friend, S,  would recognise that she was freaking out and needed to be consoled.
F was whispering to S that ""we were all playing a trick on her"" and continued to look afraid. Instead of reassuring F, S started to go on about how 'she had the exact same feelings, and that we were sucking them into a vortex'.

This freaked me out because of standard fears that I could also lose my head on LSD but also because of how poorly the situation was being handled by her friend. Eventually the two calmed down but were obviously shaken by the experience. 

However, watching something like that happen plunged me into fight or flight mode and all I could stop thinking about was what had just happened. Eventually I decided to remove myself from the group and went to lie down on a bed with Pink Floyd.
I spent the remainder of my trip thinking about how shitty it was handled by S considering she was supposed to be more experienced.

This happened last week but I wanted to talk to you guys about it to get some input from others.

So last weekend I was tripping with three of my friends on acid, I had 4 hits, my previous highest dose I had was 3 hits.  Now everything was going great for about 3 to 5 hours, the visuals were amazing and I was having a great time, as was everyone else.  But at some point, I decided to go into my bathroom to check something out.  I was looking around my bathroom at the visuals and then all of the sudden I saw a hallucination of (I'm going to try my best to describe this but to be honest I'm not 100% sure what it was) some kind of green matter shoot out from my closet door in front of me across the floor.  As it shot out across the floor it also made a noise (like a deck of cards being shuffled).  The best way I can describe this is as a stream of a green flake-like substance that grossed me out when I saw it (Idk why, thats just the connotations it was putting off to me).  Now as I said it looked gross to me, and I had never seen an actual hallucination like this so it spooked me a little bit and I froze just standing there where I saw it happen.  Then not 2 seconds later the same hallucination shot at my face, and that I was it, I freaked the fuck out. I ending up running out of my room and knocking some shit over.  I have never had a feeling of terror like that come over my body.  The trip pretty much ended with my friends comforting me and talking me down the rest of the trip.

TL;DR: Have any of you had a visual/hallucination while tripping that scared you and lead you to a bad trip? Thats what happened to me and I don't want this to be a problem the future times I trip, should I avoid the place where the hallucination took place? or should I be ok, just go into my future trips with a calm, meditative mindset telling myself that there is no reason to fear my last trip (which is what I was thinking).

But then I thought of my cell phone which is the worst possible thing you can do but there was no turning back from there. My mom just got addmitted as an in patiant last night and I just wanted a day/night to myself with everything thats going on because everyone relies on me because im the oldest (21).
And I also wanted to have a day away from my fiance because she was bugging the shit out of me and i couldnt take all the stress so I thought itd be nice to take a couple tabs and put my mind at ease, which it did but not for long. When I thought of my phone i suddenly thought of any family members trying to contact me with anything thats been going on and I just kept getting the feeling that I let someone down or that someone was waiting for me.

I finally picked up my phone maybe 5-6 hours into the trip and I have i think it said 48 missed called from my fiance which sent me into an immediate panic attack and she was getting at me because she thought i was ignoring her when i really just put my phone aside because I dont like having it while I trip. Anyway she was getting on me telling me i treat her like shit and that I put an acid trip before her.

Then I sat and thought for a little, im 21 and I got money from a bad car accident that I broke my back in and iv been living off that money shamefully for 2 years. I just sat there looking at my life so fucking ashamed of myself. I have no diploma i really dont have anything but a lawsuit. After everything came into perspective i just started bawling tears for a good 20 minutes and after I let it out I felt like I knew what had to be done and I know i could fight thru it.......it was one hell of a trip, definitely not a recreational trip tho.

Welp, just when I thought I had shit under control I tried to take things to a new level. selfishly I smoked a bowl of fine herb.  when I heard new level it sounded like something I could manage with the good people of tripsit but boy was I wrong.I want to thank CeleryMan|Hydro, tripbot, whoami|vyvanse.  When all language goes out the door its really fucking hard to maintain reality, especially where every thing I see is one damn creepy ass cartoon land image of gary busey and his huge teeth. It was like everything god the fat ass wester cartoon version and I was stuck in my head.  Somehow these guys helped me get over it while I became momentarily schizophrenic. Possibly the scariest moment of my life no doubt, shooting stars were beautiful, but weed, why weed did you have to go and make everything so bat shit crazy? Anyways, yall were great for tripping and definitely blew my mind I felt like that guy from adventure time until I finally went to bed.  I don't think I would try handling this alone ever again though as I have successfully scared the fucking shit out of my self with this combination, it would have been great to learn things about myself if my whole world werent a though loop.  I kept interpreting how society would view me, with my thoughts attacking me, then tried to stop thinking that as it was stupid and contributing to the problem, and so many odd different things by god.  Also this thing was tough to get used to.  For a while it didn't feel like I was the only one being helped.  It felt like because so many people where on the web that I was being bombarded with messages, I had no choice but to keep typing as reading was also pretty impossible. Living in the shadows is truly weird as fuck and scary as hell. Well thanks guys, I guess this just goes as a psa of the effects of lsd and how you may not be ready for it, even though you had taken a greater dose previously and managed, the setting and timing is everything.  It was the first trip at night and it was truly terrifying from any point after the weed.  My vocab went haywire and I was trying to think of everything at once and it all came out in my head as gibberish but you guys helped me get out of the shit hole I dug myself into soI am greatful for this opportunity of sharing last night with yall.  I felt very weirdly connected.  if you have any questions about the experience I could share

It's a beautiful day here in England for once. It hit about 32C and the sky is so clear! A rarity. So it seems only fitting that I round off the day with a hopefully nice lucy trip.

Little backstory: I've 'tripped' on 'lsd' about 3 times in all. However, I'm not sure that it actually was LSD. The trips were mostly fun (apart from one bad one) but the tabs were bitter and it was super heavy on me. It also took around 2-3 hours to kick in each time making me believe it may have been DOB. But a close friend managed to find a dealer that supplies microdots. This stuff has been tested and it's the real deal. I've got 10 microdots in total and I'm taking my first one in about half an hour.

What should I expect? Any tips? I've got a pretty good playlist but I think I need some more songs. I've got the entire discographies of both the Beatles and Pink Floyd and I've also picked up Shpongles album 'Are you Shpongled?' I've only listened to two songs off it and my favourite was 'Divine moments of truth' and just listening to it takes me back to my first visual hallucinations on what I thought was LSD. It is an AMAZING song. Any suggestions for similar music that'll help me have a good trip?

I'm doing it alone in my room because I often feel content on my own and I have prepared properly with food,drink,music and movies. I'm a little nervous of a bad trip, but I don't think the dose I'm taking is enough to really send me into something I can't deal with. The stuff last time made my teeth hurt loads and that wasn't fun.

Reddit is soon to be deploying an integrated chat room for every subreddit that runs on the snoonet.com IRC network.

Due to instantaneous communication, this makes /tripsit obsolete.

My option was to remove all trip-reports and calls for help from the sub and start posting calming pictures, soothing sounds, chill music and relaxing stuff like that.

To help assist #tripsit, we are going to set up an IRC bot that responds to commands and brings back useful information. 

/tripsit has new mods. Modding tripsit isnt really a hard job at this point, but it's good to have the OP's in the channel tied to the subreddit.

1335819068.0,6,self.TripSit,t0c4h,Experienced Tripper. Last time I heard voices mocking me when I did nitrous. Time for a break!,8,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/t0c4h/experienced_tripper_last_time_i_heard_voices/,"So... I've been tripping on and off for about 6 or 7 years. I've done it well over 100 times. It's been mostly acid, when we could find it. And mushrooms a while back, I used to pick them from cow fields and even grew my own for a while. When we find acid, we would always buy in large quantities so our group could stock up for a little while. Around the beginning of this year we were sold what I'm pretty sure was 25i-nbome, 150 hits of it. We ended up figuring out that we needed to put it between our gums and our cheeks, and actually had a lot of fun trips with it. We even bought more of it from a more reliable source.

This year we also started adding nitrous to the party. I've had some of the most intense, awesome experiences while tripping and doing nitrous, on acid and nbome. I've seen patterned color blobs splat on the walls to the beat of the music. I've felt the music touching my face and a sense of sitting in a pool of water. I've felt it rain inside. I've had beautiful epiphanies, only to mostly forget them by the time I come back to reality. Generally awesome stuff going on! We've gotten up to about 50 chargers a night per person when tripping. 

One night, when we had taken three week break from nbome, we decided to go hard and take 5 hits at once. We took a balloon when we started coming up. And I saw this pink goo on my hand. It was the first time I'd ever actually seen shit that wasn't there. It kind of scared me. Then I started seeing weird hideous faces, zombies coming out of the floor grabbing me. There were always people in my peripheral vision. I didn't do anymore balloons for a while that night, but I kept seeing and hearing crazy shit. This was my first bad trip and it pretty much lasted the entire time. 

I worked past that the next few trips and was more able to control my fear. We kept on tripping and having fun. I'd still sometimes get the feeling that there were people or dogs in the shadows, filling up the room wherever I couldn't see. But it wasn't that bad.

This last weekend we had some real acid for the first time since January. We'd had so much nbome lately that I think we all forgot what acid was like. We were expecting a happier trip full of laughs. Colors were more vivid and sharp, but I got less fractaling and visual hallucinations. The mindfuck seemed more intense. And it lasted at least twice as long as nbome. When it started coming on pretty strong, I got that feeling that there might be something in the shadows. But I didn't see anything like nbome. We were doing balloons and jamming awesome music in my buddies theater room. I noticed that when I did a balloon I would hear some voices. At first they seemed to be singing along with the music, horribly, almost mocking it. It was kinda funny actually. Then I saw a black guy in the visualizer, it was really there, I'd seen it before. But it seemed to kinda go with the music at the time. I laughed and said ""Ha! Look at the black guy!"". The voice quickly replied ""Oh yea a fucking black guy huh?!"" Kinda talking shit! I thought What The Fuck?!

Several times I would hear the voices come when I took in the balloon. It mostly wasn't bad, and there was also really cool shit going on at the same time, so I kept doing them. At one point, I was sitting back with my wife and her friend on the couch, the voices got really loud and just really seemed to be mocking me and my friends. I yelled something back at them like ""Shut up! Fuck you!"". And they would yell back at me again. ""Oh yea, What?!"" The girls kinda looked at me like I was crazy, and I finally told them about the voices I was hearing. They calmed me down and I felt better again. 

I remember one time hearing the sound of an old radio. The dial was turning through the stations and it was mostly talk radio chatter, sounding almost like hunter s thompson rambling. I actually enjoyed that. I think it may have been my mind trying to block out the voices. Another time I felt the room spin and I couldn't recognize a friend who had just come back into the room. The room turned brown and he looked like a dirty american indian type person(not because indians are dirty, just because he had dirt on him). I yelled ""Who the fuck are you?!"" at him. He turned to look at me, and the room changed back to normal colors and I realized it was just my friend. I felt kind of bad for yelling at him. But we laughed it off anyway.

Finally, the last balloon I did. I got comfy on the couch by my wife again. She warned me before hand, ""No yelling at people this time!"". I think this put the idea back in my head about the voices. I breathed in the nitrous and they came back again. We would call balloons, baroons, just because it was something we thought was funny. The voice got really loud and said ""Barooooons!"" in a evil mocking way and started cackling maniacally. It was finally too much. I felt the chill of fear throughout my entire body. I yelled at it again. ""FUCK YOU!! STOOOPP!!"". I threw the rest of my balloon across the room and curled up on my wife. I decided I didn't need anymore nitrous if I was going to have to put up with that shit. We watched Bio-Dome, which was funny as hell, and I felt better. I still couldn't sleep for hours. I laid awake just pondering what the fuck had happened that night. 

So I've decided we all need a good long break from tripping. My friends seem to be going too hard with the balloons. I saw one of them, who seems to get especially carried away, squeezing the balloon into his lungs. I don't get that. Was he trying to get as much in as he possibly could? Simply inhaling is enough for me. Another kept repeatedly bringing the air in and out of the balloon. He eventually passed out from doing it, which we've all done before. It's just a sign that we need to slow it down. I thought to myself... ""Is this what we've become?""

I'm also wondering if I can ever enjoy tripping and doing nitrous again. Will it always bring these mocking voices? Acid is my favorite drug. I've always loved doing it, and especially with the nitrous. But if I have to put up with that shit every time, then it's just not worth it. I think it's really just all in my head. If I think I'm going to hear them, then I probably will. I will probably take a good break for a while, and maybe try again without the nitrous first. I've always been the most experienced of the group, always able to hold my shit together. I feel paranoid even afterward sometimes in dark rooms or when I close my eyes. Although that seems to be going away quickly with time. 

Maybe this was just my first bad acid trip. I had learned to deal with bad trips on nbome. Acid seemed to bring more auditory hallucinations than visual. I guess I just wanted to get this out and tell some people. I've heard people claim that bad trips aren't real or that you never actually see shit that's not there. Those people are just inexperienced and naive. Anything can happen to anyone. I used to be one of those people that thought it could never happen to me.

I was at a large music festival a few weekends ago, and was having the time of my life, in general. I met up with a friend who was going with a date he had met not long before, and they decided to both take mushrooms - however, she ended up ditching him and having her own adventures, and I ended up with him.

My friend is not experienced with drugs, but had one positive experience on a minor amount of mushrooms and decided to take a full eighth.  His dissonance with the environment was obvious - he had been somewhat mentally isolated from the experiences of other people at the event and was fairly inexperienced at festival culture in general.

This became relevant when he started having a bad trip - I was showing him the sights to see (glowing poi/hoop spinners, dancers, etc.) at a tycho concert and he became overwhelmed, and had to go to the bathroom which was of course an arduous process going through lines at the portapotty, and as he started having a worse and worse time I quenched his trip (and my experience in general) by taking him back to camp and talking to him for most of the rest of the night.

I am concerned because I wish, for the sake of his experience, that I could have made him accept his surroundings, perhaps by finding a quiet corner and gradually warming him up to the entire concert experience.  I also feel bad because we were doing some walking to get from one place to another, and I think he really didn't like doing this and got overwhelmed, so I feel partially responsible. I also would have liked to have had a full night out myself, although I would of course give that up for a friend in need if that need is unavoidable. I know I shouldn't be, but internally, I am irritated at my friend's flippancy with drugs (he is known for taking too many drugs at a time, disregarded most of my advice on how to have a good trip/to use moderation, has known anxiety issues, and didn't thank me for taking care of him) in that I could have had a better time myself. I know  I have to let go of this, but I want to properly process what happened first.

In short, are bad trips reversible? Once the overwhelming disconnect from reality kicks in, can one go back to being in a positive and happy state, or is it best to neutralize the whole experience back to safety and a non-tripping state? I was good at doing the latter, but I wish dearly I could have done the former. I just don't know how possible it is.

I'm finding myself in a bit of a sticky situation and I think I need some advice on what to do. To begin, my brother and I have a rough past and never really got along. I know many of you might say, ""Oh, brothers are like that,"" or something, but this is different. He used to bully and torment me every chance he got and I never fought back out of a fear of escalating things. This went on for years and has had a negative impact on my social life.

But recently he seems to have changed for the most part. He smokes weed every chance he gets, and I think he's let it become his life, mainly because it's the only thing that keeps him calm. Without it, he goes back to depression and fits of anger. However, since he started smoking, he's noticeably friendlier and happier. He's still an asshole though.

In one of our conversations I let it slip that I had done acid in the past year, and now he wants to trip with me. I am not sure this is such a good idea, especially since he strikes me as the kind of person who would just fuck around with psychedelic drugs and do something irresponsible. For example, he robo-tripped at work the last time I was home (he works at Burger King). When he came back, he told me it was kind of a bad trip; he was depressed and worried the whole time. 

Anyway, I'm not sure about tripping with him, mainly because I don't know how he would react to it (he's only done Robitussin and MDMA), and I don't know how I would react to him while tripping. Even when sober, I find him to be reckless, irresponsible, and above all, annoying. I also never really felt like I could trust him.

I've considered that maybe tripping together would better help us understand each other and work out our problems, but I'm still worried that it would be a bad experience.

What does r/Tripsit think?

As the first order of business, we’ve decided to start posting weekly updates on the tripsit.me site, starting with this more general update, so we can give everyone more of an idea of what’s going on behind the scenes and let people know about any important changes or new goings on in our network.

**Street Team**

We’re currently looking at moving into the real life with our operations, providing real-life trip sitting support around the globe at various festivals and similar functions just like we do every day online – a ‘street team.’ We’ll eventually have people go to various festivals under the TripSit banner (for perhaps free or discount-entry) to help people out and spread the word, giving out free bottles of water and the like. We are working on getting some stickers and t-shirts for people to use to help spread the word; if you are going to a festival this summer please send a modmail or message an admin so we can put you on a contact list to receive free merchandise to give out.

If you have experience in graphic design, have any festival contacts or just feel like this is the kind of thing you’d really like to help out with, then send a modmail or contact the TripSit team in our admin IRC channel #tripsit.me to get involved!

**Donations and Merchandise**

We’re currently collecting money for the development of our street-team project – you can help us out by either donating in return for prime, fancy TripSit merchandise [here](http://www.gofundme.com/tripsit), or at this bitcoin address: *1EDqf32gw73tc1WtgdT2FymfmDN4RyC9RN*.


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/rY0pTtN.jpg) are our first sticker designs, printed on 2 x 3.5 inch rectangle-cut glossy/silk sticker, which you get ten of in return for donating $10 or more. If you donate $30, you will receive stickers along with a TripSit [t-shirt](http://i.imgur.com/TQSTBbX.jpg) in a size of your choice. With $50 or more, you will receive a custom TripSit tee designed by our team (add your IRC nick or a chemical symbol of your choice).

**#drugs Updates**

#drugs is the largest component of our network, and has seen huge growth over the last couple of months! This is great, and I personally love that there’s a nice place for all members of our community to enjoy general chat and make friends with people who share similar interests and values.

However, the size of #drugs also means that it can be a little hard to moderate and as such it sees some deviation in quality. We’d like to remind all users that you can help #drugs be the place you want it to by letting the administrators know what’s going on. Use the ‘~report’ command in PM to tripbot to report either good or bad behaviour you see from other users in #drugs to the administrators.

Also, remember that TripSit has many other resources available – if you’re a registered user on IRC then you can join the #DrugsVIP channel for slower but perhaps more involved chat, and we’re always encouraging people to join our web-based social networking site Nexus. Also, if you’re in the mind for helping people out or answering questions trip sitting and generally promoting harm reduction with drug use then head on over to #tripsit.

**Nexus Updates**

We’re seeing slow but steady growth on our Nexus social network, with lots of valuable content and discussion happening in various formats. Visit us [here](http://nexus.tripsit.me/) to join in and help us grow!

**Future**

We’re enjoying a nice surge in popularity at the moment and we’re excited about working on expanding the TripSit project world-wide, supporting the cause for harm reduction better and more widely than ever before. Stay tuned for more updates!

1358459510.0,5,self.TripSit,16rylq,Going to try mushrooms for the first time this weekend. Any advice?,7,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TripSit/comments/16rylq/going_to_try_mushrooms_for_the_first_time_this/,"Me and two friends of mine (good friends, but not super good friends - both girls, I'm a guy) are planning on shrooming this weekend - one of them has already done it multiple times before, the other hasn't (and neither have I). I just wanted to see if the more seasoned shroomers had any advice for me going into this - this will be my first psychedelic experience (unless if you count weed / MDMA as psychedelic), but I'm not too worried about a bad trip, since I'm a pretty mentally stable and happy / healthy person, but it's still in the back of my mind - anything I should do to prevent a bad experience? Should we have the experienced one sit for us, or is it okay if she shrooms with us too?

We're going to be going on a hike and collecting the shrooms in the wilderness - I think we're mostly going to see panaeolus cambodgeniensis, growing on cow turds (we'll be doing the hike on north shore oahu). My other friend had recommended just eating them as you hike (apparently he's done the same hike we're about to do), but i'm kind of wary of doing that, even though I'm fairly familiar with what the right ones look like. I guess I just don't want to take any chances of eating a bad mushroom - but according to him, as long as you know what to look for and damage the stem to make sure it bleeds purple-ish, you're fine.

What are your thoughts / recommendations? Is it better to take them home to identify them, dry them, etc? I'm thinking that if I do eat them on the trail I'm going to bring along my portable scale to make sure I don't take too much (I'm thinking I'm gunna aim for 2.5 grams). Also, should we eat the shrooms so that by the time they kick in we're out in nature on the hike, or are we likely to have a better time letting them kick in once we get home and have couches to sit on and the comforts / entertainments of a house etc.? Any other general advice you all would have?

Turns out that friend was a lighter and it turns out that I was a lighter too, and I realized this and started laughing a bunch. Then suddenly some awareness came around me and I realized I was just holding two lighters, and was not myself a lighter at all. I laughed some more and started mashing the lighters together, dancing to the music that turned out to be coming from a headset playing mum's ""Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today is Ok"" album. Remembered that I had smoked some salvia. In front of me was a gate that was opening and closing letting in and out light. I realized it was my legs, moving nervously, opening and closing. I stood up, feeling as though I had waken up from a dream, only to be very dizzy and I sat back down. 

The 'trip' part of this (however brief and silly it was) is over, and it wasn't traumatic or terrifying. I was just alarmed to wake up from it and realize how much of a dream it was like. I was definitely talking throughout it, but can't remember what I was saying. Also am by myself, which I know isn't the best idea but I've been on some scary trips alone and come out ok. Never salvia though. I started this post because I was worried I would fall back asleep and have a less neutral dream (something more terrifying), but at this point I realize the trip is done and I'm just waiting for the physical effects to wear off. Clearly my brain isn't all back yet though, because I had a confusing time (and still am) typing all this. Grammar be damned I guess.

No more games. No shows or movies. We discovered the gospel of classic rock on mushrooms, interpreted by the itunes visualizer. First we listened to Led Zeppelin IV. Then came Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon. Then a Doors album. We dipped through a dubset playlist. 

It was an epic journey. Euphoric. I can't wait to go again. Turn up the classics and full screen your visualizer, it was so simple and perfect.

I was given something which was ""rumored"" to be ALD-52 aka orange sunshine, but could have been RC. It was very lucid and gentle. Stacked on 1.5g or homegrown mushroom extract in chocolate. Fantastic night!

I'm deliberating as whether to add mescaline too, as I have already taken psilocybin extract = to a couple grams of the aforementioned strains of mushroom. Good idea? Bad? I will have to eat the mescaline soon, if at all. And if I take that too, I may need some good people to talk to.

My main concern is my stomach as it doesnt like syrup very much, so if I feel nauseous(cant spell) then I will stop. 
I've done DXM HBr many times, but never poly. From what I've heard it's twice the duration, half the effects. So I will be having 1800mg dxm poly, at the equivelent of 900mg, which is a high third plateau. 

I have all my needs accounted for, food, water, a large pot incase I vomit, and my laptop and phone with internet connection. 

I will try and update as much as possible and I would love to talk to people while I'm tripping! 

I took the first bottle 1 hour and 20 minutes ago. So I'm at +1:20 at 8:30am pacific time.

**EDIT - TRIP REPORT** Ok, Well let see.
At around 7am, I had my first 5oz bottle of Delsym(900mg DXM-p) DXM-p is half as intense, but twice as long duration, so this was the equivelent of me having 450mg HBr. It's worth noting I hit 3rd Plateau at 450-500mg. 
At 7:30am, I went for a bike ride to the local park, 10 minutes away. I was on the swings for about 10 minutes. At about 8am, I noticed I was getting visuals, so I decided I had to leave now, before I got the robowalk. I had enough balance to ride my bike with ease. Though I felt weird. I was getting that buzzy sensation. I got into my house at about 8:15am, and some of my housemates were up in the living room. I had hi, and promptly grabbed a large bottle of juice and a piece of bread. I went into my room, put up a heavy box against the door, locked it, and settled in on my bed. I had my laptop, phone, a few large water bottles, my juice, other DXM, and some snacks in arms reach. I had a little bit of nausea, but not bad. It just mostly felt weird having that syrupy delsym in my stomach. At around 9:15, I poured the 2nd bottle of Delsym into a cup. I drank half of it.

&gt;yee
&gt;wake up its teh firr of the month. bone thugs. 
&gt;fuck it is i2 42

so I have to try and remember the rest and put it into words. the wierd numbers you keep seeing are the time (i242 = 12:42pm, 1119 = 11:19am, etc)



From about 10am-2pm was utter and complete chaos. I have been to the third plateau quite a few times, and this was far beyond it. The first time I've reached the 4th plateau. I only weigh about 130-135 pounds, and after looking over, the amount I took definitely put me in that range. Time had ceased to exist. Nothing really seemed to matter. I was barely aware that I was tripping. I spent an eternity trying to figure out how to put on Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii. I kept getting stuck at the menu screen where I select the language. Then there's the fact that the whole first minute of the video is black with just a single kick drum beat. Somewhere along the line my external hard drive disconnected, so I finally I ended up opening it on YouTube. The band members looked like caricatures, and they seemed to put extremely little effort into their playing. The music was unrecognizable, despite me having heard it a million times. I saw myself just float by the music. I kept pausing and exiting the video. YouTube has a new feature it seems, where it will save your spot on a video if you exit the window. Very helpful. 

I kept opening Facebook, but I knew enough to know that this was a bad idea, so I kept closing it. I couldn't make sense of anything anyways. My own girlfriend of 2 years, her pictures were unrecognizable to me. I knew it was her, but there was absolutely no recognition. She looked alien to me. 

At one point I had to piss. This, I have no idea how I managed. I have housemates, so I didn't want to leave my room, since they didn't know I was tripping. I somehow managed to get on my knees and piss into an empty Mt Dew bottle I hadn't recycled yet. I didn't spill. I don't know how...but, ok. 

At around 2pm, I had noticed I had about half of a 4oz bottle of Robitussin lying around, which I promptly chugged. All this did was increase the duration of the undesirable affects, and actually put me very damn close to putting myself into Plateau Sigma, which I feel I just barely missed hitting. If that was a full 4oz bottle, or more, I am damn sure I would have hit it. I'm glad I didn't have more though. I put in 2 fucking grams of DXM into my body that day already as it was, and I'm sure my liver and kidneys hate me right now. I won't be putting any DXM into my body for a long time. 

There isn't really anything else of note I can think of. I somehow managed to throw random comments on Reddit every now and then. I saw Adam Savage's AMA open, and I was absolutely confused to death, not to mention I couldn't read more than a few words at a time with huge effort. It was a great read this morning though :)


All in all, I wouldn't recommend this much DXM to anyone. Only go this far at your own risk. It was super intense. It's a huge load on the body as well. My heart rate was around 120-150bpm the entire time. Even today it's still a bit elevated despite my resting, it's at around 80bpm(usually it's at around 65). 
If you wish to go this far, make sure you're prepared. Shut your damn phone off(my phone ran out of minutes the day before, which was perfect timing really), have some food and water nearby, and lock yourself in your room.

The plan at first was to only take 1 hit of what I was told is LSD (who really knows these days). But they gave me an extra birthday hit. I told them I'd rather test the waters with just one, but they peer pressured me into taking both of them. I'm younger than all of the people that we were with and so I kinda felt like a pussy turning it down. This was a very bad mistake. I don't know how long I sat in my chair until I stood up wide eyed and said ""Dude it hit me."" And then ran to the bathroom and vomited up whatever was in my stomach. And from that point on I just started tripping SOO hard. And it wasn't fun at all for me cause we were with people I didn't know, in a house I didn't know, listening to like feed me and borgore and other hard dubstep. I don't like techno music in general. and It just gave me awful vibes. Plus I had this overwhelming anxiety/guilt about vomiting. I felt so bad for making a mess (I cleaned it up though) and I felt bad for making myself look like a dumbass by taking too much.  I just had the worst trip. Like I can't honestly tell you what was wrong but I was just not okay. I kept trying to move and stuff, like go outside or change rooms. but nothing helped. I ended up getting a huge blanket and just curling up in it and waiting until the waves passed. And during the time I was wrapped up in that blanket on the floor I honestly thought I had lost myself. I just kept thinking that I had wandered so far from my right mind that I would never return. that I would be stuck floating in this semi-black and continuous space that my mind had put me in. And thoughts of the like. It was AWFUL. I was tripping so hard that I couldn't even talk because I knew whatever I tried saying would never come out as a coherent sentence.  Eventually I got passed the first wave and managed to get up and actually speak. And things got better from there, but I will never forget the legitimate terror I experienced while in my little ""cocoon."" I don't know whether I vomited cause I hadn't eaten very much that day (just some popcorn and a shake) or because it was too much for me.

I don't need help, it's not *that* big a dose, and I've taken larger doses while experimenting with the recreational side of stims and everything went okay. I'm not concerned about the drug itself, I just need to rant about stuff (pre-edit: much of which is only tangentially related. oops.).

Sometimes I take more than the prescribed amount if I *really* need to focus on something *really* important. Like studying for final exams. *Hint hint guess why I'm having issues*.

In retrospect, taking a larger-than-normal dose to end a t-break is *obviously* a bad idea. Don't know what I was thinking. Oh, right, ""shit, gotta study, better take extra today"". So it's more what I *wasn't* thinking. Oh well, I can't really blame anyone but myself, and even that is sketchy; of *course* I'd do something impulsive like that, I've been off my meds for a while. But then the being off my meds is *definitely* my fault. ugh.

Anyway, I'm not really sure what it *is* that I'm feeling at the moment. Frustration? Irritation? Disappointment? It is a weird sort of slightly-unhappy feeling, but a really strong one. It's weird, because it's a really strong feeling, but the actual emotion I'm feeling *isn't* strong. Whatever. Not important.

Hmm, yeah, I think it is some sort of frustration. Frustration at the fact that I am compelled to go and communicate with EVERYTHING instead of studying like I had planned. But maybe there are other emotions mixed in there, too. I don't know, but I have more important things to be thinking about. Like Calculus. Ugh. Why did this exam have to be in the *first possible time slot*? I've *never* had to take an exam at 8am on the Friday before finals week proper. At most, one that evening, but usually, I've had an extended reading weekend instead of just reading day on Thursday.

Ugh, and I've had to spend so much time today doing *other* stuff, too, and it's kept me away from studying. It's really a good thing I got my meds back, because it really helped me get all that stuff *done* instead of putting it off *even further* than I've already done, but I just feel like I don't have enough time to do all the things I need to do right now.

...oh boy, I *really* went off there. That is one rock-solid wall-O-text right there. Anyway, I have already spent *far* too long writing and editing this post instead of studying. Fucking speed, man.

Currently ingesting 21 mg 2c-e + 7.5 mg 2c-i dissolved in ginger ale (hopefully to help with nausea).

30 min ago I took a regular strength benadryl, a multivitamin, and a 100mg 5-htp pill. About a min ago when I started drinking the 2c concoction I also had a second benadryl (I am a 200 lb 6'1"" male), a gingko biloba pill, and a vinpocetine.

Theoretically, all of these should help with the body load in some way, except the 5-htp which should keep seratonin levels good. Multivitamin has magnesium, the gingko and vinpocetine are vasodilators, the benadryl I have heard many times is good for the nausea and for the body load. 

Using these, I have definitely lessened the body load but it's still gotten to annoying levels in the past even with all the ""help"" from these pills. What usually happens with 2c-e is the first 2-3 hours are pretty terrible and then the rest is pure MAGIC. I tried to add in some 2c-i because it's ""milder"" but I have never really liked it by itself, so I only added a bit in.

I should also mention that I have the following on hand... weed (which I always smoke during a trip), 5f-ur-144 (pretty much concentrated cannabinoid powder), ket, mxe, dxm, nitrous, and dmt. Would any of these help out to dissipate all the weird ""energy"" and tension that the 2c-e gives me. 

It should also be noted that 2c-b I absolutely LOVE and gives me almost no body load at all, and when it does it's enjoyable. 2c-e is a different beast though. I want those cool, moving visuals (2cb gives me bright cool colors and cartoon vision but not ""visuals"") without the head fuck of LSD or shrooms. 2c's let me think so clearly I can even reddit with ease while on 'em.

Any ideas on what can help?  

Also, anyone care to chat as I begin my journey? If anyone has any questions for me too.. AMA lol. 

I have a lot of good music as well as some good trip movies (LOTR and the hobbit, harry potters, speed racer, enter the void, others), plus two very cuddly dogs (german shepherd and great dane) to cuddle with.

So I have a brief reprieve from my generally soul-grinding, very interesting but kind of emotionally draining life (emergency medicine.)

So, naturally, I'm going to take a bunch of drugs.  There's a 120mcg tab of LSD sitting on my tongue right now.  I've never taken acid and understand this to be a lowish dose.

I also have a bag of mushrooms sitting here, with more than enough to blast me into outer space.  I am, shall we say, mildly experienced with shrooms, but have never failed to have anything less than an awesome time on them.

My original plan was just to eat a bunch of shrooms, but then I decided, why not try this LSD?

Any suggestions on what to expect?  How many mushrooms should I eat?  I like a nice 3.5g trip normally, but am unsure how to dose in conjunction with the acid.

In a safe environment, have plenty of anti-anxiety and anti-nausea meds on hand, and looking to get pretty blasted.  Not so worried about my own psyche turning on me, rather than simple unpleasant physical effects.

Any input, friends?

Pleased to meet all of you. I have been interested in psychochems for around 6 years now. I've tried all sorts: cannabis, DXM, LSD, salvia, Vicodin with APAP removed, Adderall, and a host of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. I've recently discovered nootropics, and the results have been astounding. I've currently been clean from all drugs except for 100 mg Pristiq, 30 mg Remeron, 20 mg Adderall XR,  250 mg Pramiracetam, 200 mg sulbutiamine, 1 gram cpd choline, a high-potency fish oil supplement, and a multivitamin. My research in nootropics has led me to believe that when taken with psychedelics, the experience will be incredible because of the increase in blood flow and increase in communication between the left and right brain via the Corpus Callosum.

at 2:30 I decided to smoke a j with much less than a dime of weed (around .1 g) After that, I felt an insane increase in heart rate and I assumed I was about to trip. 

I went outside and sat in the park, went to the bookstore as well. That was about for 2 hours. Felt like a really intense weed high, so I assumed it could not have been that little weed I smoked.

Anyway, its been almost 3 hours since I smoked now, but I still feel like I have a weed high that would be too much for that little amount of weed that I smoked. Is there something holding me back from having a full on trip, or could this weed just be getting me high as hell? 

NOTE: I smoke weed pretty frequently, and I haven't gotten this high off of a J in a while, last time I smoked was last Friday)

I would like to know all of your opinions of what we can do to improve the group or network sites. I also would like to offer all of you to join us and become one of the team. If you believe you have something to offer other tripsitters, skills est, then there is a good chance you do. Introduce yourself here or come chat with us on the chat channel #tripsit.me to talk to other team members. 

Also new links will start to show themselves on the sidebar of this subreddit as I try to fix things up a bit. They all belong to the tripsit.me network which is expanding every day. 

I hope we can improve this subreddit into a very active and tight community. I am glad to see you all here and hope that you will help me in creating something unique.
