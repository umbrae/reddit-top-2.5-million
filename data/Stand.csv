1366604766.0,2305,self.Stand,1cufnx,Official Unofficial CISPA Discussion Thread.,3921,1616,1304,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cufnx/official_unofficial_cispa_discussion_thread/,"**What is going on?**

[CISPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Intelligence_Sharing_and_Protection_Act), or The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act,
is a bill that has just passed the House of Representitives and is [currently working its way through the Senate](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr624).
If you don't remember this bill from [last year's blackout](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/05/cispa-and-cybersecurity-bills-are.html); you're in luck, because it's been reintroduced! 

In order to raise awareness for this legislation, many subreddits are blacking out and trying to do their part.

**Okay, but what does it do and why should I care?**

First of all, [here is the complete text](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr624/text). Please take the time to actually read it. It is important to be fully informed as there is a lot of misinformation about the purpose of this bill. Relax, it's not as long as you think it is.

CISPA is a bill focused on Cyber Security. It's meant to address growing concerns for Cyber threats and give protection to businesses who handle your personal information. The number one threat to your personal information is malicious attackers, and it costs much more to defend from attacks than to initiate them. CISPA puts more tools in businesses' hands, but it brings into the question of security vs privacy.

*So, what exactly is a Cyber Threat?*

(A) IN GENERAL- The term ‘cyber threat information’ means information directly pertaining to--

    (i) a vulnerability of a system or network of a government or private entity;

    (ii) a threat to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a system or network of a government or private entity or any information stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network;

    (iii) efforts to deny access to or degrade, disrupt, or destroy a system or network of a government or private entity; or

    (iv) efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity, including to gain such unauthorized access for the purpose of exfiltrating information stored on, processed on, or transiting a system or network of a government or private entity.

(B) EXCLUSION- Such term does not include information pertaining to efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity that solely involve violations of consumer terms of service or consumer licensing agreements and do not otherwise constitute unauthorized access.

*Well that's well and dandy, why should I be concerned?*

While CISPA was written to address a legitimate problem, there are concerns about it potential for misuse. It could allow private companies to share your personal information with other companies and the government without informing you of it. The wording that relates to what information can be shared is vague, which raises concerns about what personal information of yours will be shared. The bill has been changed over time to address some of these concerns but most privacy advocates feel that it still has large loopholes that could be abused.

**I want to make a difference, what should I do?**

[Contact your senators!](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)
Call them, email them, write them, send smoke signals! Whatever it takes! The more they hear from their constituents
the more they'll see how important the issue is to us. CISPA is very low salience among most people, that's why it's so
important for us to get the word out the best we can. You *do* have a voice and it's time to make it heard.

You may also experience a total fear of expressing your opinions on what used to be an un-regulated testament to humanity, but you won't have to worry about the Legion of Doom or the illuminati-satanist Anonymous from taking down Yahoo for a week. Or 911! 911 is bad. If you don't give in to CISPA then you'll be 911-ed by evil terrorists who eat babies!

Don't take my word for it though, take Benjamin Franklin's; **""Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government; when this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its ruins. Republics and limited monarchies derive their strength and vigor from a popular examination into the action of the magistrates.""**

Shit, no not that one. This one; **""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.""**

Fuck. Disregard those last two quotes. This isn't going well; all I can advise you to do now is to avoid a Google search of House Un-American Activities Committee, the Salem Witch-Hunt or the book 1984.

A blacklist prevents your router from allowing traffic to the sites on the list; it's a sort of one-way firmware firewall.

I appreciate your taking the time to write and welcome the opportunity to respond. 
 
The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act  was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 13, 2013 by Representative Mike Rogers (R-MI).  The bill would, among other things, establish procedures to allow the Intelligence Community to share cyber threat intelligence with the private sector. 
 
I agree with the authors of the House bill that our nation faces a serious and growing threat from  cyber attacks and espionage—threats to both our national security and our economy.  Effective  cybersecurity requires that information on cyber threats and defenses in our government's hands be passed to the private sector, and that information from industry be shared with the government.
 
At the same time, it is critical that our efforts to improve cyber security include robust privacy protections.  In particular, we must ensure that our constitutional rights and liberties are protected, and place proper limits on the government's use of cyber security information that it obtains from the private sector. 
 
Last Congress I authored the  Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2012 (S. 2102).  While that legislation accomplished many of the same goals as the House legislation, it included robust privacy protections and safeguards against the private sector abusing information sharing authorities.  As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I will shortly be introducing a bill on information sharing which allows sharing of cyber intrusion data with the government with full immunity.  In this way we hope to encourage a major effort between the public and private sector to share data so that cyber intrusion can be prevented. 
 
Once again, thank you for your letter.  I am pleased that you are engaged in this important issue and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841, or visit my website at http://www.feinstein.senate.gov.

Like most here I am interested in subreddits turning to action when finding out things like the NSA leaks for example. With the exemption of witch hunts. 


The thing I want to share with this subreddit is around the time that conspiracy theorists were focused on the illegal war in iraq and the economic inequality (and unethical banking practice). A new 'hypothetical' idea came about.


The idea was to exploit 'common law' to claim sovereignty. (Turning around and refusing the rule of the country and claiming a new rule). This is vastly over simplified and the legal intricacies, requirements and resources you'd need to pull it off aren't simple stuff. But it is possible. 


This is why I think it's possible:


The media are a huge resourceful sector. Plenty of money and influence - in fact, media companies have some of the biggest power potential. However, once it was clear to a minority (mostly the 'conspiracy theorists') that the media were untruthful. At first they whined, then they tried to spread awareness. Then finally, they **replaced them**. The sheer amount of blogs, alternative news outlets, youtube channels and other community based media are replacing the powers of old - especially the the ones known to be least truthful. 


As technology and online communities give momentum to this media replacement, doing things like ""don't post sources from *this* tabloid or ""I came to read the comments so the users could tell me why this article is wrong"" - become common place. 


Essentially, I'm saying, there are avenues to replace the systems we see that fail. It has been/is being done in media, and that's no small feat (A ex-CIA Director did a speech about the bloggers replacing media too). 


I'm not fully informed on this because I am absolved by other avenues at the moment but I thought if this post caught the eye of some people in the subreddit it might be useful.

This is a request on behalf of a UK based sub-reddit called /r/ReinstateArticle8 which was created in a similar spirit to /r/RestoreTheFourth. 

We’re all volunteers, concerned with promoting privacy and freedom from censorship (taking into account that we have different legislation affecting privacy here, hence the movement’s name).

Firstly, my apologies if this is not the correct place to post this but we are in dire need of your help and expertise.
We are in need of skilled animators/video makers to kindly volunteer their services in the name of internet freedom. If you think you can help, have adequate experience, and the issues we stand for resonate with you, then please read on and see if you would like to be involved with producing the visual side of our first promotional video (We already have the audio covered).

We have a preliminary script which is very short, so as to test the water. If all goes well we will be producing something later which will be more in-depth and fact/statistic based.

The idea is to put something out which is accessible to the general public, not just redditors, in order to drive traffic to the site so we can get people informed and organized about crucial issues of abuses of civil liberties taking place in their name.

The video/animation does not have to be incredibly complex, so long as it looks professional. It could even be a series of merging still frames with one animation at the end. But you folks are the experts so perhaps you would kindly like to take a look at the script below and have a think about what you could come up with?
________________________________________
""We all value our privacy, in day to day life, and while we are online.""

""But, unless we act now, our right to open and uncensored access to the Internet could be gone forever.""

*Animation reflecting the internet in a positive manner*

""The internet is amazing"" ""Let's keep it that way""

""Reinst8 - Demand Privacy, Reject Censorship""
________________________________________

We have a frame for the final slogan which we would like to be used at the end of the sequence. 
You can view it [here]( http://imgur.com/7wV44yp,E5bBaIt#0)

If you feel you can help, or you know somebody who you think might be interested in getting involved, please let us know. 

The overall length will need to be around 25-30 seconds (A 30 second segment would be ideal) as the VO has not yet been recorded and can be fitted to the animation/video.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read this. 
We look forward to hearing from you.

I have created a primer that explains just about all of CISPA as well as I could explain it.  It's designed to be read alongside the actual bill (link to the bill in the posts).  It's a little long, but hopefully it'll help explain why CISPA is so dangerous (particularly Section 3(g)(6)).

Spread the word, if you can.  It'd be appreciated.  Also, IANAL, but I have a pretty extensive mastery of legal-ese, as well as a penchant for word problems.  The 3 part series is pretty much designed for people that really want to see EVERYTHING in CISPA.

[Part 1 - Section 1 and 2](http://redd.it/1ctycc).

[Part 2 - Section 3 - (a) through (c)](http://redd.it/1cykk6).

[Part 3 - Section 3 - (d) through Section 7](http://redd.it/1cyo8o).

For a short and sweet ELI5-version of CISPA...

CISPA creates a way for the US Government and companies like Facebook, Google and others to share information with the US Government, as well as each other.   It also includes laws making it illegal to share information with people that shouldn’t know (what Bradley Manning did), to share that information among others that shouldn’t know (what WikiLeaks does), and allows for companies to trade personal information without getting in trouble.  It also allows for the US Government to spy on US citizens, to prosecute people that pirate movies, games or music, and does all of this without telling you.  You will also never know it’s happening.

The extreme version is people violating CISPA can be labeled ""domestic terrorists"" through a combination of CISPA and the Patriot Act, which is what the US Government *really* wants to do to Anonymous.

Many companies (nearly all that support CISPA, actually) stand to make money from this Act - new companies will be hired by every company on the internet for ""cybersecurity,"" as well as by the US Government, and everyone from internet providers to social networking sites will make money from the trading of information.  This is why there are so few companies fighting CISPA, and more reason for us citizens to protect our freedoms and liberties from ""Big Brother.""",,False,,t5_2u479,False,,,True,t3_1cyq6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cyq6w/cispa_hr_624_explained/,

Edit this to your liking but I think and others seem to think this is a really good starting point: 

&gt;Senator Pryor,
&gt;
&gt;As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. Crawford voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. 
&gt;
&gt;I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving in to the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this.
&gt;
&gt;I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at Arkansas State University. 
&gt;
&gt;Your younger generation of constituents do not agree with these draconian laws and as I understand CISPA it makes what happened to Aaron Swartz even worse and is a disgrace to us Americans.
&gt;
&gt;Again, I plead to you to vote no on this bill.
&gt;
&gt;I look forward to hearing back from you
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards,


Now obviously Senator Pryor is my Senator and Rep. Crawford I mentioned is my rep. Change this letter as you see fit and if you have one that's better please feel free to one up me on this! I'll happily take it. We need to stand together on this and if someone can write a better letter please do :)

It only took me about 1 minute and not much thinking to write this so I know some of you can do better but for those of you who don't want to write a whole new one out just edit the names and the part about Arkansas State University.

Good luck guys! 

Edit 1: Try to personalize this a bit. We do not want to look like drones.

Edit 2: People are now posting their own versions of letters in the comments. Please take a look at all and find one that fits you best to send to your Senators. Also make sure you check to see if your rep's from the house voted yes to CISPA and kindly write them an email like I did (i posted mine in the comment section)",,False,,t5_2u479,1366679596.0,,,True,t3_1cw1jo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cw1jo/a_template_to_protest_cispa_to_your_senators/,

&gt;/r/evolutionreddit - The same concept as this subreddit, although lately it has been lacking on discussion. The guy who created it is, /u/equanimousmind, is the most prolific Reddit-activist I know.

&gt;/r/sunlight - The subreddit for the Sunlight Foundation. These guys are pretty cool, and focus on government transparency issues as they relate to technology.

&gt;/r/SOPA - Still active, believe it or not.

&gt;/r/technology - The largest sub that seems to care about SOPA/CISPA issues.

&gt;/r/Runforit - This one is listed in the sidebar. I actually started this sub, but removed my moderator-ness when I tried to pass the torch on to someone else. Now the place has pretty much died due to not getting any TLC. Perhaps I should request to be reinstated as a mod?

&gt;/r/testpac - Also dead, but hopefully coming back for the 2014 election cycle. If Fight For the Future is Reddit's 501c3, then TestPAC is Reddit's PAC. (A 501c3 cannot endorse particular political candidates, a PAC can). We actually raised a lot of money for a primary election, and unlike Demand Progress (started by Aaron Schwartz), were non-partisan. Related sub: /r/rpac

The demographics of Reddit have definitely changed constantly for the past several years. Doing anything worthwhile will be met with negativity and nastiness. The top post in /r/trees for two days in a row are pleas for political action, but some of the top comments are depressing cynicism. Don't give up - Reddit activism was my full-time ~~hobby~~ job for a year, and gave me the experience I needed to get me the awesome job I have now. Never give up, never surrender.

This CISPA might fail, but eventually some future version of CISPA will become law. 

My question is: what form of CISPA would you guys *want* to have pass? People worry that internet laws are written by those who don't really understand the internet and how it works so they can't fully understand the effects and implications of the bills they are proposing. 

But we can, right? Maybe not everyone on reddit, but our community is made up of such a large, diverse talent pool that I imagine one of us could write a version of CISPA that we could all agree on. 

We could write a version without ambiguous language, and then look at them in parallel and, by example, show scenarios in which the bill (as it is currently written) is twisted and abused whereas in the same situation our version is not susceptible. 

What will this accomplish? Probably nothing. At best, one of our elected officials will read it, understand the problems with the current CISPA, and incorporate positive changes. At worst, we've wasted time on reddit, which is what most of us are doing anyway.

As it stands right now this situation is like when friends try to decide on a place to eat:

&gt; Government: How about mexican food?

&gt; Us: Nah, I don't like mexican food, it makes me gassy.

&gt; Government: Okay what about italian?

&gt; Us: Nah, italian gives me heartburn

Since hunger is a real problem, we're going to eat somewhere. But the ""Us"" in that conversation is purely reactionary. I'd hope that we could actually contribute to the conversation in addition to pointing out dead ends.",,False,,t5_2u479,False,,,True,t3_1cwxvz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cwxvz/what_cispa_would_you_like_to_see/,

That's not necessarily bad, but you might want to stick with the reddit-standard way of having a separate text and link submit button, since this is an ""official"" subreddit

At any rate, definitely change the wording of the submit button. If you'll be using this to host big AMAs (or really anything that will end up with traffic and comments from external sites), many of the people seeing the subreddit and thread will not be familiar with how reddit functions. They'll end up using that button to try to submit comments. We saw this a lot after the change in /r/IAmA. I ended up fixing the issue by hiding the submit button when users are actually in a thread -- people linked directly into an AMA would never see that button to misuse it. Something like:  

        body.comments-page div.sidebox.submit-text {display: none;}  
will accomplish that.
