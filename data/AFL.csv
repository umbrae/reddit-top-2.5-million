EDIT: Uploaded a video for you guys.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFRGEzRz6wU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be

EDIT 2: Footage after I accidentally stopped recording of the walkout.

EDIT 3: Eddie McGuire was just interviewed on Triple M Football after he left the Sydney rooms and whether you like him or not, his words should be commended. He basically said that as much as this situation pisses him and the AFL community off, the girl is clearly underage and this needs to be taken into consideration. Sure, what she did was wrong and she will pay for it, but she needs to be looked out for because some not so smart people out there are going to take this one step too far. He also talked to Goods, told him not to worry about it and commended him on his performance, and said that he was planning on making the girl apologies to him in person. Good guy Ed.

I, as hopefully most of you, will agree that this little shithead needs to pay for what she said and as much as people want to make her a target for anti-racism, I don't think it's appropriate. A fully grown man or woman holds their own responsibilities and if it had come from them, this would be an entirely different story. People would want blood and rightly so. But her mum/aunty/woman, that fucking stupid bitch sitting next to her, is the one that is no doubt responsible for her actions. If anyone needs to front and say sorry for anything, it's her. 

Also, life ban kthxbai.

That being said, I went today to see Collingwood Vs Carlton.

Holy. Shit. This. Game. Is. Amazing.

I am exhausted so I will keep it quick, but here are a few things I now know.

1) AFL will be in the states soon. I am bringing it there
2) I hate collingwood (although the fans were much  nicer than you all lead me to believe)
3) You Aussies are doing something right with your meat pies. 
4) Once I start following a team I think this game will give me a legitimate heart attack.

I love AFL, looking forward to starting a new obsession.  Thanks again for all the info you shared before the game!

Well today I couldn't find a stream of the Dees game so I listened to the game on online radio. 

I have never experienced tension like I did today. Not knowing when the siren was coming, waiting and praying it would sound made everything so much more intense and fun. I loved it...but I nearly had a fucking heart attack.

Honestly the new rules introduced, and the new interpretations, have turned the game into a farce, embarrassing even.


Can anyone sit down this year, and sincerely enjoy a good game of footy without the game being slaughtered by the umpires (unless you’re North)? The standard is low, and extremely inconsistent. A “push in the back” should be exactly that: a push, not a hand or a touch. Now we are told no pushing in the front or side as well?
 

There are so many free kicks being paid now, and they are so damaging, that many games are being decided by which team has the rub of the green for the longer time and how they make the most of it. We are at a point now where part of a team’s strategy is positioning themselves to get more frees, and the constant appealing  by players every time the ball goes out of bounds is infuriating.


Another problem now is that the umpires seem to have gotten it into their oversized egos that they are somehow part of the entertainment package (which, by the way, is becoming altogether unbearable with the constant mindless noise, bogan-cams, vacuous interviews, idiots loudly reminding everyone of the scores, and general commercialism that the game has embraced). Good umpiring is the kind you cannot remember after the game is finished, much less hear discussed in the media throughout the week. And what the hell is an “umpire appreciation round”? As if we all watch the game to see the fluorescent green team dominate the match with their silky hand signals and huge, manly whistles…


In my opinion, the powers that be are under the illusion that AFL will become a world game and are constantly tweaking the rules in an attempt to endear it to non-AFL audiences. When they realize it will never take off outside Australia (with the unlikely exception of NZ) and just accept that it is an exclusively Australian game, then they can try and simplify the rules and make it easier for the umpires to officiate the game. People like me can bitch and moan about the decisions that umpires make, but if you look at the changes that are brought in each year to the rules then that must affect the quality of umpiring.


If you look at a lot of team-based games that are played globally like cricket, soccer, and rugby to name a few, then you will find that the number of rule changes are quite minimal and certainly less than what is thrust upon the followers of AFL. It's time for the ego-trippers who run our game to quit their expansion policy and focus on what makes our game great, instead of incessantly trying to tweak some magical formula that may appeal to people to start following our game. People are more likely to take interest in the sport if the rules are easy to follow and don't change every 5 minutes, because a small panel of man have deemed it to be ""good for the game"". A lot of AFL fans have followed the game for a long time and would consider themselves knowledgeable about the game. The same lot of fans are often left in state of bewilderment and utter confusion about many decisions each week. It is patently obvious the game needs to be simplified so it is easier to officiate and also easier to follow.

1373677596.0,41,self.AFL,1i6xw5,A Beginners Experience,52,11,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1i6xw5/a_beginners_experience/,"I've always known about Australian Football since I had a set of sports blooper VHS tapes in the early-mid 90's.  Obviously younger at that time, I had a hard time distinguishing it from rugby.  Being a huge American Football fan, the extremely physical aspect of both sports fascinated me.

Growing up in Wisconsin, United States, I was bred to be a Green Bay Packers fan.  I didn't play American Football after junior high because Soccer season was the same time and I was far more proficient as a goal keeper than anything else.  I also played youth rugby from age 12-17 and have played in the men's league casually for the last 10 years.  Unfortunately, Australian Football is never played here, so never got the chance.

Onto the point.  I've been watching AFL games on Fox Sports and Fox Soccer channel.  They usually only play 1 game a weeknight from 11:00pm-1:00am, sometimes 2 games, and they are replays from a few days earlier.  Sometimes they are replays from 2-3 years ago from obviously high profile games.

I wanted to make a post and explain what I've learned about the sport as far as the laws go and see if I'm correct or not.  I've never read any lawbook, wiki page, or any type of posts as far as the laws of the game go, everything I 'know' has been learned strictly from watching the games and listening to the commentary.

- The quarters start with some sort of face off with the ball being spiked into the air by one of the ref's.  It's also how the game is restarted after points are scored.  I don't know what the correct term is.

- Handball passes can be made to your team, you cannot throw the ball

- If you kick the ball and someone on your team or the opposing team catches it, it's called a mark(if the opponent catches it I'm not sure if it's called the same thing).  You then have an uncontested opportunity at kicking the ball or you can choose to 'play on' where you can continue running with the ball.

- You can run with the ball, but every certain amount of steps or yardage run, the ball needs to touch the ground.  I've seen players dribble it like a basketball and I've seen players simply reach down and touch the ground with the ball.  I'm not sure how often you have to do it.

- Points are scored by kicking the ball through the center uprights, or through the side uprights.  Kicking it through the middle is a goal and scores 6 points.  Kicking it through the side goals is called a behind and scores 1 point.  From what I've seen, I don't think it matters if the ball is airborn as it passes through, or if it bounces through it also counts.

- I'm confused a bit about when the ball goes into touch.  It seems like as long as a player controlling the ball has at least a toe inbounds, the ball is still in play.

- When a ball does go into touch, the game is restarted by a ref throwing the ball up and over his back arching high into the air.

- If a player has the ball and is tackled and cannot pass the ball, it's basically like a jump ball you'd see in basketball when possession has gone stale.  The referee simply throws the ball into the air underhand to resume play.  I've noticed at times if this happens continuously, a team may be penalized and a free kick awarded.  I'm not sure how that is determined.

- High tackles are illegal, any contact with the head during a tackle is a penalty and a free kick is awarded.

- There doesn't seem to be any type of 'pass interference' like you'd see in American Football.  If the ball is in the air it seems like you can basically hip check your opponent to gain advantage.  I think I recall seeing blatant arm/body holding called a few times.  It also seems that jumping over the top of people to get the ball is highly encouraged and quite the talent.

- You can kick the ball whenever, even if it's just on the ground.

 That's about it.  I love watching.  It rarely seems penalties are called and the game flows really well.   I'm trying to learn more about the clubs in general and maybe pick someone to cheer for next year.

Also, that Naitanui dude seems like a beast.  He's the only name I can remember off the top of my head.  Oh, and Adam Goodes.

It's been 132 days since I left Australia after a year in Melbourne on working holiday, and I can with relief say that AFL footy is still a major part of my life. I was afraid that after leaving, my burning interest in the game would cool off and be replaced with something else, but no. I check afl.com.au daily and I go on the ""Aussie Rules Live"" android app approx twice to three times a day to get a fix, even if it's something like the saints meeting the broncos...

The level of entertainment offered by this sport is, needless to say, without equal. It's fast paced, and it requires such amazing levels of versatility in it's atheletes. Run fast &amp; far, jump high &amp; precise, kick straight &amp; far, catch on the run, kick on the run, be quick in mind and with your hands, hit hard and get hit hard. Get up. Train hard &amp; for months, play hard &amp; for months and try to never lose your edge to make the top 22 every week. 

My friends over there taught me (sort-of) how to kick, but as my passion for it grew I decided to join a club. For 8 months I was involved in a local footy club and got to play a couple of matches. Loved all of it. It's hard to put the finger on what the actual magic of the sport is, but I reckon it's because of the all-roundedness. The kick-to-hands (marking) that you don't really see in other sports is just amazing.

Whenever I met new people and got onto the topic of footy, they would often be impressed and happily surprised at how much i knew. Talking about salary caps and the draft, past premierships or rules of the game. It's funny, how I've never been interested in sports and sneered at people who's lives are engulfed by soccer (it's big in Sweden). I get them now. Now I regularly check the footy news, I've got two Sherrins, a collingwood jumper (cue downvotes) signed by a few players. I've got pie socks, t-shirts and hats. I have stickers and that book Malthouse and Buttifant wrote. My beanie is probs my most prized item, it was given to me on my first day in Oz.

I've been trying to sell the game to friends and family, but they don't seem to get hooked. My mum actually enjoyed it once she got the basics of the game, she thought ""something was always happening"" which I believe is a fair review. I filled out a survery and was actually asked to attend a meeting (with two other fans) at AFL house in the Docklands with the design department about their smartphone app, which I happily told them sucks ass. And I got an iTunes voucher!

I love how the players don't make ridiculous amounts of money.
I love how it brings a city together.
I hate Geelong Fc (very nice town though).
I love how footy-concentrated Melbourne is, and how open it is. You can drive down Swan st/Olympic blvd and within a few hundred metres spot the Dees train, the Pies have a kick and elite-level teams from other codes such as Melbourne Storm and Victory go at it.

Anyway, I don't really know where I'm going with this. I guess I want to reach out to all of the AFL fans that I can't meet in my normal life and rejoice in ~~your~~ our beautiful game.

Hi all,

I've put together a website that you guys might be interested in. It's aimed at footy fans, and is driven by twitter content. 

http://www.hashtagfooty.com

It's mainly aimed at people like me, who may not use twitter, but are interested in what is being said after Brock McLean tells some bloke that their mum gave him Aids, for example.

It's basically a way of collating and displaying tweets from footballers and clubs without the need for a twitter account. There's also a player directory which lists the details of (almost) every player on an AFL list who uses twitter, where you can view recent tweets, and start following them if you do have an account.

Take a look if you get a chance - And if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them..

Cheers

1376859195.0,39,self.AFL,1kmhwr,Announcement regarding acceptable behaviour in r/AFL (&amp; some other things),42,3,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1kmhwr/announcement_regarding_acceptable_behaviour_in/,"Hello friends,

As promised, this is a general announcement regarding what is okay and what is not okay in this subreddit. Since the Essendon charges were laid, we've seen a decrease in civility, an increase in obvious sockpuppetry (although with few exceptions, we usually can't connect the accounts), and an increase in attempted thread derailment (continue downvoting these, please). This is mainly a rehash of [our rules](/r/afl/w/rules).

***Regarding civility:*** **please STOP personally attacking people**. We respect your right to defend/attack in the Essendon situation, including the ability to poke holes in the other side's argument. What is NOT acceptable is calling fellow Redditors 'retards', 'small-brained', etc. There have been warnings given for this recently, and this has been a bannable offence in this sub since we've had rules. Therefore, **please stop the personal attacks or more warnings/bans will be forthcoming**.

***Regarding sockpuppetry:*** we've had this issue before. I prefer that nobody does this, but I know that's impossible, given how Reddit works. As before: **please don't sockpuppet**. Using sockpuppets to further abuse of other users is doubly not okay, so don't do it.

The creation of one-off accounts to post things (then deleting said account) is befuddling, but obviously, cannot be banned through Reddit's restrictions. The creation of accounts which only post about the Essendon crisis in /r/afl is a little more concerning, and such accounts will be banned if deemed abusive to others or excessively disruptive.

Also: whilst it's hard to prove sockpuppetry here, it's not impossible, especially if multiple accounts are doing the same thing and writing in the same style...

***Regarding thread derailment:*** the sub has been good on this, so please continue downvoting on sight and reporting if you wish. This isn't as big an issue on Reddit than it is on a BBS like Bigfooty, but it is still frowned upon. If you do this a lot, you will be banned under the No Dickheads Rule.

Other things:

1. I run /u/raflgamethread ... but I won't be here for Round 22. The discussion thread is settled, but the match posts are not. Does anyone want to take them on? Comment within or message me. If nobody does, handle it like the beginning of R20?

2. ~~Vote hiding has been requested again. We decided not to do this last time we discussed it, but I'll throw this to the community again.~~ (Yeah, this won't happen.) (As a bonus, this thread will be in contest mode, which is basically vote hiding, but with randomisation.)

3. I made the subreddit a twitter. It is [@redditAFL](https://www.twitter.com/redditafl). It has nothing on it thus far, but you can follow anyway.

4. On up/downvoting in general: since flair was applied, we've had downvoting by flair. I urge you to vote by the content of a comment, which is highly idealistic, but I'll ask it of you all anyway. (Also, I'm aware some of us have downvote bots after us. If you operate them, I request you cease and desist.)

5. I don't have a fifth, but you might have concerns not addressed here. Feel free.",,False,self,t5_2qhoy,1376893610.0,,richmond4,True,t3_1kmhwr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1kmhwr/announcement_regarding_acceptable_behaviour_in/,moderator

1368432057.0,32,self.AFL,1e8fne,"My thoughts on Melbourne - the recent history that got them here, why they're playing like they are, and why it will all be ok (as long as we don't sack Neeld). (WOT alert)",39,7,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1e8fne/my_thoughts_on_melbourne_the_recent_history_that/,"Ok, so with the team I love floundering, I think all is not lost, and the team's current predicament is easily explained. Neeld should stay for at least his entire current contract, and the football department has done a great job over the past two years.

Before you slam me as delusional (not Dee-lusional, all you headline writers out there) let me explain how the current predicament comes to be, as far as I see it...

Throughout the 2000's, post the 2000 Grand Final Neale Daniher was tasked with getting the team back to the GF, and chased a bunch of mature age recruits. Think Paul Johnson, Gary Moorcroft, Chris Heffernan, Byron Pickett, Ben Holland and so forth. We did manage to pick up a few decent draft picks (Sylvia, McLean, Jones) but mostly traded for experience.

Post 2007 when we missed the final we sacked Daniher and replaced him with Bailey on a three-year contract and he was told to rebuild with youth. This, throughout his tenure, not only failed but cost the club the leadership of James McDonald, Cameron Bruce, Adem Yze, Nathan Brown, Matthew Whelan and Jeff White with Neitz having retired. Bailey recruited runners for a fast running game-plan. While this looked promising in patches (think the 67-point defeat of Sydney, 96 points over Adelaide, 60 over the Tigers, 90-odd over Fremantle), during the 3rd year of his tenure (a year which netted eight wins and a draw), the 186pt loss to Geelong caused the board to backflip on what we now know (courtesy of Peter Jackson's comments yesterday) was the right move of sacking Cameron Schwab, instead firing Bailey. We also lose Scully at the end of the year to GWS.

So now Neeld enters, and finds a list lacking high training standards, with no established leaders or senior players and large amounts of floundering, skinny kids, in a club that he wants to be renowned for tough physical football. As a result he needs to make some huge changes, but it will have to wait close to a year as the draft is just about upon him. The standards he sets at training and the addition of Dave Misson begin to address the fitness of players, something Colin Garland has confirmed was a huge issue. He is given a license to tear apart the list, as the ""rebuild"" had simply not worked. The kicker though is that now GWS and Gold Coast have access to all the best of the young talent, and free agency loses the club Brent Moloney (although he had had questionable attitude and work ethic under Neeld) Jared Rivers (no hard feelings there) and Brad Green retires. So there we have a list being torn apart, that has lost what was left of the ""spine"" and experience at the club. We lose Liam Jurrah, Austin Wonneamirri, and Jim Stynes on top of this. Heading into 2013 we are without the top 4 of 2011's B+F, 2009's #1 draft pick, and 2011's leading goalkicker at the club.

So in the face of compromised drafts, Neeld clearly has to do two things - he has to bring experienced players into the club, no matter who they are, because the young players simply have to have some guidance. He also needs to bolster the playing list NOW with some people who can play a role, and he needs to add quality to the core group of young players he believes can get the team out of the giant pit they're in.

To this end, he recruits Dawes, Byrnes, Rodan, Gillies all from Premiership winning clubs, bolsters the team in the present with M. Jones, Terlich, while also recruiting Toumpas, Viney and Hogan. He also manages to recruit Mitch Clarke the year before, who suffers such a severe foot injury that he's still out of the side over almost a year later.

A massive change in the make-up of the team puts the Dees back in my mind to the first year of the ""new game plan"" which last year was working OK by the second half of the year (albeit in a team with a forward line made up of J. Rivers and J. Howe).

Now, as far as I can tell the Dees are seriously behind the eight-ball now. They have not got the phenomenal talent at either of GC or GWS, and no elite players either. But even these teams appear to take a minimum three years to begin to be competitive. It is only this year that has seen GC beat St. Kilda, they stole wins over Carlton and Richmond late last year, and have comprehensively beaten Melbourne and GWS. GWS went down by 137 points yesterday - they're clearly going to take time. 

I don't see any team that has hit truly hard times in my memory that has turned it around in less than three years, and in my mind, for the Dees, this is Year 1. But there is definitely a core of players there who can turn it around, but it's going to be a while yet. I think the most important thing is that now that the Dees are on this path, everyone at the club must have the resilience to see it through, and that means backing the captaincy of Grimes, Trengove, and the coaching of Neeld, no matter how ludicrous that may seem. To any different would be just to push the club further back.

----------------

So please! Argue with me and tell me how wrong I am on every point, how it's all to do with the curse of tanking, bad player development, and Neeld should be sacked. This is the way I see it and I'd love to discuss it with anyone who can offer a differing opinion or thoughts on the whole thing.

**Edit:** I'd also like to add, with Peter Jackson's recent comments about the problems of communication to CEO/Board, and Colin Garland's admission that prior to Neeld the list didn't have AFL standard fitness or skills...

Even seated in level 4 you never feel far from the action and get a great view. Just marvellous. 

If 70k sounds that good and creates that much atmosphere I can only imagine what it is like on grand final day or ANZAC day.

Lol at the Collingwood banner going to pieces well before the players went through it.

The kids in front of me were very funny and cute despite being raised in the black and white. Nothing funnier that seeing a little one screaming for their team and hurling G rated insults at umpires like ""booger brain!""

I think I have a man crush on Harry O now.

Thanks for helping put the purple WA Anchors in the top 4 collingwood. Maybe this will finally be their year.

The constant and loud booing Jobe got was impressive and funny. I don't think he necessarily deserves to be booed more than any other Dons player but I think it added to the atmosphere and brought the game to life even more. I wanted Jobe to get more possessions just to hear the crowd shout out.


Fuck you Wingard you fucking fuck and the pissweak fucking Crows (not that I tipped them as a result of our mammoth injury list)

Dishonourable mentions:

The smile/hug/kiss cam. My god, what a gaudy piece of Yank trash. Fucking cringe worthy and horrible. Send it back to America where it belongs. Absolute worst thing I've ever seen at the footy.

A big fuck you to the group of stupid, loud and vulgar Bombers fans behind me that spent the whole match shouting out things like ""fuck you Collingwood"", ""rip their bloody heads off"", ""kill them"", ""die you bastards"" etc. real wankers. Funny juxtaposition to the sweet pies fans in front of me though. I especially liked when these Bombers fans starting yelling out that Collingwood and their fans were a bunch of ""fucking druggies"" without so much as a hint of irony.

Dishonourable mention to the train service for not running more frequent trains after a 70k match. Though still much better than SA public transport.

Major dishonourable mention for myself for enjoying a collingwood win and findig myself barracking for them. Some days I hate myself...

Fuck you Port. Fuck you to the depths of the underworld  and may Haydes make sport of your eternal suffering! :)

A report from the game as a fan if you will.  Anyone else who was there -Dee or Dog, feel free to contribute.  I was in the gen admission seating among fans of both stripes and sitting in the gate four area.

I realise I'm not great prose writer, but I've tried to communicate this story in that sort of manner because it's the best way I could think to express it.  Also, the adrenaline was definitely pumping.  I was pretty much focused on the game except a brief foray into reddit to make comments on my phone from what might be called 'quiet moments'.  So things might be slightly out of order or misremembered.  It is all as true as I can recall though.  There will be no tl;dr.  The point of the post is the story.

I'll also say that this is my first winning experience at an AFL game.  Since moving to Melbourne last year, every game I have attended  thus far has been a blow out against the Dees.  So this experience is totally new for me but definitely something I want to share with all.  

---

Well this has already been a game that's blown us away.  We're up by 6.3.33 at the final break.  Someone on the phone to his mate behind me is rather fatefully swearing there is no way back for the Dogs now, and that his punt is safe.  The crowd, which is more vocal than I have seen it before, something crucially different to the games against the Saints and Hawks recently, is positive and relatively loud.  So are the Bulldogs fans although there are less of them (at least; they are more spread out where I'm sitting).  There were very clear and loud opinions on certain calls one way or the other as the game unfolded though.  

Things seemed to be going relatively steadily and as everyone expected.  We put a few goals together in this final term and the lead was bigger than it ever had been in the match.  Someone near me is planning to leave early to beat the mad rush, but their friend says ""nah man I wanna sing the song"", ""Yeah true lets do that"".  

Then?  Then it begins.  They get one goal back.  No big deal.  Another.  Another.  Another.  What happened.  It's like the Dees had nothing left.  The crowd gets audibly, noticeably rowdy.  A mixture of encouragement and swearing, clapping and expressed disbelief and it's all coming from us.  Doggies fans are going through their own emotions, they were on the edge of their seat, silent except for the goals, when they went nuts.   

Another goal.  The Dees crowd had died down now.  We were silent.  Stunned.  Not depressed, just confused.  How do you cope with this?  

The count up clock said 22 minutes.  This quarter had run for 22 minutes.  The goal difference, almost inconceivably, was 20 points.    Then over the top of the low rumble of silenced Dees fans a Bulldogs woman screamed ""Three goals in eight minutes, only three goals, carrrn you Dogs"".  

Boy did the Dees fans respond to that.  It's like 5 thousand pairs of eyes gunned straight for the score board, and she was right.  Surely the clock wouldn't run past 30 minutes.  The crowd got loud, and fast.  It just so happens the Bulldogs were kicking in our direction this quarter and you better believe we were yelling at our soldiers to pick up, to carry on.  You better believe the referee copped it when a shocking decision handed them a goal.  A soul crushing goal.  

""Siren!"" *bang, bang, bang!*.  ""Siren!"" *bang, bang, bang!* a group of boys were yelling.  In a sort of dark, self-satire of our own lack of confidence in our players.  A few other fans joined in but it didn't catch for long.  

But all throughout we were still quietly confident.  A certain suspension of disbelief made us see they needed three goals they surely can't get it.  They still need two goals, it wont happen.  

Then; suddenly, almost like being hit by a truck.  They were just 2 fucking points behind.  One more inside 50 gone wrong and the lead we had held for so long would be completely eliminated.  

2 points.  The ball went up in the middle, and the crowd ignited again.  Like all the exhaustion, disappointment and desperation just blew up at once.  Not this time; not now.  Not after all we've been through.  These are our god damn four points and no late collapse is going to take it away from us.   

Hands were on heads.  People were on their feet.  Noise was a constant peppering of yelling and cheering.  The Doggies got the absolute perfect ball out of the centre and kicked it straight into our fifty.  Everyone melted, but then like any great Demon hero Watts emerged with the ball, tangled with another Demon.  In our bay we were on our feet.  It was incredible, it was like we had forgotten we were able to win little contests.  But we had.   Watts took a mark, and we acted like he scored a goal that put the result beyond doubt. 

It wasn't long after this that Sylvia was making a daring run into an attacking position, and the desperate, *still believing* Doggies were in pursuit.  He launches the ball and it rolls.  We're all on our feet again, and it goes wide for a solitary, unconvincing point.  People collapse into their seats ad someone said some delightfully family unfriendly things; we were still careening from anguish to euphoria second by second, play by play.  

And that fucking siren wasn't coming.   ""This is the longest quarter of my fucking life"" I heard someone cuss.  I agreed.  

I saw in my mind a still photo of our slumping heads and jumping Footscray fans being on the front cover of a greatest wins DVD in the Dogs shop.

After an eternity though, and after too many desperate tackles, marauding, searching handballs, handling errors, or miskicks from one team or the other.  It felt like you could have played a whole other game in the time the ball spent zooming around midfield in the dying minute.  The siren did go, though.  I am almost certain nobody expected it.  As much as we all desperately anticipated it, we had convinced ourselves it wouldn't go until we had fallen behind.  That it was destiny we would be disappointed; ruined at the death.  

Dogs fans collapsed, and Dees were in the air.  I don't think I saw a single bum on a seat in Red &amp; Blue, and then with incredible satisfaction, the team song blared over the PA system.  It took us all about 40 seconds to get in sync with the recorded voice because of the noise, and perhaps we were all rusty.  

Five renditions later, and a brief lap of honour by the players themselves, most of us were leaving.  

And it was like traveling through an artery.  Thousands of people snaking along to Richmond station, and slowly dissipating.  All the emotion, all the passion getting less and less common, until I found myself sitting silently on a bus home with no hint of what had just gone on except a knowing glance between me and the older man decked out in red, white &amp; blue who got off at the same stop as me.  

I know I'll be back again.  Round 23.  That's our new grand final.  Can we double up on the Doggies?  I'll find out the hard way.

Before queueing up in the ticket line, Dad studied the prices and stumbled upon a loophole he felt would work to his advantage, for he noticed you could buy a family ticket that would admit two adults and two children, for a cheaper price than buying all the tickets separately.

So that's what he did.  For while the family ticket guaranteed entry for two adults and two children, it didn't specify which two adults and which two children used the ticket.

Dad bought the ticket at the ticket window, then motioned us all forward to the turnstile and proudly presented our family ticket.  The old man staffing the turnstile looked at the ticket, looked at Dad, looked the four of us, then finally looked at Dad again, and said to him, ""Interesting family.""

I remember my dad just smiled and nodded.  ""Sure is,"" he said, and strode through the turnstile without a backward glance.

This was the 80s, and my dad wasn't making a statement about equality, or the rights of the non-traditional family, or anything like that.

Anyway, half time rolls around and instead of the kids coming out to play, they had 3 adult games going of 9-a-side. Bunch of 40 year old fat blokes and died blonde girls in full make-up and hoop earrings playing the mixed netball version of footy. 

That was a disgrace. The kids get a chance to play on the G in front of 55,000 people, but instead they put them on when no one was there, and they didn't get their chance to form the guard of honour for the teams to run on to the ground in the second half. A real poor choice made to appease the sponsor of the 9-a-side game (which I am refusing to name because of that). Those kids missed out, and it pissed me off more than it should have.

To take a few quotes from the interview as I sit here and watch it...

* ""The decision has already been made by that Melbourne Footy Club board that he will not be coaching in 2014""... 

* ""I believe Peter Jackson has already made that decision internally""... 

* ""I believe that today he is bringing forward his timeframe on that happening to Mark Neeld"" ...

* ""Peter Jackson is... not someone who is afraid to make the tough call""

* ""No reason to think they won't execute today""

* ""Don McLardy will... not be part of this regime going forward either""

He spouts about the failure of all the recruiting, although I don't think it is questionable the off-field impacts of Rodan/Brynes, Pederson looked good on the weekend and Dawes played a cracking game.

It's just such ridiculous sensationalism and it's internal from the AFL!

Wow.",31,6,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/ut36w/essendon_down_by_47_at_3qt_lose_by_4_wow/,"With four seconds left, a long kick was taken in the centre square. Essendon's Courtenay Dempsey marks 50 out with 1 second to go and as the siren sounds, he goes to play on, but decides not to, just as the siren sounds. The umpires decides to signal PLAY-ON and refuses to let Dempsey take his kick. (information about the play-on call might be slightly inaccurate, but this seems to be about right)

Honestly, Dempsey should've been given the right to take his kick. Now, I'm no man who memorizes the Laws of the Game, but to me, you can't be waved play-on if you do a sudden movement, but stop and decide to go back and have a shot for goal. Essendon fully deserved that win in my opinion.

Do you have a different opinion? Go on, post in the comments. But please, none of that insulting crap aimed at me. E.g 'hey you dick you're stupid, blah blah blah people like u suck arse'

EDIT: I've had a bit of a check with the Laws of the Game just to see if the decision was correct. Technically, yes, it was play-on. Disregard that second paragraph except for 'Essendon fully deserved that win', because I reckon they did.

&gt;The ACC has identified specific high-performance staff, sports scientists and coaches within some codes who have condoned and/or orchestrated the administration of prohibited substances, and substances not yet approved for human consumption, to players. 

And more specifically:

&gt;Multiple players across some sporting codes and specific clubs within those codes are suspected of currently using or having previously used peptides, which could constitute an anti-doping rule violation. The level of suspected use of peptides varies between some sporting codes, however officials from a club have been identified as administering, via injections and intravenous drips, a variety of substances, possibly including peptides. Moreover, the substances were administered at levels which were possibly in breach of WADA anti-doping rules. 

Page 17 is also huge:

&gt;Widespread use of peptides has been identified, or is suspected by the ACC, in a number of professional sporting codes in Australia. Although the use of peptides appears to be more widespread in some major codes, individuals from a number of other sports are also suspected of using peptides.

&gt;Multiple players (in one code) from a number of clubs are suspected of currently using or having previously used peptides, which could constitute an anti-doping rule violation.
 
&gt;Some players have also been identified as sourcing peptides for personal use. An instance of team-based doping, orchestrated by some club officials and coaching staff, has also been identified.
 
&gt;Apart from the peptide’s anabolic effects, it has been found that injured elite athletes, particularly players from one sporting code, have been using peptides to assist in rehabilitating soft tissue injuries.

(not the counting up clock, but the counting down official one)

As a supporter of Sydney, I'm not disappointed with how their game ended, but as a fan of sport, I can't help but feel that Essendon didn't get a fair chance.  The play-on call was correct, but if Dempsey knew there was only one second left when he took the mark, he surely would have held out for the attempt at goal.

I've heard that not having the game clock makes the game more exciting, but watching on TV where the clock is present, I'd say it was still pretty exciting.  You could argue it's even more exciting with the clock.  I know my eyes were darting back and forth between play and the clock as I was trying to do the mental calculations of whether they could move the ball far enough downfield in the few seconds remaining.

In soccer, you never really know when the game is going to end, but this is not because the clock is obfuscated, but rather because the game ends when when the official says it does, and he would never end the game with a scoring opportunity possible.

I can appreciate if there are historical reasons (no American sport clings to tradition more than baseball), but at the same time, if it affects the outcome of games, they should be open to making a change.

So, what say you /r/AFL.  Should the game clock be displayed in the stadium?",,False,self,t5_2qhoy,False,,sydney2,True,t3_utka4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/utka4/a_question_for_rafl/,

As some of you may know, I usually run /u/raflgamethread. This works fine most of the time, but it's not in the near future, as I will be away for Rounds 9, 10, and 11, and will (by design) have limited internet access.

The discussion threads should continue (I have made arrangements with a real-life friend, who should put it in his Google calendar right now if he hasn't already) to be posted early Thursday morning. However, I will not be able to make match threads, and haven't yet convinced anyone to do that much work without compensation. As such, please do not be alarmed if there are no official match threads for the next three weeks.

If by the time of match, a thread is not posted and you wish to discuss a match, please consider posting one yourself. I do believe ""Match Thread: Brisbane v Fitzroy"" is sufficient and understood to be a match thread in the subreddit, with or without the body text.

If you want to generate the body text, I have created [a template in the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/afl/wiki/matchthread), which can be used to create the match threads. The second Google doc linked up top gives a guide to what I have found to be the most efficient way to do this. From experience, it takes about 15-20 minutes if you know your way around the internet. (For those on desktop, I've stickied it up top.)

Please adhere to the merger agreement (""Brisbane Lions"") to avoid angry PMs, be civil, and don't break the sub while I'm gone.

Thanks!

Some of my choice selections for laughter:
Luke Shuey, Brent Stanton, Luke Bruest and Tom Rockilff are all ranked above Brendon Goddard.

Shannon Hurn is the best defender in the AFL, well ahead of the likes of Harry Taylor, Scott Thompson, and Ted Richards. And on that point, Colin Garland is rated higher than Sam Fisher. And all of them are rated above Dustin Fletcher.

Callan Ward is ranked higher than Andrew Swallow.

Luke Dalhaus is a better forward than Nick Riewoldt. And Rob Murphy is better forward than Taylor Walker.

Zac Smith, Ben Hudson and Trent West are all above Sandilands.

EDIT:

I followed the live blog today where it was discussed and its worth noting that a lot of stats aren't used in these calculations.

The two examples given were taggers, and the situation of a player like Darren Glass.

Champion Data only just started recording 1 on 1 contests recently (a place Glass wins a lot) so the results of those aren't factored into calculations.

Taggers who are able to keep highly rated opponents quiet also are not given any sort of credit under this system, because a lot of the work they do is simply not statistically applicable.

Game situation is also not taken into account with this ratings system, and the algorithm is weighted towards more recent games.",,False,self,t5_2qhoy,1368103698.0,,stkilda2,True,t3_1dzcm7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1dzcm7/afl_player_ratings_released/,

1371108313.0,20,self.AFL,1g97a1,Alternative ways to calculate the Ladder?,28,8,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/1g97a1/alternative_ways_to_calculate_the_ladder/,"So in the AFL the ladder is very simple.  4 points for a win, split 2 each for a draw.  

This is not the only way to do a ladder up however.  What if we did a ladder differently?  Why not take a look at a couple of examples and see if they make much of a difference.  

---

###FIFA  

The FIFA ladder system is also fairly straight forward but de-emphasises draws.  A win is 3 points and a draw is 1 point.  Your raw differential, as opposed to % is also taken into account.  

This suits (soccer-)Football better because draws are fairly common and it's a low scoring game, reducing the need for a % to be relevant.  I don't think this would suit the AFL, but for explorations sake, lets take a look.  

Team|Pld|W|D|GD|Pts|
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Cats|11|10|0|294|30
Hawks|10|9|0|395|27
Swans|11|8|1|296|25
Bombers|11|8|0|261|24
Dockers|10|7|1|180|22
Magpies|11|7|0|56|21
Blues|11|6|0|190|18
Eagles|11|6|0|148|18
Tigers|10|6|0|97|18
Crows|11|5|0|76|15
Power|10|5|0|61|15
Suns|11|5|0|-40|15
Kangaroos|11|4|0|115|12
Bulldogs|10|3|0|-238|9
Lions|10|3|0|-258|9
Saints|11|2|0|-149|6
Demons|11|1|0|-731|3
Giants|11|0|0|-753|0

In this system, the ladder would currently be identical to the existing one, but there are some differences.  For example the Demons differential would be superior to the Giants should Sheedy's boys catch up to the Demons on ladder points but not for/against.  

---

###Super 15's  

The Rugby ladder is an interesting one.  In this case, teams are given 4 points for a win, two each for a draw, but also rewarded an extra ladder point in two scenario's.  Either scoring 4 tries in the match, or losing by less than 7 points (one converted try).  For this ladder, I have decided that the equivalents in AFL would be achieving 100 points in a game, or losing by less than 12 points.  They also, like other codes, prefer raw F/A over the percentage calculation.  Lets see what happens.  

Team|Pld|W|D|Bonus|GD|Pts|
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
Cats|11|10|0|10|294|50
Hawks|10|9|0|8|395|44
Swans|11|8|1|8|296|42
Bombers|11|8|0|6|261|38
Dockers|10|7|1|5|180|35
Magpies|11|7|0|7|56|35
Blues|11|6|0|10|190|34
Eagles|11|6|0|5|148|29
Tigers|10|6|0|5|97|29
Crows|11|5|0|7|76|27
Power|10|5|0|6|61|26
*Kangaroos*|11|4|0|9|115|25
*Suns*|11|5|0|3|-40|23
Bulldogs|10|3|0|2|-238|14
Lions|10|3|0|1|-258|13
Saints|11|2|0|3|-149|11
Demons|11|1|0|1|-731|5
Giants|11|0|0|2|-753|2  

Italic'd is the only positioning change on this ladder.  The 'Roos terrible record in close games is somewhat forgiven in their continual receipt of bonus points.  

Not immediately obvious, but still significant is Geelong's 6 point advantage on Hawthorn.  Even should Hawthorn take a maximum 5 points in the next round, they will sit behind Geelong, while in the actual ladder, Hawthorns great percentage would probably ensure they take the top position.  

Loss consolation and 100 point bonus encourage two things.  Competitive and attacking rugby.  I quite imagine the process would be the same in AFL and many of these games would have been very different.  Port Adelaide and Carlton are separated by just 4 points and 13% in reality, but on this ladder, Carlton's consistency, and record of attacking, high scoring games has put them 8 points ahead, or two wins.   

I like this ladder system.  I'm not saying we should adopt it necessarily, but in my mind, it's the right kind of way to reward teams.  There are of course trade offs.  The all or nothing system in place, or the 'draws are a slow death' system that FIFA has in place are interesting options as well.  They make the final moments of games that much more important, that much more stressful, because there is no consolation, and North are punished much more harshly for their failure to kick just one more goal so often.

We will not be running official /r/afl fantasy leagues, because they can't host as many people as would want to join. ~~(Unless of course, there is a mythical comp which can host a hundred sides in a league?)~~ Therefore, this thread is to be a way to co-ordinate people into a league.

**r/AFL PRIVATE COMPS WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE LOTS OF TEAMS:**

Dream Team: http://dreamteam.afl.com.au/group?cic=384198	

Supercoach: http://supercoach.heraldsun.com.au/group?cic=595517

If you create a league and would like for your fellow redditors to join, please provide the following information:

1. The competition (DT/SC/Ultimate Footy/etc.)
2. The type of league (traditional or draft - perhaps indicate a time with a time zone)
3. The number of teams wanted
4. The skill level intended (i.e. ""People who have made fantasy grand finals"" or ""People who have never played fantasy AFL"" or ""Americans who don't understand the game"" ... or open to all.)
5. A link to join!

Please also edit your comment to indicate if your league is full.

---

The OP will be updated here with tipping comp codes once they are created. Expect one on the AFL site and ... maybe one on Footytips?

If you are seeing this and it is still the month of January, please consider upvoting for visibility when registration opens.

Freo will make way for either St. Kilda or Geelong.  

Adelaide look irresistible.  Playing footy the way it should be played and quality across the park.  Dangerfield, Walker, Tippett and Jacobs have really stepped up and Sanderson has got them humming along.  

Blues have shown their true colours and look out of the race.  Hawks are still sus down back and in the ruck.  Not sure if Essendon can keep up their cracking form, but watch out for them in the next couple of years.  Sydney, West Coast and Collingwood all look good and - for me - it's a toss up between these three to play off against the Crows in the big dance.

The whole Mark Neeld saga had been sickening. These people don't care. They just want to ruin a career, regardless of how the club may fare.  We all know they aren't going well, but sacking him is not going to achieve anything. They're missing a few of their most important players and it is showing. They made up some cap about the board meeting being where he war going to be sacked, when it didn't happen. It was a regular occurrence of a board meeting. Not called in extraordinary circumstances. 

A few weeks ago they had Brendan McCartney in their cross hairs. They've also had their eye on Worsfold, McKenna, Voss, and even Hardwick.  They're reporting on unrest at Collingwood. They're covering Buddy Franklin every single week. Let the guy play and get on with it. Report something when something actually happens. They did the same with Cloke last year. It serves nobody's interest but their own.

Essendon captain Jobe Watson said he and his players felt “vindicated” by that statement. 

But ASADA has told the Herald Sun the investigation continues; and the possibility of future charges remains. 

“Given this investigation is ongoing, ASADA is not providing any further comment on its interim report. As we have previously noted, it is a complex investigation and ASADA has a duty of care to be both thorough and accurate in every step of the process,” an ASADA spokesman said. 

“Should ASADA form the view at the conclusion of its investigation that a person may have committed an anti-doping rule violation ASADA will follow its established process”.

It is not up to the AFL to initiate doping charges against players.
