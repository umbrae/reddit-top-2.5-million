Back when I was in high school *cough**cough* years ago, we had to write something called a Controversial Issue essay. It was the big ""term paper"" project, and passing it was a prerequisite for passing the class. We were allowed to pick our own topics, but were asked to avoid the wildly controversial topics such as abortion.

After a lifetime of separate-but-equal office supplies, it occurred to me a topic discussing the mistreatment of left-handers through the ages would make for an interesting topic. When I went to my teacher to clear the topic, she scoffed at me! 

""That's not a *real* issue,"" she said. ""Pick a topic that actually *matters*.""

Struck with a sudden rush of righteous indignation, I proudly proclaimed ""THAT'S exactly the kind of attitude I would expect! Keeping my people down yet again! We'll see what the principal has to say about it!"" 

She laughed at me dismissively, and though I felt a tad silly, the die was cast. So after class I went to see the principal, true to my word. And though he himself was not a southpaw, he empathized with my plight, and told me he would ask the teacher to allow me to use the topic.

I wrote the paper, but the teacher refused to grade it, flabbergasted at my defiance. The principal stepped in again, reading it and ultimately giving me an A. 

I can't be sure, but I believe for the rest of the year, that she instinctively twitched every time I raised my *left* hand to answer a question in class.",,False,,t5_2ruq7,False,,,True,t3_ofx0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/ofx0h/thats_not_a_real_issue/,

My whole family is right handed so growing up I was taught how to do things with my right hand (and foot). I was real young so it was simple things like throwing a ball or coloring. Both of which I did poorly. My parents never considered the idea that I should be using the other hand, they just figured I inherited their clumsiness. 


Things go along fine up until first grade. My teacher was quick to notice that I had a lot of trouble with writing. Aside from the lack of ability to make a straight line, I wrote most of my letters backwards. The words would be right but half the letters were mirror images of what the should be.


After a few weeks of coaching I still couldn't get it. After a conference with my teacher, parents and school shrink it was decided that I had a serious learning disability and needed to be moved to special ed. I was devastated. All my old classmates called me dumb, I cried all the time, it was miserable. 


After about two weeks of plodding through my special classes the new teacher decided to try a radical experiment. She took the pencil out of my right hand and put it into my left. I swear it was like a scene straight out of *Miracle Worker*. All of a sudden I could write all my letters correctly. I was flying through my assignments with a great new found confidence. So the teacher decided it was time for another conference. This time they brought the principal in and rather than sending me back to my old class they skipped me ahead to second grade. 


I have been a proud southpaw ever since.

Common objects that most people don't realize are handed at all.,94,6,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/1dj077/right_handed_by_design_common_objects_that_most/,"Here are some things that almost all Right handed people (*and most Left handed people*), don't realize are predominantly Right handed by design.  
  
**Cars:** American or European the ignition is always on the right side of the steering wheel. 
  
**Lawnmowers** as well as most small engines have the pull rope mounted to be used with the right hand.
  
**Cameras:** Most controls are operated with the right hand. 
  
**Cellphones:** Volume button designed to be used with index finger rather than thumb. Models with buttons have the end button on the right side and if you hold it left handed your cheek bone hangs up.  

**Guns:** If you don't own one or have never shot then you may not realize that the super hot spent shell almost always ejects to the right which has to cross right in front of your face. Operating the safety of a gun is nearly impossible. There are left handed guns, some shotguns/rifles eject downward, but to just go buy a handgun off the shelf you are very limited in your selection. 
  
**Tweezers:** I have a nice pair of tweezers and I realized one side is much sharper than the other which makes them work better right handed because the thinner side slides under the hair or splinter much easier.  
  
**Circular saws:** Dust in my eyes every time.   
  
**Chainsaws:** For safety reasons i have learned to use right handed (right hand on throttle). Chainsaws are just dangerous and should not be operated any other way than they were designed either left or right handed. 
  
**Most knives:** Most knives in the kitchen have only one edge ground down or they have one side that is flat and the other beveled. When cutting with the left hand and holding with the right the blade tends to scoop outward.  
  
**Measuring cups:** in the US display metric when held with the left hand.

**Please add your personal observations.**  
  
**Note:** *Please forgo scissors, can openers, spiral bound notebooks, etc.* ",,False,,t5_2ruq7,False,,,True,t3_1dj077,http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/1dj077/right_handed_by_design_common_objects_that_most/,

Some background, I draw with my left, but use a mouse with my right. I believe it's called mixed-handed.

I'm an animator working with Flash CS3. My work requires a lot of drawing by hand. Before today, I used Flash's Brush tool, which has a circular cursor. A circular cursor (or other precise cursor, such as a crosshair) isn't hand-dependent, it doesn't imply either left- or right-handedness.

However, I've just run up against a project that requires I switch to this tool, *the Pencil.*

[Cursor of Dread.](http://i.imgur.com/JnrJn.gif)

As a left-hander, drawing with a right-handed cursor is an unusual torture. I can only liken it to drawing with a hook, your brain anticipates the point approaching from the left, but your visual feedback suggests it's coming from the right. This discord throws every line I draw, making work impossible.

The main problem is, there seems to be no option to switch it around, which is infuriating because it seems the simplest of fixes, but alas I cannot find the option.

Windows have a set of left-handed cursors available to replace the default ones, but they have no effect on Flash's own cursors. Hunting through Flash's directory reveals no cursor files, which likely means they are buried in Flash's code.

You can set 'precise' cursors, but they don't apply to the Pencil tool. If you want to use Pencil, it's a right-handed cursor or nothing, and I have no choice but to use it.

It's hugely disappointing, especially from a ""professional"" product, that a basic accessibility option is non-existent. A few lines of code on their behalf would have saved me a world of frustration. My opinion of Flash is fairly low as it is, however, so I'm not sure if I'm surprised.

His letters are almost perfectly formed, but you can sort of tell he starts them in a different place and his teacher watches him write. Does anyone else have this habit?

FWIW, he's a very happy and confident kid and he doesn't really seem to care too much about the criticism. My problem actually lies more with how she documents it. She marks down his grade and makes comments about it in his report card and in his file, but doesn't state that he's left-handed so it seems like he's just really uncoordinated or uncooperative. They have a curriculum for teaching and assessing handwriting; it's actually a pretty good system, but it doesn't address issues like this. But like almost everyone has commented, it really doesn't matter in the long term.

1339313391.0,30,self.southpaws,uucs3,"Fellow southpaws, what is the reasoning behind the ""lefty way"" and the ""righty way"" to hold utensils such as golf clubs and baseball bats? Because to me, it makes NO sense. ",40,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/uucs3/fellow_southpaws_what_is_the_reasoning_behind_the/,"So this has been pondering my mind for a long time. As a lefty, I do almost everything left handed, with the exception of using computer mice and toilet paper, but I'm bothered by the classifications of the ""left way"" and the ""right way"" of doing things. 

For example, the ""lefty way"" to hold a hockey stick is to have your right hand on the top and your left hand on the bottom, with the top of the stick angled towards your right shoulder. And the ""lefty way"" to hold a baseball bat is with your left hand on top and your right hand on bottom, with the bat over your left shoulder. Honestly, this makes no sense to me. In both these scenarios, the non-dominant hand is placed at the end of the equipment, which seems wrong...it seems the dominant hand should be placed at the end since it has the most control. That's how I hold them, with the dominant hand at the end of the utensil.

Here's the way I hold things, and my reasoning:

**Pistol**: Held in left hand

**Rifle**: Left hand on trigger with right hand on forestock with the gun resting on my left shoulder

**Hockey Stick**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom with top of stick pointing towards my left shoulder

**Baseball Bat**: Left hand on bottom, right hand on top, held over my right shoulder, standing on the left side of the plate from the umpire's point of view. (or standing on the right side of the plate from the pitcher's point of view)

**Tennis Racket forehand**: Left hand on grip swinging from the mid/bottom left side up to right shoulder

**Tennis Racket backhand**: Left hand on bottom, right hand on top, swinging from my mid/bottom right side up to my left shoulder

**Bow &amp; Arrow**: Left hand back holding arrow, Right hand forward holding bow

**Lacrosse Stick**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom. With my arms at my sides, the pocket faces the right and the butt of the stick faces the left

**Golf Club**: Left hand on top, right hand on bottom, standing with my left foot in front and my right foot in the back. (For someone standing directly behind me, I would be to the left of the golf ball)

Here's the part that I don't get: in some of these situations, I'm apparently holding the utensil(s) as a right-handed person would, such as baseball and hockey. This makes no sense to me, as I'm using the same ""rules"" to hold each object: My dominant hand (left) is on the end and my non-dominant hand (right) is above/below that hand depending on the situations....it's in between my dominant hand (left) and the end of the utensil. 

Why aren't all of these the ""left handed"" way? **I mean I'm using the same pattern for each of them, aren't I?** 

I start my reasoning with guns; a lefty obviously holds a pistol with their left hand. And a lefty obviously holds a rifle with their left hand back on the trigger and their right hand up at the forestock (up near the barrel). Therefore, if a lefty were pointing the rifle downwards, in a similar position to the way a hockey stick is held, their left hand would be on top at the trigger and their right hand would be on bottom, near the barrel. 

Now replace that rifle with a hockey stick or golf club. This **SHOULD** be the way a lefty holds a hockey stick or golf club. But it isn't. **WHY?** Similarly, the technically correct way for a lefty to use a backhand in tennis is with the left hand at the end/bottom of the racket with the right hand above the left hand (in between the left hand and the strings), swinging from the bottom/mid right side UP to the left shoulder...this is exactly how my backhand goes, so I'm performing this the ""lefty way."" Shouldn't this mean that a left-handed golfer should have the same hand positioning, also swinging up to the left shoulder from the bottom right side of the body? I mean that's how I also golf. **BUT NO**, the apparently ""correct"" way for a lefty to swing a golf club is to stand to the right of the ball (from the POV of someone standing directly behind you), with you left hand on bottom and right hand on top--the complete opposite of how I golf. 

**So what you're telling me is that if you take a left-handed tennis backhand, replace the racket with a golf club, and perform the same swinging motion, you're performing a right-handed golf swing?**

Suddenly a righty friend looked really confused at all of us eating. He asked ""wait...are you ALL left-handed?"" Interestingly enough, none of us had really paid attention.

He then flipped (not in a bad way, just amazed) because statistically that was mind-blowing to him. We then ""informed"" him of the other lefties in our group.

The guitars from top left(of course):
 
1- Seagull S6 Cedar, not a full dreadnought but a beautiful mellow acoustic.

2- Hagstrom Swede, sounds a lot more like a Gibson than any Epiphone I've heard ever has. Heavy, lots of tones, looks awesome.

3- Epiphone SG, one of the really cheap ones. Sounds like crap, looks like crap, plays like crap. Avoid these turd mountains!

4- Cort Artisan 5 string bass, I love this thing, the B string just sounds evil and the neck is comfy. Requires spare batteries to be kept to avoid down-time, no battery no sound. 

5- The shitty acoustic I take to music festivals because I wont take the Seagull there. Literally cost $20, it is decorated with all those free stickers bands hand out, and beer bottle caps. Made purely of plastic and plywood.

6- Cort acoustic, I dont play it because the Seagull is way better. 

Also pictured! My Kurt Cobain ""Action Figure"". He's playing a Fender Jag-Stang, which never went on sale in lefty :-(

So, I bought [this left-handed mouse](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-hand-edition/) from Razor, and it's pretty awesome.  It fits my hand nicely, handles smooth, no complaints with performance.  It's just that it's huge and has like an 8 foot cord, so I'm not taking it anywhere with me.  I just leave it at my desk, and have a smaller, cordless mouse I keep in my bag for when I'm on the go.

Since the Razor is automatically a left-handed mouse, it works normally when my computer is set to right-handed mode.  But since the normal mouse is automatically right-handed, I need to change my computer setting to switch the left and right clicks.

So basically, my issue is that every time I switch which mouse I'm using, I need to go into my settings and switch the clicks again, which can be pretty annoying, since I'll inevitably click the wrong mouse button somewhere along the way.  What I'd like to do is somehow reprogram the Razor so that it functions just like a normal right-handed mouse, and then I can just permanently have the setting switched on my laptop.

Now: I am [cross-dominant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dominance). My left hand/arm feels stronger and I use it for most things while my right hand/arm feels more accurate and I use it for writing, using the PC mouse, throwing objects, cutting and things that need precision.

Many years later, one random day, I found out that I could write mirrored script with my left hand. It was not that fast and my hand started to hurt after a page (from lack of practice?) but the important thing was that it came naturally to me and I didn't have to think about forming letters/words. This cursive script even resembles my usual right handed handwriting.

So I'm wondering how I gained this knowledge with absolutely no practice. My brain seems to have simply granted mirror abilities to my left hand with no effort.

Playing it right-handed would allow me to pick up a random bass and jam out with someone without having to restring it (who's gonna wait for that?) and things like that, but am I completely going against my morals to learn something ""backwards""? I don't do ANYTHING right handed.

Lefty hookers ""hook"" their hands around and their writings so it doesn't smear as you write. The difference happens because of how the brain developes. Lefty pushers brains are flipped, so analytic thought, logic and other left brain functions happen in the right hemisphere of the brain. Lefty hookers actually have a more developed right hemisphere ( it's bigger than the the left side). Which are you?

The poll was submitted to /r/math and /r/southpaws, which explains the high prevalence of left-handedness.

I started the analysis by [removing some answer groups](http://i.imgur.com/X0y1KLM.png) completely, because they may be biased, useless in the analysis, or only had a single answer.

Next up, I gathered the detailed statistics. I used [Fisher's exact test](http://www.langsrud.com/stat/fisher.htm) and tested *all adjacent groups* for significance, as well as well as testing all three ""algebraist"" groups against the corresponding ""analyst"" groups. [None of them](http://i.imgur.com/FZVHZ8m.png) were close to being significant, with many of them having p-values of over 0.90. Technically speaking, that means we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the proportions being identical. Practically speaking, I don't believe for a second there truly is a statistical difference between the groups, any of them.

This would mean that among all groups with a clear and stated preference for how they [eat corn on the cob](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=345x150&amp;chl=In%20spirals%2C%20%5B191%5D%7CIn%20rows%2C%20ma%20%5B334%5D%7COther%20%5B32%5D&amp;chco=ff9900&amp;chd=e%3AV8mXDr), 66.4% eats in rows and the remaining 33.6% eats in spirals. This ignores the ""other"" group, some of which just wanted to say how much they hated the poll, how they didn't really have a preference, but mostly that they don't eat corn while it's on the cob. For details, refer to the first paragraph of this post.

For anyone interested in why anyone would do such a silly poll: I got the idea after I came across [this article](http://bentilly.blogspot.co.il/2010/08/analysis-vs-algebra-predicts-eating.html) via [a comment by ammicha](/r/math/comments/1j9ghw/between_algebra_and_analysis_are_most_people/cbch57f). Clearly, I couldn't reproduce the anecdote, which in my mind means the author had either a highly unusual sample, or there was simply subconscious copying going on between the relevant groups, perhaps due to biased influences by similar peers. I expect it's the latter, due to the perfect correlation in that sample.

**tl;dr** No differences among groups, for every one person eating corn in spirals there're two eating it in rows.",,False,,t5_2ruq7,1375189752.0,,,True,t3_1jcfui,http://www.reddit.com/r/southpaws/comments/1jcfui/results_corny_poll_thanks_for_the_submissions/,

I'm sure you all have. But today I had a new and rather demoralizing experience.

I'm an undergraduate intern in a university lab and one of my tasks is to weigh out very small samples using a micro balance. The micro balance I'm using is nicer than the ones I've used before and has a fancy double-sliding case that surrounds the balance. The problem is, the case only opens on the right side. That means I have to load the samples (held by tweezers) using my right hand. I am okay using my right hand for most tasks but I just didn't have the fine motor skills. I spilled a few samples and dropped the standard used to calibrate the balance (an absolute no-no). I felt useless and clumsy. I was close to just walking out of the lab because of the mistakes I had made.

So I guess my question to y'all is, are there any lefty researchers out there that have any advice regarding standard lab equipment? I want the experience of working in a lab, but I don't want to jeopardize the research just because I can't use the equipment.
