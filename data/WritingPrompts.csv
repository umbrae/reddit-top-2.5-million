That's where you start a sentence beginning with the letter A. Then the next sentence begins with the letter B. So, today's prompt requires you to, essentially, do the alphabet - but I'll go a little easy on you and say that it can be in any form you want: A poem, short story, whatever. It could even be a single sentence as long as each word that follows the previous word is the next letter in the alphabet. (Or, the alphabet in reverse if you want to show off!)

ADDED DIFFICULTY: Try to avoid using more than two character names. It's pretty easy to just say Zeke.

The subject is virtually ANYTHING you want to write about. Just work that alphabet in like I mentioned above. Good luck!

For example, my first lines are ""Sometimes I like to take long walks by myself. It helps calm me down. I don’t really go anywhere, but it helps to clear my mind."" 

Step three. Take the general idea of the story (mine being about geese) and spin it in an adverse manner. For example, my next line is ""That all changed, however, when the geese attacked.""

My heart was racing as it took a plunge off of the cliff. There was no stopping me now. Either I soared, or I crashed into the cold earth. I pressed the button again, and again the chime sounded. My beating pulse matched each pounding note. As the last ding donged, the door opened up. She was standing right there, in front of me, finally. I smiled slightly and spoke softly. “Elizabeth.”

Elizabeth spoke too, but she wasn’t smiling. I could feel the ground getting closer as the words I had dreaded hearing for years left her lips. “Who are you?”

“You…you don’t remember me?”

“Afraid not”

There it was. I lost control as I slammed to the floor, looking up at her from my knees, eyes watered. “How could you forget!? You told me you’d never forget!” I was screaming. Begging. Pleading. She looked down at me, and I can only imagine what she thought, seeing a complete stranger to her crying on her doorstep. She closed the door, and I stayed crying on her welcome mat staring at the wooden slab that Elizabeth had been standing behind. I stood up, and walked back to the car so I could start to pick up the broken pieces.

Anna was sitting in the cabin, watching as I got closer, my disappointment and anger more apparent with each step towards her. I got to the car and kicked the front tire. Pain shot up my leg, and I yelled the only thing I had on my mind ever since that mahogany slab slammed in my face.

**“Fuck!”** I yelled as loud as I could, my lungs letting out every last bit of air like a collapsing airbag. I myself collapsed on the ground by the car, opening the door and pulling myself in.

1345126445.0,96,self.WritingPrompts,ybk04,55-Word Challenge [Difficulty Level: HARD],98,2,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/ybk04/55word_challenge_difficulty_level_hard/,"Inspired by the Alphabet Game challenge, here's an exercise from a creative writing class I took years ago.

You'd be surprised what you can do with 55 words. Consider the following amazing story by Jeffrey Whitmore.

`Bedtime Story`

`""Careful, honey, it's loaded,"" he said, re-entering the bedroom.`  
`Her back rested against the headboard. ""This for your wife?""`  
`""No. Too chancy. I'm hiring a professional.""`  
`""How about me?""`  
`He smirked. ""Cute. But who'd be dumb enough to hire a lady hit man?""`  
`She wet her lips, sighting along the barrel.`  
`""Your wife.""`

It can be found in Steve Moss's collection, [World's Shortest Stories](http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Shortest-Stories-Murder-Suspense/dp/0762403004), which has loads of similarly high-quality examples.

The story has three characters, a plot and even a twist ending! Read the story again and consider for a moment how much information is directly conveyed by the text and how much you were left to infer. For instance the word ""affair"" is never used, and the entire back story and conclusion are mere figments of your imagination.

So the challenge here is obvious. Write a *complete* story in 55 words (title and all). The emphasis here is on plot; something should *happen*. Bonus points for surprises, ironic twists, and ""aha"" moments.

**Edit:** Wow! I never thought this prompt would take off the way it did. Thanks to all of you for giving it a go. Some of these are genius!

**THE PROMPT** - You are to create a creature that doesn't exist. Whether this creature is good or evil is up to you. Too often people rely on creatures that exist like vampires, zombies and werewolves. You are to create a totally new creature and write a short story involving it. There is no length maximum to this prompt - but there is a length MINIMUM of 750 words. There are no further limits on what you need to do with this prompt, just enjoy yourself.

**HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR ENTRY**

- Don't submit it by replying to this. Your entries should be submitted as a **NEW SELF POST**. Your entry should be preceded with [PI] before the title. This means (if you've read the sidebar) *Prompt Inspired*.
- If your submission is too long for a self post or the formatting isn't what you'd like, you can go to a place like docs.google.com (which is FREE) and host the story there.
- All entries are subject to critique and you can take those critiques and modify your story if you like, all the way leading up to the voting phase.

**THE PRIZE / VOTING** - The contest for this month will involve a $25 Amazon gift card to the victor. You have the entire month of August to enter and voting will commence on September 1st (as well a new contest will begin on that date.) I will explain on September 1st how voting will be conducted and voting will be a five day window with the winner being awarded their prize on September 6th. (If an Amazon gift card isn't your thing $25 paypal will be the alternate reward. If that isn't your thing - the equivalent Reddit gold can also be given.)

There will be one clear cut winner who will be featured in the sidebar with their winning submission for a few months. If you don't win, at least you've had a bit of fun and hopefully honed your writing chops just a bit more... and of course, there's always next month.

""As you can see, this is what your mortgage. This number is what you owe on that."" I followed his finger with my gaze as it moved rapidly across the papers. ""I see here you still owe a bit of money on your student loans and it looks like you made a considerable withdrawal a few weeks ago. Can you explain to me what exactly you were thinking, Mr. Donovan?""

""My eight-year-old daughter has cancer. It was for medical bills.""

""My condolences."" The man did not so much as flinch before pressing on. ""With that in mind you really should have informed the bank earlier.

It takes all my self restraint not to punch him in the face when he looks at me with his bland expression, as if I just told him about the weather, but I remind myself he's the only one who can help me right now, so I force myself to remain calm.

""I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan, there simply isn't anything more I can do for you at such a late stage. So as you can see, this, this and this is what you owe in total. That's about..."" He trails off while counting in his head, silently mouthing the numbers.

""Eight thousand dollars."" I answer quietly.

""Yes, that's about right. If you've read the warnings we've sent you, you should know you have until tomorrow night to pay the full amount or you're looking at losing your house.""

""I've been sleeping at the hospital for the last couple of weeks so I have not received any messages. Please, isn't there anything you can do, anything at all? How am I supposed to come up with eight thousand dollars in 24 hours?""

""I'm afraid not. You put yourself in this position, Mr. Donovan, you are the one who has to find a way out.

Annabel broke into a smile when she saw me coming down the corridor. She was the only nurse that Emma, my daughter, would let near her. Emma said the other nurses treated her like a product, she came in sick, she gets her treatment and then they ship her back home, no need to talk to or make a product laugh, but Annabel wasn't like that. I would often find the two of them sitting on the bed, laughing and playing cards. Annabel was always there after every procedure, as if they were sisters, never mind that Annabel was thirty years older and Hispanic. She seemed to be the only one who could put a smile on Emma's face. Even I couldn't do that anymore.

""How did it go?"" Her smile drops slightly, but she quickly picks it up again.

""You first."" She asked teasingly, but I couldn't help feeling like she was trying to hide something. It annoyed me what she knew I had been at the bank and that money was tight, but I had to tell her something when I asked her to watch Emma, and I didn't want to lie to her after all she has done for us.

""Not so good."" I try to soften the word with a smile, but it comes out crooked. ""Money is in short supply right now, that's all, but don't worry about us, we'll be fine."" This time Annabel's smile fell right off. She bit her lip before she answered.

""I'm afraid I have some bad news too."" She failed at masking her disappointment with a smile just a miserably as I had.

""What?! Why didn't you tell me right away? Did something happen to her?"" Annabel hurried after me as I ran into room 402.

""No, it's nothing like that, Emma is fine, she's just tired."" Despite her words my heart was thumping in my chest until I tore back the drapes around Emma's bed and saw the frail, hairless girl stirring and grunting softly, the way she always did when she woke up.

""What's wrong, dad?"" She rubbed a tired eye while looking at me suspiciously.

""Nothing, I was just... just checking on you, that's all."" I kissed her on her head and held her in my arms for a moment.

""I'm not dead yet, you know."" She rubbed the spot on her bald head where I had kissed her as if to remove any germs she may have caught. ""You know I don't like it when you kiss me there.""

""I know, I just had to make sure you still didn't lose your memory with your hair."" I teased and she stuck out her tongue at me. It struck me how red it was against her pale skin. ""In fact, I'm still not sure, I should probably make sure."" I held her down and tickled her, planting kisses on her scalp while she screeched with laughter.

""Stop! Help! I'm going to die!"" Emma wheezed, but when I let go off her she did not stop laughing.

""You're not going to die."" I told her solemnly. ""I won't let you.""

""I don't think the cancer cares what you think, dad.""

""He better, I don't think he would like me when I'm angry."" I winked at her and she gave me one of her rare smiles. ""I'll leave you alone for a minute, okay? Annabel had something she wanted to talk to me about."" When I turned around I saw she had been silently watching us with a warm smile on her face. Once we had stepped outside, Annabel was the first to speak.

""I don't know if I ever told you this, but you're a good father."" Annabel smiled.

""I don't know about that. What kind of father can't even pay his mortgage."" I felt my cheeks turn bright red, I had not meant to tell her that.

""The kind that knows she needs you by her side more than she needs your money."" That's what I've been telling myself, but hearing it from someone else sends a wave of relief over me.

""Thank you. Really, I don't know what we would do without you."" She humbly inclined her head.

""What I wanted to talk to you about is the results from the scan she took yesterday. It appears she's been having trouble with her liver."" Annabel pointed out a few numbers on a chart that meant nothing to me.

""So what does this mean, exactly?""

""She's not in any immediate danger, but she needs another operation to avoid further complications. The procedure is not difficult, but it will cost you about two thousand dollars."" I felt a cold lump in my chest that grew like a weed, covering me from the inside.

""Two thousand dollars..."" I sank down to the floor in the empty hospital corridor with my back against the wall. ""I can't do it."" Saying the words was like opening a flood gate, along with the first drop, everything else spilled out. ""I owe the bank eight thousand by tomorrow or I'm out of the house and now you're telling me my daughter might die if I can't pay the hospital another two thousand."" I laughed a bitter laughter. ""It's all falling apart. I just can't keep the pieces together anymore, they're all coming down on top of me and that wouldn't even be so bad, but Emma will get crushed with me and I can't let that happen. She deserves so much better. She deserves..."" I don't even know what I was going to say, so instead I simply sat there with tears rolling down my cheeks. 

""She deserves a full and happy life."" Annabel placed a hand on my shoulder and crouched down next to me.

""She will have it. I know things aren't looking good right now, but we'll figure something out together. We will think of something.""

""How can you say that? There's nothing to think off, the only way I could possibly make ten thousand in a day is..."" I felt like an idiot even for thinking it, but there was no other way. I wiped my tears on my sleeve and stood up abruptly.

""Is what?""

""I've got to go.""

After three hours of driving through the darkness, the blinking neon lights and the bright posters of Las Vegas hurt my eyes. When I entered one of the casinos I was surprised to see it looked just like the movies. I had never been inside a real casino before, I was never one to gamble, yet here I was with nothing but a thin wad of cash in my pocket and barely enough gas to get back home. I passed the one-armed bandits in the hall and approached the woman behind the desk.

""I would like all of this in chips, please."" I dumped the wad of crumbled bills on the counter and she looked at me for a moment. I thought I saw pity in her eyes, that she was going to tell me she could see what I was doing and that it was futile. The house always wins. But the moment passed and she said nothing, instead she took the money, counted it and handed me a small stack of chips. 

""Here you go, sir. 293 dollars."" I took the chips and headed out into the main hall. It was almost midnight by now, but the place was bustling with life. Fat men in suits smoking cigars, young men with a dangerous flash of intelligence in their eyes at the poker tables, beautiful women in long dresses playing Blackjack while scanning the room. I had never felt so out of place in my life, but I could not go back now, this was the only way. For a moment I entertained the idea of sitting down at a poker table, I had seen how much money you could make at poker if you played it right. I had played in home games since I was a teenager, but even in those games I was never among the best, no, poker wasn't my game. Instead I turned to scan the room for something else.

I wandered around for a while, watching the games, but even more so watching the people. Some of them jumped in joy as they won, some smirked while others cursed their luck as they saw their hopes and dreams get pulled away by the rake. I sat down at a Roulette table and watched as the board and the ball spun in opposite directions. It hit the edge and started bouncing around, until it finally slowed down and came to rest in a black slot.

""22 Black!"" A man in the same vest the woman at the front desk had been wearing called out.

""What is the payout for betting on a single number?"" I asked the man.

""35:1. Would you like to place a bet, sir? The next round is about to start.""

""Uhm... no thanks, maybe next round."" I couldn't do the calculation in my head, but I saw a man with a notepad and pen in hand, so I asked him if I could please borrow it. After some persuasion he agreed. I almost laughed when I saw the final number, I had to double check to make sure it was right.

""293 times 35..."" I muttered while I counted it again.

""10255."" Just enough to pay the bank, the hospital and maybe put food on the table for a few days. This could not be chance, it must be that whatever cruel gods there may be have finally decided to save me in my time of need. This was everything I could have asked for, everything I could have hoped for. I gave the pen and paper back and sat down at the Roulette table again.

""Betting this time, sir?"" He asked in a friendly manner.

""Yes, everything on twelve."" It had always been Emma's favorite number, it just could not fail me now when I needed it the most. The man spun the wheel and dropped the little white ball into the pit, making it spin and bounce while I watched it like a hawk.

""Come on..."" Someone next to me muttered, but I only stared. It started to slow down enough that I could see the numbers and everything the ball passed number twelve my heart sank in my chest, only to be jolted back to life an instant later when the ball came around again. In excruciating slow-motion, it slowed down and stopped, resting in the black slot labelled eleven.

""Better luck next time, sir."" The man said and swept every last dollar I had off the table.

~

The drive back home was the longest three hours of my life. I pulled over at a bar to get something to numb the pain, but then I remembered I didn't own a single dollar. It's just as well, I brought this on my self, everything is my fault, just like the man at that bank said. If I was a better person, a better father, none of this would have happened. I deserve every stab of pain and guilt I feel and even thinking about having a drink when my daughter had been missing me for hours without knowing where I was or when I'd be back made my guilt double. The nurse at the front desk gave me a strange glance when I barged in without a word, but did nothing to stop me.

I looked at my clock before entering room 402. 3:30 AM. Emma lay in her bed, curled up like a ball with blankets wrapped around her, only her head sticking out from her warm cocoon. Next to her in a chair was Annabel, she had a newspaper in a slack hand, but her head was tilted back and she was snoring softly. I took the chair next to hers and placed it next to Emma's bed. I clutched her hand in mine and buried my face in her blankets.

""I'm sorry."" I sobbed into her lap, I couldn't help myself. ""I'm sorry I wasn't a better father to you. I'm sorry your mother was never there for you. I'm sorry you had to wear patched clothes to school and that I had to cut your hair even though I didn't know how. I'm sorry I can't pay for this operation. I hope one day you can forgive me, even though I won't deserve it."" I felt a hand on my shoulder, but the touch made me flinch as if it was painful.

""Come, let's not wake her."" Annabel lead me outside into the corridor and we both sat down. She offered me a cigarette in silence.

""We're not allowed to smoke in here, are we?""

""No."" She said and lit the cigarette. I took it and inhaled deeply, making me cough violently, made even worse by my attempts to keep it quiet so as not to wake Emma, but at least my trembling hands steadied a little.

""So where were you?"" Annabel asked and took a drag from the cigarette.

""Drove to Vegas. I put everything on one spin of the roulette."" Annabel smiled sadly.

""I thought you might do something like that.""

""Aren't you going to ask how it went?"" She shook her head.

""You're not very good at hiding your emotions."" I chuckled through my tears.

""No, I suppose you're right. I guess this is it. Everything is done now. I'll have to sleep on the streets and go panhandling during the days. I think 'My daughter has cancer, spare a dime' has a nice ring to it, maybe it'll be all right."" It was meant to be a joke, but no one laughed.

""You don't have to do that."" Annabel said and took another drag from the cigarette.

""I don't see what else I can do. I'm out of options. I don't have so much as a dollar and the bank is about to take everything I own. I doubt they'll even leave me the clothes on my body."" Annabel offered me the cigarette, but I declined, it did not feel like the right time to increase my chances of getting cancer.

""They won't take anything from you."" Annabel reached into her front pocket and pulled out a slim piece of paper and gave it to me. It was a check signed by herself.

""Eleven thousand dollars...?"" I looked at the check and then at Annabel in disbelief. ""I can't take this money, it's not right, you barely know me."" She took my hand in hers and forcefully closed it around the check.

""Take it. You need it more than I do."" I shook my head.

""Why? You have hundreds of patients and we're surely not the first that can't pay. You can't go paying everyone's medical bills, let alone my mortgage and my loans."" Annabel took one final drag from the cigarette before putting it out and throwing it in a bin. She turned to me with a serious face.

""I'm going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone before. When I first started here as a nurse, almost twenty years ago, I did not know any of the other nurses. I was shy and did not make friends easily, but I soon connected to one of the patients. He was an old man by the name of Aaron and he had leukemia. He never had any visitors so one day I asked him about it and so he told me his wife had already died and there was no one else. I stayed with him to keep him company that night. 

After that he, like Emma, he refused to see any other nurses. I got to know him well over the next few weeks and he told me about his life, everything he had done or wanted to do and all the things he had seen, but for every passing day he grew weaker. One day looked even weaker and paler than usual when he called me into his room, but he assured me he was fine. He told me a story of how when he was a young man he had found an older man in an alley, beat and bloody, half the bones in his body broken and left to die. Aaron took the old man in, helped him to the hospital and helped nurture him back to health, never asking for anything in return. 

When the old man had recovered, he said that in return for saving his life, he would give my friend his life savings, asking only that he passed it on to 'you are good, you need it more than I'. After he finished the story he passed the money to me and told me 'you are good, you need it more than I'."" Annabel looked at me in silence for a while, then she leaned in, squeezed my hand with the check in her own hands and whispered to me.

""You are good, you need it more than I.""

We were young -- we were stupid. We didn’t think to look before we stepped out into the middle of the road; it was night, it was dark. *Maybe if I had seen the light sooner?* A bright flash. I was awake.

I looked around the hospital room that I had called home for months. In reality, it was a self-made prison. I was chained to the bed, but could go wherever I wanted. When I walked out of the room, I left a part of me behind, which kept me coming back every day. And every dark night, reminding me of how young and stupid we were.

It’s amazing how a few months can age you. My eyes had grown baggy, my skin deathly pale, I never had an appetite so I was suddenly underweight. My brown hair had lost it’s sparkle, and the smile he had loved so much never brought itself out anymore. What use was smiling in a world he wasn’t in? *Got to stay positive, Becca, stay positive for him. He’s still alive, just asleep. A deep, dark, sullen sleep.*

He was in a coma, he had been for the last three-and-a-half months since that summer night. It was our first anniversary, a year after he had finally convinced me to give him a chance. He was in love, he told me as much the first time we made it. I loved him too, I realized in the stale air that followed his confession, but I didn’t say that. I should have said it more. The only time he heard me say those two deadly words was the night of the crash. Our anniversary. The end of one great year, and the start of a terrible one.

We went to the same restaurant that we had gone on the first night; it was expensive beyond his means, but he insisted on it. When I offered to split the bill, he insisted on paying; an early show of chivalry that I appreciated. He loved me long before he asked me out, and even longer before I accepted his suggestion. *He was so resilient then. If only he could pick him self up and dust himself off like he did all those times I said no.*

The only sounds in the hospital room were of my breathing and the machine that monitored his heart. The beeping filled my head like a song; but it’s a song I’d rather turn off in exchange for him looking at me one more time, for him saying how much he loved me with one last hand brushing through my hair, for one last moment, one last kiss, one more passionate night under the dark sky by the lake. I wanted the beeping to stop, but I knew that as long as it kept going, he was alive and he was with me, and we were still invincible. Nothing would come between us; not a fight, not another man or woman, not a 17 year old kid racing his parents sports car in the black of the night.

My hand fit in his and held on tight. After that night, I never wanted to let go. The doctors told me that if I had not have let his hand slip away, we might both be in the bed with the machines keeping us alive, but together we were strong, we were invincible. In my dreams I don’t let go, and the car doesn’t hurt us, we hurt it. The boy is flung out the convertible top and lands in the hospital bed instead of us in this room with the beeping machine and stale air that I woke up to every morning. 

I didn’t hate him. He was young and stupid too. His name was Matthew, he told me when he came to visit, timid, his hand shaking. I could tell he didn’t sleep much either. Did he have the same nightmares as me? Of course he wished just as much as I did that the night had never happened, and of course he was thankful that no one had been killed. But he didn’t know how it felt to be here, in this chair, with his love’s hand in his, listening to the droning beat of a machine keeping him alive.

It was still going. BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The noise filled my head and drowned my thoughts with the idea of an alarm. It kept the same beat. The doctors told me that was a good sign; if it varied too much, it could mean the worst. *But what good is being alive if you can’t see, if you can’t feel, if you can’t think?* He would never walk again, the doctors assured me, but I just wanted him to talk again, to smile again, to be again.

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP! I jumped back in shock, the machine was coming to life. It was pounding loudly and I called out over it “Nurse! Nurse! Please! Something’s wrong!” The doctor came rushing in, flanked by two attending nurses. And went to work, I stepped back, “Tell me he’s okay. He’s okay. Okay.”

They didn’t answer, they wouldn’t answer, they were scared to. They didn’t know any better than me. *He’ll pull through. I’m right here. Together, we’re invincible.* I ran over to hold his hand, squatting under the physicians going about their work. They pretended like I wasn’t there. *I’m not invincible, I’m invisible. They don’t see me? Can’t they see how I’m hurting, how much I need them to tell me it will be alright?*

The beeps kept coming, and eventually settled. The doctor stepped back and gave me a nod. We made it. We were still here, in this dull room with wilted flowers and stale air. It was him and me, and the beeping that assured me that we were still alive.

I still dreamed of that night every time my eyes let themselves close, how maybe had I accepted his advances sooner, we wouldn’t be in the way of the car. We would have been happier sooner, and we’d still be singing songs in the shower and watching soaps on TV, and laughing at jokes only the two of us would ever understand. It was my fault. I was too proud, too cold to his advances. I did this to him, and he had saved me. He had pushed me to the curb while he took the impact. My impact. Our impact. He broke our invincible wall to keep me safe. Every morning I thanked him with a kiss on his pale lips, wishing so much that they’d be full of life like they were before that summer night.

I leaned in and tasted the chapstick I rubbed on his dry mouth the night before. When I pulled away, I saw a smile crawl up his cheeks, and I stared back down, stunned by joy.”He’s awake! Doctor! Get in here! He’s woken up!”

I pressed my lips to his, and a breath escaped his lungs, and I held it in mine for as long as I could, so as not to let it go. He was alive. He was awake. We were okay! The doctor came in and confirmed what I had thought. His eyes were still closed, but the coma was over. I held his hand tighter than ever, waiting for the lids to move and show me his charming brown eyes again. Our hands gripped on top of his chest, his lungs suddenly expanding. The smell of his breath was terrible, but it was his and I loved it. I stayed smiling down at him until finally, his eyes opened.

I didn’t say a word as he took it all in, his hand in my, my eyes on his, a smile brighter than any I had ever given crossing over my cheeks. “Rebecca, where are we?”

“We’re together.” I said gently, not sure how much he remembered of that night. “As long as we’re together we’re invincible, and right now no one can hurt us.”

“Are we…” He was struggling “in a hospital?”

I brushed his hair out of his eyes; I didn’t realize how much it had grown. “Yeah, we’re in a hospital. I’ve been here the whole time.”

“What…happened?”

*Do I tell him about the crash? That he’ll never walk again?* I could feel tears coming from deep inside, and no matter how hard I wished I could, there was no stopping them from pouring out. “It’s all my fault. It was dark. I was stupid. We weren’t walking, I was running. You said I shouldn't go, but I did. You chased after me, remember? Then there was the flash, you pushed me, I screamed as loud as I could. I ended up with a scuffed arm, you ended up in a coma. I shouldn't have run. I shouldn't have let go of your hand.   
“We were fighting about something stupid. That’s why I ran away in tears. You said ‘Becca, don’t go!’ but I did. It was dark. I was stupid. I should have listened. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault.”

I wiped the tears away, and his eyes were closed again; did he fall asleep? Did he slip back into the coma? I called out for the doctor, and held his hand. It was limp. The beeping seemed louder than ever; BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

Just let it end. Let it be over. Let him be okay. I’m still here. While we’re together we’re invincible. If we had stayed together…

The doctor was there standing over me. I looked up at him, hopefully. The machine was beeping sporadically. “What’s wrong? What’s happening?” I demanded of the doctor, then the nurses. They wouldn’t answer me. *Am I invisible again?* It was just me and the beeps, it seemed, but I wasn’t sure how long they’d be there. I closed my eyes, hoping that it was all just a dream, but the beeping stayed, coming slowly, threatening to end any moment…   
Beep…   
Beep…   
Beep…   
…   
…

I looked up at the doctor, who just shook his head, and I nodded back knowing it was over. We had died. I put my head on his sunken chest, and my tears soaked the thin white cloth. 

When I closed my eyes, it wasn’t the same dream as before. We were in the restaurant and he was smiling at me. The waitress tapped on my shoulder and held out a box. He was on his knee. The words were coming out. “Becca, will you marry me?”

**PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS**

Currently there is only one previous assignment, entitled Watson's Story and can be found by [clicking here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bwyoe/modpost_watsons_story_the_first_lesson_in/)

As with the previous assignment, this is to be completed in your own time and you only need share your story if you feel it needs sharing. Otherwise, workshop it in your own time, improve it, keep it for future use. If you DO decide to post it, make it its own post and label it with the [PI] tag.

**ASSIGNMENT**

Pulp novels and magazines were all the rage in the early 1900's. The pulps birthed many a famous character: Conan the Barbarian, Doc Savage, Flash Gordon, Fu Manchu, Hopalong Cassidy, Zorro, Tarzan... the list goes on. In fact, you can [read more about pulp fiction in this wikipedia article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine)

So we get to the nuts and bolts of the assignment with the prompt, you have two choices: Write a heroic tale. Your main character must overcome a gigantic obstacle. This takes place on another planet. Your world, your rules. You don't need to be too true to actual science, as you are writing in the mindset of what people knew of outerspace in the early 1900's. **OR** go to [this pulp science fiction title generator](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/title-o-tron.shtml) and generate a title for your story and write a story revolving around that title.

**LESSON MATERIALS**

Now here comes the fun part. I've collected, over the past few weeks, a massive amount of the, quite extinct, magazine ""**Fantastic Adventures**"" - and, they fall under public domain since the copyright registration has long since lapsed. Not only that, but its sister magazine Amazing Stories is readily available through web.archive.org. As well as a host of other quite enjoyable pulp magazines.

The idea is for your to steep yourself in the worlds presented by various authors. With the collection of Fantastic Adventures, I am giving them to you in CBR format. This is a ""comic book"" file format. You can read it with comic book viewers across all platforms. I particularly like ComicFlow for the ipad.

*BOOKS/MAGAZINES*:

- [FANTASTIC ADVENTURES Volumes 1-4](http://dropcanvas.com/6hnam) - Once extracted, these two zip files contain 30 issues from the beginning of Fantastic Adventures run. That's close to 4GB of reading. This is hosted on dropcanvas (which is run by a Redditor. If you create an account, you won't be put in a waiting queue.) If you enjoy these and want more issues, I have about 10GB more of them, PM me.
- [AMAZING STORIES and other pulp magazines](http://archive.org/search.php?query=amazing%20stories%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20AND%20subject%3A%22pulp%20magazine%22) - archive.org is a wonderful place to grab stuff like this. In fact [click here](http://archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype%3Atexts%20AND%20subject%3A%22pulps%22) to see all the pulps they have to offer. What's great is that you can download in most file formats. Click ""All files: HTTPS"" to see every single file format they offer.
- [Comic Book Plus](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=1555) is another great resource with tons of public domain pulp novels and comic books.

Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a child's laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.

A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well?

But he was agile with the English lexicon, and in just under an hour, he produced a narrative to rival any other. Charged with creating a story in which each sentence begins with the next letter of the alphabet, he methodically progressed from A to Z, relying on his kindergarten-honed skills to associate words with letters. During the process, there were difficulties, to be sure. Each sentence needed to be different in structure from the previous sentence, so as to introduce the variations in syntax that make a text interesting to read. Furthermore, our hero was tasked with presenting the reader with a compelling protagonist who is at once as good and endearing as he is dark and intriguing. Given the constraints of the exercise, however, our hero was practically forced to “tell” rather than “show” how amazing, intelligent, and damn sexy the main character of his story is. Having thus established the character profile of his protagonist, he next struggled to define the antagonist of the story. “Is it permissible,” he asked himself, “to ascribe to a concept, rather than a person, the role of ‘antagonist’?” “Just as a person can act as an obstacle to achieving a goal,” he wondered, “is it not possible for a restriction on language to serve as that hurdle, as well?” Knowing full well that his audience was more than forgiving – they are on Reddit, after all, and probably drunk and high and masturbating to pictures of cats – our hero moved on to further develop his story. Like many young men, he had a thirst for the alcohol. Maker’s Mark, purchased earlier in the evening to ameliorate the frustrations of 10 hours in the operating room, was our hero’s medication of choice. Needless to say, with each drink, the debilitating effect of CH3-CH2-OH took its toll on our hero’s ability to remain coherent. Of course (and to paraphrase Shakespeare), alcohol, at the cost of performance, does increase desire. Perseverance, then, became our hero’s guiding principle. Quitting the undertaking, 17 letters in, would indeed be a sad commentary on his ability to finish a task, after all. Recognizing this fact, he continued to write, all the while fighting the urge to collapse and sleep following a post-dinner meal of a full bag of Doritos with a side of bacon. Suffering from indulgence, scarcely conscious, and continuing to seek solace in drink, he nevertheless sought a solution to complete his endeavor. To finish, he knew he would have to ramble on, because although sometimes one grows so tired, he knows he has one thing to do – sing his song. Undeterred by his increasing lethargy and psychomotor retardation, our hero therefore continued to write his story. Very few writers, he surmised, could make it this far. With just a few sentences left though, he felt the pangs of somnium – was he still awake or was he now dreaming? Xanthochromia – fuck it – that’s one of the few words beginning with an ‘x’ that he could remember from his medical training. You have got to give him credit for knowing a word other than ‘xylophone’ that begins with an ‘x’, especially when he’s so tired and so close to falling….

I have been mulling over the idea of offering a series of writing lessons to this subreddit, in an effort to foster more writing. The difference between a lesson and a regular writing prompt will be: You are provided with a lot more context, you are provided reading materials for further study before completing the prompt, each lesson will aim to improve a particular skill (though, sometimes it will not be outlined as to which skill that is.) There are no awards, just satisfaction in accomplishing something and maybe adding more to your writing portfolio.

**ASSIGNMENT**

A lot of authors wither at the mere mention of fan fiction. However, I am of the mind that it's akin to a band doing a cover of a song with their own twist. It helps them relax, they know the general sound they should be aiming for... you get the idea. Much in the same line of thought, writing a bit of fan fiction you know the characters, you know where they live, you have a great idea of the types of things and situations they'd interact with. The only thing you need be worried with is the story itself. For aspiring writers who focus too much on world building, often the story is the thing that gets lost in the mix. So, let's toss all that world building to the side for now and focus on the world of Sherlock Holmes.

Your prompt and assignment is the following: Write an interaction between Sherlock and his assistant Watson. It will be Watson chatting with Sherlock about a previous adventure in his life. There is no limit on the length of the story. Your particular story can take place with either the old fashioned Sherlock or the modern one. Whatever inspires you.


**LESSON MATERIALS**

A wide swath of Sherlock books are in the public domain. They are free to read and are excellent written, too. (I find I always have to convince friends that even though they are over 100 years old, they are still awesomely written.)

Good news, everybody! We've hit the **10,000 SUBSCRIBER MARK!**

Oh, what a happy day. The five digit mark has been reached. This subreddit has existed for well over two years. However, when it started and for a year or so afterwards, the subscriber count stayed at about 33. I found the subreddit on July 22nd and was dismayed at how dead it was. I sent a message to the creator (LouY, who deleted his account many months ago) and asked if I could take over. He relinquished all controls. I had one goal in mind for the following year: To get at least 1,000 subscribers into the fold of writing. I am so pleased that we've hit that number ten-fold in well under one year of ""new management.""

There are quite a few people to thank for the growth, nurturing and inspiration of the community.

Obviously, the mods - /u/SurvivorType, /u/202halffound, /u/sakanagai, /u/lordmalifico, /u/AA_AgonistAgent.

They are all wonderful and for different reasons. You can see the short interview we had with /r/subredditoftheday here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1f6s3b/may_28th_2013_rwritingprompts_the_ultimate_test/

Which is just one of the ways in which our subscriber count grew. As well as having quite a few highly upvoted /r/bestof posts. In fact, our subreddit was one of the [prime reasons /r/bestof eliminated default subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y3ufx/rbestof_results_of_the_no_defaults_experiment/)

This has been such an awesome almost-first-year. We've got a lot of things planned for the coming months. NaNoWriMo prep, for example, is fast approaching. Some of you participated last year. I hope more of you join in this year. The weekly critique thread is quite popular (and was forgone this week in light of the 10k mark approaching, and because I haven't finished critiquing everyone from last week yet.) We will be testing out allowing links in the near future and, well, a lot of other fun stuff. Also, look forward to the third lesson either today or tomorrow. I will also be uploading more pulp sci-fi in smaller chunks for the users who requested it as part of the second lesson.

Cheers!

**JULY CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT**

It has been a while since we've had a contest. The prize of which is $25 (You can choose to get that via PayPal or virtual Amazon Gift Card.) You will also be able to get three months of Reddit gold. That's the most important bit, right? The prize?

*The Prompt*: Your character is a desperate homeless person. They need to somehow secure $10,000 in a day to save an estranged family member. How do they get the money? How did their family member get into such a situation? What is the resolution?

CONTEST",36,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/15usos/pi_dfτxfτy_expfτdxy_jan_contest/,"It’s a typical Tuesday night. I’m at Melissa’s house, tutoring her in physics. She has her own place and, as usual, we are both sitting on her living room couch pouring over her latest physics homework on the coffee table. The table is cluttered with papers and drinks, a jacket and a little model car that must belong to her boyfriend. At this exact moment, she is complaining about her homework. Not surprisingly, she’s having trouble discerning the difference between chaotic and deterministic systems.  In her defense though, I would have trouble learning just about anything if I was sitting on the most God-awful maroon and baby-blue floral print couch. She looks up from the piles of paper and pictures to ask me to explain it (for the umpteenth time) in terms she can understand. This might prove difficult, but I try, yet again, to elucidate to her that chaos hinges on the ability for small changes in the input to produce drastic changes in the output. That’s an important thing to remember. In essence, it’s the Butterfly Effect. She nods her little blonde head along slowly, but I think we both know she doesn’t get it. 


“Chaos happens because, as much as we try, we can never successfully predict what is going to happen,” I explain. 


“Ok... but that’s not true. We can predict the weather,” she retorts. I can’t tell if she is being sincere in her response or if she’s just trying to be argumentative.


“Ahh, but can we predict the weather more than, say a week out,” I ask, hoping she won’t actually answer. “No, we can’t. Not successfully at least. The best weather systems in the world can’t determine how the weather will act a month out with one hundred percent certainty.”


“And that is because?”


“Because too many things happen that can change it. Any little thing can drastically affect the outcome of an event.”


An exasperated sigh. 


“I just don’t understand how I’ll ever need any of this,” she complains. 


As she releases another obnoxious exhale, she rolls her eyes to convey the message that both deterministic systems and I are boring. I stand up from the couch and turn to face her.


“What you don’t understand is that this is everywhere!” I spread my arms out as I say “everywhere,” but instead of illustrating my point, all I do is knock over a cup of juice and the toy car onto the floor. She yelps and lunges to try and catch it. Fail. It spills all over her carpet. 


“Aha! See, we never could have predicted that would happen!”


Instead of acknowledging my wit, she just growls some cuss words and looks up at me.


“Thanks, Jude. Go get paper towels, please.”


“Where are they?”


“Nevermind,” she says. “I’ll use this”. She pulls her blue sweater over her head, revealing a pretty... well... revealing shirt underneath. With a flimsy white top, I could easily understand why she was wearing a sweater. I wouldn’t wear that out in public. What would you call that exactly? A bandeau? 


She’s on her hands and knees in front of me, cussing away, trying to soak up the juice so it doesn’t stain the carpet. I’m about to bend down and help her when a booming voice announces it’s presence from behind me.

“What the fuck is going on,” it explodes out.


I turn to face the largest, hulking, giant of a beast I have ever seen: Melissa’s boyfriend. My face is completely white: partly because I never heard him open the door, and partly because he is a terrifying human being. His mohawk gave him another six inches of height on his already 6’2” body. He had tattoos on his neck and arms, which were clearly visible due to the fact that his denim shirt had its sleeves torn off. He had, what I’m pretty sure was a Confederate flag bandana in the back of his oil-stained jeans, and I’m almost positive you would have trouble fitting tires over his biceps. In fact, I think one of the tattoos on his arm mentioned how he was a “strong mo’ fucka”. Fitting.


With perfect timing, Melissa leans out from behind me, still on her knees, to greet her fuming boyfriend.


“Why the fuck are you yelling” she yells back.


“I come home with you on your knees, and you’re wearing a bra in front of this jerk. Why do you think I’m fucking yelling?!”


“It’s a bandeau,” I correct him. The words escape my mouth before I can stop them and I instantly regret talking. That little comment is going to produce some negative results, I predict.


He takes a step towards me and lowers his head to closer match my pathetic height. I can feel his heated nostril breath on my face.


“What did you just say, bro,” he growls out.


“It’s a bandeau?”


He glares at me in silence for a moment before he continues.


“If you want a problem, I can give you a problem.”


“No. That is the opposite of what I want.”


He tightens his fists at his side.


“We weren’t doing anything, Trent,” Mel yells from behind me.


“Yeah,” he shouts back. “It looks like you weren’t doing anything. Tell me, do you not do anything with other guys too?” 


“That doesn’t even make sense,” she screams back.


 They’re yelling at each other and I take this opportunity to take small footsteps towards the door. I think that in all this rage my absence would hardly be noticed.


“Where do you think you’re going,” the big man thunders as he pushes me back. His one hand pushing me produced enough force to send me tumbling backwards over the table landing on my back.  Melissa screams and the guy stomps over to me. He picks me up with both hands by my my shirt, and holds me off the ground so that only the tips of my toes can barely scratch against the carpet.


“You come into my house? You mess around with my girl?”


Melissa is futilely pounding hers fists against his gargantuan back.	


“Let him go, you oaf! We weren’t doing anything,” she screams.


“I wasn’t messing around with her, I swear! She’s not even my type.” Maybe not the best choice in words.


He raises an eyebrow and then tightens his grip on my shirt.


“What’s that supposed to mean, huh?”


“Uh... I mean... she’s attractive...”


His fists tighten and he raises me higher into the air. I’m glad there isn’t a ceiling fan. That would be just a gratuitous amount of violence.


“...but, I mean... I just... I would never. I mean, maybe if she was single...”


He throws me on the ground and right before he is about to kick my head in, Melissa jumps in front of him. 


“Stop it, Trent! Just stop it! Jude and I weren’t doing anything! I wouldn’t ever even consider doing anything with him.”	


I’m hurt. Both my back and my pride. I think I landed on something too. Maybe it was that stupid Hotwheels car.


“I saw you two though. Don’t lie to me,” he barks at her before he bends down to pick me up again.


I’m lifted (rather uncomfortably) by my hair and the back of my collar until I’m on my feet.


“If you want a fight, man, you can have a fight.”



I stand up straight and he pushes me back a little. I stumble back a couple feet. I’m panicking. What am I going to do? This guy could kill a buffalo if he wanted. He’s crazy.


“I’m gonna fucking murder you.”


He takes a step towards me and I raise my arms in front of my face and slam my eyes shut, terrified of what is about to come. Instead of a smashing sensation in my facial area, all I hear is a cry for help and a thundering smash. I cautiously open one of my eyes and lower my hands. The Beast is unconscious. His girlfriend is screaming and crying. What the heck just happened?


“Oh my God! Get help,” she yells up to me. She’s on her knees next to her mister.


“What just happened?”


“He slipped! Oh my God! Call 9-1-1, please, Jude.” She’s sobbing now. It’s no longer crying. There is torrent of snot, mascara and tears streaming down her face and onto the forehead of her crumpled boyfriend.


I look down at them. He’s lying on his back, with his head leaning against the coffee table. I guess when he had slipped and fallen backwards and cracked the back of his head on the table. Now he’s unconscious. Ha! That’s what you get for being a bully.


“Don’t just stand there. Do something,” she yells at me.


So I do. I grab my physics book off the couch and put on my jacket. 


“What are you doing?” She stares up at me.


As I’m zipping up, I notice a little toy car against the far wall. So that’s what he had slipped on.


“What are you doing,” she repeats.



I walk over to the car and pick it up. The car in my palm makes me smile. Such a small car brought down such a large man. A car that wasn’t supposed to be where it was sitting anyways. Ahh, the irony. 



I turn to face the couple as the boyfriend slowly opens his eyes. Groggy and wincing, he looks up at his girlfriend, back at me, and then back at his girlfriend.


“What happened here,” he moans.


I walk towards him and place the car neatly on his chest.



“Chaos.”

First submission to this sub :) inspired by Flat Stanley)

The point is to draw the character on a piece of paper. Expression, colors, how realistic versus how cartoony it is, they're all up to you and they all contribute to the character. You have only one day. Even if you forget it in your desk, you write about it. Is it tortured and hallucinating? If it desolate for being forgotten? Has it learned a way to cope and grown stronger? The events of the story MUST be true. However, you can embellish as you wish, and portray the events through the voice of the character. 

(Any feedback on this one day being a prompt for a high school English class, as well? I think it'd be fun to see who embraces it and carries it around (image twenty teenagers carrying paper dolls around :P I think their friends would be jealous) and who has to force themselves to be even more creative by creating a story out of nothing but the inside of a backpack.)

It's a prompt that keeps on prompting!

First, if you're unfamiliar with www.tvtropes.org, their home page has a decent definition of what a trope is. Check it out for a while. Go on. [I'll wait.](http://xkcd.com/609/)

Back? Great. So here's the game:

**Trope Roulette**

1. Go to www.tvtropes.org and click the ""random"" button three times to get three articles. (I couldn't get this to ""open in a new tab"", so you'll have to do a little work to get all three open at the same time.)  
2. From your pool of three random pages, pick one to throw out.  
3. Write something that uses the other two tropes.  
4. Post your work preceded by links to *all three* tropes. Tell which one you rejected (and why if you like, but that's not required).

If you're lucky (for some definition of lucky) you'll have to challenge yourself to unify both tropes and hopefully get a worthwhile result.

Since this is a fairly new idea, there is almost certainly going to be a need for rules clarifications, so feel free to ask if anything is unclear. I'll likely be placing edits below for ""official"" rules, but I'd be interested to hear about any variants you may think of. If you know of any other ""everlasting gob-prompts"" I'd love to hear about them too.

**Edit:** Even before it gets asked: Yes, you're welcome to use all three tropes. The reason for the throwing one out is that there are some bad ones. Not duds mind you. A boring trope can be just as callenging as an interesting one. There are just some (like [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryOverwrite) and [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeDimensionalEpisode)) that I'd consider impossible mainly because they are structural/meta tropes that can't really be worked into a story.

Take one aspect from a children's story of your choosing, and create an adult fiction piece based on it. The idea is to get your reader to not figure out it was based on a children's story.

From the original assignment:

In converting the children's story to an adult short story, here are some things you might try:

Change the complexity of the language.

Change a childish component (character, action, etc) into its adult 
equivalent, whatever you decide that to be. You'll want to get rid of talking trains and animals, for instance. Maybe that means changing a talking animal into a human character.

Add detail, description, characters that you wouldn't find in a children's story.

Combine two characters into one character.

Cut parts from the story. Maybe the story has a satisfying ending and you want to leave the reader hanging.

Rearrange the order of the story.

Throw a wrench in the story: something that would never occur in a children's story.

**AUGUST CONTEST**

We have the same incentive as the July Contest: The prize of which is $25 (You can choose to get that via PayPal or virtual Amazon Gift Card.) You will also be able to get three months of Reddit gold. That's the most important bit, right? The prize?

*The Prompt*: There are services out there that will deliver a message to loved ones a few weeks after you've passed on. (for example http://deathswitch.com - give it a look) Your prompt is to write a story about one such message, the implications the message has and, well, whatever else that just popped in your head about this subject.

*Instructions*: As with the previous contests, submit your works with the title ""[PI] TITLE OF YOUR STORY - August Contest"". You have until August 31st 11:59PM PST to submit your story. If you have issue with it not showing up under ""NEW"", please contact the mods with a link to the submission on Reddit so we can approve it. You can edit it however much you like up until the deadline, take any criticisms people make to help you if you wish. You may not submit your work to any weekly writing critique threads until after the contest has ended.

Have fun and happy writing!",Moderator Post,False,,t5_2s3nb,1376001144.0,flairMP,,True,t3_1jj1jn,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jj1jn/modpost_july_contest_voting_august_contest/,moderator

I'm going to be giving away FIVE months of Reddit gold within the next week. You can snatch yourself a month by winning one of the following contests:

- BEST NEW PROMPT. Any prompt posted within the week is eligible. (Any prompt that preceded this post is ineligible.) I will determine which prompt wins based on a few factors (activity, upvotes, and a few more factors I'll tuck under my hat.)
- BEST PROMPT RESPONSE. Any responses to the prompts that are posted after this contest announcement will be eligible. However, once again, it must be within this current week cycle starting from the time of this post.
- BEST AND MOST HELPFUL CHATTER. You will notice in the sidebar the Live Chat link. Join us in chat. Or click this link: https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/writingprompts?nick=kiwi_? if you're in a browser. The best and most helpful person who chats within the week, as determined by one of our more active IRC chat mods, wins. This one is subjective but... if we get enough chatters there will be up to *THREE WINNERS.* So, come on in. Chat about anything. Please stay the week. Idle. Maybe we'll give away a random award for best idler. (I'm the current champ in that department.)
- $20 CHATTER CONTEST. Hang out in the channel. That's all you have to do. At some random point in the week, I'll check out the goings on in there. I will assign everyone I see in my chat logs with a random number. I will then use a random number generator and choose the winner based on that.

NOTE: While it would be easier on me if you use your Reddit name as your chat handle, this isn't required. However, please state in the channel on your initial arrival what your reddit name is if you're not going by your exact Reddit name! :) My logs will record it.

Even if you assumed everyone tried to get back to their real country, moving 7 billion people would take years, or decades. People would largely have to just settle in, as they waited for the huge travel backlog to work through.

&gt;It would be similar to a survival or dystopian story, people just trying to stay alive, but instead of decimating the world (aliens attack, nuclear holocaust, zombies etc) you leave the world untouched, and just move the people, arguably creating a more devastating effect.

It means the following:

&gt; [CW] - Constrained Writing. This is when a limitation (or forced useage) of a word, letter, etc. is put on the writer. You should, however, give the prompt more direction than just the constraint.

Here is a wonderful wikipedia article on the subject: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing

Now your first official constrained writing prompt: The Reverse Alphabet Game. We had fun the last time with the alphabet game and most people went with the normal direction of the alphabet. This time, start with ""Z"" and work backwards. I will paste my explanation of how to do the alphabet game:

**THE PROMPT**

One of the exercises we used to do in improv class was called ""The Alphabet Game."" That's where you start a sentence beginning with the letter Z. Then the next sentence begins with the letter Y, the next X... and so on. So, today's prompt requires you to, essentially, do the alphabet - but I'll go a little easy on you and say that it can be in any form you want: A poem, short story, whatever. It could even be a single sentence as long as each word that follows the previous word is the next letter in the alphabet.

For your ease of reference, here is the alphabet in reverse:

If you missed the previous one [simply click here to read and participate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/10vv0h/nano_prep_week_1_what_will_you_write_about/) I will be reading more of the story ideas in that thread and giving input. So if you haven't yet, feel free to throw your hat in the ring as well.

This week we are going to focus on character bios. Now remember: Participation is not compulsory. As well, you can choose to share nothing with us and merely do this on your own and keep the work to yourself. Some writers like to keep every detail to themselves unless the work is finished. This is fine and perfectly acceptable. However, feel free to respond to others or give helpful tips for this particular prep prompt.

Character biographies can be a wonderful thing. They help your develop a real relationship with a character. A good template to use is a wikipedia article on a person in history that your character might be similar to. You can learn about their childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Mark the important milestones (fights, love interests, training, relationships with friends, etc.)

Things your character biography ought to include: A name. Unless your character is nameless (a fun challenge that some writers have pulled off) you're going to want to figure this out first. A lot of people beginning NaNoWriMo often get stuck at this very point. Don't let this be your hanging point! First think of your characters parents nationalities. Maybe they're slightly hippy irish people. Their daughter is named Misty O'Brien. Perhaps they're both Finnish, however they both moved to America. Your characters real name could be Henri Hjelm but people call him ""Hen"" because of his birdlike appearance (though he's never caught on.) Maybe your characters name has no point of origin. Your characters parents might just have named you after the things they love. After all, there is a person with the real name [Marijuana Pepsi Jackson](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/34641678/ns/today-today_news/t/marijuana-pepsi-will-see-you-now/).

The name sorted, simply write a short bio with flourishes as you see fit. Elaborations where you feel the need. Add things like medical conditions (how did your character get that limp? Why does your character rap four times on a door before entering?) if they have some. Explore their parents for a little bit - maybe one of them was a carpenter and that's why your character was handy with a hammer. Perhaps your character was abandoned by his or her parents and feels like they have something to prove now that they are a single parent.

There are quite a few beneficial things about doing this: You might come up with story ideas based on other characters mentioned in the bio. You can organically create other characters that appear in your story that have a history with one of the main characters.

Whether or not you choose to participate in this weeks exercise, please upvote only for visibility sake (as self posts don't gain karma. upvotes are for visibility purposes.)

We just want to take a moment to welcome our new subscribers and let you all know that we appreciate you being here!

As for our older subscribers, you already know how much we love you.

A few things I would like to bring up. 

As /u/jetsonwriter reminded me, feedback is a great thing. We are all here to help each other. Constructive criticism can really help a writer grow. 

Please encourage each other to excel. If you don't want to say anything publicly, send them a friendly PM. That gives the author the opportunity to edit their submission without anyone knowing they accidentally left out a word.

Another thing I would like to point out is our chat room. You will find a link in the side bar. I can't promise it will always be lively as it depends on everyone's schedules, but we have had some awesome discussions and many prompts have originated from conversations there. I am always online there, but not always at my computer. If you need anything just drop me a PM.

Remember there is no *wrong* way to respond to a prompt. That's what it's all about. What does the prompt *inspire* you to write? No matter what the answer is, it's always right. 

Also, please make sure to tag your prompts. If you have any questions, just message the mods.

----

I died once. No, really, I did. I’m not talking about the death that happens for five seconds before an EMT gives you CPR and brings you back. I was truly dead. I was put in the morgue and given a death certificate and all that stuff that goes along with being dead. 

But I didn’t have any family that I knew of. I didn’t have any close friends or a significant other to miss me, to organize a funeral for me. I guess that is why they chose me. No one would question why my body wasn’t buried and why no one mourned me.

“He’s waking up” were the first words I heard after dying.

The room was so bright when I opened my eyes. All of the surfaces and furniture were either white or shiny steel. There were bright lights in the room that those surfaces reflected. I guess my eyes hadn’t been used in a while so it was very painful to open them.
A man in a white lab coat walked up to me and asked “How are you feeling?”

I tried to move a bit to test how my body was really feeling only to discover I was strapped, standing up, to a large metal slab. I looked down and saw the bindings. I struggled against them a bit. 

“Why am I strapped down?” I asked

“We didn’t want you to hurt yourself when you woke up,” said another man as he walked towards me from across the room. He was tall, thin and bald.

“I’m Seth,” he said.

“I’m Mark.”

“I know. Mark, welcome back from the dead.” The man smiled at me.
I remembered the hospital and I remember losing consciousness. I also remembered some intense and crazy dreams. Had they happened before I died? Or were they memories of an afterlife? The color red was so intense in the dreams. Fire. Screaming. Earthquakes. Intense heated winds. Had I gone to Hell? Or had I dreamt that I had gone to Hell?

“We pioneered a way to bring people back to life,” the man said. “It is a special serum that repairs the brain tissue and heals most injuries. We’ve been working on it for years. You are the first one to actually return from the dead.”

“I guess that means I owe you my life,” I said. 

“You could say that, and we do want your help,” he said.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“We’re not sure how long the serum is actually going to work on you. It’s possible that your body will revert back to its original damaged state."" Seth pointed at the man in the lab coat. ""This man, Roger, he has been making some great discoveries in the field of human/machine integration. We’d like to try adding machine parts to you to keep you alive.”

“I like the idea of remaining alive,” I said. “But after you bionic me, will I be free to go?”

“You are free to go now, but I wouldn’t advise it. I think your best chance at a full afterlife is to stick with us.”

I agreed and spent the next few months going under for surgery and waking up to tests of strength and endurance. Every time I came back from surgery, I had more memories of that horrible place.  I remembered walking through fire, feeling my skin boil. I remembered seeing people crying. 

I saw a woman hugging a limp, dead child in her arms, once – only to have the child vanish and then reappear alive and giggling, running around the woman. “Not again,” she had cried out. How many times had she cradled that child and cried?

I told Seth about the dreams after the third surgery. “What if I went to hell when I died?” I asked. “What if every time I am put under anesthesia my soul returns to hell?”

“I don’t personally believe in Heaven and Hell,” he said. “I haven’t seen enough evidence to even suggest that there is an afterlife.”

Roger had been in the room for this conversation. His eyes went wide as if in terror. “Boss,” he said, “the others we’ve tried this on, well, they all had religious affiliations. We’ve had Christians, Jews, Muslims, and even a Jainist.”

“What does that have to do with anything?” asked Seth, a bit of annoyance showing on his face.

“Well, Mark didn’t have anything like that listed. Mark, did you go to church?” he asked me.

“I think you went to Hell,” said Roger. “I think the reason we were able to get you back from the dead is that you wanted to escape. Everyone else went to Heaven and didn’t want to leave.”

“You’re being a superstitious kook,” Seth said. He looked at me and said, “We don’t know if the others would have had dreams like yours because they never woke up. It could just be that you’re not feeling deserving of coming back to life for whatever reason and your brain is manifesting its guilt in dreams. You’re imagining Hell because you feel undeserving.”

Your detective has solved that initial case, at least in the eyes of the law.

Some time has passed since then. It could be a matter of hours, weeks, or even years. The mastermind remains free, possibly even active, during that that stretch. But your detective is still on the hunt. While pursuing a possible lead, a new case appears to break their concentration. However, they can't help but feel that this new case is somehow related to their new nemesis.

Like last time, this should be a complete story. The new case should be opened and closed within this single story. There are conditions here. First, your detective must deviate from their path in order to solve the case. And second, there must be direct communication between your detective and the mastermind (in person, phone, email, letter, etc.). Whether the mastermind is caught is up to you. Do you end your story arc here? Do you let the mastermind escape unharmed? Does the mastermind getting caught play into his grand scheme?

* Survive, at all costs. And never look inside the portfolio. 
* For the sake of myself and our beautiful children, succeed. 

The antagonists are: 

It isn't simply an organisation, as our protagonist has found out, but competing groups of antagonists -- none of whom can recognise our protagonist unless they identify her as the carrier of the portfolio. And among the passengers, any number might be an enemy. 

In the rush, our protagonist has failed to discover which stop the drop is to be made. It is written on the inside cover of the portfolio, but she herself cannot look into it. 

Now, the question is.... does our not-so-fearless protagonist peek into the portfolio? Or does she risk attempting to coax it out of another passenger, even if it means exposing herself as the target? 

Also: what the hell is inside the damned portfolio anyway?

This prompt is for those of us who are currently working on writing a novel. Think of an unrelated major event that has occured in your characters world. It might be a major world event or a major local event. Write a timeline of events. For example:

**THE BLOODY INCIDENT OF 2088**

- Jan. 5th, 2088: Rebel forces collected in a peaceful protest against the corporations that run the government.
- Jan. 12th, 2088: Tensions rise as the protests reach the week mark. Holopolice are dispersed into the area. This is good on two fronts: You can't hurt holopolice as they are just projections, they can monitor and control a situation without force.
- Jan. 13th, 2088: Someone hacked the holopolice database. They have somehow taken corporeal form... the rebels seem to have apparent control over these newly born sentinals.
- Jan. 14th, 2088: The massacre of the corporations begin. The holopolice, now being referred to as the hollowmen, are particularly vicious in their attacks.

So, essentially, you are to come up with a series of events that have some impact on a character. Even if it's their attitude, something that happened to a parent, relative, friend... something that shapes them in some particular way. It can help you understand your characters better.

Reddit formatting: To create a timeline like the above, make sure you hit ""Enter"" twice. This will start a new line. (Enter once, you will still be part of the same 'paragraph'.) On this completely new line put a dash - and a space. Then write. Each new part of the timeline only needs to have the enter key hit once, with a new dash starting the next line.

Too sore to move, she tries to focus on the ceiling fan circling above her, but the hazy moving shape only makes her more nauseated. She feels the sheets beside her to check for Brian, and jolts upright when she realizes the entire bed is soaking wet. The boat was new, but the need for a morning re-cap with Brian was old hat. Questions like ""What did I say?"" and ""What happened after the fifth glass of wine?"" were just as much a part of their breakfast as eggs. ""Brian?"" she pitifully moans into the quiet morning, voice hoarse and barely audible. There is no answer. ""Brian?"" she calls again, this time a bit louder and more pleading. Still no answer. Naked, wet, alone, she is left to put together the events from the night before on her own. Dock. Margaritas. Wine. Lobster. More Margaritas. The events of the night started to trickle in out of order, and out of focus. She wraps a beach towel around her naked body, and stands on wobbly legs, swaying back and forth with the boat. It is eerily silent as she crawls up the stairs to the top deck to find Brian. ""Brian?"" she calls again. ""Where are you? Ok, this isn't funny anymore."" Still nothing. As her eyes adjust to the morning sun, she traces the horizon line. Nothing. She turns around slowly, and then more frantically in circles as she realizes there is no land as far as the eye can see. There is also no Brian. Margaritas. Wine. Lobster. She gasps as she sees the ""slutty"" tube top laying in the puddle of stagnate water, and remembers her argument with Brian before going ashore. Cruel and indignant, she remembers spending the entire evening at the bar making sure Brian knew that other men appreciated her tube top, even if he could not. Flashes of his disappointed face sitting alone at the bar during the wet t-shirt contest dizzy her and she grabs on to the mast to steady herself. ""Oh good. You're up,"" an unfamiliar male voice from behind her booms. ""I was just finishing cleaning up Brian's mess on the bow."" She pulls the beach towel closer to her in an attempt to cover up for the stranger. ""You didn't feel a need to cover up last night,"" he says in a playful manner. ""Now let's get moving. LIke I said last night, we can be in Mexico by dinner."" He throws a half empty bottle of bleach her way. ""Now be sure to wipe down everything before we get to customs."" She screams as she recognizes Brian's lifeless body slumped over some life jackets. The stranger calmly walks to her side, and puts an arm around her shoulder, ""Come on! Cheer up. You wanted the attention. You wanted to be desired. You wanted the spectacle of two guys fighting for your affections. You got what you wanted. And I got what I wanted.

Write a short story where you use the same sentence twice. Exactly the same wording. (You can add style flairs, or emphasis on a word.) However, each usage of it must be tonally different. Allow me to show you an example that will clearly illustrate what I mean.

Imagine a story about a vegetarian who is eating meat. One of their friends, a fellow vegetarian, catches them eating said meat and says:

""You know that's meat... don't you?""

The tone there is clear. They are judgemental. Well, the story progresses and they find out that their friend is actually eating... a human (dun dun dunnnnn!) Now, while stumbling back they say the phrase again:

""You *know* that's meat... don't you?""

It's no longer a condescending sentence, but one filled with fear.

First a wonderful note: So happy to see the community has passed 5,000 subscribers! It's always great to hit milestones.

### CHAT ###

Please, please! Everyone consider joining the new chatroom. If you're on a regular computer the link is [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=WritingPrompts) and in the sidebar. If you're on a smartphone, just search for the term IRC in your app stores and you ought to find a chat client. Then connect to irc.freenode.net and type /join #WritingPrompts and get into the mix of things.

### CONTESTS ###

January will feature one writing contest for the month. The prize will be $20. This contest will be announced on New Years Day and, as is tradition, will be a months worth of time to enter - with only participants being able to vote at the end of the month on entries other than their own.

### PUBLISHING ###

While winning $20 is a fun little thing, I'm going to try to contact a few creative writing related magazines to see if we can't get a relationship with them where we hold a small contest for publishing in the magazine itself. If anyone has any pertinent contacts, please send me a PM with details so we can set something up. It would be nice for some people to see their work in print (or e-ink.)

### PODCASTS ###

Hopefully, beginning sometime in January, the podcast will begin. I've been busy with life so it hasn't begun sooner. It will likely be through blogtalkradio (a free service) and include writing advice, humorous stories from authors... and interviews with published authors and call ins from everyone here. I'm working on the first guest, but the first show will likely not feature any guests. There will, of course, be prompts during the show that could spur your creative juices.

### THANKS ###

I want to give thanks to all the wonderful work done by the other mods of the subreddit. Specifically SurvivorType and AgonistAgent who have helped keep the community thriving and active. 202halffound has done a wonderful job maintaining the CSS. Of course thanks to LouY for creating the community and allowing me in the end of July to steer the ship when we had a mere 34 subscribers. The community will thrive even more in 2013, I trust - and when it does we will likely need more mods. So keep an ear to the ground.

Thank you, lastly, to all who have ever created a prompt or written in response to a prompt. Not a day goes by that I don't drop in to see if there's something new or interesting to read and you all (amateurs and pros alike) do such a wonderful job of creating.

Have a happy and safe New Years! See you on January 1st!

I close with some words to live by:

[Read my reply to faiban who is one such person](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11z81e/nano_prep_week_4_subplots_antagonists_research_oh/c6tkmgz
): ""You needn't worry. If you've done little to no planning at all - the intent is just to write. Even if you write off the top of your head! You can do it. Just, perhaps, write a short line of beginning, middle and end so you have a hint of where to go. Point A to Point B to Point C. The whole intention of NaNoWriMo is not to necessarily write the best you can, it's to flex your writing muscle and actually finish something. The more you work those muscles, the better your future works will be. It's about learning what works and what doesn't work for you when you set out to write things that are more thought out. I do hope you participate!""

-----------

The next message I have is to those who say ""But I won't have enough time to write in November! I have school! I have work! I have a very active sex life!"" To those people I always recommend the very witty note John Hodgeman (who you may know from The Daily Show and the Mac Vs. PC ads - he was once a literary agent) - which you can [read here](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/another-example-of-the-illuminating-correspondence-between-john-hodgman-professional-literary-agent-and-his-cousin-one-josh-who-aims-to-be-a-man-of-letters
). An excerpt from the advice that is particularly thoughtful: ""*Given your demanding job as a temporary employee, it may be difficult to find the time to write the novels that I tell you to write. On the other hand, many of the great works of our time were written by those who held full time jobs—in fact, salaried positions with benefits. Melville, for example, was a famous whaler. Did you know that? Borges was a jeweler. Some critics argue that their writings were enriched by their every day, 9-5 experience in the office. But whatever the case, they MADE the time to write.*""

So, famous authors of the past made time - you can make the time! Now, granted, they might not have written their works in a months time... but if you truly feel you can't write 1,200 words or so a day, perhaps limit yourself to at least completing a novellette or novella.

----------

Throughout your writing, it would be fun to turn Reddit from distraction into resource. Create a writing username on Reddit or simply use your current one and unsubscribe from all the non writing related subreddits! (You could use Reddit Enhancement Suite to just make a filter - but unsubbing for a month is the best option as that will work across all platforms including mobile.) If your book is about dragons, subscribe to writing subreddits and maybe include the dragons subreddit. If it's about zombies, include the zombies subreddit. You get the idea - only add subreddits that will increase your creativity rather than distract from it.

Here are some subreddits you should consider checking in with throughout the duration of NaNo:

- /r/wordcount - This is a really fun one. Have everyone cheer you on throughout the month.
- /r/KeepWriting - This is a community that will help you with the nuts and bolts of things if you have a question. They can help keep you motivated.
- /r/Whatstheword - Got a word that you just can't quite remember? They can help you figure it out.
- /r/logophilia/ - Introduces you to words that are cool to expand your vocabulary.
- /r/Comedywriting - This is more a more specific reddit dedicated to humor.
- /r/nanowrimo - Well, of course this is the be all end all subreddits for the month. Tips, motivation, etc. - you will find it all here.

Got a subreddit appropriate for this list I may have missed? Comment so I can add to it!

Well, that's it! Please reply to this with any other tips you want. Get your writing spaces ready and prepped for take off! I'll post a picture of my writing area here later on today. Please post a picture of yours! Ok, I think I've used enough exclamation marks.

[PREP WEEK 2 - Getting To Know Your Characters](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11955g/nano_prep_week_2_getting_to_know_your_characters/)

-------------

Welcome, one and all, to the third week of preperation. We are already halfway through October. Don't be nervous, this will all go well! Remember - *any* writing is a victory!

So, we've covered what we want to write about. We've thought a little (or, if you're like me, a LOT) about the characters we want to write about. Now we get to do one of the most entertaining parts of the whole writing experience: The story outline.

There are many ways with which you may feel comfortable coming up with a plot outline. Myself, personally, I do it the old fashioned way. Pen on paper. There are programs specifically geared toward this for people who are very order orientated, though. At the end of this entry, I will list a few of them with links to the sites for download.

If you've never written an outline before, it's not that particularly hard if you know where you want the story to begin and end. It's just the middle bits some people find daunting. Creating subplots, quests, romances, etc. - but, I swear once you get down to it, it'll flow out of you.

There are different ways one can approach this. The simple chapter by chapter breakdown is probably the easiest to keep track of. I will create an example for you so you can understand. Let's say I'm writing a story about a frog that is prophecied to rule the planet. Let's also say it's just going to be a six chapter novellette. Here's how my plot outline might look for the first chapter:

**CHAPTER ONE**

- Open on a tragedy. Froggy's parents killed by humans. Froggy swears revenge.
- Fast forward five years. Froggy has learned the language of man. He infiltrates a pet shop and shows off his speaking abilities. News coverage around the world.
- Froggy gets his own show. As he is talking to his frog militia friends, he explains that phase one is complete.
- ADDITIONAL PLOT ELEMENTS TO TACKLE FOR CHAPTER ONE: Foreshadowing thought - Perhaps it was the President's motorcade that killed his parents. Have one of the pet shop owners be a really kind person and give Froggy some nagging thoughts against an all out war against the human race.


My plot outlines tend to be a lot longer than this, but you can write as little or as much as you want for each chapter. Obviously, the more you write the easier it will be to actually hit the ground running come November. Other than the standard point by point way of ordering, or the technological way (using an app that has special ordering)... another way is to design a plot flowchart. It's a very interesting method and, sometimes when I'm done doing it the way I normally do, I then draw up a flowchart much like the Princess Bride example used at this website: http://myliteraryquest.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/plot-flowcharts/

You have your assignment for this week. In the comments to this, I do not expect you to share your plot outline with us unless you really REALLY feel like you need input and don't care that we know the beginning, middle and end of your story. What would be nice to see in the comments are tips, tricks and links you have on creating plot outlines.

Share your progress with us below, maybe post some pictures of your workspace. Let's have a bit of fun with these prep threads! Any sort of writing related comment or question is welcome below.


*HELPFUL PROGRAMS*

I was going to make a list, however, /r/nanowrimo has an excellently laid out list of useful programs for distraction free writing, plotting, etc.

**SEPTEMBER CONTEST**

I got many good suggestions for a prompt for this month, but I'm going to hold off on using some of them for a little bit. (For various reasons.) So, here's the prompt for this month and the rules:

*PROMPT* - Write a short story about a futuristic dystopian society. If you're unfamiliar with what dystopia means, [read this wikipedia article on dystopian societies and what novels had them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia). This is an extremely open ended prompt, but it's to help you learn some world building. A few questions to help spark you (you can answer all or none of these): What's the average day like for a person? How does one get any sort of enjoyment in their daily life in a place like this? Can they socialize with other people? What sorts of things does the populace rally around? Why can't they change their situation?

*HELPFUL READING* - Good 'dystopian' books are classics like Nineteen Eighty Four, Fahrenheit 451, Logan's Run, Brave New World. More modern examples are The Hunger Games, Wool (a personal favorite and a quick read. Plus Hugh Howey is a self published success.), Divergent. If you don't have the time to read these things, feel free to find plot breakdowns online.

*SUBMISSION GUIDELINES* - As with the previous contest, submit your works with the title ""[PI] TITLE OF YOUR STORY - September Contest"". You have until September 30th 11:59PM PST to submit your story. If you have issue with it not showing up under ""NEW"", please contact the mods with a link to the submission on Reddit so we can approve it. You can edit it however much you like up until the deadline, take any criticisms people make to help you if you wish.

*PRIZE* - Same prize as last month ($25 PP or Amazon Gift Card.) Also, the winning submission will be read for the monthly podcast.

Have fun and happy writing!

------

**OTHER NOTES FOR THE SUBREDDIT**

New tags to be added! To foster even more creativity and to help some of the newer writers out there, we've got a couple new tags to work with:

**[OT]** - Off Topic. This is for topics that are NOT prompts. Every now and again you may have a question about the community or need some help hashing out a story. Off Topic posts are meant only for things geared towards writing or questions about the community itself. We're just going to test out this tag and see if it works out well.

**[IC]** - In Character. This is for threads where you workshop a character and get a feel for it. Got a character for a story but you aren't fully sure how they might talk or act? Post a thread like [IC] I am a bard for the our king AMA. Make sure you post a few details about your world and allow us to act like we're in your world and we will ask questions of your character (and you respond in character.)

As we are testing these tags, they won't go into the sidebar until we know that they work.

-----

**THE PODCAST**

It will be once a month. Hopefully the 15th of every month. That's the only update I have for now on that. Stay tuned.

1344801453.0,19,self.WritingPrompts,y3tuc,"[PI] The Alphabet Game- ""Another Night""",26,7,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/y3tuc/pi_the_alphabet_game_another_night/,"Amongst the quiet bundle of houses that edged the outskirts of town lay one house not quite like the others. Being an outsider, one may not notice the minuet and mundane differences, the way the blinds were tinged a slight yellow, never seen open during the day, or how the door was bleached from the sun, a subtly lighter maroon than the rest on the block from being constantly shut.

Considering that the neighborhood possessed a quaint closeness, the kind that allowed everyone to know their neighbor's business in a way that swayed towards concern as opposed to nosiness, it was not to be expected that any dark secrets were lurking within the depths of the serene community. Despite the evidence stacked against the fact that there could possibly be something wrong twisting beneath the surface, one could not be so wrong as to surmise that it wasn't.

Emily Burke, the owner of the house quite not like the others, sat at the kitchen table, staring blankly at the empty chair opposite her, tightly grasping a coffee cup in her hands. Fixated on the silence that hung above her head and settled into every nook and cranny of her small home, she closed her eyes and assured herself that it would stay that way for the rest of the night.

Granted, the children were asleep, all tucked in hours ago, surely there was nothing to be concerned with; like herself they were heavy sleepers, never stirring, always difficult to arouse in the morning. Heavy eyelids seemed to accompany this trait, constantly giving them the same strained, exhausted look that she possessed, no matter how much energy she had.

Instead of coming from some gene however, the heavy look in her eyes was now ingrained from countless nights spent awake, worrying and trying to calm the gnawing feeling scratching at her stomach. Just as she had done since many nights preceding this one, Emily sat at her table at 3am, drinking coffee and focusing on the silence that engulfed her house, waiting for it to be broken once again.

""Killer"" was not the first word to come to mind when one thought of Emily; aside from secrecy that shrouded the confines of her home, she was thought of as the ideal mother and neighbor. Lost within this facade lay a darkness that swirled within her, churning and eating at her sanity, stealing her sleep.

Most of the blame she placed once again on genetics, the tendency to erupt in anger or be to swift to raise her hand when her children; blaming her mother for passing on some formidable disease that had lain dormant within her until her later years. Needless to say, she refused to blame her own body and instead blamed the her husband for slowly chipping away at the wall that caged the problem within her.

Outwardly their marriage had appeared perfect, filled with what anyone could dream to have; however a cloud of mutual abuse bubbled beneath the surface before slowly boiling over. People simply would have never guessed that the walls of their house held years of muffled fights and countless physical and emotional jabs.

Quickly enough, their problems with climaxed, reaching an unpredictably terrible zenith that now confined Emily to her home for most of the day, shielding herself from pestering questions and locking the secret within.  

Running her fingers though her matted hair, Emily sighed with a wince as she felt it coming, the anticipation began to mount as it did when a stretched rubber band was held up to your skin; the gnawing feeling from the wait was more painful than what was being awaited.

She jumped as it began, first a low moan came from deep within the basement, followed by pleading and screaming, so much screaming; she knew it all wasn't real, all prerecorded in her mind, but every noise was as vivid as the night it happened. Tonight was no different from the others, the same muffled grunts and scratching that grew louder with each step closer to the basement; she had to make sure they weren't real, that he was still as she had left him.

Until she reached the bottom of the stairs, Emily held her breathe, flinching with each animalistic, rhyming grunt that escaped from the mouth of the door leading to the back of the basement. Vexed by the incessant noise and plagued by worry, she ripped open the door of the large, industrial freezer that lay in the back room.

Worry left her body in the form of tears as she saw him, right where he should be; slumped in the back of the freezer sat the icy blue corpse of her husband, shirt stained with various patterns of dried blood and eyes frozen wide, mouth agape in a twisted scream, pleading for a mixture of forgiveness and air.

""X""s were strewn upon his skin, carved deep from a knife that now laid buried between the tulips in the front yard, the only physical evidence remaining now stared back into Emily's eyes, scrutinizing her as she stood, shivering and staring back into his with a similar frozen expression.

Yet another night was spent, standing there unmoving, watching her husband to prevent the screaming until the small beam of sun broke through the window in the corner above, just in case the neighbors heard, just in case it was real.

Zipping up the morbid thoughts that came out at night and stocking them away until the next, Emily shut the door and made her way upstairs, waiting for her children to wake up.",,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_y3tuc,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/y3tuc/pi_the_alphabet_game_another_night/,

It's a fact of life, and at some point it will likely be a part of your characters' lives too. Writing a good sex scene is extremely difficult, especially in a larger non-erotic work where we have to see your characters as people before and after the fact (not just as horny sexbots).

There are many pitfalls and questions to ponder. Do you focus on the act itself or concentrate on the thoughts and emotions of those commiting it? Do you bring up birth control? Do you describe body parts and if so what language do you use? Using the word ""penis"" sounds clinical but pretty much every euphemism will get a laugh (usually not what you want). What is the goal of the scene? After all, sex in which your characters consummate some bond (romantic, passionate) is distinctly different from sex that humanizes them (clumsy, awkward, or dull). How do you reach your audience knowing how complex and varied human arousal can be? Put plainly, sex is complicated. Writing about sex, doubly so.

**Prompt:** Write a story/scene in which the character(s) commit (or attempt to commit) a sex act.

**NOTES ABOUT THE SUBREDDIT**

We are almost for 4k users. What I've enjoyed in particular this week was the ""continuing story"" prompt creation. Thanks to redditor kittyportals for starting the first one, ShaiTown for creating the latest *open* one and Bad_Influence63 for thinking to create a tag. The [CS] tag is now in the sidebar and clearly defined.

That said, when creating prompts feel free to combine some of the tags. For example:

""[FF][CS] Cats eyes"" - Could be a prompt about the world through a cats eyes and replies can be no longer than, say, 30 words.

""[HP][RE] Hindenburg disaster"" - Could be a historical prompt that you outline with some sentences.

Tag talk aside, exciting months up ahead. Septembers contest prompt has been sorted. The daily prompts I'll be doing in October will focus on helping you start and develop stories for Nanowrimo. Some of you may not know what nanowrimo is (head to http://www.nanowrimo.org for more details) - it stands for National Novel Writing Month. It's an annual internet-based creative writing project which challenges participants to write 50,000 words of a new novel between November 1 and 30. So beginning October 1st you will see [NANOPREP] tags pop up in the daily writing prompts I create. I aim to help you (and myself) to be so fully prepared for November that writing will be, hopefully, a piece of cake. :)

PROMPT: A good thing in a writers tool belt is misdirection.

The reader thinks: It's a criminal committing a crime. Now imagine the reader finds out that he was just a highly motivated party planner who was hired to setup a surprise party, but lost the key and had to break in through the 10 story window. (Then he gets shot because he broke into the wrong apartment. Yes, this was the premise of a short story I wrote years ago as part of this very exercise.)

This line, among many others Bulwer-Lytton penned, has gone on to become a cliche of modern times.

In his honor, the [Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/about.html) was established in 1982. The contest asks entrants ""to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."" Note that ""worst"" here does not mean most shocking or depraved, violent or pornographic. Instead it means the worst authorship. These sentences are funny, but only in the sense that you're not ""laughing with"" the author. The ""best"" aren't funny at all, but simply make you wince in vicarious embarrassment.

Let's dissect one of [many fine examples](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/lyttony.html), the 2010 Grand Prize Winner:

    For the first month of Ricardo and Felicity’s affair, they greeted
    one another at every stolen rendezvous with a kiss - a lengthy,
    ravenous kiss, Ricardo lapping and sucking at Felicity’s mouth as
    if she were a giant cage-mounted water bottle and he were the
    world’s thirstiest gerbil.

What makes this sentence a ""winner""?

* *Inconsistent diction and tone.* The words ""rendezvous"" and ""ravenous kiss"" should never appear anywhere near ""cage-mounted"" and ""gerbil"".
* *Strained metaphors.* There are a million things you can compare a kiss to. This shouldn't be one of them.
* *Numerous long asides.* This sentence managed to win with only one, but sprinkling the sentence with unnecessary parenthetical and dependent clauses is common.
* *Plausibly serious.* Probably the hardest quality to attain, the sentence has to be (somewhat) believably coming from a well-meaning author who didn't set out to write something awful.

**PROMPT:** Write your own winning entry to the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction contest. Your one sentence can be up to 100 words, but it is recommend that entries not go beyond 50 or 60.

**EXTRA CREDIT:** Submit your entry to the actual contest. Entries are accepted year-round. You could win a small cash prize and everlasting fame.

With a couple of labored breaths he got to his feet and stood tall. The sky was an ever brightening shade of blue. He took a look at his watch, his face contorting in clear discomfort. It was 6:02 AM. 

The next four minutes would be spent in crippling anxiety. It had been eleven years since it all happened. Eleven years since Sofia had begun to look at him differently. Eleven years of marriage, of living under the same roof, of being hopelessly connected. She slept dreamlessly in the room beneath Phillip’s feet, unaware of what was transpiring. He remembered that time, the waning days of college, the fresh exuberance that she looked at life with, and the consuming fear at what he thought awaited him. She was going to run off, start teaching abroad, follow the path of children who needed her. Phillip? Well, he’d try to land a job that had air conditioning, bow his head and accept the three-walled prison that would be a gray cubicle. Who knows, maybe he would have gotten lucky and landed a beige one instead, gotten some color into his life. It didn’t matter. She was his color and she was going to walk right out on him. After another one of their unofficial dates, they hugged in the middle of campus and headed their own way, trying to get back to their rooms before midnight brought out all sorts of vagrants. He had been adamantly trying to accept his impending reality, but it wasn’t going well. Had he been more of an adult, maybe he wouldn’t have listened to the man in the suit.

“You really like her, don’t ya?” Back on the roof, it was 6:03 AM.

“You’re walking away, but you didn’t say no.” The man in the suit began to follow him. The suit was impeccable. Even after these eleven years, Phillip had still never seen anything like it since. A deep red tie nestled perfectly in the center of his dress shirt, never moving in the slightest. It was late, though, and Phillip really didn’t want to deal with anything the man had to say, even if it regarded what tortured him most. 

“Oh, come now, you may think you’re good at hiding it, but to anyone who bothers to look just a little bit harder…well…” Phillip was becoming agitated. If he could just get home, he could sleep and get past another day.  
“You’re so cold, Phillip. I hate the cold. You’ll never win her over like that.” The rage boiled. How did he know his name? Probably just some douchebag who was in one of his classes and had a flair for pranks.

“Come to think of it, though, you’ll never win her over, regardless, right?” The man hit a nerve. Phillip was not in the mood for this. Not now, not ever.

“Leave me alone, freak” seethed Phillip, through grated teeth. The man in the suit ran out in front of him and began walking backwards so they were face to face. The man was clean shaven with slightly over gelled hair that had a sheen from the overhead street lights.

“That’s no way to treat your best friend, Phil.” Phil? His name was Phillip.

“Who the hell are you, anyway?” Phillip lashed out, his brisk walk coming to a halt. He had stopped under one of the street lights. The man took a few more steps backward until he was completely ensconced in shadow.

“I just told you, Phil. I’m your best friend. And because I am, I’m going to help you get what you want. By the time you put that precious little head of yours on your pillow, Sofia will be yours.” Even in the darkness, the teeth in his crooked grin caught some of the light, seemingly floating in the space in front of Phillip. He knew Sofia’s name, too? Phillip became defensive.

“Fuck off. Go bother someone else, asshole.” Even Phillip was a bit surprised by how curt he was. The thought of sleep and his pillow motivated him to continue walking, right past the man in the suit. Maybe he wanted to get to his pillow because, somewhere, he believed what the man had said. He couldn’t remember anymore. He rounded the corner onto his block, pretending not to notice that the man was gleefully on his trail. The man hopped up on the low wall beside Phillip and began walking on it, carefully placing each foot in front of the other to keep his balance. 

“You doubt me. That’s completely understandable. Being so rude, on the other hand? That just plain hurt, Phil. You could have said, ‘I doubt you, good sir’ or ‘I do not require your assistance in this matter, helpful old chap, but I shan’t soon forget this’ but nooooo, you called me an asshole.” The man in the suit suddenly flipped himself into a handstand and continued along the wall, to Phillip’s amazement. “You know, maybe you wouldn’t need my help if you had some of those people skills I’ve heard others speak of.”

Phil caved and his shoulders slumped. “What do you want from me? I just want to get home and sleep, can’t I get that at least, tonight?” Phillip asked, his question aimed at the universe more than the man. The man launched himself off the wall and landed with precision in front of Phillip, again, perfectly situated amongst the looming shadows of the nearby buildings.

“Yes, you can! But why settle? I’ll tell you what, Phil, I’ll let you go if you allow me a simple demonstration. If, after you see my…talents, you still only seek the solace of sleep, I shall grant it. Deal?” He extended a hand out to Phillip in hopes of a handshake. The hand looked frailer than it should have been for a man his apparent age. Phillip looked at it and then back at the man. He nodded, the most approval he was willing to grant. The man rescinded his hand as a raspy chuckle escaped him. “Wonderful! I knew there was a reasonable man beneath that rugged exterior! Sit back and watch.” 

Back on the roof, it was 6:04 AM.

The man quickly twisted his body around to face the intersection and outstretched his arms. He began to wiggle his fingers as a low laugh developed in his throat, gradually getting louder.

“Here…”

Headlights appeared, headed straight for the intersection. Although far away, Phillip could hear the sound of the engine, stuck in a high pitched whine indicating unsafe speeds. Lucky guess, thought Phillip.

“it…”

Off to the side, on the intersecting street, another car appeared, also headed for the intersection. Much slower, the car seemed to be carrying two young women who were amidst laughter. Something got caught in Phillip’s throat. He felt a cold sweat break out on his neck as he began to see the possible outcomes of whatever the man appeared to be conjuring. He opened his mouth to say something, but the man beat him to it.

“comes!”

The car with the women entered the intersection and was immediately bathed in the headlights of the speeder. A split-second awareness of their unfortunate position preceded their car being t-boned in a horrific mesh of metal and sound that reverberated throughout the emptying streets. Complete dread filled Phillip’s stomach. The speeder kept a startling amount of momentum as the other car rolled violently down the street towards Phillip and the man. After a few more seconds of horrific crunching and grinding, both cars came to a stop, groans escaping both vehicular carapaces. 

“Excellent! My timing on these gets better and better. I guess what they say about practice is tr—“ Phillip burst into a sprint towards the wreckage. The man shook his head. “Still rude.”

Phillip ran up to the driver side window of the car with the women in it. He gagged as he realized he had difficulty seeing where metal ended and the women began. They writhed, mouthing incoherent words, seemingly reaching out to him. He backpedaled and placed his hands on the top of his head, completely desperate and uncertain on what he should do. The man in the suit joined him.

“Relax. It’s mostly aesthetic damage. That is, if you listen to my proposal.”

“Your proposal!? How did you do this!? I’m calling the police!” Phillip took out his phone. The man laughed.

“Yes, please do. Make sure you tell them that it was my finger waggling that really did most of the damage.” The crooked grin had returned. Phillip knew he was being psychotic, but how could this have all been chance?

An ambulance that had been four blocks away had seen the collision and arrived on the scene. The paramedics scrambled out of the vehicle and approached the devastation.

“So, Phil. Impressed? Don’t answer, I know the answer is a resounding yes. If I can do this, getting Sofia can’t be that hard, can it?” Phillip stared off, trying in vain to make sense of the last fifteen minutes of his life. He watched the paramedics pull the women from the car after confirming that the people in the speeding vehicle were only affected by non-life-threatening injuries. “I still don’t seem able to reach you. I’ll make it an even better deal, then. Accept my terms, and those two women get to live. Reject my offer…”

Both women were flatlining. Each had a paramedic working relentlessly to resuscitate, but there was no indication that it was working. “Come on, Phil, I chose you because I thought you weren’t a moron. Don’t prove me wrong, now. I’m offering you their lives AND Sofia. It’s a steal, you’re really raking me over the coals.”

""What do you want from me?” asked Phillip, not taking his eyes off of the paramedics.

“Something you weren’t even sure you had. Your soul.” Phillip tore his gaze from the destruction and looked the man in the eyes. He was now fully lit, the lights of the ambulance pouring over him in waves. His face seemed to change in every flash of the light, something Phillip would never be able to put his finger on. Phillip had heard the words, but they were asinine.

“Are you kidding?” The man reached up and turned Phillip’s head towards the wreckage.

“Does this look like kidding?” The women still showed no signs of life. Phillip couldn’t change that, could he? How could he live with himself not knowing the answer to that question?

“Deal.”

“A man of the people! That would have gotten you far down the line,” said the man in the suit. He laughed dryly as he reached into his inside coat pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. “I’ve got even better news, Phil. I’m not even collecting my part of the deal right now. Let’s face it, you couldn’t enjoy true love without a soul, could ya? And, just for good measure, I’ll let you pick the month and day when I do cash in. I still get to pick the year. Wouldn’t be much fun if I let you have all the freedom.” Phillip didn’t respond, his eyes still fixated on the scene before him. The man in the suit stared at him waiting for a reply. After a moment, he spoke again.

“You should take advantage of this offer; you really don’t want me picking the date.” More silence followed. “Nothing? Alright then, we’ll pick something random. How about…August 14th. Yes, that sounds quite reasonable. I th—“

“No.” Phillip had faced the man again. A wide grin came over the man’s face.

“Ah, a response! You have life, yet! But what’s wrong with August 14th? It seems like as good a date as any other.”

“You know damn well what’s wrong with it.” Phillip was stern and unforgiving.

“Oh my, that’s Sofia’s birthday, isn’t it? Well, that would have certainly put a damper on things. Good catch, Phil. The 15th, then?” Phillip returned to his silence. “The 15th it is! On August 15th, of a withheld year, I shall come fetch my part of the agreement. You’ll know of my arrival by the sunrise. If it rises at 6:06 AM, regardless of where you are, I am en route. I like to stick with the whole “six” relation, it doesn’t confuse people.” Another toothy grin decorated his face, but Phillip missed it. The man in the suit knew he had gotten his allotment of fun. He handed the document over to Phillip.

“Just need a single signature on that dotted line. You have no idea how many lawyers I’ve got, they really give me hell for not getting signatures.”

Phillip stared at the document. He had resigned himself to his circumstances. He didn’t believe he was turning his soul over, he simply believed that in due time, he would wake up. A nightmare induced by stress. It wouldn’t have been the first one. Still, this was all so realistic. But how? Impossible.

“Take too much longer and we might have to alter this deal. Look, they’re giving up.” One of the paramedics had her head bowed over one of the women, the defibrillator lying on its side, motionless. The other paramedic still tried, his hands pushing down on the chest of the driver. No sign of life.

The anxiety swelled in Phillip’s chest again. He turned to ask the man for a pen and found he had already extended one to him. He snatched it and scribbled his name on the line. He threw the paper and pen on the ground and quickly stepped to the paramedics.

The man in the suit called out after him. “And don’t get any bright ideas, Phil! There are worse punishments than this.”

“Shock them again!” yelled Phillip. Both paramedics looked up, defeated countenances meeting his wild gaze. 

“Sir…” said the man who had stopped performing CPR.

“Shock them again!” He was on the verge of madness. The paramedics didn’t want another incident on their hands and, deep down, they wanted to believe Phillip knew something they didn’t. The man placed the pads on the driver’s chest. The defibrillator squealed as it charged.

“Clear.” He said the words solemnly, expecting nothing. The jolt plunged into the driver’s heart. A beep left the electrocardiogram, followed by another, and another. Phillip switched his gaze to the other paramedic.

“You! Now!” The other paramedic did the same, and the same result was produced. The pulsing sounds of life were not in sync, each seeming to battle each other, each wanting life more than the other. The paramedics turned to face Phillip.

“How…?”

Phillip turned around to find the man in the suit. His gaze rewarded him with nothing. No contract. No perfect red tie. No crooked smirk. Just an empty sidewalk. Behind him the paramedics dashed to the ambulance for stretchers as a fire truck and another ambulance arrived. Back on the roof, it was 6:05 AM.

Phillip awoke the following morning in a haze, his mind desperately trying to convince him he had dreamt everything. It was 9:07 AM and he had a class that had started seven minutes before. He decided it wasn’t worth it after thinking on it briefly and instead reached for his laptop. If he hadn’t had dreamt everything that happened, the school news site would certainly mention it. As his computer booted up, he returned his head to his pillow and stared at the ceiling, doing some computing of his own.

Even if the car crash had happened, it could all be explained. A nasty wreck at an intersection, undoubtedly spurred on by college drinking, and the fortunate location of the paramedics kept the events that transpired from being impossible, just unlikely. Maybe he had imagined the whole thing. He decided he would spend the entire day in, turning off his cell phone and just reserving the day for himself. 

His welcome screen greeted him. After a quick clacking of keys, his computer accepted his password as correct and took him to his desktop, a picture of him and Sofia at a carnival reminding Phillip of the other part of his deal. He smiled faintly. She was going to do great things.

He opened up his browser and went to the school’s site. There, on the front page, in large font, were the words “Victims of Horrifying Wreck Defy Odds.” A strange cocktail of emotion afflicted Phillip. He was glad they had survived the night, but disappointed it had happened at all. He sighed loudly, almost loud enough to drown out the knock at his door.

He waited, hoping he wouldn’t have to move from the comfort of his bed. Comfort had been a hard thing to come by lately. Another knock roused him from his warm haven and forced him to the door. He threw on a ratty t-shirt and pulled the door open. Sofia stood on the other side, fidgeting with her hands, a forced smile on her face.

“Sofia? Hi, hey, uhh, why aren’t you in class?”

“I could ask you the same thing.” She laughed awkwardly and averted her gaze from Phillip. “Can I come in?”

“Yeah, sure, you want some breakfast or som—“ Phillip had already begun to make his way to the kitchen. Sofia shut the door.

“We need to talk.” Phillip stopped and slowly turned back around to face her. His mind was well aware of the deal he had signed just hours before. A healthy skepticism still resided in his mind, though.

“Everything alright?” he asked with genuine concern.

“No. Well, uh, yes, mostly, but not everything.” She still couldn’t look him in the eyes.

“Come on, Sofi, you know you can tell me anything. What’s up?”

“Well…I guess I’ll just say what I’m feeling because…” She paused, searching for something else to keep her from saying what part of her wanted to avoid. She knew there was no other way. 

“I think I love you.” Phillip felt like a sledgehammer had connected with his skull. He felt woozy, ecstatic, sick, confused, and scared all at once. An image of the man in the suit flashed in his mind, quickly giving way to the fact that Sofia had just uttered the words he had played over and over in his head over the past three years. He fumbled around for his couch, needing something to relieve him of the burden of having to stand. He leaned on the armrest, never taking his eyes off of hers, which had finally found the courage to meet his.

He looked away and exhaled. He had been unaware that he had momentarily stopped breathing. His eyes unconsciously scanned the room as he tried to put words together. After a minute, he realized the best answer was the simplest.

""I love you, too.” Sofia shook her head.

“No, I didn’t mean it like th—“

“I know how you meant it, Sofia. I love you.” The first glimmer of tears appeared in her eyes. Complete happiness engulfed the two of them. They hugged, the embrace feeling like it had never felt before. He pulled her off and kissed her, feeling more alive than he ever had.

Sofia decided against teaching abroad, knowing Phillip couldn’t follow her. She was happy, but a fracture of guilt found its way into Phillip’s mind. Phillip struggled to find consistent work. He bounced around from job to job, all the while Sofia loved him unconditionally. Her teaching career never quite panned out. She opted instead to work in the public relations department of a pharmaceutical company, deftly dodging questions and lawsuits.

The two victims of the car crash had died a few months after his fateful night, their remaining existence confined to a hospital bed. The spoils of him making the right decision. 

After three years of failure, Phillip began to hate life. Every morning, Sofia went out to work an undesirable job that had taken her as far away from her dreams as possible. She never stopped loving Phillip, though, and that drove him crazy. She never blamed him for anything. Even in the spirals of depression that gripped Phillip, the awareness that whatever misery she had to put up with was a direct result of his deal with the man in the suit, she consoled him and tried to put his mind at ease. He sought release.

Eleven years later, he couldn’t bear to look at Sofia anymore. He felt crushing guilt, an insufferable sadness at what he had caused her. His disconnected demeanor depressed Sofia. She thought herself inadequate, felt she had failed him. Knowing he had caused this only created more guilt and distance between them. It was as vicious a cycle as could come to pass.

He had spent her entire birthday away from their home. He had hoped that disgraceful act of indecency would be the final memory she had of him. On the roof, it was 6:06 AM.

He looked out at the horizon, the chirps of just waking birds echoing through the drowsy streets. The sky grew lighter. He looked back at his watch. Thirty seconds left.

“Come on, come on, come on.” He looked back at the horizon which now teased him with a blue that was quickly becoming pink. He stared intently, willing the sun to appear, exerting some sort of intangible force in desperation. The seconds ticked away, the horizon losing all trace of blueness, becoming engulfed in tones of warmth. The sun refused to make its entrance. He didn’t dare look at his watch.

“Come on,” he said again under his breath. Nothing. He turned slowly, finding the courage to look at his watch once more.

6:08. Two minutes had passed in his infinite wait. 

“Come on. Come on! COME ON!” He ripped off his watch and threw it off the roof. “Come on you son of a bitch, come collect! Come get your fucking prize!” He shook from rage and fell to his knees as the tears began to flow freely. 

“Save her!” he bellowed from the depths of the damned soul he was forced to retain. The first rays of sunlight fell onto his face, mocking his pleas. “Why!?” he screamed, the word coming out more as a shrill, animalistic howl rather than English. He collapsed entirely, clutching himself. A fall from the roof could certainly kill him, but he couldn’t escape what the man had yelled out to him at the end of their only interaction. Worse punishments than this? It was an unfathomable concept, but how could he doubt the man in the suit now?

Another year awaited him. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he didn’t have a soul. The sun broke free of the horizon entirely, it’s warmth landing everywhere but Phillip’s roof. He got to his feet and wiped the tears from his eyes. He told himself what he had told himself eight times already: Next August 15th, his contract would be fulfilled.

I remember one girl writing a peice that exposed the text messages a group of high school friends sent each other before bowling. Another (pre-med) sent longer emails between a primary care physician, patient, and cardiac specialist concerning a heart transplant. 

I'll try to look for my own, but essentially I wrote about a small group of college graduate students cooperating over research with their department professor. He would email the students together and they would then discussed his communications through email or text. Being Graduates within a small program, they also discussed each other intimately.

I remember enjoying my work after completing it, something rare as I'm just starting out. It tested various group dynamics and juxtaposed clearly different personalities. I'll look for it and try to submit if I can find it.

-best of luck. 

**e:** also ps. I remember the reason for gathering the records. One of the students in the group (as the story would have continued) died, and they had been collected to establish whereabouts, personalities, and responsibility in a fictional suit against the university.

This is a month-long undertaking, with week-long projects.
There are no passing or failing grades, just do what you can if you're at all interested in this workshop. 

In this month's workshop series, we're going to be going into character creation, starting with the world of the character, the character, side characters, any antagonists and finally a short story including them all in the week of April 25th. Every monday (give or take), I'll be posting a new workshop. This is for fun, to improve the skills of the newer writers in the subreddit and keeping the skills of the older ones sharp.


Key to a character is the world he lives in. Today, we're going to be creating your world, and your project is due by sometime next Monday.
We will be using a review system of your peers- Positive, constructive feedback from your fellow /r/writingprompts users will help clear up any issues and help you on your way to creating something. 

But world-building is a massive undertaking! It need not be- Some create as they go, others plot out every detail before committing to a story. Some create maps, others keep mental notes. It is up to you-
The most basic response to this workshop is describing the world your guy/girl/robot/smizmar/self-aware robot coming to terms with it's own existence/whathaveyou lives in. Complex answers like sketched maps, history events are also acceptable, I'm happy with either.

Your world could be ours. Your world could be a fantasy world in the iron age, or an alien moon adrift in orbit around a gas giant, or a steampunk dystopia ruled over by robotic kings, you're free to create!

-------

Well, we are almost there. It's almost November. This is the last real full Nano Prep Week. Next week will just be a fun thread.

This is the nuts and bolts week. You can do any or all of the following things for your story:

- **Write character sheets for your antagonists.** Get to know them. Why are they the antagonist? What was their life like up until this point? What are their ultimate goals in the story?
- **Subplots.** The side stories that can keep a story entertaining. Maybe your characters are on a quest to defeat an evil orc, but first they must find a key to get into his kingdom. You can even create subplots to those subplots. Sidekick A falls in love with Sidekick B when Sidekick B saves A from a perilous death. Have fun with this! It can be considered a ""break in the action."" In old school theater (really old school - [Commedia Del'Arte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte) old school) There was a thing known as a [lazzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazzi). You can employ this to relieve tension, add comic flair (if it fits into the situation.) Just remember - it's good to make your characters *real*... having them be serious or be too comical the entire time would be unbelievable. Keep your characters at least a little grounded. (Of course, with all writing advice - you can throw anything out the window.)
- **Research**! Is your story about feudal Japan? Read everything you can on wikipedia! Is your story about England in the late 1800's? Go to news.google.com - they have archives from newspapers around the early 1800's to today! Whatever the case may be, research can help you color a story, especially if it is something you don't know much about or it's in a location you are unfamiliar with. Writing about Australia but you've never been there? Go on Google Maps street view and find the names of shops that are around that area. Make note of how the buildings look. Write down descriptions of the flora and fauna in the area! It'll make it sound all the more believable!

The comment thread will be for anyone looking for advice, to give tips, to encourage and otherwise engage in bets, pledges, whatever with each other!

As always, have fun and happy writing!",,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_11z81e,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11z81e/nano_prep_week_4_subplots_antagonists_research_oh/,moderator

The surrogate was fast and powerful, but had no built in weaponry of any kind. They had lost both rifles when the beast came crashing into the clearing where they had been collecting samples of the local plant life. They had been forced to flee. His body was not fast enough, however. The beast was catching up. He clutched Amy closer and ran on.

Interface.

Jason pulled up a schematic of his robotic body and studied it as he ran. He was searching for anything that might help him defend Amy. Suddenly, he saw a way.

""You have to trust me, Amy."" he said. ""I am going to have to set you down.""

""Alright, I'm ready when you are."" she said. She didn't sound convinced.

Rerouting energy conduits and charging his capacitors to maximum he suddenly stopped and wheeled about, setting her down gently.

He turned towards the charging creature and held out his hand as a torrent of built up energy flowed from him. Blinding white bolts of pure death struck the creature in the head and enveloped it. It's body spasmed in pain as it fell to the ground, it's momentum causing it to continue to slide towards them.

At the last second Jason ceased his assault and scooped Amy back up. He deftly stepped aside as the dead creature slid past them.

""Whew."" He said to her. ""That was close.""

""I knew you would save us."" She smiled. ""I didn't know robotic surrogates could even do that!""

""Me either."" replied Jason. ""Not until I tried it! Necessity is the mother of invention they say!""

Suddenly the trees at the edge of the forest crashed to the ground as the herd broke through and into the open. Hundreds of the creatures were now stampeding towards them. They were in danger of being trampled by something they hadn't even come up with a name for yet.

Jason ran.

Ahead was a canyon, if he could make the jump across they would be safe. He was pushing for maximum speed now. He veered right towards a rock formation, using it as a natural ramp he launched into the air. He knew he was going to fall short but he was well past the point of no return now. 

Amy knew it too. She screamed.

His hand caught the far wall and smashed through the rock causing a shower of debris. They slid downwards several feet before he could halt their descent.

He heaved Amy upwards and over the rim of the canyon wall just as the rocks he was clinging to broke free, and he started to fall.

Amy landed hard, but was relatively unharmed. She crawled to the edge and looked far down into the canyon. The gleaming silver body was smashed against the rocks below.

""Oh shit."" she whispered.

She turned to look around her. Shadows darted among the rocks. 

Jason found himself back at the remote selection menu. He snatched up the first available unit he found and bolted from the charging station. Amy was alone on the mountain. He had to get back there. Fast.

He ran outside and looked towards the Kestrel bays. None were in. 

Jason ran. He was much faster than any of the other vehicles anyway. He detoured through a repair bay, scooping up a plasma field generator and an industrial grade capacitor. He plugged them into his body's receptors as he began rerouting his power systems.

He sent out a wide broadcast message to any Kestrels close to the coordinates he sent. 

There was only one close enough to matter.

""Raven here Jason, what's up?""

""Amy is up in the mountains, alone and unarmed!"" Jason replied.

""What the hell, Jason?"" she asked. ""Never mind, we'll discuss the reasons later. On our way.""

Jason ran on.

Morgan wheeled in the air, piloting the nimble Kestrel towards the coordinates indicated. It was a very fast aircraft, a compact squat body powered by multiple multi-directional jets. He punched it to maximum velocity. 

He and Raven were soldiers. Both were enhanced with cybernetic augmentations that gave them outstanding strength, speed and agility. They would need every advantage that could be provided to protect humanity on this hostile world.

The dark creatures moved with feline grace. Vaguely reptilian in appearance, they possessed a hard shell of armored black skin and a series of short stubby ridges protruding from their backs. Their low flat skulls reminded Amy of an alligator in a way, as did the rest of the sleek body. They had long curved claws, she was almost certain they could climb.  

Amy moved higher up into the rocks.

They moved towards her, catching her scent. There was nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.

Raven popped the canopy of the Kestrel as Morgan came in to land. She leaped out, aiming for the creature closest to Amy. She fired a single shot that simply ricocheted off the creature's impenetrable hide. 

""Great."" She muttered to herself, holstering her pistol and drawing her sword as she fell.

She landed in the midst of them. They hissed at her, surprised and angered at her sudden intrusion.

Jason was again approaching the canyon. The herd was now complacent and grazing peacefully as he raced through them. He reached the canyon rim and jumped. Without Amy's added weight it was not difficult to make the distance.

Raven was a blur of motion and flashing steel. The creatures kept pace. They were fast! They moved like liquid around her. Her blade simply glanced off their armored skin, but at least she had distracted them from Amy.

Morgan set the high powered sniper rifle on the rocks and took aim. He squeezed off a shot. The creature's head exploded in a cloud of red mist. 

""Gotcha!"" He yelled triumphantly.

The creatures all paused in their attack on Raven and looked his direction.

""Oh shit."" he said as he quickly cocked the weapon.

Moving as one, they turned and came for him.

Jason suddenly landed between Morgan and the charging creatures, throwing up a cloud of dust. They skidded to a halt, unsure what to make of this new gleaming silver intruder. 

One of them hissed a warning at him and started to swish it's tail slowly back and forth. 

Jason spread his arms out before him, blinding pure white energy crackling between his outstretched hands. 

His entire body was enveloped in a gleaming aura. A fine web of glowing white plasma danced around his form.

He reached out towards them, his hands glowing with power.

""Holy shit!"" said Morgan, slowly taking his finger off the trigger.

The creatures started backing away. They looked at one another uncertainly and then suddenly seeming to reach a decision, turned from Jason and ran.

They fled from the power they perceived within him, and somehow knew they could not overcome.

Amy climbed down from her perch in the rocks as the energy dissipated from Jason's body. The glow had left him now. 

She approached cautiously.

""Is it safe now?"" she asked.

""Yes, it's safe."" he replied.

She ran to him and wrapped her arms around him tightly, squeezing with all her strength.

""I knew you would come back for me!""

In that moment, more than any other, he wished he had survived the crash that had landed them on this alien world. He wished he was more than just a digital backup of himself residing in the colony's computer network. He wished he was still human.

He wished that right now he could feel her body pressing against him.

Tell my little ones I love them, and I want you to know that I love you as well. *I love you*. I can’t know the circumstances of my death, but I wanted you to receive this letter if my time came.

You were supposed to be my *Everything* but instead you carried the burdens of my sweet everything’s. The infidelity, the bottle, and the neglect. You, a caged bird by choice. 

When we were young we took a trip to Burma, we saw the after effects of a building collapse, a husband had clutched his wife dearly, trying to protect her from rubble. She didn’t make it, but I guess in some ways she did, whatever that means. And we cried, and it was the first time I had cried in years. 

That’s why I wonder if I was brave. Did at any point I wake up and protect you from the rubble? 

I know I didn’t. 

I think I’m sorry Claire, I think I want to spend a couple more lives being better to you but all of that’s hidden by  the unknown. Of Where I’m going. See you soon? I need to be near you.

A womb. Cold suet and hot bile. My black veil. *Mother.* I just want to be somewhere, with you, where we were young and pretty and green - sitting out on porches, under streetlights that burned orange in the dark like a sky full of stubborn suns, dying and fighting; kerosene in our veins, when we had mountains for teeth and we ran and sang so pretty and out of tune.

But I know I won’t be with you, and the fight in me has been gone for a long, *long* time. I’m too lovely for hell and I’m too broken for heaven. I wish that when this is all over I might sing another song with you, quietly this time before it’s all gone, but I don’t have much hope for that and I never have.

----------

 “Serves ‘em right,” was all Damian could muster, scoffing at the news he had just received. “They don’t need any help from me.”

“But they do.” Barty had served the Cloburn family for generations. His portrait never joined those of the bearers of the family name or the ash that each canvas became in time. His bust surely never joined those of the Cloburn patriarchs. Had Damian carried family pictures, Barty Patton would have been included.

Damian froze, for once by means other than the harsh winds that cleansed the streets of less stubborn refuse. The ice in his veins shielded him well from such trifles as weather. It burned even colder when he thought about his family.

“Tell me, how desperate could they be if they turned to me for help?”

“But, Damian,” Barty replied, “they didn’t ask. They can’t ask. Whether they care to admit it or not, they need you. You are still their brother.”

That hurt. The guilt had been purged long ago, replaced by rage. “Need me? Some things never change, Barty. You’re a terrible liar.” He started walking away, looking for a new alley to use.

“Damian Edward Cloburn!” shouted Barty whose hands had balled into fists. “I raised you as would have my own son. I cared for you as well as a man could care for a child. I was there when you took your first steps, when you spoke your first words. I listened to your troubles and now you’ll listen to me.”

“That name,” Damian said with a venom infecting his core, “isn’t mine. You at least remember that much.”

The shouting of that fateful night echoed through his memory. He blinked and shook the images from his mind before continuing his retreat. Barty ran after, pulling him by the shoulder with such force that it spun Damian in his tracks.

“Name or not, they are your blood and as such theirs is also your burden to bear. They are held for their debts and you are the only one they can trust.”

Damian looked into the old man’s eyes and saw the quivering irises, the distortion from the welling tears. He had been hurt far more than he deserved. It wasn’t his fault. He wasn’t the one to punish.

“Trust? What a joke… What do you need from me?” he resigned.

“Ten thousand,” the old man replied. “By tomorrow evening.”

“Ten grand? Jesus!”

Barty was as puzzled as Damian was shocked. 

“Surely you have enough,” he prodded, half-questioning.

Damian grimaced. He waved at the mounds of cardboard lining the walls of the alley, illuminated by the flames of a barrel. 

“Does it look like I have ten thousand dollars?!”

“B-but, sir, didn’t you withdraw a sum before you left? Emma and Geoffrey were convi-“

“I never took a goddamned cent of their filthy money.”

Barty realized the mistake he had made. Damian wasn’t who he needed. But he was out of options.

“Is there nothing you can do?” he pled.

Damian still wore a bitter expression from the mere thought of helping himself to his siblings’ profits.

“Why not just sell their shit? They had plenty of it. Used to just throw away larger stacks than that.”

Barty wiped his brow.

“The bank seized the majority of the estate and ‘The Egg’ has the rest.”

Damian let loose exasperated laugh, his tongue poking his left cheek as he did. He paced over to the fire and let the warmth take care of his hands.

“They’re too far gone to save, Barty. You know that.”

“I have to try, sir.”

“You do,” mumbled Damian, mulling over the devotion. “And if I don’t?”

“They know about you, too. And where to find you. As far as they are concerned, you are just as responsible.”

Damian’s outstretched fingers curled into fists. He didn’t need the barrel for heat.

He could run. He did it once before. Not far enough, but he could keep moving. Some place warmer, friendlier. Somewhere that Cloburn was just a name.

“Dammit, I was happy here!” he shouted.

“Happy, sir?”

“Happier, at least. Better than back at home.” He sighed, staring at the dancing flames. “I’ll see what I can do.”

“That’s all I ask,” Barty said, flashing the same hopeful smile he did when Damian walked out. “I’m glad to see you doing well.”

“Thanks, Barty.”

Once again alone, Barty huddled over the fire. The events replayed in his head, the angry words, the lies, the drugs. He missed his old life. Before it went to hell, that is. As his memory caught up to Geoffrey standing naked, splashed with blood, standing over his beaten sister, he kicked over the barrel and curled into a ball against the cold bricks.

The hand on his shirt collar lifted him to his feet. The owner was 6’6” easy, muscles testing his shirt sleeves. The face was long with sunken eyes.

“This way.”

Led by his collar, the bruiser dragged Damian to a black limousine. The door opened as he got near. The bruiser tossed him inside. Laying on the floor of the compartment, Damian turned his head to see a pair of black shoes, shining brilliantly. His eyes wandered up to see the round form of The Egg.

“Mr. Cloburn,” he started in a deep voice that rattled the ice chilling his beverage. “I believe you owe me some money.”

Damian started to rise when the limo lurched forward, rolling him in the side of the bench seat. The second attempt was more successful.

“Emma and Geoff owe you money.”

“The Cloburns owe. You are a Cloburn. Their debt is your debt.”

“So I’ve heard.”

The Egg smacked his lips before taking a sip of his drink.

“I get the impression you are not going to cooperate.”

“No, I’ll get your money. But I want to make it clear that they’re not my family any more. What they do is their own damned fault.”

The scotch splashed off of the cubes as The Egg swirled his glass.

“You pay this debt, their future debts are theirs alone.”

“Good. Now, can I go get your cash?”

Another sip. The glass was then placed in on a shelf by the window.

“I saw your residence.  Let’s just say I have trouble believing in your ability to pay up.”

“I said I’ll get your money,” Damian said, wary of the direction this conversation was going.

“Before you go, I’m going to need some form of… collateral.”

“Colla- I don’t have anything.”

The Egg snapped his fingers and the limo halted.

“Of course you do.”

Another snap and the doors opened on both sides. Large hands suspended on even larger arms pinned Damian to the rear of the seat with one hand covering his mouth. The Egg leaned forward and furnished a knife from a cocktail tray. As Damian struggled against the much stronger arms, The Egg carefully decided which part to collect, scraping the blade against the candidates. The left middle finger was the final choice. With a strained effort, the knife freed finger from hand while muffled screams filled the vehicle. The crime boss dangled the digit in front of Damian’s eyes for a moment before tossing it into an ice bucket.

“We’ll keep it safe until tomorrow. 5 pm. Right here, by your little home. If you don’t show, we hunt you down and we take what we take. No ice. You think about that.” He turned to one of the arms. “Boys.”

A muscular arm yanked Damian clear of the car and threw him onto the sidewalk. The impact on concrete barely dulled the intense pain of his down payment. It was only worsened when he started thinking about what took his finger from him. *Surely losing the family fortune was enough. Why did those idiots have to take up gambling, too? And with someone like The Egg, no less.*

The repeated chants of how his brother and sister deserved what was coming to them made his heart race and the blood to pour out of the open wound. One of the other men in the alley came to Damian’s aid. He was a junkie with a strip of rubber tubing to use a tourniquet. Another took a spare bandana, rinsed it at a nearby spigot, and wrapped the hand.

“I’m calling it in,” he gasped through the water his neighbors were feeding him. “I’m calling in ten.”

He blacked out, but the network woke. It happened from time to time, one of their ranks getting into some deep trouble. When Damian first showed up, they saw some rich brat running away from home. But he was quick to help out, giving his thick wool coat to one of the youths and sharing his meager stash of food. It was clear before too long that he was there to stay. The panhandlers made decent money around the city, enough to feed themselves and help out their brothers in arms. Legions of displaced citizens sent what they could from hand to hand.

Damian stood in the bedroom door a much younger man. He had just arrived home and hadn’t yet removed his coat when the screams sent him running upstairs. The needles were spread across the floor as a wild Geoff, bare as a babe, continued to strike life into Emma whose arm was still tied. When Geoff noticed the guest, he froze.

“She’s just playing.”

Damian ran into the room and pulled the woman into his arms, placing her chest against his head. There was still a heartbeat. She was just unconscious. 

“What the hell did you do to her?” he demanded.

Geoff waved his palms in front of him as he kicked the needles away, hoping that his brother didn’t notice. He could see that it didn’t work.

“We were just trying out the new shit. Wanted to see how good it was before it hit the streets.”

“Jesus, you’re selling it now?!”

Damian was furious. Geoff had no place trying to deal and dragging Emma along for the ride was a step too far.

“Calm down, bro. It was her idea. She just wanted a little extra bank.”

Emma started moving and her eyes rolled open. She looked up at Damian.

“Did you want a hit?” she slurred.

When Damian stood, disgusted, his sister fell to the ground limply, head banging into the floor. He ignored their rambling as he walked to the front door. Barty was waiting. Their eyes met and Damian could see the guilt within.

“You knew?”

Tears streamed down the butler’s face.

“How long?” he questioned further.

“Five years, at least.”

“And you never told me?”

“I thought they would stop. Forgive me, Mr. Cloburn.” 

Damian walked past, out into the cold rain.

“It’s not me who needs to forgive you. And don’t call me a Cloburn. I can’t stand to be associated with *that*.”

Barty's expression cracked a glimpse of something besides remorse. Almost a grin, or so Damian thought. A sign of hope, relief maybe, that at least one of the children would be free of the storm ahead.

Even as a dream, that night still hurt. When Damian stirred, he was greeted with a pile of cash.

“Ten thousand,” said his neighbor. “Took all day, but we got it. Hope it’s worth it. You’ll owe more than a few favors.”

“Thanks,” Damian responded, stretching out his arm to place it over top of the cash. “What time is it? How long was I out?”

The limo pulled up at the mouth of the alley.

“Long enough. Good luck out there.”

The others scattered, wanting no part of what was about to go down. Damian labored to lift himself up, errantly grabbing for support and landing his hand on the fiery barrel. When at last he stood, The Egg in his menacing rotund form waited, flanked by a pair of his thugs.

“You have something for me?” The Egg called out.

Damian collected the cash into a stack and held it up.

“Is it all there?” The Egg asked.

“Yeah. All ten grand. Every dollar needed to let my siblings go free.”

He lowered his arm, dropping the stack into the fire.

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” the crime boss shouted. “You’re dead! You hear me? Dead!”

Damian turned his back and walked further into the alley.

It turns out that writing is scary. Because we have high expectations, and we feel we are not living up to them: our writing is not good enough (see: http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1gv9ag/im_ashamedembarrassedscared_of_everything_that_i/).

But other than fear of not living up to expectations, writing is probably scary because we are naked when we do it; writing is a sort of therapy, we deal with our fears and our sorrows. 

That may be the real fear! Fear of being honest. Fear of opening up. It may be the fear that accompanies growth!

But anyway, after reading the above thread, I decided to help r/writing by writing a poem about fear.

I first recalled one of my own fears and wrote about it: 

Fear. Fear is something that plays a large role in my life. I’m mainly afraid of talking to women. We used to go out, and then I felt a pressure to ‘seduce women’. And I was just stuck, I couldn’t move. It was not something I really wanted, but I couldn’t come aware of that. I didn’t move, and I was confused. And I was much afraid, maybe even on the verge of panicking. 

Then I ordered my fingers to type:

Boy

afraid

I’m trying to get myself laid

Fear

It’s unclear

but it’s here

lost in a storm

on the sea, merely a worm

in the midst of fear you get born

a haze before my eyes

my mind is telling me lies

I look away and the moment dies

fear why are you winning again?

it’s so easy behind my pen

situation is what separates boys from men

I think it’s behind me

Safely behind a cup of tea

But still I plea

Other self 

listen to this elf

don’t put your dream on a shelf

Your hope is my hope

We are tied by a long rope

I know you were only trying to cope

With the sand that people throw

in our eyes, as to show

that we have nowhere to go

but this place at this time

in this space and this rhyme

and this face, 

and a moment that fits on a dime.

-----------------------

I think I have potential as a poet, now only to start practicing! So if anyone wants to improve his or her poetry, here's the exercise: write a poem about fear, in order to help r/writing.

If you google ""How scary would it be if"" in quotation marks, you will get many results. The stuff that follows the opening sentence can wind up being unexpected writing prompts.

With all of the bad weather recently you'd expect bruises or at least some tender areas, but, if the soul's strength is determined by the thickness of one's skin, then Larry gave the appearance, at least, of a steadfast, driven young fruit.

Yet his post-formative life, so seemingly full of purpose, gave rise to something more dogmatic and inflexible that really turned off the other fruit and vegetables in the garden. 

""I just think that we should be positive in all situations,"" Larry said to Mortimer, the sullen cucumber sitting a couple of hills down. ""I mean why be so cynical, Mort? Don't you get tired of complaining about squash vine borers and bacterial wilt?""

Mort sat silently trying to ignore Larry who had become a nuisance to those plants close by. It wasn't so much that Larry was factually wrong about embracing despondency, but it seemed that Larry was closing his eyes to the more sinister elements of the world.

No one knew why Larry seemed so detached from some of life's bitter realities, but it had gotten to the point where the others did not see Larry as being strong in spirit, but living in denial.

The others guessed that maybe he had been mishandled as a baby hothouse. Others thought he never fully came to grips with many of his brothers' and sisters' flowers falling off early before fully blooming and coming to fruition. But Mort thought whatever damage had befallen Larry, his overly optimistic outlook on life and bothersome lectures on seeing the sunny side of every situation were almost more than he could take.

""Mort, just look at Old Man Tilly over there with his basket walking in the yellow squash,"" Larry admonished. ""He looks like he is taking some of them into the house today. Good for them. They deserve more attention and I hope they enjoy their time inside the house. They are probably going to reach a ripe old age in the lap of luxury.""

Mort had enough.

""Larry, what do you think happens after Old Man Tilly comes out and takes the other fruits and vegetables inside? Don't you ever wonder what happens to them? They go in, but they never come out. It makes me shudder to think what...""

""Wonder what happens to them?"" Larry interrupted with a frenzied laugh. ""Wonder what happens to them? I think you are just jealous of the other plants out here who get taken inside, and you are sad because deep down you wish you would be next!""

""This is what I think happens, Mort. Old Man Tilly picks the plants he thinks are best acclimated for indoor life. He takes them inside and cleans them, giving them nice clothes to wear, and plays games with them until it is time for bed each night. The fruit and vegetables on the inside wake up every day to glorious, exciting, indoor activities and wonderful house treats. It must be the life! No more rain. No more blazing sun. Luxury, Mort. Luxury I tell you.""

Just as Larry had finished making his point, Old Man Tilly made his way over to the tomato vines.

""Larry! Sit still and don't say anything! Just try to go unnoticed,"" Mort pleaded.

""Why should I do that?"" Larry said incredulously and turned himself just enough so the sunlight glinted off Larry's taut skin directly into Old Man Tilly's line of sight.

""I hope he sees me! Then I can get picked up and taken inside with all our old friends, where I don't have to have these exasperating conversations with you anymore Mort. I mean, you are a good vegetable and all, but I just need something more out of my life.""

At that moment Larry felt a warm but rough hand on his back. Old Man Tilly was picking him off of his vine! A thrill like nothing he had experienced shot through Larry's multilocular zones sending shivers through his seeds.

""Mort! It's finally happening,"" said Larry in a state of near ecstasy. ""He's picking me! He's picking me! Finally, he's noticed me- one of the best and most handsome tomatoes in the lot, and I am going inside! I am going inside!""

Mort cried out, ""No! Larry! Larry! I don't want you to leave! I am sorry for being so cynical!! Please Larry, try to get out of the basket!""

""Don't worry about me,"" Larry said trying to comfort Mort. As Old Man Tilly placed Larry inside his basket, Mort could hear Larry say faintly, ""Everything is fine. Everything is going to be just fine.""",,False,,t5_2s3nb,1359680316.0,,,True,t3_17hcav,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/17hcav/everything_is_fine_jan_contest/,

Colors, description - if you're in first person, describing insanity is as easy as defeating Tron - simply have abnormal thoughts and as the narrator is insane to, the reader will not notice abnormalities that disfunction within society.

Personify things in limited third person. The drapes flew like the ghosts that whispered into his mind and the bastards that sat on the board like vultures mocking his every word.

Writing style. Sentence length can adjust pacing - long, erratic, run-on sentences for racing and incoherent thought. Short ones for simple mindedness or even disconnectedness.

Narrator describe abnormal events as normal. Questionable narration even in third person. **Experiment**

After all, insanity is not normal. It is far from normal, it is abnormal. Why should your style remain normal if you want the reader to empathize? Repetition is boring, but so is telling, grant abnormalities and inconsistencies and repetition to link the reader to the text and beyond.

The patriotic sun shined its patriotic rays through the windows of my patriotic room. I yawned, stretching my People’s arms before getting out of my People’s bed. Smiling from ear to ear, I prepared myself a glorious breakfast of Freedom eggs and Liberty sausage, with a tall orange glass of Sunshine Smiles. The Bureau of Happiness declared it a magnificent breakfast, fulfilling the quota of morning calories, vitamins, and minerals necessary for a productive working day.

After my patriotic breakfast, I scanned my fingerprint before leaping into my patriotic Dutymobile to drive to my job. All the streetlights shone green today, and traffic swelled with other patriotic workingpeople on their way to improving our society. I drove on Fairness Highway before turning off at Paradise Exit, before then taking a hard left at Egalitarian Drive.

This week, I received a favorable ticket from the Job Lottery. Today, I entered a bright white building, excited to my core to try out being an orthopedic surgeon. The receptionist people greeted me, smiling from ear to ear after I scanned myself in. We shook our State-approved handshake, our fingers interwoven between each other to signify unity. I already knew in what office I would work, having pored over the job’s Operations Manual all night beforehand. Needless to say, I felt incredibly blessed and fortunate to perform great deeds for my fellow person!

For the day, I received a total of three patients. The first one, Number 8713579, complained patriotically of a sore thumb. Smiling from ear to ear, I informed her that she suffered from Lack of Happiness Disorder (LHD), and that the State has generously found a treatment for her condition. After patriotically tending to the necessary paperwork, I administered to her a vial of bright-orange liquid: Sunshine Smiles. Citing personal experience, I persuaded her to drink two patriotic tablespoons of the solution, twice per day. I scheduled a follow-up appointment for her next doctor, which would happen sometime between 9 and 12 years from now. Smiling from ear to ear, she took the vial and left the building.

My second patient said nothing, so a nurse had to describe his condition for me. According to the 53-page report, the patient (Number 4342671) had quite a nasty, unpatriotic toothache. Again, thanks to reading my Operations Manual, I knew exactly the right treatment. I prescribed one vial of Sunshine Smiles to him. Smiling from ear to ear, he took the vial and left the building.

My third patient proved to behave most strangely! From the first time I saw him, something didn’t seem patriotic. He trembled, darting his eyes around the room. His pupils landed on the Patriot Cam located in the ceiling of my office. I looked at it too, smiling from ear to ear. The man, who couldn’t have looked any older than 0.75 or 0.8 Great Leaders, started babbling in tongues I could not understand. Looking back, I still cannot understand the guttural phrases issued forth from his unsmiling mouth. Clearly, the man was deranged, in special need of a large and patriotic dose of treatment. Thankfully, I knew exactly how to solve his problem. I scrawled out a prescription of Sunshine Smiles, drew a vial of the liquid out of a white box, and handed it to him. 

The man (who by now was shamefully calling himself “Grady”) refused the vial, instead continuing to babble incoherently to me. Smiling from ear to ear, I attempted to convince him of his patriotic duty to accept the vial. It was the patriotic thing to do, I told him as I would tell a willful child. But this was a serious case. He tried to tear himself out of the restraints, but luckily I had the foresight to add an extra lock in the seat today. Gazing at this struggling, tormented figure before me, I couldn’t help but feel the greatest sense of pity. With tears forming in my People’s eyes, I buzzed the intercom for a nurse, and Number 6920913 appeared moments later. I instructed him to administer a patriotic dosage of Sunshine Smiles, intravenously into the man’s wrist. This, I remember, is correct procedure in the Operations Manual, to be used in emergency purposes only. The nurse managed to subdue the patient, and the bright orange liquid seeped into his veins. The man calmed down, hunching his back, before finally smiling from ear to ear! My heart leapt into my throat with joy, almost exploding with patriotism. I never felt happier to help out my fellow person!

The office closed promptly at 6th Master, and for the rest of the day I patriotically covered the requisite paperwork for the next day. I recorded the quantity of vials administered, dosages given, and patients visited. I filled an invoice for another express delivery of vials, which should arrive the next day. By the time I had finished, I was the last person to leave the building; of course, the janitors would arrive soon, so I waited to hand them the keys to the office. I gave the State-approved handshake to Number 4185672, smiling from ear to ear as I gave her the keys. We documented the handshake, and I scanned my fingerprint back into my Dutymobile, pulling out of the parking lot and back onto Egalitarian Drive.

The drive home featured fewer Dutymobiles than before, unlike the inspirational sea of white that I saw this morning. The State had generously apportioned this time for all orthopedic surgeons to drive on the streets. I returned home, eager to watch some State-approved television. After the PEP Rally (Public Execution Program), PTV played its feature program: Patriotic Television Nightly. Tonight’s featured guest was Number 2363422, author of the patriotic work *Patriotism and You: The State Guide to Happiness*. I had already read the book on multiple occasions, but I felt myself on the edge of my seat the whole time, hanging onto every word of this enlightened patriot.

After the program finished, I enjoyed a patriotic supper, the favorite of all State Leaders: Equality turkey, Peace Broccoli, with a side dish of Tranquility rice and a tall glass of Sunshine Smiles. Smiling from ear to ear, I climbed into bed and fell asleep. 

Today was a fantastic, patriotic day, and every fiber of my being desperately wished for tomorrow to arrive, so I could do it all over again!

1345184495.0,15,self.WritingPrompts,yd5k4,[PI] August Contest: The Zinga Snare,16,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/yd5k4/pi_august_contest_the_zinga_snare/,"Greisha slipped into the shadows when she first heard the human footsteps tramping through the woods.

""Grammy, why don't we just set a trap for the Zinga like pappy does?"" A young female voice carried through the forest.

""Because, little one, those traps are deadly. What good is a dead Zinga?"" said a raspier, older female voice.

Greisha stayed in the shadows as they passed. She knew humans believed that if you trapped a Zinga, you could get three wishes from it. Humans also believed that the feather from a Zinga's wings could make you invisible. Humans believed this because the Zingas seemingly disappeared after being chased. However, it wasn't that the Zingas actually disappeared. A Zinga, when stepping into the shadows, can literally become a shadow. They lost their humanoid bodies and wings and became just the dark and the air in the shadow.

Humans had no qualms hunting the Zingas to near extinction. While the Zinga had humanoid bodies, the addition of wings, beaks, and other bird-like features made the humans see them as little more than animals. Zingas had complex language and societies but it was hard for the humans to see that.  Their beaks made clicking sounds when they spoke, making it hard for a human to discern what was being said - the humans likened their speech to dolphin cries and assumed it was nothing more than emotional and guttural language.

Zingas didn't have cities or houses, either. But what need had they of housing? In the night, they slipped into their shadow state and rested in that manner. If the weather was inclement, a Zinga need only to slip into a shadow. In the shadow state, they felt no cold or warmth. They became creatures of pure intellect and emotion. They even mated in the shadows - quite literally becoming one as their shadow states melded. A child would grow out of their combined shadow selves and be born into the shadow.

Greisha had been taught when she was little to hide from the humans.  When she heard one, she was to slip into shadow and stay there a long as she could. If the Zingas could have stayed in the shadows forever, they would have - but they needed food, water, and sunlight like most other living creatures.

Greisha was on her own now - she hadn't seen another Zinga in a long time and longed for a mate or even just a friend. Without anyone around to hold her back, her curiosity led her to follow these two female humans. She moved as much as she could in shadows, materializing only long enough to run to the next shadow. The forest thankfully provided ample shadows.

""Why do we need a live Zinga, grammy?"" said the young girl. Greisha could see her nearly jogging to keep up with the elderly female. As Greisha understood it, the older a human got, the slower it got just like all of the other forest animals. This woman despite her obvious age was quite a mover.

""Silly girl, you make too much noise. We'll never find one with all of the racket you are making.""

""But, grammy!"" the little one said even more loudly.

The elderly woman stopped and turned to face the little one. She squatted down so that her face was at the same level as the young one. ""Fine,"" she said. ""But you mustn't tell your father.""

""I promise,"" the little girl said in a hushed voice as she moved her head in close to the woman.

""Well, do you remember the Zinga that got away from your father?""

The little girl's head bobbed up and down.

""The Zinga didn't escape, I hid it.""

The little girl gasped. ""But pappy says we need them,"" she said.

""Your pappy sells the feathers off of the Zingas he's killed to stupid tourists. And since they don't actually do anything, he gets so little money from it. He would be better off helping me raise the pigs and work the farm. Did you know the Zingas are going extinct?""

""What does extinct mean?""

""It means, child, that if we keep killing them, there won't be any more - ever again.""

""Oh, that's bad, isn't it?""

""Yes, little one. It is. I decided to steal the Zinga from your father. I have it hiding in a shed. But it is so lonely. No one should be without friends or family. So, we need to be very quiet and find us a Zinga. We'll take it back to the shed and our Zinga will be happy.""

""I'll be very, very quiet,"" the little girl said.

That sounded very nice to Greisha, too.  Another Zinga nearby - another one of me, in need of company.  She decided then that she would volunteer herself to this human so that she could be taken to the other Zinga. She stepped out of the shadows and moved slowly towards the old woman.

The old woman pulled out a large miner's light and shone it at Greisha. Greisha stopped in her tracks and knelt on the forest floor, wrapping her wings about her. She had learned the language the humans of this area used and had been practicing trying to speak the words. She tried to say, ""Take me."" It took much effort and without a mouth, the 'me' came out to be 'e'.

The old woman seemed to understand and turned off her light. ""You heard all of that, did you?"" she asked Greisha.

Greisha nodded her head up and down - a way humans said 'yes' to one another.

The old woman walked towards Greisha, and held a hand out to her. Greisha didn't know exactly what to do so she just touched the hand with her wing. The woman made an upwards motion with her hand and Greisha finally understood that she was attempting to help her to her feet. Greisha stood.

""Now, now,"" said the old woman. ""Let us get you home."" She patted Greisha in between her back wings.

Greisha was taller than both the old woman and the young child and much more broadly built but she looked so weak as she walked along out of the forest. They left the forest and went to the old woman's farm. It made Greisha uneasy to be out of the forest. In the middle of open fields, she could not find enough shadow to hide in. But she reassured herself that she would be safe - that this old woman was trying to take care of the Zingas before they all were killed by her kind.

The little girl was instructed to go inside the main house though she put up a fight over it, saying that she 'wanted to see the Zingas hug!"" The old lady led Greisha around the back of the house to a small, green shed. Greisha at first thought it would be far too small for two Zingas but then thought there must be no light in there.

'We could remain in shadow, only coming out for meals. That must be how she hid the other one - her son could not see the other Zinga in the shadow.'

Greisha was so excited that she started to squawk and click her beak. She bobbed her head up and down and walked in place quite a few steps in front of the door. The old lady opened the door quickly and Greisha ran in head first. She was surprised to hear the door slam behind her. She was more surprised by the light, though. There were lights everywhere in the shed. Nothing made a shadow. And there was no other Zinga in there. She banged on the door with her head.

A piece of the outside door slid open, just enough for her to see the face of the old woman. ""I knew you were there,"" said the old woman. ""But I didn't lie. I do have another Zinga. We will raise Zingas instead of pigs now.""",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_yd5k4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/yd5k4/pi_august_contest_the_zinga_snare/,

Butt's littered the ground around him as he leaned forward and cupped his hands. Clicking the lighter, a small flame rose in the darkness illuminating his face for an instant and bringing a respite of warmth. 

""Damn, how much longer is this going to take"" he muttered to himself, his cigarette bouncing on his lips with every word. Earlier in the evening this job felt like a peace of cake, now it felt like he wasn't getting paid nearly enough. ""Forget it, let's just keep our eyes pinned on the hotel doors across the street"" he said to no one in particular, as one is want to do in times of dreary loneliness. Gifting himself a moment he closed his eyes, wishing he was back at home in a warm bed, a half finished scotch on one side and a beautiful woman on the other. 

He jolted suddenly at the sound of a cab door slamming. Irritated with himself, he checked the location of the cab. ""Just another failure coming home from the city, nothing more"" he mused, with more relief than he cared to admit. 

Knowing he could've missed his target put him on edge though, and he sat up a bit straighter while uncomfortably trying to keep his hands in his pockets at the same time. Leering through the abyss, he spied a hint of movement. Making her way through the large double doors, she  gracefully strode onto the sidewalk.

No one was with her, although this knowledge made him a little more nervous than it did comfortable. Only one other time had he seen her leave alone, and the thought of that night made him uncomfortable. Picking himself up from his bench, he put his cigarette out and began a casual pursuit. 

Quietly, he made sure he had everything in order. Reaching into his jacket, he made sure the safety was off. She turned the corner and he quickened his pace, he had checked earlier and this was as good as any opportunity he would find tonight. 

The few final steps slowed to a crawl in his mind as he drew the pistol and rounded the corner. Unbeknownst to the target, a pistol was slowly leveled at her skull. 

Violently, a loud clap and a bright light shot from his hand and blood landed on the pavement. ""What the fu..."" was all he could get out before the next shot him him in the face. 

""X"" was the only the story the stamp needed to tell on his photo the following morning. ""You told me he could get it done, now she knows we're coming for her.""

With his arrival came the mass departure of many of the town’s most significant inhabitants: The Browns, the Smiths, the grand old Washington clan – all gone: eastward, westward, northward, southward – anyway to escape the blistering heat, the unpalatable dryness and the sheer boredom that was South Central Iowa. Even Mayor Hibbert, the ecstatic Republican puppet who had been nonchalantly running the poor town to the ground seemed nowhere to be found, and his unconventionally large estate seemed as empty as ever. The town itself, the splendidly simplistic, arid, beige entity of Sugarcane, Iowa, was done, and its monotonous townsfolk were realizing this sooner than they had anticipated.
	I was born and raised in Sugarcane, Iowa, yet I never felt at home there. My parents had either died when I was a young boy, or were never there at all – I would never know. I had grown up with my exasperated, empty, grandmother, who never cared much about anything besides a scrawny and sour cat with no name. I was truly alone in the universe, so they say. I hung out with all sorts of hazy crowds. The upbeat, experimentally jazzy tune of Des Moines was just a short ride away, and by the ripe age of thirteen I was a maestro in all things nobody should be a maestro of. Growing up in America’s Heartland was a great breath of joy and suffering, and melancholic loneliness.
	And so, slowly, but not as slowly as one would have liked to believe, the sad town of Sugarcane, Iowa was left for dead and another solemn tribute to the robust, picturesque America of old was born. I found myself one day having to make the decision on where to go from there. I had nowhere to be, specifically. I never did. I was a natural born follower; everyday I would go through the motions, and nothing ever meant anything one way or the other. I figured that life was not pointless, just not a definite necessity worth wasting time over. I had better things to do than worry. My young mind was a Kerouacan wasteland of scattered thoughts and composed notions. 
	My bags were indifferently packed, and I departed from my little neighbourhood to the edge of the city. I had not a single idea of what I would do once I left Sugarcane, Iowa. I knew this, and I accepted this. I figured the thought would come to me in a flash of spontaneous ingenuity, an ironic stroke of brilliance worthy of a cinematically stereotyped bad-boy, with crazy ideas and a supersized heart of limitless youth and excitement. Unfortunately, I was left with nothing, and my heart remained at its original ordinary size and stature. I walked on, into the overplayed stereotypically cinematic sunset. 
	However, sooner than they had anticipated, my stroke of genius; my moment of zen; my truest understanding of life, the universe, and everything descended quickly, than gently, upon my very soul and being. It was a single second of confusion and certainty, of hopelessness and hope and the love of God and humanity and everything and anything. It was like no drug I have ever tried before or was willing to try again.
	I looked down upon my poor, unforgiveable town of Sugarcane, Iowa and its grey parks and its uncomfortably arranged houses and its dishevelled buildings. And I looked down on the way the creamy orange sun wrapped its sorry arms around my town, almost out of pity. And I knew that I knew something – what it was, I may never know. But it was something. And I knew what I had to do it. 
	I walked on, and for the first time in a long time I was worth something to myself.

**EDIT: Spacing**

-----------------------------


The bell sounded throughout the school and I carefully slipped into my desk. The teacher, a brunette woman in her mid-30 with a taut face named Mrs. Cunningham, finished writing the words “English 3” on the board. This was the 2nd month into 11th grade English and she has taken it upon herself to remind us every day of what class we were in, as if we’d forget. She turns and smiles at us and I place my hand on my chin, glancing out the window.




“Today we’ll be starting out with a writing exercise. It’s simple, and I want everyone to get out paper and pen.” She trilled.




Twirling a pen in my fingers I gaze around the room while waiting for her next instruction. Having lived in a small town most of my life I knew almost all of these kids since we were in pre-school together.



Except the new girl. She was beautiful in a subtle way. Not the lime-light type, she usually sat in the desk next to mine in the next row. Her hair was a natural deep mahogany, brunette with a hint of red. She had a soft jawline, hallowed cheeks, and full lips. Light freckles sprinkled across the bridge of her nose and her cheeks. She was very quiet, observant and reserved girl. The most reaction I’ve seen out of her was a twitch of a smile when I said something funny or she enjoyed Mrs. Cunningham’s over exaggerated reactions. 




She is absent a lot, sometimes coming back to school with her face pale and her hands shaking. But every day she wore long sleeved shirts or hoodies despite the Arizona weather. I figured she was just self-conscious of her body, trying to hide it. Maybe she was going through that phase that girls do where they feel like not a single feature on their body is good enough.




I don't know, I'm a guy, I don't know these things. My name is Alexander, Alex for short. I usually kept my hair semi-long, it flopping in my face as a wavy mess. I was told my hazel eyes were captivating, though I didn’t feel I was very much intriguing. Just a simple guy who enjoys his videogames, hanging out, and swimming. I don't get noticed by girls a whole lot, and only had 3 girlfriends in my entire life (1 of which was in middle school and lasted all of 3 weeks). Normally I take it upon myself to help out the new person but everything about this girl screamed **stay away!** She herself wasn’t off-putting, but the way she made effort to stay out of bodily contact with people or the wispy, quiet voice she rarely used called for the message of *please just leave me alone.*




“I want everyone to think of an emotion,” the teacher began, calling my attention back, “it can be any emotion you like, maybe one you wish to work on like anger or sadness, or an emotion you enjoy feeling, like love and joy. I want you to give this emotion a life. Who is Joy’s parents? How did she become Joy? What is her personality? Her favorites? How does she look? Give this thought and write a maximum of 3 paragraphs. Begin!”




I glance over at the girl, Vivian, to see her writing quickly. She leans forward, intent. We write for 30 mins, and I felt pretty good at my attempt. Vivian was called first to read and I watch her lips move more than I listen when she stands up to read.




When she sits back down her sleeve rides up, just enough for me to see why she wore them. Dark red cuts and scars lined almost every inch of what little exposed wrist I saw. She quickly pulled it back down and her green eyes met mine, a look of shame, fear, and sadness in them. All I heard was the rush of blood in my ears, and suddenly it all made sense. The days she came back she was extra careful to not let anyone touch her.



One time in English Mrs. Cunningham patted her on the back and Vivian flinched and gave a small yelp. During PE on the days she couldn’t make up any more excuses for dressing out, the gym shorts exposed bruised flesh along her legs. She always made up an excuse that she plays sports or her brother was rough-housing with her. But now, after seeing her cuts, I didn’t believe it. This girl whom I’ve seen almost every day for months now was being abused at home, and took it out on herself, and not a single person notices.



This realization made me sick to my stomach and I suddenly couldn’t view the world straight. Who would hurt this beautiful talented girl? How could someone cause her so much pain she took it out on herself as well? God, how could the PE teacher just accept her excuses without a second thought? My eyes glided over the room and I felt angry at every single person here for not noticing or caring enough to say something. But most of all I felt angry at myself for sitting next to her every day, for watching her in PE and head off to the bus, and not noticing. We both lived such different lives but she went about her days at school as if everything was alright at home. It wasn't alright, and she may never be alright.",Prompt Inspired ,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1dok49,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1dok49/pi_one_life_two_stories/,

-------------

**The Impossible Guards of Cygnus**

Dan Chase lit another smoker as he reclined in his office chair. The Hippilians were supposedly an inquisitive bunch, but business was slow. No clients meant no credits, and another week of Recyche didn’t exactly make that prospect seem enjoyable. But the smoker calmed the nerves enough to sit and wait a while longer.

The robot by the door sprang to attention, indicating a visitor. That when she entered. Five six and half of that were a pair of ivory legs that could sink a star ship. A wave of brilliant blue hair started from the hips and flowed up her petite frame, over her soft shoulders, and cresting atop a nearly symmetrical face. A pair of round sunglasses covered her eyes, but the glint of green was a dead giveaway that she wasn’t local. Between her thin, red lips was a finger of a long, white glove, formerly of her delicate hand holding out a familiar blue infocard.

Chase’s smoker nearly set his trousers on fire as it fell out of his open jaw. He quickly rubbed the smoldering end on a piece of the metal chair between his legs, and stood up straight.

“Evening, ma’am. Dan Chase, at your investigative service. What can I help you for?”

She pulled her shades lower down her narrow nose, tilting her head down to make a hint of eye contact.

“I hear you find things.”

Her voice was a wispy soprano. The words hung the air for a moment longer than they rightfully should.

“I’ve had my successes in that field. Looking for something in particular, Miss…?”

“Molly. Just Molly. And it’s someone actually.” She pulled a picture from the front of her blouse and handed it to the detective. “Petra. My sister. She had been investigating the area around Cygnus when she disappeared.”

No more explanation needed. Cygnus was one of the many areas in the sector that were marked as Red Zones. Terraforming didn’t always take, but sometimes it just made things worse. Dangerous even. The Corps forbade travel near these zones, but there were always those who didn’t want to listen. Chase had assumed anyone foolish enough to wander too close deserved whatever misfortune they found. Amazing what the prospect of income could do to change his mind.

He looked at the woman in the picture. The resemblance was uncanny. Eyes were different, but the face, the hair.

“You’re aware of my rates?”

“Yes, Mr. Chase. You so helpfully plastered your infocard with them. I’m prepared to pay your rates as well as your expenses. My sister is very dear to me, far more so than the credits. I owe her my life, after all.”

The only thing worse than a missing persons case in a Red Zone is a gorgeous client that can afford the full rate. While Chase pondered how best to allocate additional expenses to force a horizontal discount, Molly unsheathed a credit disk.

“This should cover your expenses for the time being. I’ll be monitoring the account in case your funds run low.”

So much for that plan. Chase snatched the disk out of her hands.

“Okay, Molly, I’ll get right on that. Your sister is as good as found.”

For many a detective, that would have been simply bravado. Chase, however, was particularly gifted in his field. His extensive network of contacts helped there, but he also had a knack for getting out of trouble.

His client turned to leave the office.

“One more thing, ma’am,” he called out. How do I contact you?”

She kept walking, holding the infocard up above her shoulder.

“You don’t. I’ll call you.”

As she left, the robotic door opener returned to standby. 

--------------------

If there was any place to find information on a Red Zone mission, it would be the port. Any venture out into the restricted sectors always required three things: guts, as small a team as possible, and a pilot. The last of those was hardest to come by. They were a tight knit crew, though, and if you had an in with one, you had them all.

The Ion Dive wasn’t your typical space-side bar. For starters, “bar” was a loose term. It had all the debauchery you’d expect with none of the stimulant. A hopped up pilot wasn’t getting hired. But tradition is tradition. That didn’t make it safe. Quite the contrary. While a drunkard was more prone to violence, the fact was that someone sober was far better at it.

Chase didn’t have anything to fear, though. As he stepped through the hatchway, a few familiar faces turned.

“Captain!” shouted a few.

He no longer served in the Corps, but most of the pilots were veterans themselves. His specialty had been intelligence, so he never worked directly with many pilots, but ran into his fair share of them nonetheless. He was looking for one, in particular. The tall, dark-skinned beast of a man was one of the few to remain focused on his Recyche.

“Savage,” Chase greeted his friend. “You’re looking well.”

“Blow it out your ass, Cap.”

“What was that for?”

Savage turned his head toward Chase.

“I heard about Tortina. You left her stranded on that moon for days.”

A mission gone south always leaves artifacts. Tortina was a more recent failure.

The detective placed his hands on the bar. As he did, the mechanized bartender revved to life. He ordered a glass of the recycled slurry and sat down next to intensifying man. Some folks take offense you nearly kill their spouse.

“She knew the risks and she still deviated from the plan. She’s lucky I was able to make another pass and pick her up at all.”

It didn’t seem to change Savage’s mind.

“She came home safe,” added Chase.

“Yeah, she did. And now she’s thirsty for more adventure.”

Finally, a smile.

He continued, “so what brings you here? Like I have to ask.”

Chase pulled out the picture.

“Nice. Your new gal?”

“Case. Ran an op near Cygnus. Know anything?”

“One of these days, Cap, you’ll need to find someone else to ask. And don’t correct me.”

“What, and miss out on your constant rays of starshine? Wouldn’t be the same Savage, and you know it.”

“You’re just lucky I still kinda like you. Yeah, she bought a little ship a few weeks ago and set off, on her own. Good thing Lefty didn’t settle for a rental, ‘cause that ship’s gone. Last beacon was two weeks ago.”

Chase was taking notes on a small memo pad, noting the time of final contact. Since machines required human presence to operate, that means either the ship was destroyed, or Petra had strayed too far. Either way, it was a fair assessment that she wasn’t coming back. At least not on her own. 

“Last echo?”

“Cygnus. For once your info is right.”

Chase took a swig of the wretched swill, with Savage waiting for the second request.

“Well? I take it you’re looking for flight out there?”

Chase grinned. “Well, since you’re offering…”

“Oh, no. You don’t have nearly enough.”

Chase furnished the credit disk and waved it enticingly.

“I have an open-ended credit disk that says otherwise.”

“I really hate you sometimes, Cap. I’ll meet you at the dock.”

The pilot grabbed the disk and fed it into his reader. He took what he thought was fair, just about everything, then ordered a round for house.

----------

The speeder wasn’t the largest or most elegant ship at the station, but it was fast and well-suited to avoiding Corps patrols. The diminutive craft wasn’t in the greatest shape, but it ran quietly and the dark paint would make it tough to spot in space.

As they approached the border, Savage switched off the lights and radios. And the navigation.

“We’re going silent.”

Chase would have been nervous if he didn’t trust his pilot that much. Savage was the only pilot he’d request back in the Corps. He could fly blindfolded if he had to, and did on at least one occasion.

There was only the blackness of space out of the main window. Above, they could see a patrol ship pass them by. The drifting took a couple of hours to clear the border, but they made it into the Cygnus Red Zone.

Savage switch the lights and computers back on. No sooner than he did, the alarms sounded.

“What the hell is that,” shouted the surprised pilot. “We’re not hit.”

“What just happened, Savage?”

“No clue, Cap. We just lost all power. We’re here, but we’re heading down, fast. Prepare to eject!”

He could see the wasteland of Cygnus approaching rapidly. Savage pulled a lever by his seat. The soft pod formed around his seat as he pulled the helmet on his flight suit over his head. A final pull and the chair sank through the floor.

Chase pulled his lever and grabbed his helmet. A second pull, and nothing. Damn thing jammed. He reached through the soft pod membrane and grabbed a handheld radio, stuffing it in his suit. Then, he braced for impact.

---------------

Chase awoke on a table. An altar to be exact. He could see the smoke from the landing zone rising avoe a small hill far enough away that he knew he had been moved. As he slowly gained consciousness, he started gaining awareness. For instance, his helmet was gone. That meant the planet had air. At least the terraforming wasn’t a complete failure. He reached for the radio, thankfully still in place.

The table rested outside about twenty meters from a cave entrance. As he turned to sit up, he noticed the ground. No normal dirt, but a type of sand covered it reflected gray by the surrounding stars in the darkened sky. There were also no footprints. Meaning Savage couldn’t have moved him. He wasn’t the sort to leave or think about covering his tracks if he did. In fact, the lack of any footprints anywhere was starting to worry him.

He had to strategize. First step was to survey the ship to see if it could be salvaged. He looked around to check for signs of life, but saw nothing. He lowered himself off of the altar and immediately felt a jolt of pain shoot up his right leg resting on the coarse sand.

“Not broken,” he thought to himself. “But pretty bruised. Thank goodness the ship is close.”

As he lumbered over the shallow hill, the smoke intensified. He trod carefully as he expected to find shrapnel. There was none. When he reached the impact crater, he saw only a hole. No ship, no signs of dragging. It simply vanished. Even for a rickety ship like the speeder, at least some of it should have survived. But there was nothing.

The only object of reference anywhere in the vicinity was the cave. The pain in his leg had started to dull, so his return trip was brisker. At the mouth of the cave, he stood back to the wall and peered around the corner. Just a corridor. He stepped inside, careful to remain silent.

As he approached an intersection of paths, he heard it. A metallic clanging. He ducked down a path, and dropped to the ground, poking his head out to catch a glimpse of the source. He had missed it, but the shadows were humanoid. Robots of some flavor. Robots meant there was a human nearby.

He got to his feet and sidled down the corridor to the path where they had crossed. In the distance, the shadows took another turn. Chase followed.

Another turn and he saw a brightly lit chamber. Hugging the wall, he approached slowly. The room was an atrium of sorts with four similarly lit chambers connecting it. In one straight ahead was a young woman. Petite with long blue hair. It was Petra.

The gray sand on the ground was thicker in this room and he left footprints as he walked. As he reached but a few feet away from the doorway, the woman stirred and noticed the human.

“Petra?”

“Who are you? What are you doing here? How do you know my name?” she asked without leaving room for answer in between.

“Your sister sent me. I’m here to take you home. Come on, let’s go.”

She shook her head in despair. “Too late,” she cried. “The guards are here.”

“What guards?”

He turned to see the empty room. Then he saw the dust shift. The sand rapidly piled up several feet into the air before returning a mass back to the ground, leaving a human-shaped metal being. It was joined by four others. 

“Impossible.”

The grabbed the startled man and took him to an adjacent cell before fading into sand once more.

Chase stood up and walked towards the doorway. As he approached, the guards returned. He was caught.

------------

Chase inspected his room. A small hole in the wall joined his cell with Petra’s. He walked over and peered through. Petra had the same idea and they were staring at each other.

“How did you find me?” she asked.

“Your sister mentioned Cygnus. I came here and crash landed. I woke up on the table outside. My ship. It’s gone.”

“Mine, too,” she replied. “These are remnants of wreckage. They turn any machinery they find into sand to build up their numbers.”

“That explains the ship.”

He remembered the radio.

“Wait, I still have a radio. This sand doesn’t house any programming. That means there must be a control signal. Maybe I can find it.”

He pried open the handheld device and started poking around, moving a few sliders on the face. With a cheery grin he flipped a switch and a burst of staccato tones played from the speaker.

“Found it.”

“What is that?”

“This signal is what tells them to form from the sand. If I can just counter it…”

He started pulling wires and resetting them inside the radio. It only took a few minutes for the former intelligence officer to wrap it up.

“Here goes nothing.”

He flipped a switch and walked to the door. And through it. No resistance. He ran over to Petra’s cell and urged her through. Taking her hand in his, they ran out towards the exit.

“I can’t believe it,” Petra exclaimed. “You did it. That was amazing!”

“Thank you. Now to get you off this planet. Molly’s probably can’t wait to hear the good news.”

Chase pulled the young woman’s arm as she came to a halt.

“Who’s Molly?”

The question hadn’t yet sunk in when he heard a familiar voice as they left cave entrance.

“Well done, Mr. Chase. Clever, clever, clever.”

Standing just outside, in front of a small ship was Molly. Chase pushed Petra so that she stood directly behind him.

“What are you doing here?” he asked.

“I can’t just let you leave here. You’re staying and that’s that.”

“I don’t think so,” he strained as he charged forward, his fist hitting her squarely in the jaw.

The thunk of hand on metal echoed on the stone walls.

“What the hell? Who are you? Really?”

The woman let out a deep chuckle.

“Surely someone as crafty as yourself has figured that out by now.”

As Chase nursed his hand, he glared at Molly.

“I know you’re not a normal robot. You don’t need a signal to operate. You made it here on your own, meaning you aren’t dependent on humans, so you predate the Mechanoid Laws. Your appearance is new; you modeled it after someone else.”

He squeezed Petra’s hand again to confirm she was human.

“You’re an android. Part of the terraforming unit.”

“Bravo,” she said, clapping slowly. My children, though, are a bit newer. They need to be close to humans to live. Rather perfect arrangement if you ask me. They need humans and their orders are to guard them, so they have extra incentive. The last human died too quickly. This one is young and fertile, but the prospect of building a supply of humans was too good to pass. You two will stay here and breed, allowing us all to live here indefinitely.”

“No dice,” answered Chase.

“But why not? You’ll have a comfortable room, fresh food, none of that recycled garbage.”

“And I’ll be a prisoner. That just doesn’t sit well with me. And besides, you paid me to bring Petra home. I already accepted payment, so I’m gonna do it.”

“And just how do you expect to do that?”

He held out the radio disruptor.

“I only need to get past you. Those guards of yours can’t help you.”

As he finished his statement, a red light on the radio started blinking and faded as the radio went dead.

“What’s the matter, dearie? No more juice.”

Chase pulled a cover off the rear of the device. The indicator on the battery read zero charge. The sand behind them formed into a wall of guards. They were surrounded.

“Time to head back inside, you two.”

A brief flash became a fresh battery which Chase caught and quickly restored power to the radio dropping the guards to dust.

“Miss me?” asked Savage, bearing a grin as wide as one can only do when arriving precisely in the nick of time.

“If I weren’t afraid of disease, Savage, I’d kiss you right now.”

“Ooh,” gasped the android. “Another plaything.”

“Plaything? Missy, you have the wrong idea.”

“It’s Molly you cretin.”

The blast from the laser pistol removed her head.

“Don’t correct me.”

----------

Molly’s ship wasn’t quite the speeder, but it would do. Inside, Petra formally thanked her rescuer, pressing her lips tenderly to his.

Savage shrugged. “What, nothing for me?”

“Thank you, Mr. Savage,” she added.

“You know, Cap, that android would have housed you, fed you, and have you breed with this pretty thing. Why didn’t you just stay?”

Chase’s smile vanished, but only for a moment. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a credit disk.

They probably would have grown bored with their situation.

&gt;However, despite what may have been assumed on first appearances, they were neither bored nor unoccupied. There was a voice that talked to this person. The person would converse endlessly with this voice.

***

The moderately tolerated /r/shutupandwrite **Critiquecast** is accepting submissions again! Get your stories to us by **Friday, March 29th @ Midnight EST** and get a chance for your stories to be critiqued live and, possibly, a chance at Reddit Gold too. Whatever that does.

###The Critiquecast
We are a group of people from /r/shutupandwrite who, every Sunday, go on air in an attempt rip apart your stories in as sarcastic and blatantly unfair of a manner as possible. While there have been some incidents of accidental earnestness and fairness, and potentially even *usefulness*, we are mostly here to chill out and have a good time reading stuff.

You can check out our previous episodes on [Mixcloud](http://mixcloud.com/critiquecast) or, sometime soon, iTunes! I just have to actually get us on there first.

We'll be making a separate announcement when we're ready to go live, but it will be on Sunday, 2PM EST, at http://ustream.tv/channel/critiquecast.

###The Prompt
This week, write a story that takes place in a minute. That is to say, from the start of the story to the end of the story, a minute will have passed in the world the story takes place in. Creativity is encouraged. A single character spending that entire minute pondering a philosophical question or something else equally *not-entertaining* is discouraged.

* **Word Count:** We have a strict 1,500 word maximum to prevent us from being stuck reading really long stories. There is no word *minimum*, though, so feel free to give us some flash fiction, microfiction, stuff like that. Just don't be a smartass and give us a fortune cookie, and we'll all be good.
* **Format:** Since we'll be rehosting these stories in Google Docs, a properly converted, publicly viewable Google document is highly preferred. (That does mean you actually *convert* your files accordingly, not just upload a .docx and call it good.) You could submit something else, but I will hate you a bit for it. Unless it's plaintext, in which case, hugs &lt;3
* **Submit To:** The comment section in this thread. We're going to make your writing public anyway, so you've got nothing to lose by putting it here.
* **Submit By:** As it says at the top, midnight EST on Friday of next week. The earlier we get your stuff, the earlier we're likely to read it, though.

Write on, and remember to follow [@critiquecast](http://twitter.com/critiquecast) for updates!

Here are a couple of common recurring patterns *Frasier* (and most sitcoms for that matter) use for comedic effect:

1. The Multi-layered Misinformation Formula—A lot of the time, the comedy in Frasier comes from multiple people thinking they know what's going on, but having one important detail incorrect.  A great example of this is in the Season 5 Halloween episode.  Roz tells Frasier she's pregnant.  Daphne finds out, then Niles overhears Daphne and Frasier talking and thinks Daphne's the pregnant one.  Martin then finds out from Frasier, but after talking with Niles, thinks Frasier's the father.  TL; DR Dramatic Irony.

2. The Botched Date Formula—If a character (usually Frasier) is attracted to somebody, 99% of the time, the relationship ends in failure.  The formula goes like this—Frasier meets a girl.  Using increasingly ridiculous tactics, he attempts to conceal something from her, usually the truth behind a lie he told, to keep the relationship from breaking.  After culminating into a nearly unbelievable charade that he (and the audience) thinks worked, the girl finds out the truth from something small, usually an offhand comment somebody makes.  Game over. TL; DR Goal, obstacle, fake resolution, and real resolution.

Using one or both of those formulas, write about a comedic situation involving two or more people where each character has one important fact wrong, or one or more characters try to conceal the truth from another character unsuccessfully.",Writing Prompt,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1a752h,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1a752h/wp_the_frasier_formulas/,

Voting is easy. Simply read all of the entries and vote on which story you think is best. Obviously, you can't vote on your own. You can only vote if you have entered a story into the contest. To see all of the entries (I hope - as long as you've labeled it properly.

You have one week to vote. So, by Wednesday October 10th at 11:59PM PST.

Also, you must vote to win. Don't just collect votes and not vote yourself! :)

You could be truly happy with this woman, but you're not sure you could ever find her sexually attractive.

B: She looks decent and has the cutest of smiles. The conversations you have with this woman are intriguing. She shares your interest but lacks initiative and drive.

C: She is attractive, but lacks creative interests. She likes to tan, exercise and go to parties. She feels like someone to waste away with, someone you would only keep for a while. She does not like to ponder over philosophy. She does not share your interest for books. She wants you to watch movies with her and hang out with her friends. She's kind.

No stars to shine back at him, and the wind tore past his clothes and bit him deep.  The light from his cigarette gave off the only light, and probably signaled his presence for miles.  He might have cared about that a few months ago, but now it all seemed trivial.  


He laid his hand across a sword hilt, tied to his waist on his left side and through a second belt loop.  The brown leather sheath felt cool under his touch.  Then with glance he looked to his right hip, a large steel handgun strapped to his side.  Mentally he recalled the last few days, counting every shot he had fired. 


""Four..."" he murmured to himself, as he checked the six cylinders on the weapon to verify.


Smoke vented from his nose as he shook his head gently.  The world seemed to melt away, his aches and pains drifted with them.  There isn't much else more comforting then a smoke, he thought.

Charles Tailor was a man of few needs. He spent most of his days working at a small desk as an accountant for a non-descript shipping company that dealt mainly with household wares. He walked the same rout to and from work each day. He lived in a small house that was left to him by his an uncle on his mothers side, who’s only life accomplishment was the invention of a new technique for folding wire into paperclips.

Mr. Tailor was a tall, lanky man whose bird chest was framed by akward, large shoulders. His face sported a large roman nose that sat directly beneath large grey eyes that always seems to be staring into space. His brow was deeply lined. A blunt chin that was stamped with a curious and slightly crooked cleft cradled the bottom of his face. 

As you would expect, Mr. Tailor was a life long bachelor. Entering his mid-forty’s, Mr. Tailor had never been on more than a date, and only one of those once a decade. Some would attribute this to his look, others to his tendency to never talk until spoken to. Whatever the reason, it did not look like it was going to change any time soon.

Sadly, this story is not about Charles Tailor overcoming some monumental force to become a hero and then falling in love with a loving woman. Sadly, the story I will be relating to you on these following pages starts with Mr. Tailor being murdered. A murder that started into motion a set of events that came very close to ending the world, as we know it. 

As I mentioned before, Mr. Tailor took the same rout to work every day. On a dull Tuesday morning he was walking in the rain with a large and old umbrella shielding him from the downpour.  His walk always started just before daybreak, and in fact he always started working in his desk in the dark of the early morning. Being the only one on the road, his footsteps where the only one muffled by the rain.

It's midnight in the convenience store in one of the worst neighborhoods in the city.  The clerk behind the counter is bored, sitting on a stool, flipping through a magazine while waiting for the next customer.

Suddenly there is a commotion... a masked robber has arrived with a gun, screaming about his weapon being loaded and demanding cash from the clerk.  It's a scary situation.  Is there going to be blood?  Is the clerk going to be shot?

The clerk looks up from his magazine.  Instead of being terrified, he merely stares at the robber with an annoyed look.  The robber ratchets up his threats of violence.  In response, the clerk stands up, ambles over to the cash register, reaches for a button as if to open up the cash drawer...

...and suddenly the floor under the robber starts to collapse.

Sometime in the past, the owner of the store had designed a disguised, large trap door in the floor in front of the counter, leading to a hidden space in the basement. The trap door consisted of two doors which were hinged on the outside so anyone standing on it would disappear downwards at the press of a button.  This whole setup was cleverly disguised as a couple of floor mats.  

When the clerk pushed the button, both doors collapsed inwards/downwards, sending the surprised robber cashless to a different destination.

After the robber falls through, the hidden doors snap shut and the space in front of the counter seems to become a normal floor again.  The clerk returns to peacefully sitting his stool and picks up his magazine again.  As very faint screams are heard from underneath the floor, a slow, sly smile starts to spread across the clerk's face.  He knows what's happening next to the gunman... the same fate as what has happened to every robber that has tried to mess with this store for the last 2-3 years.",Writing Prompt,False,,t5_2s3nb,1359238044.0,,,True,t3_17c3nw,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/17c3nw/wp_finish_this_story_about_clever_revenge_against/,

The Corporal passed through twilight's eye, after schools dismissed children and before rush hour clogged the airways.  Above, a megalithic starship blotted out the distant third sun, leaving the second sun's scant red rays to intersect with the waning first sun's golden cob.  He left the sidewalk for a field of tended grass, the spongy soil a welcome sensation beneath his feet. In the distance, a little girl played alone on a merry-go-round. He hastened his pace, crossing the grassy field to reach her.

Maya.  She could be no one else.  Tact painted geometric figures in his peripheral vision, punctuated by unreadable hieroglyphs, what the Corporal assumed were probabilities: The odds of someone exiting through a front door from the row of dwellings across the street; the threat factor of street-level vehicles passing by; and, most important, his own threat variance. But, Tact offered no algorithmic fact or analysis about the girl.  The AI embedded in the combat chassis welding his skull and spine had plenty to say about everything else, just not the girl.  She was Maya.  That statement flowed logically through the patchwork mess of brains and machine, and he knew, felt in the heart the medic had butchered from a fallen soldier and patched into his chest, she could be no other. 

Around she went, focused on the ride, until she spied his approach and beamed.  Smiled.  Grinned like she had in the dream haunting his fractured mind.  Dead on the facility floor, brain spattered across the tile, Maya had been there to beckon him home.  She made one more trip around the toy, leaped to the grass, and ran towards him.

Daddy, she may have said, but the words carried an echo.  He extended his arms and scooped her up, spun around once and embraced her close.  Her fur-trimmed hood pressed against his forehead, and he kissed her rosy cheek.   Daddy, he thought he heard her say. He squeezed her against his chest, shared with her the heat radiating from his heart.

""Maya.""  And Tact had nothing to say about it.  Why would it?  All of the hieroglyphs glowed amber from here to the horizon, on land and in the air.  All was serene.  He had noticed the change when crossing the DMZ, when the red hieroglyphs of enemy positions and vectors decomposed to blurred hues of friendly lines.

She tilted her head away from his shoulder, nuzzled his cheek with her nose, and then gazed into his eyes.  I missed you so much, he thought she said.  She embraced him still, rubbed her fingers over the protruding exoskeleton reinforcing his arms, touched the dirtied and bloodied cloth draped over the molded chest armor.

""Maya, daddy's home.""

As he spoke, she gazed at his face.  Her pupils, black orbs in the dying sunlight, watched his lips move, followed the craggy lines up his scarred cheek to the wrinkles around his eyes. Her smile waned, and momentarily he thought she would cry.  All expression left her face.

""You can't be my daddy anymore.""

""Maya, I -""

She planted her palms on his chest and pushed herself away.  Gently, he drew her back into the embrace.  But she struggled against his affection.  She drew his pistol from the holster strapped to his chest, pressed the muzzle into his sternum.   Her polished steel cheeks actuated, her mirrored irises narrowed.

His wife, the mother of his child, the woman from his dreams who, along with Maya, had beseeched his return, strode across the park.  Lithe and athletic legs, carbon fiber flexing and bending as though organic, carried her at a brisk clip.  

""Put her down,"" the woman said.

The girl tapped the gun barrel against his armored chest, creating a muted thud.  ""I know, mommy.  He's decom.""

""Oh,"" the woman said and slowed.  ""You've disarmed him.  I'll let you handle this. Do you remember how?""

""As I was saying,"" the girl said, ""You can't be my daddy.  Your serial number is decommissioned.""

""Maya -""

""That is not my designation,"" she said.  ""Now,"" she tapped the gun against his chest again. ""Put me down.""

He lowered her to the grass, and she took a few steps back.  

She spoke, at least he thought she had.  She parted her articulated jawbone and sounds emanated from the metallic hollow.  Confused noise.  Five small lights glowed above her left eyebrow, cycled through red, yellow, and green.  The woman circled to her daughter's side, giving him a wide berth.

""Remember what I told you about showing status lights in public,"" she told the girl.

""Oops,"" she said, and the five lights faded.  ""I'm going to download - ""

""No,"" the woman said.  She put her hand on the girl's shoulder.  ""No.  Disengage.""

She guided the girl to step away from the Corporal, and told her, ""He may look friendly, and he may broadcast your dad's serial number, and he may wear your father's hardware.""  She pointed at his exposed fleshy cheeks.  ""But his model is incorrect.""

""I don't understand,"" the girl said.

""He's an illegitimate copy. Shoot him.""

No pause.  No consideration.  The girl didn't adjust the pistol except to pull the trigger. The gauss round's battery case cleared the ejection port at the same moment the round struck his sternum in a crevice between the armor plates.  It was a well-calculated shot.  The round punctured reinforced fabric, wormed through his flesh.  The pain forced him to double over, and the exoskeleton serving as a spinal replacement responded to the urge and tipped him head first towards the ground.  The ground was cold, damp on his forehead and cheeks, the dirt gritty and acidic on his lips.  He clamped his right hand over the wound, and grabbed a mound of posies in his left, pushed himself up to a kneeling position.

Blood, warm and red, steaming in the cool twilight, pumped through his fingers. Tact didn't know what to do with it except analyze the temperature, rate of flow, and contents.  It offered a little orange flare attached to his bloodied hand, foreign words, numbers, and a chemical symbol.  Apparently he was iron-deficient.   While Tact figured out what was happening, the Corporal righted himself, his left hand still clenched around the clump of posies, pulling them from the ground.  The girl raised the pistol barrel to aim at his forehead.  He could die like this, executed by his daughter.  It would be logical; the yearning in his heart would be satisfied.  There were worse places and ways to die.  And, since he had died in the laboratory firefight, maybe fate had intended him to live so that he might die here and now at his daughter's hand.

He offered the posies to the girl.  ""I love you, Maya.""  He closed his eyes and waited for the frozen blackness and foggy dream he knew death would bring.

""Daddy,"" a girl's voice said.  ""You're so silly.  I'm over here."" 

He opened his eyes, the gauss pistol prominent in his right eye, and the girl's fur-trimmed hood filling half of his left.  Behind her, across the park, he saw another girl, the girl who had beckoned him back from the brink of death, holding a woman's hand.

She waved.  ""Daddy, we're over here.""

This was logical according to the mishmash of brain tissue and machine mind.  Once again, love for his wife and daughter found traction in his bleeding-out heart.  Maya.

He glanced at the child's face and eyes, and he begged of her mother and her, ""Please, don't shoot.  My wife and daughter are right over there.""

He hadn't meant his claim to be a distraction, and neither mother nor child looked.  Being machines, he knew, they wouldn't have to.  Nonetheless, the child had not yet pulled the trigger, and that gave Tact time to recollect itself.  He suspected it didn't know what to do with an organic wound, compounded by the sudden change in tactical position.  Both had entered the town as friendlies, but in the blink of a machine child's metallic eye, they were painted hostile. Tact filled his vision with status updates.  It painted a diagram while instructing the exoskeleton to spear his spine and lungs, injecting silver liquid into the wound from the opposite side. With no medic on hand to prep the point of entry or the wound with cryogenic spray, the needle may as well have been red-hot shrapnel in his back and the liquid acid vomited into the wound.  

Hieroglyphs pranced around the girl, pulsating on her eyes, measuring her height, weight, estimated reaction times.  Sequences iterated alongside ghosted images, stopping at a probable match, and painting her contorted silhouette. Tact raised some kind of alarm, and the entire grid flared hostile.  Moments before the park had been empty save her and him, the horizon a slim band of sunset and shadows augmented with Tact's amber waves of friendliness.  Now, amber yielded to red; multiple hostiles closed in on their position.  None of the symbols made sense. They didn't have to.

He took the pistol from her hand.  It was easy.  She wasn't expecting it, and her underdeveloped actuators yielded to his exoskeleton-reinforced grip.  On Tact's next scan cycle, it suggested …

""No,"" he said aloud, and told the girl.  ""I'm not going to hurt you.  I won't hurt either of you.""  He holstered the pistol, and Tact made it clear in that accursed alien hieroglyphic language he was making a tactical mistake.

Daddy, he thought he heard the little girl across the park call.

He stood and began to run again.  Across the park, and then out of town. Always on the horizon, the little girl and her mother beckoned him closer.  And so he ran once more, towards the DMZ. Back into enemy territory.  ",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_16iue7,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/16iue7/pi_love_on_the_run_jan_contest/,

Most of the time, magic is portrayed as big blatant ""violations"" of reality as we understand it. For example: wizards shooting fireballs out of their wands. If you shot a fireball at a skeptic, you could rightly call him/her an idiot for saying it wasn't real. (If he/she was still alive, that is.) This is what I call ""Blatant Magic"" or ""Fireball Magic."" Different observers see it as the same phenomenon. 

On the other hand, magic can also be seen as something more subtle,If a sorcerer tried to curse a skeptic with illness, and he/she got sick, the skeptic wouldn't seem foolish for not believing the sorcerer caused the skeptic to fall ill. From the skeptic's perspective, he/she merely inhaled a virus at the wrong time. From the sorcerer's perspective, he/she caused events in the universe to fall into place in such a way as to make the skeptic fall ill.
This is what I call ""Subtle Magic"" or ""Michigan J. Frog Magic"", because like the eponymous [frog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_J._Frog), it'll sing in front of you, but in front of others, [it just sits and croaks like a normal frog.](http://youtu.be/NRnX4quv5W4)

I loved campfires. There was something primal about them. Man mastering the elements. I hurried to get the box of matches.

My grandpa took them from me and set them aside. “We won't be using these.” he said with a smile.

“How will we start the fire then?” I asked, perplexed. “Are we going to rub two sticks together?”

“No.” he answered. “We are going to use magic.”

“Magic? Magic is make believe!” I laughed. I thought he was just kidding with me. I would find out soon enough that he was serious. Very serious.

He put his finger to my forehead and punctuated each word with a light tap. “Clear your mind.” He said quietly. He looked around to make sure nobody was watching us and held up a stick. “Magic is based on thoughts that form images in your mind. You must use that image to project that thought into being. Use your hands to concentrate and direct your thought.”

“I don't understand...” I began.

“Hold your hand out towards this piece of wood. It might be easier for you to point at it. I will help you focus your energy. Now, think of fire. Concentrate on the end of the stick as you do that. Now, in your mind imagine the end of this stick on fire. Concentrate on that. Believe in it. Believe it has already happened and you are now watching it burn. Let that thought travel from your mind down your arm and through your finger to its destination.”

I still wasn't sure if he was kidding with me. I decided I had nothing to lose by trying what he was asking of me though. I trusted in him completely as well, that helped.

I did what I could to clear my young mind of all the silly random thoughts it was usually filled with. I thought of nothing but fire for a few moments. Fire. Flame. 

I reached my hand towards the stick, extending my index finger towards it. I tried to push my vision of fire into my arm. Oddly, my arm started to tingle just a little bit. This encouraged me. Suddenly, I did believe! 

As I was reveling in my belief, I realized I now controlled the force that was awaiting my bidding. I let the energy flow through my arm, to my hand and through my finger. Suddenly the end of the stick burst into a bright green flame, settling almost at once into the normal reddish orange flame that normally accompanies fire.

My grandfather laughed aloud, and tousled my hair. “You are such a good boy. This has to be our secret though, do you understand that?”

“Yes, but Grandpa, how...”

“Later, we will talk about this.” he said. “For now I just needed to know if you could do it. You are a very special little boy. Soon, you will meet other children who are just like you. One day the world may need... well, let's just wait and see.”

My grandfather held the burning stick close to his face, at the same time extending his other hand in a fist towards the tepee of kindling we had assembled in the fire ring. As he blew out the small flame, he suddenly opened his fingers, and our fire roared to life.

This was my introduction of the secret world that exists within our own mundane, normal existence. There was a dark side to it all as well, But I was not to learn of it for many years.

All I knew at the time, was that I was learning *magic*.

Not just any message, though. No, this one was special in ways that exceeded its author’s imagination. It might help the reader to know that this message was written by Francis Elkhart in July of 1998.

…

Apologies. I suppose that only meant something if you knew that Francis Elkhart passed away that very month, you see. That bit is rather important to this story. While Wills and legal teams can handle most matters of transitioning a family from whole to bereaved, there is always something lost in what the executor reads. That’s why Francis wrote the letter and took it upon himself to file it in the post so that it would reach his family across the seas. In the letter, he wrote the most important words he’d ever put to paper.

But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. As I said, this is a story about a message.

Randy Willow sifted through the review bin in the Greenville post office. The complicated computers that read and sorted the countless envelopes lacked the ability to read intent. Those missives that were not properly marked or lacked postage were dumped to a bin for a more organic approach.

The stack was small this evening. A few bills were printed askew so the address wasn’t visible through the window provided. Someone put a check between the labeled portion and the window. Finally, there was a sort of greeting card that was rejected for being overweight. That struck Randy as odd. Makers of pre-printed tidings were careful about their weight. It wasn’t uncommon for gift cards to find their way into birthday cards and the like. The plastic totem plus a musical chip might be enough to tip the scale.

In reality, it was the addition of glue that little Bradley Volk used to keep his mother’s birthday card safe from the wilds of the postal system that contributed to the weight. That, and the addition of a letter to a surviving member of the Elkhart family that got stuck to some stray adhesive.

The air conditioning in the post office was out of order, so Randy was more concerned with leaving the building heat than investigating such a pointless matter. The scale had read only a fraction of an ounce too many. He nearly placed it in the return bin, before overriding the system to let the card through unharmed.

As the conveyors turned in the back of the building, the rising temperatures softened the glue, freeing Francis’s letter from the greeting card and its original address, the ink smeared over top a Shoebox logo. It fell into a tray of mail already sorted for their intended travels. The box would depart for Kingston in the morning with the addition of a stowaway.

She loved the juxtaposition of the tightness of the leggings and the looseness of the outer layers. She loved the way that the mildly stretchy fabric was warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Mostly, though, she loved that they were hers.

Her route took her down by the elementary school, around the grassy fields surrounding the church, past the old factory that had become something of a meeting ground for other events, through a stretch of sparse woodland, and to the park on the other side. The park had dedicated running paths, but Gloria had already run. Instead, the benches were her priority. One in particular.

Its back to a pair of caged basketball courts, the bench rested near the entrance to Kingston Community Park. Rather than allow its occupants to admire the competition, this bench was designed to look beyond the path to the parking lot and past the main road. Idling in front of an old brick building, a truck bearing “U.S. Mail” waited for a portion of its contents to stay behind. Only one tray made it off of the truck this morning. It was going to be a slow day.

As the mail truck pulled away, Gloria took her leave as well. Mitchell was in the shower when she got back. She’d shower later, she decided while placing her ring back on her finger, and hung her sweaty clothes up in the closet, just inches away from the black bag in which stayed a decorative white dress still waiting for the big day.

It was a big day, though. Just not for her. Not directly, at least. Her work day started as it normally did, sorting the unsortable mail. But she found an incoming letter where the address had been torn off.  The return address was none too clear, either. As she normally did in these situations, she tossed the envelope into the abandoned letters bin and continued sorting.

-------

Gloria Kitscher woke up to the post-dawn alarm on a Friday morning. Mitchell, as was usual, slept through it without losing a Z. Her jogging clothes were hanging on the closet door. Like always, they were placed back into the closet, suspended behind the aging wedding gown, mixed in with the other clothing marked for donation. Her uniform was what her arm reached for. The hook gave way and the hanger fell, clacking against others on its journey downward.

Mitchell bolted upright.

“Dammit, Gloria,” he shouted.

“Sorry,” she apologized as her husband repositioned the covers to achieve a more comfortable position.

She left the hanger on the floor when she finished removing the postal service shirt from it. As she worked the final buttons, her finger rubbed the 30-year pin. Mitchell had wanted her to quit when they married, but she enjoyed having something to do, something to add a little spending money to her purse.

It was a slow day. Kingston had avoided the boom that hit towns closer to the cities. The computerized systems were good enough to keep her labor limited. So Gloria pored through the bins of abandoned mail, sifting through letters that would never find their home.

Her hand found a familiar cream-colored envelope that had been stripped of its addresses. Upon closer examination, though, some of the ink remained in the corner. “RT” was clearly in the name. And the zip code included two of the final four digits; the postmark had the primary five. There was something about this letter that stood out to her. While most in that pile were genuinely lost, this one still had a chance. Almost without thinking, she stuffed it into her handbag to examine later.

In the comfort of her own home, her mind raced at the possible contents and circumstances. From the date, it had been more than two decades since it first found its way to the hands of the postal service. Surely the sender would have sent a replacement card or note since then. Surely this message would not be missed.

But what if it was? The city was a good start, but that alone wouldn’t be enough. The name was almost completely missing. Gloria took a deep breath then slid her finger beneath the flap, ripping it open. The letter itself would have a name, certainly. And there was. Of a sort. “My darling Katie” was written on the top fold of a piece of paper. Gloria unfolded the sheet to see the full name.

But it wasn’t there. In fact, the letter itself was barely a sentence: “You never watched the right” suggesting it was ended prematurely.

“’The right’ what?” Gloria asked herself. For the second time that day, she found herself wanting to just throw the letter away. There wasn’t enough information even inside to find the sender or the recipient.

“You never watched to the right”

There had to be more, she thought to herself. But more importantly, she had to know. Mitchell would be a couple of hours still. Greenville was only a short drive away. She grabbed the letter, envelope, and her keys.

---------

The post office in Greenville had already closed for the day, but she only needed access to the facility, not the services. She was still wearing her postal uniform so the evening sorters weren’t too mindful of the trespasser. All she needed was the archived copy of the coding map. That would narrow down the search grid considerably.

While Gloria may have bemoaned the increased role of computers in the post office, they made her task significantly easier. To facilitate the jobs of carriers, the maps they used included the last names of residents for each area. There were four areas in Greenville that would filter through that post office with zip codes ending in 81. That left about 60 possible names.

The scanned copies made some of the writing hard to read, but Gloria finished the first two areas certain that they were without a single possible match. After giving her eyes a rest, she found the same result in the third. The fourth had a single possible match. She printed out the page for reference and started looking up that name, hoping he was still local.

-------------

Herman Brassart had bought the house when he got his first promotion. He had hoped his children would inherit it when he passed, but they went their own ways and settled far from Greenville. He was just about ready call it an early night when the doorbell rang.

A woman, mid-forties by her appearance, stood out front with an anxious expression. Herman didn’t recognize her, but she was dressed like a postman.

“Who is it?” he called out through the closed door.

“Herman Brassart? My name is Gloria,” she replied. “Gloria Fairmont. I work for the post office. I have an undelivered letter that I think you may have written.”

“I don’t write letters,” Herman stated in a gruff voice.

Gloria wasn’t giving up that easily.

“Maybe you don’t now, but what about 23 years ago?”

Herman thought this woman to be worryingly persistent. Regardless, he wasn’t interested in whatever games she was trying to play.

“It was for Katie,” she shouted in a final effort.

Gloria stared at the door for a few moments in silence before turning away. The sliding of locks turned her back around.

“Did you say Katie?”

Herman had been retired for several years and his sagging skin suggested he may have waited longer than he had to.  There was a vacancy in Herman’s eyes as he retreated into the flooding memories. The stern face receded into a calm smile.

“Come inside,” he said, gliding himself to a couch in the living room.

The door was left open. Gloria stepped inside, closing it behind her before seating herself at an adjacent sofa. She then reached into her pocket and furnished the partially-torn envelope. Herman took it as it was extended in his direction, putting on a pair of reading glasses as he did.

“Who was Katie?” Gloria asked to break the silence.

Herman kept his attention focused on the paper, still folded in his hands. His voice dragged in the air as if it was falling asleep, slipping into a dream.

“Just a young lady I knew at a time. Went to our church. I’d see her on the bus each morning. Same seat every time: driver’s side, by the window. I sat on the other side of the aisle. She’d read, mostly. But, every once in a while, she’d look up and out the window. Part of me hoped she’d look my way.”

Herman paused as he watched her turning to her right.

“I don’t know,” he resumed. “I thought that, maybe, she’d want to keep looking. I always wanted to tell her that. I just didn’t know how.”

He waved the note in the air for punctuation.

“When she never responded or looked up, I just assumed she didn’t care. There was hope that it just got lost in the mail somehow, but…”

Katie was bitten by the whimsy of the old man’s tale. Herman, however, was merely longing.

“So that’s what it means,” she remarked.

“What what means?”

“Your letter.”

“Huh?” the man muttered as he opened the note. “No, no, no. It’s all wrong.”

“Wrong?” asked Gloria. “How so?”

“This letter isn’t mine. I never wrote this.”

“No, that can’t be right. Are you sure?” 

“I may be old, but I’m hardly to the point I wouldn’t remember the letter I sent all those years ago. I at least remembered to sign the damned thing.”

Gloria still shook her head and pulled out her printed map.

“But you were the only one in the right zip code whose name ended in RT. It has to be you.”

“Let me see that,” Herman grumbled before snatching the paper from Gloria’s hands. “Grey. Right there. That’s your house.”

He pointed at a spot on the map, handing it back to the woman.

“Grey? I don’t understand.”

“Grey moved in there Fall of ’98. Start of a school year, see. If I read that post mark right, that was after the letter.”

Gloria could see the faint outline of an erased name hidden under “Grey.” It wasn’t legible, but there was something under it.

“Frank Elkhart wrote that, I guarantee it.”

“Where’s Frank now?”

Herman rubbed his forehead.

“He passed away. That’s why the house was empty.""

Gloria’s head fell. She sat there staring at her knees.

“I’m too late,” she said weakly.

“Late? Even if you got that letter when it was sent it’d be too late. Frank died in July of ’98.”

“So this whole thing has been a waste?!” Gloria shouted as she brushed her eye, expecting tears but finding none.

She clumsily rose to her feet and strode to her car in a rush. She hadn’t noticed that Herman had gotten up to follow.

“You know,” Herman called after her, “it’s not as bad as you think.”

Gloria already had half of her body in her car with the door nearly closed. Herman walked down to the bottom step and sat down. He wasn’t staring at Gloria, though. Instead, he was focused on the small flowerbed by his right foot.

“I never watched the right,” he murmured. “There used to be a park. They tore it down a long time ago. That bus ride, every morning? It would drive right past it. My wife loved flowers.”

Herman caressed a perennial tenderly in his hand.

“Those ones at the park in particular. She’d visit the park sometimes. Probably would have seen her there a few times if I paid any attention. I was always so caught up on the girl to my left, I never looked out my damned window. If I had, I’d have seen Polly like I was supposed to. We’d have had more time to spend together.”

As Herman’s tears left his cheek, Gloria’s comforting arm gave the old man a hug. Her left hand played with the ring on her finger, longing to feel as passionately as Herman about something. Her phone rang to break the moment. It was Mitchell.

“Gloria?” he asked in a panic. “Where are you?”

Gloria pulled the phone away from her ear to check the time. It was nearly 7. She hadn’t planned on staying in Greenville nearly that long.

“I’m out in Greenville. I was just getting ready to head home.”

“Greenville?!” huffed Mitchell incredulously. “What the hell are you doing out there?”

“I’ll explain later. I’ll see you in about an hour.”

Gloria didn’t wait for a response before hanging up the phone. She stood up and looked at Herman with a sorrowful gaze.

“It’s alright, miss,” he reassured her. “Go on now. Don’t let me keep you.”

“I’m sorry I raised your hopes like that.”

“For years, I missed something by stubbornly looking the wrong way. Even now, I’m just fixated on something I can’t reach. Maybe it’s just time to set my sights elsewhere. Frank may have written that note to his granddaughter, but the message might have been for me, too.”

Gloria reached down and gave Herman a hug and a light peck on the cheek before tearfully smiling, returning to her car and driving away.

She neared the highway when she pulled off into a gas station parking lot. She pulled out her phone and started searching for the whereabouts of Katie Elkhart. There was only one hit in the region, a recent marriage of Katie Elkhart to a Vernon Monroe. The age seemed close enough. And more importantly, the announcement mentioned her home town: Greenville, OH. Vernon lived up north in Highland.  The red lights of her dashboard clock suggested she turn right to resume her quest in the morning. But, when she returned to the road, she turned north.

------------

Gloria didn’t have an exact address or an open post office to consult. None of that stopped her on the road to Highland. The advantage of a small town was that folks still had need for things like phone books. The days of phone booths with the tomes dangling by a cable were gone, but people still went out of town. Gloria kept an eye out for yellow bags on porches.

The grass at 1210 F Street was sufficiently high to suggest that the owners had been away for awhile. Surely, Gloria reasoned, they wouldn’t mind if someone just looks through their phone book. There were several listed entries for Monroe, but no Vernon. Victoria and Velma were present, as was “V Monroe.” With no other options, Gloria entered the address into her phone and headed straight there. 

It was nearly eight, but there were several lights still present in the windows. Gloria sat in the car watching for silhouettes against the curtains. When at last a shadow whipped past, she hopped out of the vehicle and trotted to the front door. As the doorbell rang, her phone signaled the arrival of a text message.

*Where are you? Call me ASAP.*

She started a reply, but the door opened to interrupt her.

“Hello?” asked the man with long brown hair that reached past his shoulders and a tall body confined to a wheelchair. “Can I help you?”

She struggled to find words. As they finally arrived, her phone rang. The sudden chime made her jump. Rather than answer, she reached into her pocket to decline the call.

“Miss?” the man asked.

“Sorry, but are you Vernon Monroe?”

“What’s this about?”

Gloria fumbled around for the letter, the envelope more worse for the wear with every stop on its travels. She explained about finding the letter and her desire to get it to its destination. She told him about Herman Brassart, about his Katie, and about his story. She continued about tracking him down in search for Katie, hoping that the letter had finally made it the final steps.

The man shook his head.

“No, I’m truly sorry, miss. There’s no Katie here. My name’s Vince. Not sure I know a Vernon.”

Gloria found herself at another failed meeting. She started sobbing. Vince put his hands on her shoulders. As she wept, the letter fell from her grip.

“There there,” he whispered, leaning down to pick up the letter.

In its fall, the paper had opened, bearing its message. He looked over it.

“Twenty three years, you said?”

“Y-yes,” Gloria replied.

“Funny how things work.”

“What do you mean by that?” asked the woman, drying her eyes.

“I lost the use of my legs back in the summer of ’98. I was just a kid out riding my bike, letting the summer waste away. Rode out into the street. Never looked. Driver couldn’t move out of the way in time. Broke my back in three places. Been sitting ever since.”

“And it came from the right?”

“Sure did. To think, if the letter had found its way to me back then, I might still be walking.”

Even if it would have taken a major error to have made that happen, Gloria couldn’t help but feel sad, guilty even for another unfortunate soul for whom the message had arrived too late. Doubt crept in. What if she was similarly too late for Katie? She started to feel faint.

“All the same it didn’t though,” added Vince with the air of a laugh. “I was lucky to escape with my life, but that accident kept me from being so reckless from that point on. It even got the town to put in that bike path and start promoting bike safety. Hasn’t been an accident around here since.”

Gloria’s phone beeped again. She pulled it from her pocket to see that the battery had run out.

“Shit,” she said before realizing it was out loud. “I’m sorry.”

“Oh, no harm, ma’am. Look, I’m sorry I can’t help you. But I hope that letter gets to where it needs to be. You’re doing something good, I hope you know that.”

It was a reassuring thought, but it wasn’t quite enough to put her mind at ease.

“Thanks, Vince.”

She said her goodbyes and returned to her car. No phone or even radio, she drove back to Kingston in silence.

------------

It was well past ten when Gloria walked through the front door of her home, still dressed in her postal uniform. Mitchell was sitting at the dining table embracing a bottle of cheap Scotch under one arm. He hadn’t gotten very far, though. His face was pressed against the stained wood which helped echo his snores into the entryway. Even the light slam of the front door failed to stir the man.

‘Sleeping. All I ever see from you these days,” she groaned. “And you smell like a distillery. Ugh.”

She was exhausted, and not just in terms of the hour. Resigning herself to deal with the mess in the morning, she reached for the light switch to end her night. As she did, the letter flashed in her mind. As it did, her eyes drifted right and down to her husband. There was more than just a perspiring glass and liquor bottle in front of him. The first thing she noticed was the phone, face up with no signs of life. Its battery had died. His tablet was also out.

She stepped closer. There were several sheets of paper with scribbling:  
*Vince Monroe*  
*Letter - what letter?*  
*Vernon Monroe*  
*Katie Elkhart Monroe*  
*Frank Elkhart  (Francis)*  
*1998 - July*  
*Greenville, Highland*

“How?” Gloria asked quietly.

Her phone. She had accidentally picked up the phone rather than dismissing the call. Mitchell had been listening in to the conversation, taking notes. She had never called Frank ‘Francis,’ though. She pulled up the top page. Beneath that was a printed sheet with the obituary of Francis Elkhart. In the text, the phrase “granddaughter Katherine” had been circled.

A small light by the tablet’s screen blinked, signaling a notification. Gloria grabbed it and hit the power button to wake the device. The email was just something from the insurance company. She dismissed the notification with a swipe of her finger. The app running in the background came into view: a web browser. On the current page was a list of search results for Katherine Elkhart Monroe.

She returned her attention to her husband. Tucked under his right hand was another slip of paper. It was an address, Katie’s address. He found her. He tracked down Katie for her. Gloria bent and embraced her husband. His stirred, but only just.

“Love you, Glor,” he yawned, never truly rising from his slumber.

“I know,” she replied, pulling the liquor from his grasp and setting it safely on the other end of the table.

Gloria went to the bedroom to change her clothes. Her jogging outfit was hanging from the closet door, as it always was when she woke up. She left it there when she pulled a nightgown from a hanger. Once changed, she reached to the back and retrieved a blanket.

Back in the dining room, Gloria placed the blanket around Mitchell’s shoulders. She dug through a cabinet in the kitchen to find an envelope. Using Mitchell’s note, she placed Katie’s note into the newly addressed vessel and sealed it, fixing it with a single stamp.

Her mind had been fixated on discovering the meaning of those words, “You never watched the right,” but she was content letting the message find its own way. She didn’t need Katie’s explanation. She knew what it meant, what it meant to her. Time had started to weather her relationship with Mitchell. She thought he stopped caring. But Mitchell did care. Gloria just kept missing the little acts he’d do. She never watched the right signs; never saw how much he really loved her.

Her eyelids were growing heavy, but she defied them to stare at her sleeping husband for just a while longer, her hand grasping his.

------------

Katie loved summer. Until she started school, she never realized why the bigger kids did, too. First grade was only a few weeks away. She was excited on this day, though. She was going to visit her grandpa. He used to drive out himself, but it had been a few months since his last visit. And even then, he just coughed a lot.

Grandpa Frank was standing on his porch when they arrived. Katie, as soon as the door was unlocked, jumped out of the car and gave her grandfather a great big hug. When she finally let go, she eagerly held out a quarter.

“Oh, trying this again,” the elderly man laughed. “Let’s see if there’s anything left in this one.”

He gave the coin a close inspection, biting it for good measure.

“I don’t know, Katie. I don’t think this one’s ready.”

“Aww. Come on Grandpa,” Katie pleaded. “Can’t you try?”

“Hm. Well, it’s worth a shot.”

He tightened his left fist around the coin. He flicked it into the air with his thumb and caught it again.

“Doesn’t seem to work.”

“One more try, Grandpa.”

“Alright,” he relented. “Let’s try doing it even higher.”

He used his arm to give the coin additional height. He traced its arc and used both of his hands as a bowl to catch it. But when he held out his hand to return the quarter, it was a dollar bill.

“It worked!” Katie exclaimed.

“It always does.”

“You have to tell me how you do that, Grandpa.”

Francis’s smile drooped by a fraction. Not enough for the girl to notice, though. He dropped to a knee to look his granddaughter’s eyes straight on.

“I’ll tell you what. The magic doesn’t work if you spill the secret. So I’ll mail you how it’s done. How’s about that?”

“Thanks, Grandpa,” Katie said, giving Francis another hug.

“You’re welcome, Katie,” he replied, not letting go.

-----------

It sounds simple, doesn’t it? It is quite a trick, though, turning one thing into four. Whether it is one quarter into a full dollar or one letter into four messages, not everyone can accomplish that feat. It may not have been intended, but the best things in life rarely are. If you were wanting to know how the story truly ends, how Katie reacted having the trick finally revealed, I’m afraid you’ll have to leave disappointed. I could conceivably send the rest by post, if you are so daring. But I’ll remind you that this was never Katie’s story.

I can only hope this letter has reached you and the children in good health. I can't expect you to read this, but if you are...I thank you. Really, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for reading my last words.

I'm not sure what you'd want to hear from me if I were still alive. I suppose I owe you an apology. It's long overdue but...a late apology is a good apology as any right? You're probably rolling your eyes right now. Somethings never change, do they?

Anyways, I'm sorry. It's about ten years late, but it would have been sooner if you had just picked up my calls! I shouldn't blame though. If anyone the blame is on me. I am sorry I wasn't there to watch our children grow up. Between getting married so young and ten immediately having two children within five years...it was too much. I wasn't ready to be a mother, even if you were ready to be a father. I'm sure you're giving the girls all that you can. I hope they get all that deserve. If only you could rope the moon for our girls, then they could really have all they deserve.

I trust you've found love again. It shouldn't be hard for you, right? Chicks dig guys who are good with kids, don't they? Most do. God knows I was still in love with you after I left.

I'm sorry I didn't take care of you the way I promised I would. I hope you know that. It was so hard to up and leave all that we had, but it was too much too soon. I couldn't be the mother Lacey and Allison needed, nor could I be the wife you deserved. I was too young. 19 is too young to marry someone. 20 is too young to have a daughter, and 22 is too young to be a stay at home, married woman. At least it is for me, more power to those that can do it. I wish I was that strong.

I suppose I should go, these letters can only be so long right? I just wanted to apologize for the wrongs that I've done. In a few days a lawyer should show up with my will. I've left all I have to you and the girls. It's just some money, and my property. Do with it what you will. Please wish Lacey a happy birthday for me. Tell Allison that she was beautiful in her wedding dress. I saw a picture of her online, she looked stunning. Andrew is a very lucky man.

I love and miss you. Just as much as I love and miss our two lovely girls. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I am gone now, I can't hurt you anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This piece throws you right into the drama. It seems to call upon urgency. It is a suitable soundtrack for the world falling apart from the perspective of a horrified spectator frozen in awe. 

It's for a frantic love letter during the medieval age. Hastily written down before you make your escape during a stormy night just as the guards break down the door to your desolate tower in the middle of nowhere. 

It's for a struggle of adversaries unwillingly pitted against each other in a fight to the death. Clashing against each other in hate, both deserving to live though one of them must die. Their back-story is filled with woe and sorrow and this is their one chance of freedom. 

It's for walking in the depth of night as the rain beats down on the pavement. You're in a fast pace toward a destiny you have chosen for yourself. Though it is sure to bring heartache upon the people you love, this is your time.

And other very romanticized themes knee deep in drama. Have fun!",Music Prompt,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1gzzyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gzzyp/mp_cataclysm/,

She's my best friend but she can't stand being around me anymore! I fall into these depressive states on my own accord. I fixate on the fiction I've sculpted in my mind and I slowly fall away from what is real. I'm in a hole. Away from those who care. Away from those who couldn't care less. It's dark and lonely here. I've been asked before why I feel the way I do, and I never answer. How am I supposed to tell someone that I am in control of the thoughts that take me away from the world. The only possible answer they could give me is to just stop thinking about those things, but I can't!

 ****
The Critiquecast is taking your stories again! Yes, finally. Yes, it's been two months. Yes, we're a little bit more on top of things now.

**What is [the Critiquecast](http://shutupandwrite.net/category/critiquecast/)?**

We are a group of amateur writers who got together and decided to critique others' writing on the air. It's not meant to be a serious critique (*amateur* writers, remember); it's more so to give you the experience of hearing your writing read aloud by an unforgiving and unfair audience.

For this cycle we will be picking **six** stories to critique on the air. How? You're going to tell us which ones, that's how. The official submission thread in /r/shutupandwrite will be put into Contest Mode for the duration of the week, and whatever ones you want to see critiqued, you can upvote. We have the ultimate say in which ones we will pick to critique, but highly upvoted stories will be given more consideration.

Recordings speak louder than words:

* [26. A Cut Below](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/05/20/critiquecast-026-a-cut-below/)
* [14. People McNuggets](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/04/01/critiquecast-14-people-mcnuggets/)
* [12. Breakfast with a Boner](http://shutupandwrite.net/2013/03/24/critiquecast-012-breakfast-with-a-boner/)

**THE PROMPT**
&gt; The main character realizes that he/she brought the wrong one. No, that's not a typo. You're supposed to fill in the wrong *what* (or *who* or *whatever*) with your imagination.

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1,200 words. Bonus points if you keep it to 1,000.
* Submissions must be in the form of a Google doc.
* Submissions *must* be on the /r/shutupandwrite thread, otherwise voting's going to be a headache for everyone involved.
* Submissions are due on MIDNIGHT  EST, Sunday, June 9th.

**Voting guidelines**

Vote for whatever stories you'd like to see critiqued on the show! A few days after submissions end, we'll announce which six we're going to critique. Unfortunately that means we might be neglecting a few stories, so feel free to submit your own audio critiques as replies to the submitter. Anything that's well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unprofessional and blatantly unfair) may be selected as a bonus episode to go up whenever we feel like it.

The arbitrarily selected ""winner"" of this cycle of the critiquecast will be awarded Reddit Gold. That's about all there is to it.

The point of this exercise is to use words to best express your thoughts in the roughest form possible. (Hint: Try writing down one phrase that you have on your mind, then write in sentences, phrases, or whatever you choose that comes to mind.)

There I am, standing against the brick wall of an alleyway, under the grey sky feeling, hoping that it will rain. I have stubble, shorter hair, and I”m wearing a grey jacket. I pull out a black lighter from my left pocket, and a pack of smokes from my jacket. I look at my feet, then focus at my hands. I smile. I even laugh a little. With the cigarette in my mouth, I light. I inhale slowly. Then release.

Eyes closed., I feel myself, remember myself lying down alone on a rooftop. A building’s rooftop. The same grey jacket, white shirt, blue jeans. No smokes this time. The sky is blue. The sun is out. So why am I wearing a jacket? I close my eyes again, and I’m standing at the edge of a familiar cliff. I see the city, the water, I can feel the morning. I can see the sun peeking past the clouds, the skyline so close, I feel so insignificant, but amazing.

I throw my pack of smokes off the cliff, holding onto a single cigarette. I stare at it. I wonder about why I ever needed it. I throw it away, too. The black lighter lies in my hand, and I light. I flick the light on out of habit, and I stop. How many times this goes on for, well, I don’t konw. I just keep doing it until the fluid dies out. I shiver. It’s cold.

When did it become night time? I didn’t realize that the moon was full, or that I was alone. I’m aware. I hear nothing but my breathing. I’m scared. I’m alone and in te cold. I lie down on the dying grass, seeing the lights of the skyline as I decsend. The stars shine fofr the first time in 20 years, and I smile.

My phone rings. I sit up. Disheveled, I wonder what the weather is like outside, and through the curtain, I notice: light hasn’t peekdd through yet. Oh, I hope for rain. I answer the call, as I lie in bed, and I say, “Hello?”

I don’t hear a voice, and I realize: my phone never rang.

Dejected, I stand up. I gaze at the microwave in the kitchen, and I notice that it’s only 6am. In my shorts, I make a cup of coffee, grab the paper outside, and I sit on the porch. Again, I’m alone. The sounds of morning come into my ears as I become aware with each sip of elixir.

“Maybe I should have made an Irish Coffee…”

Things fade away. It’s just a white room. I can’t see anything past. Nothing ahead. I’m sitting, standing, doing something. I am stilll.

I laugh manically. I am happy. There’s this joy in my heart that fills up, and I realize that the world around me, my personal reality, is a canvas. It’s alonely. It’s white. It’s bland. But I’m happy.

Faces light up on the canvas of my mind. Each face on a screen next to a screen next to a screen. I blink. Each video plays. each memory plays over. Every sound of every memory is playing all at once. The people I don’t care about, the people that I love. The questions that I’ve asked. The judgements that have been made. Everything that was exists again. It’s somewhere in medias res in the memories that play into one another. And I hear it. A sea of sound and thoughts and epiphanies and sadness. This is a sea of sound, of memories. This is the chorus to my mind. I close my eyes, I space out. Anywhere and everywhere that my body is, I hear it. I hear these sounds. I can hear everything at once,s sometimes one thing louder than the rest, sometimes the sound of my own voice talking to myself, and sometimes… nothing at all. Sometimes, I’m back at the cliff, or the alley, or the roof.

Sometimes, in my mind, I’m walking around. Other times, I’m talking. Talking to nobody.

I’m always talking to nobody.

_____________________________________________________________

An entire year had passed. Rosie's sister had her first child in late June. Her grandfather had had his 91st birthday in September and back in February her parents had been married for 35 years.

In all that time Rosie had stayed in her apartment, *their* apartment. She'd worn his clothes and gathered all of his things into boxes that she kept in the living room. Every piece of his life since they'd been together was there, unused, but so very loved.

Every day she wept. A single year of marriage.

*The first year's the hardest,* they'd said.

So much of that time had been spent arguing. Rosie recalled the times she thought they'd made a mistake. She couldn't stand him leaving dishes everywhere, he couldn't stand that she wanted him to go to bed when she did. They'd fought, they'd said words they didn't mean, and they'd made up and loved so passionately.

Everything Rosie was had been centered around him. He was her life. When he was gone Rosie panicked. In all of the entire world there was nothing left for her. In all of the universe there was nowhere Rosie belonged, and there was no one for her to love.

The moment he left this world Rosie ceased to exist.

An entire year has passed. Despite Rosie's family, and his family even, doing their best to console her, ultimately a decision had to be made, and the decision was hers alone. Rosie could give up, she could very easily let her twenty-one years of life go to waste and allow herself to slip quietly away.

Or Rosie could move forward.

The expanse of the future terrified her. She was empty, she was alone, and she had lost her identity and will. That was all neatly buried beneath a granite headstone now. But life continued somehow. Seasons changed, people were aging, and the sun still rose in the mornings.

Today, exactly one year since his passing, Rosie tapes the last box shut. Her chest caves and she sobs. Her tears fall and a springtime breeze blows in through an open window. Rosie fills her lungs, she cries out with the pain, and then... nothing.

The sadness gives way to peace. He's gone now, but will never leave her heart, and in that Rosie can find strength. She can push through the difficult times knowing that what she had was real. The love she'd felt was rare and can last for an eternity in her memories.

Though her heart aches physically, her mind is restless at night with the phantom of his arms around her, and she can't stand in a crowd with the confidence that he is by her side anymore, Rosie *can* continue...",Prompt Inspired ,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1ejaku,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ejaku/pi_closure/,

A Moment in Time Through The Senses: March 9, 2013 

.
.
.

SIGHT

I am sitting in Danny's living room, which has now become my living room for the past year and a half. It's messy, but at least the table is clean. There is a Tinkerbell balloon hanging from one of the chairs that Danny bought me the other day. We have many shelves full of all sorts of things: dvds on the bookshelf, stationary supplies that Danny NEEDED to have, letters and cards we've sent to each other, empty jars that I have been collecting, photos from both of our families. The television sits in front of us, playing a movie as usual. Dan wanted to watch War Horse, which has been pretty good so far. Under the television, we have a lot of electronics which are lighted up and blinking. The clock says 11:18 so I must have missed the 11:11 make a wish time. On the top shelf of the television desk are candles that we light sometimes to create a romantic mood, alongside a few chocolate and marshmallow roses Danny has given me this year. He is sitting on the chair to my right, as usual-- the black one that is falling apart, writing up his charts as I lay on the couch underneath the burgundy and black blanket he bought me.

.
.
.

HEARING

I hear Danny flipping through the D&amp;D book that he's using to write up his game and charts. His fingers are tapping away at his keyboard, a little slower than mine, but more methodical, thinking about what he wants to put in his game and how he wants to write that up. My own fingers are tap tap tapping away at the keyboard laptop in my lap, quickly going over the letters to write up my journal entry as quick as possible. On the television, War Horse is finishing up, no dialogue but the theme music is slow, steady and lulling. Music for a happy ending by the music writer John Williams. Dan is making fun of the movie as the music swells on it's final scene, saying stuff like: ""You thought I was crazy, didn't ya, ma? But I'm back and I've got a horse, now let's never speak of this again."" Somewhere in the kitchen, Shilo is munching away at her cat food, while Dan turns his attention to me and mockingly adds, ""Yay, it's a happy ending. I was worried for the horse."" 

""It's okay Danny, the horse gets to live... for now.""

He sniffles, probably because he still has a cold. He adds, ""I'm sad. The horsey lived such a horrible life. Why did it have such a horrible life?"" 

I sarcastically reply, ""I don't know baby.. I don't know.""


.
.
.

SMELL

I have never had much of a sense of smell, so I'm not sure how to answer this part of the entry. I suppose there's the smell of rain and humidity, because the weather has been really shitty lately. My blanket also smell of the mixture of Danny's scent and mine. Though it's mine, it lays on our bed and both our scents make it onto the fabric. I also smell Shilo's litter box a bit, mostly because I have to clean it and I have been pretty lazy with most of the housework. On the weekends, I don't do much since it's my days off from being the housewife, cook and maid. I think I smell eggs as well because Danny made us deviled eggs a little while ago and the house still smells like our meal. I think it also smells a bit like smoke because our boiler just had a problem a few weeks ago and there is still soot covering all of our walls. Someday I'm going to have to wash that off, but for the most part the house smells a lot cleaner and humane than the home I left far behind when I moved out of my parent's house. I'm grateful for the lack of smell these days. 

.
.
.

TOUCH

My legs are asleep at the moment because I've been sitting indian style for so long. They are all pins and needle-y up to the knees, but from the knees up to my stomach, they're warm. I needed to put the red and black blanket between me and the laptop because the computer was burning marks onto my thighs. It has no lapdesk and the fan is right by my thigh. Sometimes it gets so red that I think I've permanently injured myself. I really should get something for my lap to prevent that. For now, I use a blanket between us, but it still gets rather hot. It might not be so bad if I could get myself to wear pants, but these days I usually only wear a shirt for most of the time. Moving upward, my stomach is a little achy because it's the first day of my period, and I'm PMSy. I was really bad this morning, but it seems to have subsided a bit. My back is also aching. It feels like shit lately and I'm going to have to get back to the gym soon or my muscles are going to completely atrophy. My shirt is scratchy on my back. My armpits are sticky and I could use a shower. My hair and scalp are so dry and yet greasy. Really not the best statement I could be making with myself. My eyes feel heavy even though I've gotten a decent amount of sleep. I haven't been sleeping too well, but I took a 5 hour nap this afternoon. My hands are typing on the keyboard which feels smooth and clean. 

.
.

TASTE

My mouth is dry, my tongue scratchy and yet I can still taste the eggs that Dan made for our last meal. They were deviled eggs with yellow mustard, relish, Spanish paprika, salt and pepper. He makes really good food. My lips are dry, like they usually are in the winter and taste of dead skin.

CONTEST,14,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/15y24w/pi_thunderstorm_jan_contest/,"The afternoon was breathing today. Its heavy clouds were abreast the gentle blue of summer and the bodies of battered buildings crawled across the stone streets with their shadows. Presently, Sgt. Miles had just finished screaming the order to find cover. He himself held tightly to his rifle, back pressed against a stone wall. Alex could see the bodies of his platoon crumpled against that wall, searching in vain for a semblance of redemption from the fear. The smell of bodies and debris grew tired in the heat and had now slowed their intrusion of the Alex’s senses. His attention instead, sharpened on the small procession of stones, dirt, and blood that stood vigil over the dead body of Pvt. Strawther. No one dared to move him, being that the bullet that had emptied his brain only a few moments earlier was still unclaimed. 

He remembered that Sgt. Miles had called it thunderstorm, the sound that sniper fire made. The sensation of the bullet burning through your skin apparently made you register its cry of resistance much later than it actually was. At least, that's what the Sergeant had told Alex earlier. Regardless, the noise of thunder meant that one should find themselves behind cover. So he sat, an uneasy grin on his face, beside him Pvt. Strawther prostrate in grotesque offering to his murderer. The solemnity of the silence forced his smile, this outranked the quiet Sundays he often spent in church, eyes closed in prayer before he heard his name. 

Alex’s attention wandered to a window blemishing the cold face of a building sitting squat at the end of the street. The darkness of the stone hands that lifted it high above them wassuddenly betrayed by a sharp glint of steel. Thunder struck first in this instance, a sound charging beside him as a bullet bore low on the wall face and the sniper receded back into his shadow. Alex looked over to the where the shot had come from. He didnt register it at first but then the weight of his heart fell upon his stomach and shuddered. He saw the dull sickly brown of his Sergeant's uniform, the sun resting upon the shouldered rifle aimed at the building. He saw it again, the clenched fist falling, a gesture of his end. Clasped fingers urged him out of cover to draw fire, Sgt. Miles was ferrying him to his death.

Still watching the window, Alex sat silently brooding over his sentence. His rifle felt heavy on his chest and its metal barrel kissed him just as Madeline used to. Her hands tucked tightly between his, her unfamiliar farewell overwhelming him with the sensation of blue, blue like the sky was now.  He watched as another plume of smoke and dust exploded from a shot fired towards the window. The hand gestured again, calling him to move. He relished the waking moment he spent with her and the sky, then a voice ushered him back into his nightmare. He edged himself across the wall, its coarse embrace reminding him of the unusual sensation of first. The first ice cream he ever had, the first knee scrape, the first kiss, the first love. Alex rounded the corner, his legs carrying him out into the gaping maw of the street. He ran on, meek, heavy footed, and scared.

Lightning struck first in this instance, the bullet leaping through the mist of dust and tearing into his chest. Alex desperately rummaged through the scenes of his past to recollect a time when breathing was natural but only the agony met him. It worsened until his feet surrendered into the temptation of pain. His knees buckled beneath him, giving way for his face to hit the ground. Blood started to run freely from his nose and he spat, he struggled to breathe through the scarlet mess that heavily caked his face. He clasped his fingers around his nose as a final prayer for salvation. His other hand moved hastily to his neck, clawing and squeezing his throat. Fingers clenched, he pressed himself up and retched from the blood and saliva that overwhelmed his mouth. The air grew heavier and he struggled to simply hold his body up. He fell even harder. Bones crushed beneath his sternum, his fingers unable to escape the looming torso that fell atop them. The sound was sickening, the pain blaring, and the metallic taste of blood strangled him. The perverse grasp of unconsciousness eased in from the corners of his eyes. The sensations in his body deepened towards a final symphony, thunder,  before it became fainter. Slowly the quivers of his body and the tinges of pain dissipated until it became quiet. This distorted unknown emotion was nauseating and his mind drifted into the dark corridors of dread. He was unsure of this fleeting sensation; he had never felt it before but essentially he knew. He was dying; this was a first.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1358130432.0,,,True,t3_15y24w,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/15y24w/pi_thunderstorm_jan_contest/,

Everything was in its place, just as it was when I left… just as it should be. Memories came flooding back. It was overwhelming. There was the master bedroom. My parents had lived their once, and I can still remember lying between them on those stormy nights, when the wind howled loudly, like a myriad of hungry wolves, shaking the brass headboard. I too shared that bed later in life with my wife. I remember waking up next to her fragile body, seeing the pure bliss in her eyes as the sun climbed up over the hilltops outside. Then there was the living room, where my only son took his first steps. The walls were still a pasty, tan colour, and a Monet reproduction was still hanging on the back wall. Through a narrow archway was the kitchen, with the stain-covered marble island and the dusty tiles, and the pesky bit of flooring that would always refuse to be covered. It was in that room where everyday, I would come home to a warm meal prepared by my wife, no matter the circumstance. Of course, it was also there where I discovered that there would be no more warm meals, and I still remember her empty body slouched against the stove, a beautiful flower doomed by the merciless winter. And under all that sorrow was the cellar, which would become my son’s room, where he would stay for days without showing his face. It was there where I found him in his darkest hour, tormented by the loss of mother, hanging from the ceiling fan by a short rope.

This kinda took on its own direction, and ended up as the prelude to an adventure, so I thought I'd post it separately. Critique and opinion welcome.

==

There had always been something odd about Adam's bathroom mirror. When he'd moved into the apartment, the mirror was already there with its surface covered in scratches: Adam simply hadn't gotten around to replacing it yet. He stared into the mirror blankly, as he did most mornings: without at least some caffeine in his bloodstream, Adam was unlikely to win awards for alertness. Perhaps today was an exception, because he noticed that the scratches on the mirror were all in the same direction. Probably nothing.

Adam kicked himself awake with an espresso on his way to work. The marks on his mirror were playing on his mind a little: all of them in the same direction, and some thicker than others. Maybe it fell down and was dragged at some point, then the previous owner hung it back up and hoped no-one would notice. Must've been half-blind, if they thought they'd get away with it; Adam would have to get in touch with the landlord.

==

He walked back home during lunch, and decided to get his neighbour's opinion on the mirror. Adam had only talked to the retired gentleman next door on a few occasions in the months since he'd moved in, so the man was more than happy to indulge Adam's questioning for a while, in the interests of neighbourly fraternity.

""So, what'd you make of it, Simon?""

""I thought you'd never get around to asking, son.""

As they both stood in Adam's bathroom, Simon brought his face closer to the mirror. Wispy strands of grey hair became magnified, and deep creases in his lined face multiplied, as he stayed close to the mirror while speaking.

""He was a strange one, Mr Ryan was. Lived here before you did, for a coupla years, and something always seemed a little... off, if you know what I mean.""

""No idea what you mean, sir,"" Adam replied.

""Mm, well. He invited me in one time, showed me what he was doing to this mirror: Mr Ryan was etching some lines into the thing. He said it was a message... I kinda left at that point.""

""Right, sure. ...A message, he said?""

""Yah, he might've been a little cracked. Let me know if you work it out, eh?""

==

Adam didn't get much work done after lunch. He mulled over what this ""Mr Ryan"" could've meant by a message in the mirror, and why he'd scratched all kinds of lines into it. Deliberately, no less.

""Delivery for Mr Clark?""

""Er, yes,"" Adam blurted. The FedEx guy had crept up on him, and was now presenting a parcel. As Adam looked up, the messenger was scanning a barcode from one of the labels plastered on the box: a short beep later, he was asked for a signature.

As the messenger left, Adam stared blankly at the package that had been delivered. There were barcodes of various sizes overlaid on each other on its surface: he turned the box in his hands, until one of the larger stickers had its lines running in a similar direction to those on the mirror.

""A barcode? Nah...""

==

As evening came, Adam had pulled the mirror from his bathroom wall, and was engaged in an attempt to lift the pattern of scratches: he'd found some paper, and was now rubbing a pencil over it to try transferring the ridges from the mirror underneath. Surprisingly, the lines were coming through quite well: faint in places, but he could draw them up into something usable.

With a completed transfer on the coffee table, Adam had two things come to mind. It definitely looked like a barcode, if quite a long one; and he was pretty sure that he was a little insane for even taking things this far. Well, a little craziness was fine: if the barcode didn't scan that would be the end of it.

Adam pulled out his phone, and started up the barcode scanner. He pointed the camera at the sheet of paper on the coffee table, covered in pencil striations of varying thickness and shade. A green indicator on the phone's screen, and:

---------------------------------------------------------------------


It had been a long day, and we were both laying down, trying to sleep. I, however, couldn’t catch any sleep if I wanted to, and the fidgeting in the bunk across the room told me 56 was experiencing the same thing.

“Hey, Five-Six.” I spoke, almost to the air.

“Yeah?” His voice sounded as restless as mine.

“What’s your name?”

“00244568.” The response had become automatic at this point.

“No. Your name! What you went by before you were cloned.” I was getting a little irritated. Not as irritated as I would be at his response.

“I’ve always been a clone.”

“No! You fucking haven’t! You’re a real fucking person, with real fucking memories of a real fucking family! You had a real fucking life, a real fucking job, and real fucking people that you knew and loved, and they fucking stole it from you! Now what the fuck is your name!”

“James! James! Christ! My name is fucking James!”

I paused. We both sat in silence. I let myself cool down for what felt like a good solid minute.

“I’m sorry I yelled at you, James.”

I could see the dim light reflecting off of his eyes. He must have been holding back tears. Now that I think about it, it must have been the first time he’d been either apologized to or addressed by his real name in months.

“What’s your name, man?”

“Michael.”

“Can I call you Mike?”

I was trying not to cry, at this point, myself. I hadn’t been asked that question in years. I never thought there would come a day when I wouldn’t be annoyed by it. Usually my answer would have been no, but now, all I could get out was “Of course.”

“Cool. Sorry, Mike. I didn’t mean to get you riled up.”

""You know I'm not one to break promises, but I don't think that we can be...together anymore."" I hate to see it, but I can't look away from her face. Her response is just as I feared it would be. She starts crying. 

""Why? We're... we were so good together,"" she asks in her high-pitched crying voice. 

""You know we're headed separate ways,"" I tell her. ""I mean, I'm still working at the freaking movie theater. My writing is going no where. I'm awful and you know it. But you, you got into Princeton. Freaking *Princeton!* You deserve more than me,"" I tell her, fighting back tears of my own.

""Fine. Fine,"" she said, turning angry instead of sad. She starts to walk out the door. I remember the old quote '*if you love someone, set them free*,' and realize just how fitting it is in this situation. As she leaves, she says the words that will always leave me in regret. ""You want to be this big of an idiot about it, so...I'll be on my way.""

1376661892.0,11,self.WritingPrompts,1khky9,[PI] I Guess - August Contest,11,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1khky9/pi_i_guess_august_contest/,"My father gave me two pieces of advice when I was young: Never lie, and never accept defeat.

I was never very good at following advice.

But we’ll get to that later. Right now, we need to talk about me. That’s what I’m here for, after all.

I’ve been going to college for the past three years, trying to earn a major in Biology. It may only be at the state school, but hey, I worked hard to get there, and I’m doing my damnedest to earn this degree if it kills me. I’ve loved biology since I was like 4 years old or something like that. Maybe it was six. Who cares.

Anyway. Mom’s paying for my college right now, and I want to get a job in bio so that I can pay her back for all she’s done for me throughout her life. Oh, and also for college. Mom just kinda gave me control to the college fund account, so I guess I’m paying, but it’s her money, so she’s my sponsor. I guess.

So… yeah. That’s what’s going on with me right now.

… Alright, fine. That’s a load of bullshit. Bullshit, that’s what that is. I dropped out of college the first semester. I’m a real smart kid, I guess; I mean, I like to think that’s true, but I just have no motivation. Right now, anyway. I’ll get to that later, though. 

Anyway.

I’ve drained the account already. It was supposed to put me through at least a year of school; Mom always made a lot of money, and there was like 40k or something in there, but it’s kinda gone now. I can’t even remember what I spent it on.

Bullshit. Again. That’s me, lifelong bullshitter. Sorry, Dad, I really didn’t take your advice to heart.

I know exactly what I spent it on.

At first it was just alcohol. I mean, at that point in my life, when I’d dropped out ‘cause I was too fucking lazy too get anything done, it was just a way for me to forget. Then I moved on to painkillers. Those killed the account pretty fast, along with paying rent for the shitty apartment I’d found. The pills turned me into a zombie, so I just switched back to booze. That way, I could at least think while I was marinating in my self-pity. Or at least be conscious, if not really thinking. I’d sit in the apartment and drink until I couldn’t think anymore. Drown my sorrows in shitty whiskey, I guess.

My sorrows? Yeah, yeah, I know, you need me to be detailed and clear if I want you to help me. Got it.

Alright, fine. I guess this all goes back to when my dad died. 

It was my fault. I never should’ve let him go out that night to get milk from the store. I should’ve gotten it, but I was too damn lazy. I should’ve been the one who got mugged. I should’ve been shot in the stomach. I should’ve bled out in that alley. Not him.

Again, that’s bullshit. I don’t know why I make up so many fucking stories. Keeps my mind off of how pathetic my own life’s gotten, I guess.

It was cancer. Colon cancer. That’s what killed him. His own body saying “fuck you,” and all his organs working to rot him from the inside out. He finally died right before my graduation.

He didn’t even get to see me cross the fucking stage.

…Alright, here’s the big one, I guess.

I didn’t visit him in the hospital.

And that’s not bullshit. That’s just me being a shitty son.

I was “too busy” hanging out with friends, trying to relish the last few days with buddies before we finished high school and never saw each other again except maybe through Facebook. That was my excuse, anyway. I was trying to keep myself from even having to *think* about worrying about my dying father.  I was busy repressing that, pushing it away. Trying to forget that my dad wouldn’t make it.

I never fucking visited him. Not one. Single. Time. Not even when my mom begged me to.

I’m a fucking horrible person.

The last time I saw him was in his coffin at the funeral. I didn’t even give a fucking eulogy. How sad is it that your only child won’t even speak at your own funeral? Because he’s too pathetic?

Anyway, the hospital people told me they found a letter on his bedside table that he left for me.

I took it home without reading it, and almost burned it, but instead I just crumpled it up and threw it in the trash can in my room.

At least, I tried to. It missed, and got stuck somewhere behind my desk in my room in my house. I didn’t bother to take it out.

It’s been stuck there since he died, I guess. At least, until two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago, when I found the letter, I decided to tell mom the truth. I’d been bullshitting her long enough.

I guess I wanted her to cry, to tell me that I was a horrible person, that she raised me better, but instead, she just sighed like she expected it, like she knew it was coming. She told me I could move in with her if I wanted, but I told her I’d just take my stuff to my apartment and go. She just said ""whatever.""

Man, I’m a fucking terrible son. She didn’t even seem disappointed, just… resigned. Like she knew, in her heart, that I’d never be anything more than a leech. That’s what I am. A parasite.

I found the note when I was moving my desk. I didn’t know what it was. I figured it was probably some shitty poetry, or something like that, that I’d written after dad died.

I brought the letter with me today. Here, I’ll read it, I guess:

&gt;Son,

&gt; I know that the last few months have been terribly difficult for you, maybe even more so than for me. It’s very difficult knowing that your parent will never see you get married, never see you have children, never get to see the smiles on the faces of his grandkids.

&gt; I know why you didn’t visit me. And it’s okay. It’s okay that you didn’t visit me.

&gt; I know this is the part where I’m supposed to tell you how disappointed I am in you. How I can’t believe you let your grief rule you, how hurt I am that you never came by for your own father.

&gt; But I’m not disappointed in you. I understand. Really, I do.

&gt; I bet you still remember what we had for dinner that night. Steak, broccoli, and those box mashed potatoes, the ones you always asked for us to buy because you liked them. I don’t think you’ll ever forget any details from that conversation.

&gt; Telling you I was going to die was the second hardest thing I’ve ever done. The hardest thing I’ve ever done is living with your face afterwards. You had an expression of sadness that runs through to the soul, of grief so profound it becomes you.

&gt; You let your grief consume you.

&gt; In my last moments, you chose to forget that I was dying. You accepted defeat.

&gt; And that’s okay. I probably would have done the same thing. It’s so much harder to deal with the death of a parent when you know that it’s coming. I speak from experience.

&gt; I won’t kid you, I think this is my last night. So, here’s what I want you to do and not do as you go on without me.

&gt; Don’t lie. Lies poison you. They make it so you live your whole life suspicious that you might say the wrong thing and someone will catch you.

&gt; Don’t give up either. Don’t be one of those people who recedes into themselves because they can’t handle their grief. I had to die eventually. It’s the one thing that’s constant for everyone. *Memento mori,* the saying goes.

&gt; Here’s what I want you to do: be sad for me. Cry at my funeral;  wish I’m there when you know I can’t be; be reminded of me by little things like when my favorite movie comes on TV, or you hear my favorite song.

&gt; And then, move on. Don’t let my death be a burden on you. That’s the absolute last thing that I want.

&gt; I hope you read this, son. It took forever to figure out how to say everything that I wanted to.

&gt; Be nice to you mother. Tell her I love her.

&gt; And know that I love you. I’ll miss you as much as you’ll miss me.

&gt; Oh, and, in honor of me, make sure you watch the baseball game every so often. I may not see it, but this will finally be the year that we win the World Series.

&gt; Love,  
&gt; Dad

So, that’s what he wrote. Looks like, yet again, I sucked at following dad’s advice. I didn’t do anything that he asked for in his letter. I lied. I gave up after he died. I never moved on.

I accepted defeat. Because I’d defeated myself. I accepted defeat, just like my dad told me not to.

It’s time I started listening to him, I guess.

What? Okay, fine. You’re right. I need to stop saying I guess. It means I doubt myself and yadda yadda.

Fine. It’s time I followed my dad’s advice and moved on. That’s why I moved out. That’s why I’m saving all my money to pay back my mom. That’s why I stopped drinking. I’ve been clean since I found the letter.

And that’s why I came in to you. Because I need help. I need to take the broken pieces of my life and put them back together. And I think therapy’s the best place start.

I may be broken, but, as Dad used to say, there’s nothing that can’t be fixed.

I have to move on. I have to stop surving, and start living, I guess.

No, I don’t guess. Not on that one. That one I know.

Because if I know anything in this fucked-up world we live in, it’s that Dad loved me more than anything. Even baseball.

Thanks for the meeting. I appreciate it. I learned a lot about myself.

I’m going to go visit Dad in the graveyard. It’s about time I did that.

And then I’m going to finally move on. I’m only going to think about happy memories of Dad, not any of that guilt shit that’s been dragging me down.

Because that’s what Dad would want. It’s what he deserves from his son.

And that’s something that I know for sure.

1375939708.0,12,self.WritingPrompts,1jxsss,[PI] I'M SORRY - August Contest,12,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jxsss/pi_im_sorry_august_contest/,"We buried my good for nothing bitch of a sister last week.  She died sad and alone, just what she deserved.  Today we go to the attorney's and sort out her will.  We were told it was an audio will, and that the attorney would clear the room of any who were not allowed to be present, turn it on, and leave.

I arrive at the attorney's office and am greeted by the teared eyes and puffy faces of my mother and youngest sisters.  I don't know how or why, but they've been crying pretty much nonstop since the incident.  I try my best to act concerned and saddened, just so they would calm down a little.  The attorney comes out, looking a little dejected.  ""I'm sorry to say this, but she requested that only David be present for the reading.  The rest of you will need to stay out here with me during the presentation.""  He turns specifically to me.  ""When you're ready, follow me, and I'll start the tape.""  I nod and follow him back to his office.

I get comfortable in one of the large-backed leather chairs sitting in front of the attorney's desk.  In front of me sits one of those old reel tape players.  The attorney walks over, clicks play, and leaves.  Soon, the familiar sound of my now-dead sister's voice fills the room.

""David, if you're hearing this, then I have died before I ever got to rectify my mistakes.  I'm sorry.  Everything you've ever said about me was true.  I was cold and heartless to you.  I was always trying to outshine you, take away all your thunder.  I spread rumors behind your back, I told our parents complete lies just to get you in trouble.  They always believed me, took my word in every argument, doted me when they ignored you.  I am truly sorry for all the harm I did to you.

""I also regret never being there for you.  When you were bullied in school, I joined in, simply to get in with the popular crowd.  When you were suffering from depression and our parents wouldn't believe you, I knew, and I never did anything to convince them.  When you were in terrible relationships, instead of showing you what was wrong, I belittled you and your girlfriend.  When you were struggling through college, I never helped you, I instead insulted you for failing classes.  When you couldn't find a job, I called you a worthless, lazy lowlife instead of trusting in you and encouraging you.  When you got married, I called your wife a whore, a bitch, and all manner of names, and skipped your wedding, when I really should have been there for you on your biggest day.  Again, I am truly, truly sorry.

""And you know what?  The saddest part about this is that *I did it out of love for you.*  I'm so, so jealous of you.  You got all the smarts, you pursued a fulfilling career, you had the true friends, you found true love.  I tried to make up with a sharp tongue, a successful but shallow business, lots of fairweather friends, and lots of meaningless, self-centered relationships.  I tried to be you, tried to steal your successes, your friends, your love.  But in the end I ended up being anything but you.  Goes to show how much being yourself actually does matter.

""I know it isn't much of an apology, and really a late one at that, but in order to make it up to you, I'm leaving you everything.  The magazine, the New York penthouse, the sports cars, the bank account, everything.  It's all yours.  Do as you please with it.  Just please, please forgive me for everything I did to you and everything I should have but didn't.  *Know that I love you, with all of my heart, and I always have. I've just been terrible at showing it.*""

I get up, expressionless, remove the reel, stick it in my pocket, and walk out.  My mother and sisters are still puffy-faced and teary-eyed.  I barely acknowledge them as I walk out the door.

I tread across the somber knoll with a lilac in my hand.  They were her favorite flower.  My knees press deep into the freshly packed dirt of her grave as I place the flower in the little vase on her gravestone.  A single tear rolls down my cheek, the first one since that fateful night.

I'm sorry, too, Dani.  I'm sorry for the way I treated you when you needed an understanding and compassionate brother.  I'm sorry I didn't stop you from leaving when I knew your new guy had been abusing you, and he'd had too much to drink.  And I'm sorry I never got to tell you that I loved you, too, while you were still alive.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1375998840.0,,,True,t3_1jxsss,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jxsss/pi_im_sorry_august_contest/,

Matt knows what song I’d like played at the service.  I told Nina how I’d hate to be eulogized on Facebook like they did for that girl who died in that car crash.  I made my four-year-old cousin memorize the passcode to my phone so he could share photos, videos, notes when I’m gone.  Practically my entire life is on there.  My life…

I think I’m expecting someone to piece together all these bread crumbs like a detective set on cracking the case of my life, my death.  As naïve as it is to place faith in a four-year-old, or in tidbits of conversation that were most likely forgotten, it still comforts me to know that I’m leaving clues behind.  These clues would solve the mystery of me if anyone cared to take it on.  But deep down I know, I know.  No one in this world had ever, will ever want to solve my mystery.  No one except me.  And I go to my dying day having never solved it.  

I’m not talking about the mystery of my death.  I won’t be a homicide case, I won’t be an unexplained suicide.  I’m talking about my life.  That’s what they’re supposed to talk about at my funeral, isn’t it?  The preacher’s not going to break out the chart of my autopsy and explain the cause of death in cold, medical jargon.  He’s going to embellish the story of my life with, “She was beautiful, she was kind, she was loving…”  And then he’s going to cap it all off with, “But most importantly, she was saved.”

Ahh, what comfort it is to tell the mourning that their loved one is in a better place.  There’s a peace that settles the grieving heart when it’s told that their daughter, sister, friend is in Heaven.   But it leaves it at that.  She’s in Heaven.  The end.  No, there’s no unfinished business with her.  No, there’s no unsolved mystery.  Yes, I’ll tell you her story.  But I’ll tell it through my eyes because I never ventured deep enough into her soul to explore appearance versus reality, to question her bright demeanor and discover her darkness, to glimpse what she saw when she looked at herself because I never thought to seek the true woman.  She was my daughter, sister, friend.  I’ll tell you that story, because that’s the only side of her I know.

How self-centered I am to think that within me is a whole universe to be revealed.  I am conceited to think that I could be important enough to have books and documentaries made about my life.  I am not so special.  Just look at my profile on Facebook.  Look at my likes.  Never averaging above five on a post.  Look at my social life, my schedule.  One outing every two weeks? Pathetic.  My love life…  My lack of one.  Now look at me judging me based on the most trivial measures.  Meaningless, vain measures of status that only the most worldly would use to size a person’s worth.  Yet that’s how I gauge my insignificance.  I may be self-centered, but at this center I hold a lowly position.  At this lowly position I maintain an inner longing, holding my masked appearance of well-being, hoping that someday someone will look beyond the status likes and social outings to solve my mystery and discover the real me.

1372919296.0,11,self.WritingPrompts,1hmc3c,[PI] Thin Blood - July Contest,11,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1hmc3c/pi_thin_blood_july_contest/,"Brandon pressed his lips against the steel flask and cocked his head back to have the gin flow down his throat. He was getting low again, in fact it rushed down faster than he anticipated and the last few drops spilled into his mouth. Pulling the flask away from his mouth, he tipped it upside down and shook it violently, revealing no more drops of his warm nectar. Winter hasn’t even started yet, and he was going to have to scrap up some cash for some more winter clothes, and hopefully some booze. Nothing makes a winter go by faster than not even feeling it to begin with. Brandon made his walk toward the corner of 23 street, in which he always sat out and got a few dollars for the day. 

A few past memories seeped into his head, the days where he was happy, where he was better, but at the cost of his own morality. He was an ex mercenary, a contract killer for hire. He slayed women, children, even a princess. After a while, he couldn’t do it anymore, he knew it was wrong and laid down the gun. 

“Change?” he said to a passerby who only continued walking without showing any sign of acknowledgement. Another man passed by as he raised his cup up again. This wasn’t a way to live, but now it was the only way he knew. At the end of the sidewalk he saw a man running, clearly in a hurry. His hair was freshly cut, his tie was made perfectly, his suit was well tailored. This guy had money, so as he started to run by Brandon, he swiftly stuck his leg out and tripped the man whose briefcase spilled into the ground revealing pills of all kinds.

“You little peasant,” said the man as he started to scramble for the pills “No, no, no, it’s all ruined!” The man grew angry and stuck his hand into the throat of Brandon and slammed him against the wall “Don’t you homeless people have any manners?”

“I’m sorry sir, but you ran into me,” said Brandon as he tried to smile from the situation. The man’s grip wasn’t too tight, and he knew he could reverse it when the time came.

“These pills all together are worth ten thousand dollars, do you have ten thousand dollars? No? Well let me just repo your cardboard box and see how you feel, maggot,” said the man whose veins were starting to bulge out of his head as he yelled. The onlookers just continued walking past as though it was another day in the city. Brandon couldn’t take the rudeness anymore and as he was about to flip the man on his back, and recognized his eyes.

“Sal?” said Brandon. The man stopped his barrage of insults and looked at him, wondering how he knew his name and then peered a bit closer.

“Brandon? Damn, you’re a mess, what happened to the assassin business?” asked Sal, they used to be close friends, and he even helped him once on some trouble from a rival drug dealer. Their relation was blood though, Sal was his brother, though he refused to even associate with his kind anymore “Look, you want the truth?” Sal looked around as though he was making sure no one was overhearing the conversation then leaned into his ear.

“I’m ten thousand dollars in debt right now to Vincent, and if I don’t get the money by tomorrow, my head is off, and I’ll be sleeping with the fishes faster than you can say ‘That’s the game you play’,” said Sal as he pulled away “, I need your help. You need to do a job for me.”

“What’s the job?” asked Brandon. Sal rustled through his briefcase, putting the rest of the pills that have fallen over into it and pulled out a picture. It was a picture of a family, a man, a woman, and two children both a boy and a girl.

“This guy lives in a house on 31st street, he owes me $25,000 to be precise, but he hasn’t given me a damn dime in a year and I know that cocky little prick is in cahoots with Vincent,” said Sal “I want you to head over there, and ask him so kindly for the money. If he doesn’t, send him a message to make sure he learns his mistake, and see what you can scrape up with the valuables in his house that equals $10,000 so I can get Vincent off my ass.”

“Do I look like I’m still in the mercenary business?” asked Brandon.

“Look, do you want your own brother dead knowing you could have helped him live? I need your help Brandon, you’re the only one that can help me,” a tear rolled down his eyes. Brandon knew he was telling the truth, but he didn’t think he’d have to reenter the game this way. You know what they say though, if you’re good at what you do, you’ll always come back to it.

“I don’t have anything anymore though, look at me, I’m a mess,” said Brandon as he lifted up his hands and grabbed his clothes to stretch out and reveal the holes.

“Don’t worry,” said Sal who slipped a card in his pocket “Give this to Frank on Elm Street, he’ll hook you up, and for god sake ask for a shower because you stink more than Daisy on a friday night.” Brandon couldn’t help but laugh, Daisy was a known whore on the streets, but she was also Sal’s wife. Don’t know why, maybe he just likes girls that are easy.

“Alright Sal, I’ll help you this time, but after this I wanted to be done with this kind of work,” said Brandon.

“Brandon! You’re living in a cardboard box, burning trash in a barrel holding out a cup to scrape up some dimes,” said Sal throwing the harsh reality in his face “Work for me, and you won’t ever have to worry about when your next food is, or how you’re going to wipe your ass.” It was a tempting offer, to finally get out of being homeless and into what he was always good at.

“You got yourself a deal, brother,” said Brandon who stuck his hand out.

“What part of you smell terrible don’t you understand?” said Sal smacking his hand away “But it’s good to have you back, now get going I need the money ASAP,” as he grabbed his briefcase and started to jog the direction he was heading previously “See you soon.”

Brandon started to walk toward Elm Street, which was a few miles away as he looked at the card and saw the specific address. He remembered the man, Frank was his name, but some called him The Arsenal. They even said that the police department get their weapons through him. If you look at the crime rates, you would believe it to be true. The address lead him to a construction site, with a small trailer in the back. As he walked toward the trailer he was stopped by one of the construction workers.

“Are you lost, hobo?” said the construction worker who pressed his hand hard against Brandon’s chest and pushed him away.

“I was sent here by Sal,” said Brandon who held up Frank’s card. The construction worker laughed and grabbed the card in which he pulled out his phone and scanned it.

“Checks through,” he said the man who let him go by. As Brandon walked passed him the man pulled his collar back and tossed him to the ground “But you have to pass the final test.” He lifted up the crowbar that was in his hand and was going for a brutal blow before Brandon rolled out the way. Two more men ran to the scene and it gave Brandon a flash of the past. Sal was always worried that Brandon was getting old for his job, and would always test him. 

With a swift kick to one of the men that ran up, it knocked the man’s construction hat off in which Brandon grabbed it and slammed it hard into the face of the other. The man with the crowbar rushed forward and swung. Brandon grasped the handle of the crowbar and pulled, causing the man to continue forward off balance and straight into the fist of Brandon . The crowbar slipped to the ground and Brandon kicked it up to his hand only for a man to get out of the trailer.

“Stop! You’re going to kill them Brandon,” said Frank as he walked out “Forget about these neanderthals and come in, Sal called me about his little side job for you.” The other men scurried away as the got up and Brandon dropped the crowbar to the ground and entered the trailer Frank motioned for him to sit down.

“Just give me what I need and I’ll be on my way,” said Brandon as he stayed sitting up. Frank laughed at the response.

“Ah Brandon, you was always about business, but look at you now! You look dead!” replied Frank.

“If I could only be so lucky,” replied Brandon who kept his body tense.

“I understand,” he said as Frank reach under his desk and pressed a button. The wall on the left that had a map of the supposed construction of the site flipped over and an arsenal that could kill a city was revealed. Frank tossed a bag at him in which Brandon proceeded to look at it and kick it away. He only grabbed the machete, and a pistol.

“This is all I’ll need,” said Brandon as he started to walk away.

“Are you sure? Did Sal even tell you what you’re up against?” asked Frank as it caused Brandon to pause and look back. The expression of confusion on his face answered it all “You’re going against the big five, Leo is the one you’re looking for, but I bet he didn’t tell you that there is a meeting in his house. That means Angelo, John, Rascatti, and even Vincent himself will be there.”

“Are you kidding me? That’s suicide!” said Brandon as he rushed back into Frank’s face “You’re expecting me to go up against almost the whole goddamn city as every kingpin will be loaded with body guards.”

“Desperate times calls for desperate measures,” said Frank as he held his hands in the air as though saying he has nothing to do with it “If you don’t stop all of them now, Sal won’t exist tomorrow.”

“Over $10,000?” asked Brandon he felt something was off.

“Yeah, and also banging Vincent’s wife,” said Frank. Brandon only cringed at that remark. Sal was never able to keep it in his pants. He placed the machete back and grasped the lone samurai sword in which he strapped to his side, and grabbed a few grenades.

“This is the last favor I’m doing him for sure,” said Brandon as he walked out the door. A limousine awaited him outside that would take him to the street he needed to be. He didn’t speak to the driver, nor to Frank who yelled the words “Good luck!” as he left. No, he was going to have to enter his old world again, no mercy.

He was dropped off at the corner and the house that he was targeting was in the middle. It was the largest house on the street, and the set of cars in front of it gave way that this was more than just a typical night. Brandon gazed his eyes around, for an alternate route in and saw a basement hatch in the back as he went into the garden. He could hear laughter inside the house as he opened up the hatch and went in. It was a large wine cellar, and it had an off smell to it, something he remembered but couldn’t quite put a name on it.

Then he turned the corner and saw a body in the chair, tortured completely. If he was alive still it’d be a miracle. Brandon stepped forward and pressed his finger against the neck, no heartbeat. Footsteps were coming downstairs.

“No, this time you’re carrying the body and I’m dumping it,” said one man.

“Fine fine, stop being a wuss,” said the other as Brandon hid under the stairs quickly and peeked through the steps. He could see them going over to the body, as he took his pistol out. Then he noticed he forgot to add the silencer, worthless. He pulled out his sword slowly, and tilted a bit out. As they started to untie the man, Brandon rushed forward and sliced the head off one man. Before the other man could react, Brandon took the sheath of the sword and slammed it into the throat of the man to catch him off guard. With a quick movement he sliced the sword through the heart and pulled out slowly as the man dropped to the floor. 

With no time to waste he continued up the steps which lead to the kitchen area. He could see a few cooks running around, which meant that the men were probably in the next room. There was no way he would be able to get in there without causing a ruckus. A man entered the back room.

“Hey do you guys make an cheese burgers or something?” asked the guy, and in the other room he could hear the guest yell his name, Angelo, to get back in. Time is ticking, he had to make a move, and Brandon pulled out the pistol and fired a bullet straight into the skull of Angelo. The cooks screamed and dropped to the ground as the body fell as well. He pulled a grenade off his waist and tossed it into the next room without hesitation as he slammed the door open. He saw them, the crew of now four with a few of their men standing up on guard. The grenade tossed into the room and with three seconds you heard a rush of bodies, and then an explosion. The door blew off the hinges, glass shattered, and you could hear coughs in the smoke. 

Brandon walked back into the room and looked around, the guards were dead, and he could tell one of the kingpins have fallen as he kicked over the body and saw it was John. That means the other three must have went deeper into the house.

“You come into my house, and do this shit?” yelled a man who walked into the room with a tommy gun. It was clearly Leo, as he pulled the trigger and laid down bullets. Brandon dropped to the ground, behind the table and could see the bullets fly above. He was lucky that most of the top men no longer knew how to kill. He heard the click of the gun as the last bullet escaped. Brandon hopped over the table with his pistol drawn as Leo dropped the gun and held his hands in the air. 

“Sal had a message for you,” said Brandon as he fired a bullet. It smashed into Leo’s throat as he gasped for breath and fell on his knees “Your head is now payment.” He didn’t have time to finish him, he’ll die quickly enough as he walked further into the house. He needed to find the last two, Rascatti and Vincent. The next door entered a hallway in which lead to several doors down the path but with each kick to the door there wasn’t anyone in the rooms. It then lead to the lobby, a large area where you could see Rascatti scrambling toward the door. 

Brandon fired a few shots, but both missed and as the battlefield spilled into the streets, he saw one car escape. That had to be Vincent. Rascatti opened the driver door to his vehicle, but he was too slow, all those carbs of spaghetti and pasta was his demise as Brandon rushed up behind him and sliced him in the back, and through the head. He didn’t care though, he kicked the body away to reveal his keys, grabbed it and started the car to get to Vincent. He caught up, as they started ramming into each other with their cars, but neither of them were budging. 

They reached the bridge, and Brandon decided to try one drastic move. He sped up in front of Vincent, and opened up the driver door as he crawled out to the roof of the car, and then jumped into his. With the sunroof in perfect position, he smashed his hand through the roof and dropped a grenade. With a roll off the side of the bridge and into the icy waters he saw the car blow up, and the bridge along with it. The swim to the shore and the walk in order to go back to Leo’s house took an hour or two. He did promise to get the money, but when he arrived it was already surrounded by Sal’s men. Sal exited the house as Brandon got up and he showed him the briefcase of money.

“You did a great service,” said Sal.

“Yeah, so how’s it feel to be the only kingpin?” asked Brandon. Sal smiled and looked up. 

“It feels great, but there’s only one thing, you’re a wanted man now, the loyal members know you’re a traitor and will hunt you down,” said Sal as Brandon quirked his eyebrow. He knew information traveled fast, but not this fast “I tipped them.” Brandon grew furious, but he wasn’t surprised. Sal only thought of himself, that’s why he hated calling him brother. 

“So what now? I have to escape into the unknown again?” asked Brandon.

“You did say you wanted a way out, right? Well, here’s your ticket,” said Sal as he pressed the barrel of his gun into the mouth of Brandon “And here’s my ticket to being painted in infamy when they find out I took revenge on the traitor who killed the big five.” He pulled the trigger, and it was lights out.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1hmc3c,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1hmc3c/pi_thin_blood_july_contest/,

The critiquecast is a side project of Shut Up &amp; Write ([website](http://shutupandwrite.net) &amp;bull; [reddit](/r/shutupandwrite)), a podcast where amateur writers give unfair and unforgiving line-by-line reactions to submitted work. Most of the time, asking for critique from peers results in wimpy, noncommittal feedback. The critiquecast aims to be the opposite extreme: unbridled honesty from the perspective of a prospective reader with no reason to hold back.

The title of the prompt says it all. Some Native American tribes believe one can be possessed by an evil spirit called a wendigo (there are different spelling variations and more information available [at this wikipedia article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo)) This spirit, essentially, turns you into a cannibal.

So, what should you write? Well, anything really.

What Makes A Good Man

Under the sallow flickering glow of a fading light bulb, its stuttering filament as erratic and convulsive as an epileptic firefly in its death throes, Alcides Mayorga surveyed himself in the mirror. A modestly adorned man, he had opted for simple chinos a tight fitting black shirt, so closely fitted to the sculpted contours of his compact frame it gave the impression of a second skin. His spare sensibilities extended beyond wardrobe to the rest of him—he was athletically lean, hair still neatly trimmed in a high and tight, taciturn in speech, and nearly expressionless to boot, his only affectation the hard look of the demobilized—which gave the impression of a man of simplicity and direct manner that engendered trust. Aside from intriguingly garnet colored eyes, his only accessories were two pairs of tattoos on his neck and a gun metal colored right arm.

He docks his handset and runs a diagnostic. The elbow servo was burning out. Motion range restricted to one hundred sixty degrees. Exposed wiring in the wrist by the battery house also promised to wear out soon, if the battery itself didn’t give out sooner. At best he had one charge left.  After that he’d need to start burning six thousand calories a day to keep it running. Rations hardly made eighteen hundred. Better make it count. Alcides needs some servicing soon. He needs to get paid tonight.

Putting away his handset, he catches himself uncomfortably in the mirror. His right shoulder twitches instinctively. It’s a memento of the last tick he ever fought. Big drone came in and clipped his wing in its mandibles. Last thing the army ever paid for was his tin arm. They kind of paid for the Low City hole he lived in and made sure he had something to eat, but they did that for all the creeps, so long as they didn’t try and sneak into center city or get to the upper floors. Clocking in at about twenty pounds despite the light weight alloys and parts, he thought he detected an ever so subtle asymmetry between right and left sides. Shit. Lose an arm and gain neuroses about your body being out of balance. Of all the fucking problems to have—

Deep breath. He draws himself up like a soldier. Chin out, arms drawn in, he’s got all the comportment of a specialist at inspection. *No ma’am, I just play one on the vids*. Exhale. *Whatever, time to make some monopoly*.

Stocktamento sulks in the late summer night. Low City is slung in the mid-nineties, giving the sulfurous perma-fog a volcanic character. Here and there dim street lights hang in the air like disembodied wisps, casting the odd cavernous shadows on doorways, burned out cars, and the lurkers walking the streets. Yeah, the Deeps ‘n’ Creeps are out in force tonight and why not? It’s Friday. Everyone’s got a hustle or a fix and something they need in return. “Fat kissa,” someone hisses in the slum cant and though Alcides still doesn’t get most of it, he knows enough to know that he doesn’t need paper to pay for one the man is offering. He smirks. *I’m on the same side of the dodge, buddy, not your mark.*

Alcides heads to the comrail station in south Lodi. He’s gonna take the Golden Rail to some club north of Yuba, way on the outskirts, close enough to see the north emplacements with their fifty cals and rocket batteries and its famed multivariant armor units—*Holding the Line is their Sacred Duty*—but first he’s gotta get through security. Right at the entrance he gets his mug snapped along with some shuffling tweaker who’s circling the station lights like a wounded moth. Then it’s down towards the turnstiles, filmed in panaroma from eight angles, to the ID pad where he’s got to drop his citizen card in, lean into the eye reader, and slide his right hand against the panel so the near field can register his prosthetic. *Mayorga Mendoza, Alcides. AMM94SF04478. Resident Community Park 84, 2126 Century Boulevard, Room 0166. Cleared for Outer Ring travel. Curfew exempt. Community park privileges revoked. Warning, vitamin d deficiency. Warning, government issued prosthetic in need of service.* Yeah, yeah.

And just like that he’s allowed into the true undercity. Black and red police commandos greet him on the other side with machine gun wariness. Their Dutch language trained canine partner emits guttural disapproval while his robotic counterparts glare at him flat faced with three red eyes from the other side of uncanny valley. *Some respect they got for vets*, he thinks as he takes the escalator down towards the track. It’s a slow ride but walking down quickly is just the thing that draws suspicion. Besides, the train knows to wait anyway.

On the platform it’s just him and this cute young thing wrapped up in a miniskirt and latex bodysuit with cut outs just close to all the right places. Alcides stared. No way she was a creeper. Make-up was on in all the right places without the clownlike proportions and there weren’t and bruises or tracks that he could see. She could be an undercover pop-it looking to slum her fix rather than pay her Middle Thirty premiums, but the apprehension in her eye wasn’t quite wild enough to be from a junkie. No, it was quite rational, smacking of the middle class and a good education. *Doing the Lord’s work here, honey? Taking some pity on the Low City scum before you hit the sky lounges?*

The train comes and there’s only one car open to the two of them. His lucky day. She sits with her legs crossed, a true disappointment, but let’s not get distracted here. Girls like that, they’re not for you, Al ole pal. They’re for the lawyers, doctors, system architects, urban engineers, and maybe the right kind of officer if he’s got demob orders or they were high school sweethearts or something. Can’t buy a girl like that with money or bravado or with a fucking metal arm and over amped right side.

Silence is their only commerce on the lonely ride north. She’s looking away the whole time as the ads flash in from the track walls or the LED panels in the train turn over. He’s under no such obligation to pretend she’s not there. She gets off just north of the river in Arden-Arcade. A black and red and his three eyed robopal make sure that Alcides doesn’t surreptitiously disembark. *Hasta eternidad, chica*, he thinks, *look for me in your dreams, cuz you’re gonna be in mine.*

Another twenty minutes and he’s at the end of the line in Yuba. Six thousand credits later and he can confirm the Tierra Buena stop is anything but, a practical wasteland where you couldn’t hardly find even the ubiquitous octagonal towers of government housing. No, this place was too poor for even the iron clad distinctions of Low, Middle, or High Cities. Just flat and barren. Pill boxes and watch towers are set across the northern horizon amidst the chain links, razor wire, and mined countermeasures just beneath the surface. He can’t help but sigh. Even on a Friday, someone’s gotta be worried about the damn bugs. And if they aren’t worried about them, they gotta watch out for the creepers. A few decades in and you gotta wonder why they even bother with the twenty second century. 

His pause here is more wistful than Alcides would prefer. Free Land Armor Exoskeletons sit majestically in artillery repose under the pale moonlight. Half tank and half walker, the FLARE is the backbone of the Multivariant Armor Corps. The roaring engine overhead might be its winged equivalent, humanity’s MV-cum-savior Land Air Rapid Response Interceptor. But it could just be an automated drone, looking for any movement on the other side of the fence. 

Not that it matters to him. They bounced him out of the MV Corps with a 4-F on a psych eval that meant there was no way they were going to plug him into a transformable tank and no circumstance where they’d pay him to shoot a weapon again. Paramilitaries wouldn’t touch him and he was deemed unlikely to transfer into civil professions. That left harvy or scavy, and when it came down to the choice between an unarmored combine outside the city limits or combing through San Francisco’s bug lands for salvageable material, well, shit. It was the dole for Alcides. Fuck the army. He gave them his arm and six years of his life. They gave him a dark hole to disappear into, complete with protein paste, vitamin chips, and a whole lot of encouragement not to crawl back out.


*


Club Patroklos was not a place deserving of a fancy and hard to pronounce name, but it was discreet with little camera coverage or police patrols. It was full of pop-its and lowlife degenerates, the latter of which he stood out as a prime cut. He’d been casing the place for about six weeks, in and out on weekends and week nights, making himself a familiar face without quite being a regular. Sergey at the door knew him enough to let him in without the customary intimidation. It was not his kind of place but it was the kind of place where he could find someone else who felt out of place. And that mattered.

Lights in Patroklos need to be dim. Everybody’s waif thin with bags so heavy under their eyes you’d think they could carry a second pair of peepers to replace bleary red-rimmed set above. Sweat soaked bodies, shaved heads and three day scruff are on nearly every cheek and he’s not quite sure if it’s the pot that masks the body odor or the other way around. Psilocykos and spiceheads every last one of them, rocking out on pills cut in equal parts phenethylamene and mephadrone, it was hard to tell if they were actually enjoying themselves or biding their time in continuous chemical ecstasy until bug or fatal exhaustion took them. The dance floor is thin tonight, each strobe revealing so few revelers that their twisted and gyrating limbs evoke a burnt out forest. Aside from some East Asian eye candy trafficked in by the ownership, there’s not much to look at.

Alcides heads to the bar to wait and drink. His little paper and familiar face will carry him for a few hours. One finger signals a ‘cocktail,’ barely palatable Patriot Whiskey cut with a homemade fruit mash, and he looks out towards the floor. *They twist like willows caught in a breeze*, he thinks as the heavy bass drop catches him in the chest. He admires this. *They bend but they do not break*. He wants that to be a metaphor for his life.

Cocktails come and go and his gag reflex is pretty worn out by the time he sees him. Tall, easy six foot and change, he’s perfect. Right arm and right leg move in sync with the natural gait but there’s something about the mechanics that don’t quite add up. The baseport below the back of his skull, close cropped hair, and eight tattooed mandibled heads on his neck fill in the rest of the details. A fellow vet with an impressive kill record. Alcides would know. He was proud of the four on his neck but they in no way measured up to eight notches. He only knew one guy who had a record anything close to that.

“Hey there, killer,” he oozes as he slides up next to him at the bar. A face sardonic and bemused and very familiar gave a half turn.

“Specialist Mayorga… Al?”

“Sergeant Lee?” he recognizes with a shit eating grin. Of course it would be that one guy.

“Lieutenant Lee, now. It’s been ages!” and David Lee reaches in for a hearty shake between mechanical arms, when he pats him on the shoulder he realizes for the first time that Alcides’ doesn’t fully extend.

“Only one sixty degree movement. Haven’t made it round the VA lately.”

“Well, what’s twenty degrees between war buddies anyway? And I see you’re going au natural, too.”

“They didn’t have a skin tone that matched me,” he lied. Alcides couldn’t afford the fake skin.

“Ah, who cares? A real man owns his battle scars.” Real men have no choice. It was in Atlanta, that doomed city, when that damned worker caught Specialist Mayorga from behind and clipped his right arm in the middle of the bicep. Sergeant Lee, an uptight by the book asshole of an NCO, seeing one of his subordinates in mortal peril charges from cover and kills the tick with two shots to the eye. He then pulled Specialist Mayorga back to cover where he was tended to by the company medic until he could be extracted by VTOL. At a field hospital in Dalton they removed the remainder of his arm so he could be fitted for a full arm prosthesis. Four months of physical and integrative therapy—not to mention a failed psych exam—later, Specialist Al Mayorga ended and the broken Alcides Mayorga, Resident Community Shithole eightywhatever, was left with the pieces of his life.

“How have you been?” Lee continued, lightning flashes of spotlight illuminating his genuine interest.

“Getting by,” Alcides said, because what else is there to say in a loud bar with a guy you know and memories you thought you were over, “How about you? Last time I saw you, you were all meat and there were only seven of those… You join MV?”

That question was especially painful.

“Nah,” Lee says, getting a couple more cocktails, “I’m infantry for life. After Atlanta I got into an experimental power armor unit. They tried to scale down some of the MV tech for human-armor integration and ditch the transformation aspects.”

“How’d that go?”

Lee takes a gulp of infused grain liquor and pruno and then a second, drinking like Alcides feels.

“Recon drop north of Liberal. Looking to scout enemy positions and expand the EZC north to Garden City,” Alcides had heard of those kinds of missions, taking armor units and mechanized infantry into the badlands to expand the Effective Zone of Control, aka the land around the last cities we hadn’t lost. None of them came with positive reports, “We were at a power station in some burned out burb called Ulysses when we came across several soldier types.

“It was a quick firefight. I mean, they’re always kind of slow and then when they’re over they feel quick but this… wasn’t right. We had a few quadruped pups for support, but each side made hell of the other. The bigger castes, their mandibles cut right through the armor. Snapped mine at the elbow like it was a twig. One of the legs pierced me a little below the pelvis,” he pointed at his right leg, perilously close to the groin, “I lost my rifle but was able to shoot an explosive charge from the arm cannon into its thorax. Blew the bastard in half.”

“Damn,” Alcides said, but he could have just as easily said nothing. It was a kind of story that didn’t need a response.

“They gave me up for lost. My comm booster was damaged when the tick pinned me to the ground. Those suits, if they’re damaged or they don’t detect vitals, they only transmit a low frequency retrieve signal. The rest of the unit came under heavy swarming and pulled out.”

“They left you?”

Lee nodded, “Shock set in pretty quick. I was screaming bloody murder till I couldn’t breathe and then the suit took over. Wrapped emergency tourniquets, cauterized the, the… stumps. Starting sticking me with fluids and transfusions to keep me alive… but, you know, those suits are like anything else. Got a mean battery pack but it doesn’t last forever. Especially not when they’re in full emergency mode. When I saw the HUD flicker and die, I thought I was a goner.”

*Shit*, Alcides thought. He tried to think back to Atlanta. Specialist Mayorga, he only hurt. It wasn’t until he was Alcides Mayorga, lowlife, that he had wanted to die. In the four months he adjusted to the arm and trained to qualify for the MV entrance exam, he had been focused, determined, eager to get back into the fight. It wasn’t till demob that he realized that only a part of him had come back. The not very good part.

“How’d they find you?”

“Meat detail came back to pick up the pieces. They got there just after I passed out, I guess. Were able to power the suit and keep me going till a doc could revive me and they could start fitting me for new pieces,” he had finished his cocktail and was halfway through another, “Demobed after that. Got a PTSD diagnosis and that was that.”

Alcides could relate, “What did you think about?”

Lee was glassy eyed and silent for a while. He took his drink pretty hard and had to force it down with a fist to his mouth.

“I thought about, fucking up. They gave me command and they… died. I wondered about bugs, if they, you know, felt? We killed a bunch. Did they, regret? Miss… things? I don’t know, I was delirious. Mostly I thought about overriding the medical protocols and taking all the morphine in one shot. Going to sleep and never coming back.”

“Why didn’t you?”

“I wanted an eighth tattoo on my neck. I wanted them, someone, to know that I had killed that motherfucker and we had won,” he slapped the bar with a solid sound of metal on scrap metal. The bartender looked over and Alcides gave him a nod and a hand across the neck. Their night had ended.

“Let me get it,” Lee stuttered generously.

“No, let me,” Alcides insisted, “I owe you.”


*


Outside the predawn was arid with the evaporation of old dreams. With Lieutenant Lee draped over his shoulder, he looked at the silhouettes of the FLAREs in the graying sky. Even in the hope of a new day it was hard not to look and think that they had lost something that couldn’t be repaired or replaced. He didn’t have a name for it. Maybe it was the promise that the next day would be better than the last. Maybe it was simply the illusion that the promise was true.

With his right hand, Alcides tapped out a brief message on his handset.

“I was only a brevet lieutenant. I wasn’t ready.”

“C’mon buddy, let’s get you home. I got a bottle of good stuff, from before the war. We can have a few drinks and relive some of the good times. Hey, Sergey, do you mind popping in and grabbing us a little something to smoke while we wait?”

The party has ended. For those inside, stuck in their capsule born dreams, perhaps it never ends. Perhaps the spice really does stretch seconds into eternal dreams, eradicating the waking moments and filling them, instead, with spiritual euphoria and a oneness that obliterates circumstance with its totality. 

Without the expectation of more guests for the morning, the obliging bouncer went inside to procure whatever illicits were to be had. Moving swiftly with a well-choreographed grace, Alcides Mayorga touched a secret button in the center of the palm of his mechanical hand. The tips of his middle and ring fingers retreated to reveal two metal prongs. Without hesitation he thrusts the two prods directly into Lee’s chest, discharging six thousand kilovolts into his comrade. The shudder is rapid and one-shot-effective. Brevet Lieutenant David Lee’s weight doubles with unconsciousness. A van prowls from around the corner, pulls up quickly with the side door open, and takes its two occupants well from the sight of Club Patroklos’ doors by the time Sergey Hadjiev returns with a joint in hand.

“It was good hardware,” Jayne says, “Military grade, top notch stuff. The baseport itself will be worth a fortune.”

“I’m glad,” Alcides responds, meaning he expects to be paid very handsomely for his work.

“Real good condition too. You could tell it was well taken care of. The donor too. Quite a catch.”

He lets the double entendre break on the shores of his indifference, like an important title or a story about someone else’s dreams.

“Probably will fetch a lot on the market.”

“That’s good.”

“I suppose you expect to be paid well for it,” Jayne sighs, looking up from the macabre assortment of equipment. That goes without saying, but Jayne likes to say it.

“It only seems fair.”

“It only seems fair,” Jayne repeats. Removing the clean suit, a hand drops into deep pockets and pulls out a wad of cash. It is thrown in Alcides’ general direction. His right arm doesn’t extend far enough to make the catch, but Jayne probably supposed that too.

“I can fix that,” Jayne says as Alcides bends back up with the money.

“How much?”

“Ninety thousand plus parts.”

“Ninety!—What the fuck, Jayne? There’s only three hundred thousand here. I brought you a port and two limbs. I expected at least twice as much,” Anger, if nothing else, still has a vibrant home in the heart of Alcides Mayorga.

“I don’t have that kind of paper monopoly. No one does unless they’re a big time spice dealer. You know that.”

“I know that you owe me,” he shouts and brings his heavy hand crashing loud upon the operating table.

“Okay, okay, look, Al. Let me throw in the fix for free. I got a spare servo and can do the rewiring. That is one fifty easy. The rest I can give you in merchandise.”

“Merchandise? What am I supposed to do, tote these guys around at every chop shop in Low City till I get a fair price?”

“Fair price? C’mon, you’re getting a fair price here, Al, let me throw in two ounces of mélange. Four grams in pills, the rest powdered. You can push it at the clubs and get another three, four hundred easy.”

It made economic sense. It was dangerous as hell, he surely couldn’t head to Yuba City any time soon and he wasn’t going to mess with that stuff close to home. Still, out in Auburn, there were a few clubs. Some spice, a rep as a good dealer, no bullshit, a fellow member of the disadvantaged “enhanced” with a friendly ear… could work. He also had to admit the unspoken message here. Jayne was granting him a kind of protection and in return demanded a certain kind of flexibility.

“Fine, and a battery charge too.” he deadpans. 

“And a battery charge too,” Jayne drops a shoulder bag. He checks the stuff, weighs it in his hand. Two ounces alright. He turns to go.

“You know… we didn’t have the sedatives ready when he came to. He called out for you. Called you by name. Said you were buddies.”

“Did he?”

“Yeah. Said you were friends.”

Alcides thought about this for a moment.

“I said everything to him that I needed to. What time should I come back?”

“Tonight,” Jayne says without looking up from the appendages he’s cleaning. Alcides squints at him as he thinks it over. Jayne seems awfully eager to give him something for free.

“Tomorrow,” he counters.

“Sunday, then.”

As he walks out the door, Alcides Mayorga thinks that he’s not at all sure what tomorrow will bring. And while three hundred thousand can’t buy you much these days, it’s gonna buy him a hell of a night in the sky lounges of Arden-Arcade.

Horror. Mankind has been afraid of the unknown, danger and monsters of our own creation since our distant forefathers wandered dark forests at night. A well crafted horror story plays onto any number of fears, and they can range from a few short words ""The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door...""
(Brown, 1948) to multiple book sagas that stand the test of time.



In this workshop, I want to see what you can do to craft a modern horror story, specifically a ghost story. There's no limit to length, but for an optional challenge, stick within 500 words.

“No, what it means is that you have very little time left. Possibly less than a month.”

Sky was thin there, full of giggles, and each flight brought the novel discovery of the tops of things, an incredible new frontier, possibilities of a world seen from above, not just the craned neck and pants tugging drudgery of the carpet below. Sweetness seemed to infuse the thrill of life then. Instant vintage captured impeccably through the filter of #recollection. 

All of it might never have happened, of course. The memories of small children are almost always fabrications of some sort, abridged interpretations that smooth over over the rough patches of incomprehensible reality that surrounds them, filling its plot holes instead with simple fantasies that achieve remarkable verisimilitude. Worlds of heroes and monsters. Big people astride the vastness of life as if they could move its very foundations. Infinite choice. The giddy terror of your world inverted. The belief that there will always be hands to ground you again.

It came on a sunny Saturday. Weather never cooperates. It rains on weddings, blows rough at the beach, hums vibrantly with saffron hues at a funeral, is cold on the first day of spring. Death comes smiling on a holiday, revels with innocent gaiety, takes his due, harvests the kingly grains of last season to leave room for the next year's seedlings. Dresses sharply. Whistles popular tunes. Nods and blows kisses and keeps that promise to call you again sometime later.  It's June and the weather is pleasant and it gives you a little reminder of the what comes after.

Somber and staid were the tones of the packaging. Completely incongruous with an all you can drink mimosa afternoon. It stood on her kitchen table for a good week and a half, drawing gloom around itself so tight that it had wrapped the city in a tree shattering electric forked downpour before she could open it. It was like that. A portent of something, a symbol so full of meaning that it began to twist reality in its own right like some animate thing, willful if not autonomous, domineering. An echo from the world after, though it was really a thing from the before.

AfterWord is ornate in its simplicity. Smooth slate casing, elegant white script, sanserif, casual: initials to initials, a date of recording. It's just a thumb drive too. Digital preservation of our analog lives. Flash memory modern and immortal, replicable nearly infinite times across infinite devices, starkly superior to three days of formaldehyde vanity before family roses seal the casket., near permanence, defiant contrast to the messy entropy that grinds memory into dust.

When the storm's recrimination subsided and the power came back it was sunny and clear eyed on a Thursday afternoon. She stuck it in the computer quickly, before thoughts of study or sitcoms or house cleaning could take hold. It did not load in iTunes. After an hour of trying to figure out what a codec was it just turned on and there he was.

By the light of day he looked thin. His room at hospice was small but brightly lit, open, as if he'd already let everything else go. Except for a ficus plant attended to by the staff, the only fixture was a golf magazine. Something he'd picked up on the way, no doubt, but never opened. Like so many things he'd promised before, it was there as a reminder of what he always intended to do but never found time for.

“Hi, Stephanie,” he began, coughed, and paused while he cleared his throat for several seconds. “It sounds worse than it is,” he assured, “They keep me good and doped up. Food's ok. I--” he broke, choked again, and it was as if he was going to cut the session off right there, as he had done so many times before, but he caught himself, barely, and continued.

“You know kiddo, there are just times when... you have some things to say and... you're not sure you're going to say them. And these things, you know, things, they, uh, get in the way of... other things, and you tell yourself that next time will be different. That you're gonna be different, that things... ah, crap. If I was good at saying this, I would have, you know--”

And she doesn't. Memory is pastiche. At a certain age, it's nothing more than the narrative that one writes for their own benefit. Victories, betrayals, justification. It is not for record. Record is anathema to memory. Record is embarrassing photos, plays that aren't attended, birthdays forgotten. Memory, on the other hand, is the honey like recollection which can preserve a day forever but never does service to a lifetime. 

He stood large in her life when she was known only as 'knee-high' and 'tyke.' How many imaginary schoolyard battles had he won for her in proxy? So many that she started to fight his for him, against the unbearable harpy that fed and clothed her, put her through school, threw her out of the house and then cried herself silly at her graduation. How bitter the rejoinders then, how she lorded his absence over her adolescent tenant, Cinderella defaming the Prince in a losing battle for the ugly stepdaughter.

Memory is a battle for definition. Politicians and generals wage war over who will be forgotten in the history texts while common folk fight ever more bitterly for the attention of those who will listen, long after the war has been lost. Like a baleful charioteer he rode again through those fateful fields littered with the dismembered fragments of what once was, trying to explain away his retreat, the abortive sallies forward, the circuitous path of his campaign, without ever acknowledging his fear of the Red Sea. 

There were many words but not the ones that mattered, not then and not now. The word 'princess' could never be uttered enough to obscure that, no amount of ice cream sandwiches could assuage its lack. Not when she was sixteen and angry. Not when she was twenty two and rich on dreams and broke in everything else. Not when she was twenty eight and on her own and he found the horizon of his day was shorter than he had hoped. Not after his day had set.

“Remember,” he said, choking on the words again. Not because they were hard to say but because they were hard to have in the face of death when they hadn't been worn in life, a new habit without enough time to begin, a game of golf without handicap, lost before the first tee.

He looked into the camera gaunt faced, his cheeks spread thin over his salt and pepper flecked jaws. His eyes were waxy. Emotive on cue, as if that was greater than the sentiment behind them. The afternoon sun was as strong there and then as it was here and now, the great shadows cast where the tee shirt draped off his bones was bleeding over on to the linoleum. His clothes were giant still, but in her eyes now she saw something smaller beneath.

She turned off the video then, capturing the fragment of him in that amber light. Prostrate before the post mortem audience like a penitent in prayer. In memory she'd always have pieces of him, like this, and that would always be part of her story.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1kfa29,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1kfa29/pi_big_girls_dont_cry_august_contest/,

**The Last Time We Remember.**

It took a lot to get Jamie Escar going; took a lot to pull her out of the customary nonchalance she’d perfected over a decade in the industry, took a lot to get her to raise her voice in anger or disgust. Some even said it took a whole lot more for all of this to happen in her agent’s, and lifelong friend, Delaney Fox’s presence. 

And yet at that very moment, Jamie’s hands itched to wrap around the cutlery lying at her fingertips, and toss it, pointy-end first, into Del’s exposed and very vulnerable neck.

‘I know what you’re thinking,’ Del said, his forehead shining with sweat and glasses shining with reflected light from the overhead chandelier. 

Jamie dug her nails into the surface of the table standing between them. 

‘I really think you don’t.’

Del ignored the warning tone. 

‘It’s been three months and she hasn’t given up.’

‘Good for her,’ Jamie worked to keep her voice from shaking, ‘bloody good for her. I still don’t care.’

Del sighed and scanned the room, pressing his lips together, pressing his hands together. Jamie failed to understand what inspiration he expected to get from her living room. He’d spent many days complaining how spartan it was, and how, now that she had more money than she knew what to do with, she should get a decorator with better sense of light and space. 

To be completely and utterly honest, Jamie liked how her obscenely expensive home looked, even if the look had been specifically engineered to get Del to disapprove. 

‘It’ll take less than ten minutes,’ Del was back for another round, spreading his hands, raising his eyebrows, ‘what do you have to lose?’

‘You once told me a minute of my time was worth a hundred dollars.’

‘That was rhetorical—’

‘And she wants ten minutes. Does she have a thousand dollars?’

‘Jamie—’

*‘Does she have a thousand dollars?’* 

Jamie’s voice cracked at the self-imposed decibel limit. She wouldn’t let herself get any louder. She wouldn’t. 

Del chewed over her question, sighing, ‘no.’

‘Well then.’ 

But Del still had some ammunition left. ‘Family shouldn’t have to pay to see you.’

‘She isn’t my family.’

‘Tasha considered—’

‘I don’t care what Tasha considered!’ Jamie leaped to her feet, toppling her chair backwards on to the marble floor. ‘Tasha wasn’t my fucking life-coach and besides,’ she paused to catch her breath, unusually aware of the blood thundering in her ears, ‘if you haven’t noticed, Tasha is dead!’

This ringing truth forced the room into silence. 

Jamie licked her lips, bottling away the rising shame in her chest for another day. She’d vowed never to shout at Del, back when he’d orchestrated her big break, promised herself to treat him as a father figure, deserving of her respect and admiration more than anyone else in the world, and now the realization of failing a decade-old promise made Jamie’s heart ache with regret. 

She turned away and picked up the chair, unseeing of the large, unsightly scratch on one of the legs. 

‘I’m sorry.’

Del’s words floated over her shoulder. 

‘I shouldn’t have mentioned Ta—your cousin. You’re still grieving and—’

‘I’m not.’ 

Jamie faced him, weary of the confrontation and the conversation. Barely ten o’ clock in the morning and she felt as though she’d been awake for a thousand years, watching empires rise in glory and crumble with bloodshed, their secrets forever lost to the tides of time. 

The lines on Del’s forehead stood out under the harsh white light, contrasting with London’s grey skies in the bay windows beyond. They were open, but the city sat under the clouds, a still leaf desperate for a breath of fresh air to take it on its adventures. 

‘You loved her Jamie,’ Del said, ‘I know you don’t like to admit it, but you did. She was your family.’

‘I loved her *because* she was my family.’ Jamie didn’t know how important the feelings were before she gave definition to them, ‘she used to say... back when—she used to say that we’d never be friends if we weren’t related. She was right.’

Del stood up and Jamie fought the urge to collapse into his arms. Ten years he’d navigated her through the pitfalls and sinkholes of Hollywood, ten years he’d held her steady against the avalanche of riches and fame, but now he asked for something she couldn’t possibly give. 

Some wounds, like empires, deserved to be buried under greater, better successes. 

‘Ten minutes,’ Del said, ‘that’s all. And we will never have to speak of Tasha again.’

And some wounds, like empires, deserved to be dug from their graves, and shaken free into the cold light of day.

We have an issue.  Shortly after we brought in our suspect for DNA swabbing he confessed in a 78-page written document to not just the bank robbery on 7th Street and Carlisle, but to the case with the two dead pharm techs from last week that went cold. He has declined to have a lawyer present.  I spent the night transcribing most of it, but it was hard to decipher some parts due to water damage and chicken-scratch writing.  At this moment we’ve got him in a holding cell here for the night.  He keeps asking for more paper.  The fucker used up the entire rest of the memo pad I gave him.  Both sides.

Anyways, here are the relevant points.  He bounces around a lot, but I figured it’s best we question him tomorrow to really straighten all this out.  He’s got tons to give and he’s not exactly holding out on us either.  We may finally solve a few other unsolved cases because of this bastard! - Fannigan

MAURICE PETAKY

28 years old

Confession given on November 23, 2012

Begin Transcript

If I could just tell you I did it all and have you understand what all that meant, it would save us both a lot of time.  I’ve kept a journal though for most of my life, and now I wish I had confessed in it instead of this shitty, yellow memo pad.  Rolling the pages up, warping them-- instead of turning them like you’re reading something worth remembering.  It’s bullshit.  I wish I were writing in one of my notebooks. It would have completed me.  The moment when you finish a notebook is the most satisfying thing I have felt in all my 28 years. I am not afraid of writing this confession.  Writing in general has been possibly the only thing I was ever consistent with. I’m going to miss days at the library in the air conditioning just writing away.  Random thoughts.  Funny puns and word play. Even a business idea or two, but nothing serious. In fact,  As a transient, friends come and go more often than you’d like a lot of the time, so finding a way to be alone for me was my first priority, and it took a while to finally understand that.  Since all my notebooks are long gone too, I guess this memo pad will be the last thing I ever write, so fuck it, I’m going to fill it up.

Wendy Petaky was my only living relative as far as I know, and I did not even know she existed until three months before she passed away.  That’s not to say she never tried to reach out; I was simply all over the place, both mentally and geographically.  Before things had gotten really bad and my phone was cut off about nine months ago, I was doing work with a bunch of temp agencies.  You can verify that in Dallas, Texas as well as Waco, Texas if you like.  Anyways, she finally found me after one of the agencies put together some internet package thing that they said was going to help me find more jobs.  The guy gave me a good discount since I did a lot of good work for people and eventually Wendy must have found me and so she messaged me on there.  I feel like an idiot now waiting as long as I did to log in and read my messages.  I could have spent more time with her.  Wendy had had a stroke, so talking was extremely difficult.  Instead, we decided to keep writing each other.  Wendy Petaky was my biological mother.  I met her three times in real life, but it was absolutely mortifying and I don’t think I hid it well. 

Wendy had explained to me she couldn’t afford her diabetes medicine.  I’m glad I didn’t inherit that, but still I wasn’t going to do nothing while she suffered.  That’s when the pharmacists got involved.  I had her pill bottle from the first time she and I met.  She had it with her and it was empty, so I asked her why she didn’t just call it in and renew her prescription.  You get the point.  Anyways, I call it in and when I show up to pick them up they wouldn’t give it to me because I didn’t have any ID.  I told them everything, the whole situation, but they wouldn’t listen.  They just kept apologizing and refusing which made me want to slap the shit out of them.  I just kept getting angrier and angrier as I got more and more helpless.  It was an awful feeling.  I leapt over the counter and knocked the 100-pound pharmacist out cold before crushing the slightly heavier one’s throat as I strangled her.  After the first few seconds, I realized it’s mostly thumbs.  I took the medicine and ran.  If I’d’ve been arrested before, you probably would have found fingerprints or something.  I guess it doesn’t really matter now.

Once I left I felt terrible about what I did.  I couldn’t tell Wendy, so I just showed up with her medicine and she smiled and nodded as best she could.  Her mouth was so shaky the whole time, but it wasn’t sadness.  She was trying to smile and this was the best she could do.  That’s perfect mom!  I wish I had gotten a picture, but I was too shocked from what I had just done.   Well that, and neither of us had a camera.

I robbed the bank for essentially the same reason, except I didn’t have a prescription. My thought was I could get the money, say ten grand? Whatever was right there behind the desk.  Then we could go to Mexico or someplace where medicine doesn’t have gatekeepers.  It’d be day’s drive, but once we get over the boarder we’d be safe.  I had always been told getting into Mexico was never an issue.  Getting back into the US was an entirely different story.  But at this point, it didn’t matter.  I was a fugitive and wasn’t trying to go back to a place where I was surely being hunted.

Of course, none of that ended up happening, since I’m here and all.  She was dead when I arrived back at her dirty, cramped apartment on Baker Street.  It looked peaceful enough.  Not like the pharmacist who I strangled.  I don’t know if I’ll ever stop seeing that look on her face when I close my eyes.  That look of complete terror as she was having the life choked out of her.  I guess it stuck with me because after living on the streets, people not only stop talking to you, they stop even looking at you.  That was the most eye contact I’d had had with a person in months.  Anyways, that’s when I called the police from her home phone and was taken in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Soldier**
	He crested the hill and took in what lay at the top of it. The forest was thicker here, and seemed to have suffered some kind of calamity, perhaps a storm. Though many trees still stood and some light reached the forest floor, fallen logs were everywhere. Someone could easily trip.
	The soldier was about to continue on his way when he saw something off to his right. It was a speck of blue lying on the forest floor. Never one to miss a scouting opportunity, he took the rifle from his back and hefted it, prepared to fire if necessary. He derived this caution from years of experience.
	The forest floor was muddy, but his black boots did not sink into it. They remained beautifully polished, an equivalent state to the clothing he wore. Its fabric, a shade between green and brown, looked freshly cleaned. But in his careful steps over the logs it was not stiff; it moved with him. His helmet was plain and unassuming, the same colour as his clothes; his chest bore only one medal, gold with a red ribbon. He looked the essence of the word soldier, and he knew it.
	To his surprise, he was not confronted with some new danger. It was, if anything worse. He saw, lying next to an old and rotting log, a little blonde-haired girl. She looked very pale, perhaps even close to death, and wore no shoes.
	The soldier slung his rifle, crouched down, and checked her pulse, hoping against hope. To his surprise and relief, it was present and it was very strong. He bent down and put his hear to her face, confident he would hear breathing.
	“Hello, Mr. Soldier.”
	He jumped back in shock and found himself reaching for his gun. He quashed his fighting reflexes and replied, “Hello, girl. Do you feel alright?”
	She sat up, not seeming to notice the forest around her. She moved around a bit, testing her limbs, and brushed bits of dirt from her turquoise sundress. “I feel…um…I think I’m okay. How are you?”
	He was pleasantly relieved to have some other intelligent being for conversation, even if only a young girl. “Never better,” he replied, and it was the truth. “Do you know how you came here, by any chance?”
	She bit her lip, clearly taxing her youthful brain. “I…hmm…I should remember, but I don’t. I—I can’t remember anything. Wait!” Her face lit up and she started reciting facts as if by rote. “My name is Irene, I’m eight years old, and I live in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and…where am I now?” Only now did she become aware of her surroundings.
	“You are…” The soldier hesitated. Even he wasn’t sure of the true nature of the place he inhabited, and if Irene was what he thought she was, what he did know would probably frighten her. “Ah…why don’t you just come with me for now, Irene? I’ll tell you where you are later, when we’re somewhere safer. This isn’t really a good place.”
	“Okay,” Irene said innocently. “Where are my mommy and daddy? I remember…that’s right, I was in the car with them, we were going into the parking lot of my church, and now…I’m here.”
	“I’ll take you to them,” he lied. Immediately he regretted that decision. He had only the foggiest idea of how they might accomplish this, and he was not sure he was capable of being a caretaker. It was not his role.
	“Am I in heaven?” Irene asked him after a pause.
	“Heaven? No,” the soldier laughed. “You’re not in heaven, Irene.”
	She stood up, skipped to his side and they began walking. The soldier thought to himself, perhaps just the opposite.

	They walked through the forest in silence for a short while, when they came to a small hut. The soldier opened the door and Irene giggled.
	“You live here?” she said, unconvinced.
	“Yes, for now,” said the soldier. “Something wrong with that?”
	“But it’s so small!” She was right. The hut consisted a fire pit for cooking, a bed, a table and chair, a few boxes, and very little else. The soldier ignored her comments, walked to the wall of the hut and opened one of the boxes.
	“Are you hungry, Irene?” he asked. “I always keep a little food ready, in case I have someone over.”
	“Hmm, now that you say it, I guess I am pretty hungry. Do you have any pop?”
	“Sorry, girl. Only the basics.” He set before her a small brown cube, about the size of an ice cube, and a glass of water. Irene made a face.
	“Eww. What is that?”
	“Survival rations. Come on, they’re good for you!” She still pouted and looked doubtful. “I admit, they don’t taste very good, but they have all the nutrition you need.” Irene folded her arms and looked at him.
	“Don’t you have anything else?” she whined.
	“No. I only keep the basics.”
	“You live on this stuff?”
	“I don’t need to eat.”
	Irene’s eyes opened wide. “How do you stay alive, then?”
	“I told you, I don’t need any food. I never get hungry. I think the last time I ate was…about a month ago, just because I’d forgotten the taste of those things.”
	She looked mortified. “What are you!?”
	The soldier sighed. “I think I’ll get this over with. You’re actually in—”
	He was abruptly interrupted by a bear smashing through the left wall of the hut and letting out a mighty roar. Irene let out a high shriek that was just as mighty.
	“Irene, get behind me!” The soldier readied his rifle and aimed it at the bear. “Go on, get out of here!” he shouted to the bear. The bear did not get the message and roared again. It was pawing the ground, seemingly preparing to charge. The soldier fired a warning shot, causing the bear to growl and slam its paw into a box. The box flew across the hut and smashed to pieces on the side wall. The soldier fired another shot, but the bear still did not back down.
	A nagging thought came into the soldier’s mind: That bear looks oddly familiar. But if it is, that means—
	His suspicions were confirmed when a second bear smashed through the wall behind him, and both bears roared as one. Irene was panicking, shifting from the soldier’s front to his rear, unsure of which bear from which she should protect herself. He grabbed her and held her fast at his side. “Stand your ground,” he whispered. “Be brave.” But even he found it hard to believe that he could defend them against two bears.
	The second bear seemed more inclined to attack than the first. In the soldier’s frantic switching between his sights of the two bears, he saw it slowly advancing on them, growling viciously. That was too much for him. He finally aimed carefully and fired his rifle.
	The shot hit the second bear and carried its right ear. It grunted, not appearing to notice the pain, and charged. The soldier was firing shot after shot into the bear’s cranium, but it would not die. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the first bear begin to advance for the kill. When both bears were but a foot away he braced himself for the pain—but a strong force pushed him out of the way, to the door of the hut, and he was shocked at what he saw.
	Irene stood, facing away from him, her small arms spread between the two bears. Their noses pressed dangerously against her palms. “Stop,” she said firmly.
	The soldier could scarcely believe what he saw next. Irene turned to the first bear, a look of fury on her face, and said “Enough with you! You threaten my companion and you destroy his property. Begone!” The first bear disappeared into thin air.
	The second bear, its face coated with blood from its missing ear, moaned nervously and pawed at its face. Irene turned to it and scolded it with “Now get out of here! Shoo! Go find your friend!” The bear galloped out of the hut at full speed, and Irene watched it carefully until it could no longer be seen in the thick of the forest.
	Then she collapsed to the ground.
	The soldier rushed to her, but she was conscious and looked perfectly normal. “Ooh,” she moaned. “What happened? Everything got black all of a sudden.” She looked around. “The bears are gone!”
	“Yes, Irene. You scared them away.”
	“I did? But then why don’t I remember it?”
	“I don’t know, but you should have seen it! It was unbelievable! You just told them to leave, and they did. You even made one disappear into thin air!” He feared what she would think of her sudden increase in vocabulary.
	“Can I make you disappear, too?”
	The soldier chuckled. “No. I need to get you to your parents, and there are things more dangerous than those bears around here.”
	Irene did not seem concerned about that ominous statement. Instead, she looked at the rubble of the two smashed walls and said, “Your house is even worse than before.”
	“Yeah, I guess,” he admitted.
	“You know how you shot off that bear’s ear?”
	“Ah…yes,” the soldier responded, unsure of what she meant.
	“You know what you call a bear without an ear?”
	“What?”
	“B.”
	The soldier burst out laughing.
	“Can I have one of those weird cube thingies now?”

	Irene scarfed down four of the nutrition cubes before looking up. “So…what do you think those bears were, Mr. Soldier?”
	“I know exactly what they were,” said the soldier. He was rebuilding (or more accurately, re-stacking) the bricks for one of the walls, and was about half finished one of them. “I’ve met them before.”
	“You have?”
	“I fought them off by causing a rockslide onto them. It’s amazing they survived. Nasty fellows, those two. Anyways, have you ever read the book of 1 Kings? In the Bible?”
	Irene thought carefully. “Yeah…we studied parts of it in Sunday school...”
	“There’s a story where a group of “young fellows”—teenagers, probably—were threatening the prophet Elisha. They were making fun of his bald head, and telling him to go join the bald lepers. So Elisha, fearing for his life, called down a curse on the young men.”
	“What’s a leper?” asked Irene.
	“Someone who has the disease leprosy.”
	“Oh.”
	“When he finished saying the curse, the Bible says that two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths. You just had the honour of meeting those bears.”
	“Wow. But how did they get out of the Bible and come here?” Irene asked with surprising insight for her age.
	The soldier sighed, partly from release and partly from disappointement. “I guess I could never keep this from you forever. Irene, you are farther from your parents than you can imagine.” He walked to the other smashed wall, hauled a stone of a fair size to the table, and sat down across from Irene.
	“What…do you mean?” Irene had stopped chewing a fourth cube to listen. She looked shocked and dismayed, and she had not even heard the full truth.
	The soldier took a deep breath and revealed, “You have fallen into the kingdom of Medulla. It is a land of things forgotten—anything that slips from the memory of people in your world comes here. You forget to clean the fridge, you’ll find a clean fridge in Medulla. You forget about your long-lost cousins, they’ll be here, sort of.”
	“I forgot where I left my teddy.”
	“You’ll find that information here, and maybe your teddy, if you know where to look.”
	“But how can I be here? I’m not forgotten.”
	“Don’t ask me how it happened. Most of the time, when someone forgets that an ordinary person exists, it’s just an echo of them that comes here. It’s nowhere near as distinct and personal as you, and it’s never here for very long. But I can tell you are more than a memory—you hunger for food, for one. Your full essence, your soul, has come into Medulla.”
	“But, does that mean I can’t go home?”
	“I know of no passage from here into the real world. You are quite possibly trapped here for all eternity.”
	Irene burst into tears. The soldier waited patiently for her to recover, and when she was able to look up, he said:
	“However, I did say that Medulla is a kingdom. And we do have a king here: the Tree of Life. People who have seen him say he is wise, just, and knowledgeable. They say he’s like a grandfather to all of us in this land. He just might be able to tell us a way for you to go home.”
	“Why didn’t you say so?” said Irene, suddenly brimming with excitement. “Let’s go find this Tree King, or whatever he is!”
	“That’s the problem. He tells no one where he resides. And they say that those who have found him never want to reveal the location; they get uncomfortable and change the subject. I do know of one being who has seen the Tree of Life, but he’s a long journey away from here, and if we find him I cannot guarantee he will tell us the way to the Tree.”
	Irene thought this over. “So, there’s at least a chance I can see my parents again?”
	“Yes.”
	“Then let’s go!” She jumped from the chair and tried to decide between the door and the unfixed hole in the wall.
	“Irene, wait!” said the soldier. “Before we go, there is one more thing you need to know.”
	“What is it?” She turned toward him.
	“I’d just like you to think about something for a minute. What’s something people forget all the time?”
	“My mom always forgets where she left her keys, and she makes a mess looking for them, and—”
	“Kind of right, but no. The thing people always forget is nightmares. Can you remember any of the bad dreams you’ve had?”
	Irene thought. “I guess I can kind of remember one of them.”
	“That’s my point. Everyone seems to have one bad dream they remember. But they forget all the others forever. And what happens to forgotten things?”
	“They go here?”
	“Exactly.” The soldier shuddered. “Those bears were an unlucky blip. People can usually remember them, but every once in a while nobody in your world remembers that unimportant little story in 1 Kings, so they show up here. But I am not joking when I say this: if you want to make this journey, no, these journeys, you will encounter nightmares all the time. In my experiences with them they not only fill you with fear on sight, they attack viciously and unpredictably, and are extremely difficult to kill.
	“We are safe in this forest. But if you want to get home, you will face unimaginable dangers, and I am not sure I will always be able to protect you. Do you understand?”
	Irene looked in a daze as she considered everything she had just heard. But she shook it off, tried and failed to look brave, and said “Yes.”
	“Great. I think I have a backpack around here somewhere…” He found one in one of the boxes that lined the walls of the hut. “Here.” He opened another box and dumped all of its contents into the pack. “That should last us until we can get supplies. I have enough nutrition cubes and water in there to last you about a week.”
	“What’s your name?”
	The soldier was caught off guard. “I…I don’t have a name. I suppose nobody ever named me and I didn’t need one.”
	“But you have to have a name! Everybody has to have a name! What would I be if I weren’t Irene?”
	“I don’t know.”
	“Hmm…” Irene looked up thoughtfully. “Can I just keep calling you Mr. Soldier? I like that name. You are a soldier, right?”
	“Yes, I am,” he chuckled. “I don’t mind Mr. Soldier. You just go ahead.”
	The soldier was alarmed at how attached he was becoming to this girl, and on duty nonetheless. But then again, he had never been off duty.

	They set out through the forest at a brisk and hopeful pace at first. This soon descended to a moderate, trudging pace, and the soldier was becoming impatient. But he forced back his urges to hurry the girl along and stayed quiet. What authority did he have over her but age? Did age even count, as he was ageless? Civilians were to be treated with as much respect as fellow soldiers, he knew that. 
	But he had never had any fellow soldiers, so how could he know how to treat them?
	“Mr. Soldier?” said Irene. She sounded a bit bored. “How come you said there aren’t any nightmares in this forest?”
	“Because I know it. I actually know a ton of stuff that I have no way of finding out, like how Medulla is a land of forgotten things. But to answer your question a bit more precisely: there was this guy who had a ton of ideas; perhaps he was an author. He got into some kind of—accident—and he lost all his memories. So everything he knew came here. He was so focused on his work that he’d never had any nightmares.”
	“I don’t know what I’d do if I lost all my memories.”
	“I think I know all of that just because I was one of his ideas.”
	Irene stopped. The soldier did not realize she had for a few seconds and walked some distance ahead of her. She was looking at him strangely. “You’re not real?”
	“Well, no, not real as in part of your world. But in this world I’m as real as can be.”
	She walked to him and grabbed one of his legs. Then she felt the cloth of his trousers between his fingers. “You seem pretty real. But you don’t really exist.”
	“Of course I exist! It’s just that…ah…” Irene resumed walking, seeming satisfied that she had outsmarted her companion. The soldier followed.
	“If I don’t exist, do you?” he finally pondered.
	“I’m real. I guess I’m just somewhere all the stuff that doesn’t exist goes.”
	“What’s the difference between us, then?”
	“I came from the real world.”
	“This is my real world. Let’s just stop; my head’s starting to hurt and we could go on with this forever.”
	“But I’m not done yet!” Irene seemed eager to continue their philosophical duelling, but they were interrupted when an enormous section of the forest, only about five metres to their left, ceased to exist. It was simply there one moment and not the next. Small amounts of dirt rained down from the sides of the newly created gorge, into what looked like a deep chasm.
	“Oh dear,” was all the soldier could say.
	“What is it?”
	“This is either some odd kind of nightmare I’ve never seen before, or—”
	“What could be worse than a nightmare?” Irene interrupted.
	Most of the forest behind them, except for a few isolated islands, disappeared.
	“Recall! Run, Irene!” The two adventurers set out racing at top speed across what remained of the forest. Small portions of it were disappearing every second. Irene tripped over a log and almost fell into a hole that opened up right where she was falling, but the soldier grabbed her by the collar and half-threw her back to safe ground. The edge of the forest was in sight, when a large section in front of them disappeared. Unperturbed, they ran around it, diving to the ground as the last of the wood returned to memory.
	Irene looked up and looked back at the forest, which now resembled an enormous sinkhole. “I guess the guy remembered something,” said Irene.
	“Exactly,” said the soldier. “Most of the landscapes in Medulla are composed of people with amnesia who’ve forgotten everything they’ve ever seen. Once in a while somebody gets a lot of memories back at once, and then…that happens.”
	Irene looked down into the chasm. The sides were about three metres high, and there was nothing but blackness beneath the dirt after that. “Cool.”
	“Spoken like a true soldier,” said the same. “Come on. We’ve still got a long way to go.” They resumed walking. An enormous golden desert loomed before them.
	“So that forest…it came out of here and into that guy’s mind?”
	“Yes.”
	“I guess that means it exists then?”
	“Correct.”
	“Do things like that happen a lot in this place?”
	“All the time.
	“Could that happen to me?”
	“I wish I knew the answer, Irene.” The soldier looked tired. “But for now, and maybe forever, this debate is closed.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the story course as I intended it (spoiler alert?): the soldier and Irene eventually come to a small ramshackle town of memories, where they find an old man who agrees to tell them where the tree of life is—on the condition that they kill him immediately. Right after he tells them the way, invisible hands start torturing him. The soldier blows his brains out.

The soldier and Irene make their way to the Tree of Life (note: this is the tree in the Garden of Eden, which mankind always forgets), who explains that Irene was in a car accident on the highway and has been in a coma so long that her parents have begun to forget her. Being anchored in reality, she has godlike powers over forgotten things. The soldier is an almagation of an author's idea of a perfect, obedient, loyal, and skilled soldier. The Tree of Life gives Irene a door that leads either to consciousness or to the next world, but it cannot tell which. After goodbyes and her passage through the door, the Tree tells the soldier that only one person may know its location at a time, on threat of great pain, and that he is the new guardian of its location. The soldier salutes and walks off into the desert.",Continuing Story,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,flairCS,,True,t3_1jbq02,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jbq02/cs_soldier/,

“ah gwan love, one more pint.” The slobbering mess at the bar bellowed, waving the empty glass in his hand as if it is the holy grail. 
“Eric love, I think you had enough years ago.” The sweet voice of the barmaid called back.

“A half?” 

“Nope. You're bound to break something again, sure we only just got the jukebox fixed after your last escapade.” 

“I'll break your jukebox.” Eric smiled back, chuckling to himself. The disgusting specimen gyrating his shit-stained jeans in her direction, grunting heavily, his thirsty throat wheezing from the unexpected movement. The barmaids eye's appear glazed over, almost soulless, she'd always had to shut herself off from the putrid perverts and groping hands. “Just go home...” She paused, life pouncing back into her deserting pupils. “Sorry Eric, I forgot.”

“Well love, there's plenty of time to make up for that.” Eric winked back, wiping the sweat from under his torn cap, a faded red of failed dreams. Janis ignores him, half-heartedly pushing an old rag across the bar, an emotional lass she truly did pity the pathetic mess before her. The other punters had stumbled home to there families, the jukebox long since played it's last song, just our Eric left with nowhere to go. “Look Eric, you can stay on one of the seats tonight, I hate the thought of you being out there in the cold.” Erics face became sincere as he began to smile, an uneven jungle of yellowed teeth shone across at the merciful barmaid. “Thanks Janis.”

.

There is a few minuets of silence as Eric began to reflect upon his pointless existence, his nicotine stained fingers stroking a leather patch which dangles over his left eye. Almost as if jealous of the attention, a lone tear reluctantly tumbles down his right cheek. “Oh Kevan.” he said to himself, his hand racing to dry up the past. Janis notices this and stands quietly watching, her eyebrows levitating as she holds her weary heart in despair. Attempting to shrug it off, she shakes her head violently, causing her long black hair to wave. Forcing herself to remember the time that Eric exposed his self proclaimed 'meaty salvation' to her elderly mother during her birthday party in the pub, how furious she was. Eric was barred for a month before worming his way back on to his trusted stool. Janis doesn't want to feel too sorry for the man, as pity is weakness and weakness is prayed upon by the desperate. 

However she did know of Kevan, Kevan was Erics son, a troubled lad who's mother had deserted the family when he was a young teen. “It's only a couple of days off isn't it?” She asks, her watering eyes beginning to melt.

“Aye, 'tis so.” Eric turns away from the sympathetic ears, gazing at the glowing lights of the fruit machine. “He was only a wee lad ya' know. He didn't mean it, I'd come in drunk slagging his mother off and he just snapped.”

“That quick?” Janis questions, leaning over the bar and grasping Erics now shaking hands.

“No, there was a bit of shoving first, then I said something no father should ever say. He hit me, he was right to... Just a shame he didn't account for the hunk of cheap gold on his finger. Then poof. Darkness.”

The barmaid bows her head, a grave expression swamping her haggard face. “It's a sad shame so it is.”
“You ain't herd the best part.” Eric shrugs. “That ring was the last thing his slut of a mother gave him. I always said that bitch wasn't happy with taking my life away so she took me eye as well.” Erics forced smile providing a thin veil to conceal his worry. Janis' pouted lips politely beam back.

.

The two talked for hours and much to Erics delight the drink kept flowing, free of charge. The tinted green lights dotted around the rustic tavern providing a sombre coating. “But it is the day after tomorrow Eric, and you should talk about it.” said Janis, trying to haul the conversation along. 

“Yeah, £10,000 they want, bail money they want, pfft. I swear to god I'd get it him it if I could.” Erics head leaped onto his welcoming palms. “Lord Jeysus above knows its my fault, the boys never been the same since me old eye fell out.”

“I'd help you Eric, I really would, but there's nothing I can do. Kevan stole a lot of money... I'm so sorry.” Janis yawned.

“I know so, but I'd love to pay it. Just so he knows his father still loves him and always will. If I could do this one thing, just this one thing, I'd die a happy man. We all know I'm close to checking out, I might not be here by the time...”

“Don't.” Janis begs, she hated not having control, being helpless, it plucks at the tired bones on her wiry frame. “I'm going to bed now Eric.”

.


Eric nods and waves goodnight, but as soon as Janis turned the handle on the door, *thud!* Janis leaped back around to find Eric scrambling over the bar trying to reach the larger taps, a hairy half moon with a cracked smile peeking out from Erics waistband. “For feck sake Eric! I might be a little soft, but I'm sure as hell ain't stupid... They're off.” She slams the door behind herself feeling betrayed, sulking off toward the friendly call of a real bed. “And pull your feckin' kecks up!”

.

By this point now Eric is blind drunk, so much so he could be issued a Labrador, then train the Labrador to find more drink. He almost levitates towards the pool room, a small square area with long claret sofas stretching wall to wall. However, his one good eye remains on the bandit machine in the corner. The solemn sound of a zipper brakes the silence. Checking over his shoulder Erics trembling hands reach down the front of his dampened jeans. The meaty salvation is due an appearance.  Erics twisted snigger echoes throughout the room. The blue, red and yellow lights of the fruit machine glistening, drawing him in like a careless moth to a light bulb. As Eric staggers towards the glow he trips over a fallen pool cue, allowing the dead weight of his body to collapse against the machines solid frame. Using all of his strength to hoist himself up, Eric faces the bandit. Drip, drip, drip, the flood had begun. With his hands firmly pressed on the bandit, a cloudy, yellow Niagara dives towards the resilient floorboards he stands on. Tears of piss defiantly bouncing back up, coating his cheap market trainers in a golden jacket.

Eric is laughing hysterically at his latest drunken shenanigan, waving uncontrollably as urine marks his territory further. “Shh.” he hisses. A small river began to meander behind the glisten of the menacing fruit machine, rapidly hurtling towards the hidden plug socket it hid behind it. There is a spark.

“Feckin' 'ell. Janis! Shi...”

Too late.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**   Part II – Like she's Mother Theresa.**


Erics eye opens upon a shore of immaculate white, gazing at the infinite plains he began to sob. “You pissed it all away, It's gone. Gone, gone gone.” He felt almost suffocated by the heavy burden of regret. “Poor Kevan, sure he's better off without ya. Is this all there is?” He could not see his body, though he was sure he was moving his arms, Eric continued to cry heavily. “Why the beyjeysus do I have a hangover in heaven, ya'd think they'd cut that sort of thing out.” However Eric was not in heaven, not even close, the shock from the fruit machine had caused him to collapse on the pool room floor. During his slumber Eric had become entangled in an old white table cloth he had pulled down during the night. 

.

Unbeknown to Eric, Janis and her husband Ryan were gazing upon the crying mess on the pool room floor, heckling at him as he continued to weep . “How the feck has he managed that?” Janis laughs.

“Get up ya eejit ya,” Her husband scorned “It's a feckin' table cloth, your not dead... Jeysus if we were so lucky.”

Sure enough Eric felt the cold puddle of piss he'd slept in. “It's a miracle! Think this warrants a free pint?” He asked, pouncing up with his arms clawing to free himself from the table cloth.

“For Gods sake, he's pissed on the floor again” Janis exclaimed, her fingers desperately pegging her up turned nose. “Get out.”

Erics mouth drops in a false shock “But I'm the victim here. I'm the loyal patron who's fallen and slipped due to your cowboy machine leaking.”

“Fruit machines don't leak, gobshite.” Janis was having none of it.

“Miracle fruit machines do. What's that I feel? Hmm I'm no doctor but I think that's the old concussion.” 

“You bastard.” Janis screams, storming off back toward the bar, with Ryan following closely  behind.

“*Have you had an accident or injury in the last five years that wasn't your fault?*... Well as a matter of fact I have.” Eric mocked. “Ay and when I get my claim in maybe I'll let you sleep on the pool room settee ya old tart ya.”


.

Janis and Ryan continued to watch Eric as he danced around the floor, his hands flailing with enthusiasm. “We could just bar him again.” Ryan suggested, his fingers intertwined, almost praying for Janis' blessing.

“We can't do that, sure, his son's the reason we kept this place. Him and his dodgy numbers.” Janis replied.

“Ay but he'll be long gone soon enough and we don't owe his tramp of a dad nothing. Plus if he ever finds out about Kevan and the old tax returns he'd shaft us for it everyday.” Ryan's beady eyes squinted as he spoke, he wanted nothing more to do with that family.

“And if Kevan hadn't have fixed it? Who would be the tramps then Ryan?”

“Ok, so.”

.

An elderly woman wearily pushed the heavy pub door open, using all the force she had whilst quietly moaning to herself. A colorful headscarf tied neatly round her wrinkled face, similar to a prune in sweet wrapping. Mary-Jo, Janis' long suffering mother. An almost crippled pensioner who gave everything to her parish, that lovely old lady you'd help across the street, however dementia desperately dangled upon her every fearing thought. “Fr. O'Leary threw a grand old mass today” she chirped. “Well at least until he bit Mr. Parsons.”

.

Eric was a twisted man, with the desolate years still wrapped tightly around his bitter bones, he'd often try to trick Mary-Jo for his own enjoyment. Little did our Eric know, he was about to get his biggest brake from the frail old woman. 
“Mass?” Eric cried out, “You should have been here love, there was a miracle this morning.”

The petite frame turned to face Eric, a purple smile with missing teeth, “A miracle?”

“It is so, Mary-Jo, It is so.” Eric smiled. “Miracle water here, I saw heaven itself.”

“Heaven? Here?” Poor old Mary-Jo, twenty years ago she'd have given him his marching orders, but as mortality hurtles towards her, she innocently clung to her faith. “Ah what I wouldn't give to gaze upon the other side.” She sighed.

“I'm sure you wont have to wait too long for that one.” Eric muttered under his breath. “Get us a pint in and I'll show you the water.”

Sure enough Mary-Jo hobbled towards Eric, cradling the cold glass of ale, weighing her down as if a shiny anchor on a rotting fishing boat. Eric pointed towards his 'holy' puddle, holding back his stale smile.
“And this is water of our lord and savior?” Mary-Jo appeared to grow as she smiled up at Eric.

“Sure, It is so.” Eric laughed, barely able to contain his immature excitement. 

“Now you mention it I can smell the holy spirit dancing, a lovely, churchly smell.” Mary-Jo, poor Mary-Jo. “I'll have to inform the priest.”


.

With all the excitement of a child on Christmas morning, little Mary-Jo stumbled as fast as her plastic hip could take her. She failed to account for her brittle bones, she was weak on her feet and began to lose her balance. Mary-Jos arm extends forward, desperately trying to catch her self on the pool table as she swayed. Eric's mouth slowly began to gape as he watched the fragile, yet lovely, Mary-Jo plummet to the floor at warp speed.


.


“Mother!” Janis must have herd the noise and came bundling through the door frame, her eyes wide in horror as she saw the tiny woman flopping on the ground. Frenzied hands scramble to offer help, yet one by one they slowly began to stand back in amazement. In a vivid blur, Mary-Jo appeared to almost leap up, reaching altitudes of around three feet. 

“Jeysus, Mory &amp; Josepht, dis wemans a feckin' aycrobat.” a thick accent called from the back.

“It was almost majestic.” Eric said in awe, tearing his faded cap down towards his venomous heart.

“It's anudder miracle Mr. Lune.” Mary-Jo's voice appeared younger, more strong and vibrant then any tone that had ever left her throat. “Andduer one, 'cos of the miracle water, It's fixed my bones.”

.

Whether it was wishful thinking or a perfect placebo placed within her deep desire, the fall had almost fixed the hobbling little old lady. Janis stood with her hands pressed against her caving jaw, her mind churning slowly, deciding whether to tell her dear old mother that she'd fallen in Erics piss. As she watched her mother dance around she couldn't bring herself to do it, the tooth fairy exists for today. “Yeah mother, a true miracle it is.”

“Fr. O'Leary needs to hear about this” Mary-Jo said, throwing a note Erics way in an ecstatic fit of joy. “Take this now, you deserve a drink Mr. Lune.”
Eric greedily snatched at the small piece of paper, each slimy finger snapping closed like the cold jaws of a preying alligator. Mary-Jo, almost jogging at this point, easily flung the heavy door to her side. There was a deep bellow of laughter as the few early morning drinkers began to heckle a Mary-Jo running past, a large wet patch of Erics urine had hitched a ride onto her plain purple skirt. 



.

A sharp bend was ironed into Janis' top lip, the devils elbow itself. Her drawn eyebrows swooped down her forehead, almost meeting in the middle to resemble a hunters arrow. “Out. Now.” she snarled.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Part III – The Holy Spirits.**


“Feck the lotta ya” Eric bellows as he stumbles off outside, home sweet home, he begins to glide across the concrete jungle. The teens who walk past laugh at him, the mothers scold their naive children, “Stay away from that tramp.” 

Fathers point him out to their dopey sons as an example. “See, that's where the drank gets ya.” 
In all seriousness this is life within its lowest form, behind the drunken blurs and cheesy smell there still stands a human being. Despite this, our Eric is an easy target, a loner who holds a torch to the revolutionaries. A one-eyed, alcoholic, hobo with no true friends beyond the half empty glass beside him.


.


One of the few 'friends' Eric holds dear is the proprietor of a corner shop, a gritty little building where shiny apples die on display, rotting outside for all to see. Imtiaz, or Imi as he likes to be called. This short, middle aged Pakistani man has picked the wrong neighborhood to set up shop, though you'd never notice due to his constant smile and cheery personality. Eric and Imi share a likeness in a sense, a bond formed by constant hate and upturned noses. It is all the rage for the bitter teens on dole, blaming their failure on the common enemy. The country's going to the dogs, while the idle cats lay in the sun. Eric stumbles into the corner shop, his eye lighting up at the vodka behind the counter. The crumbled £10 note Mary-Jo had gifted him ready to be deployed on the battlefield of a false reality. 


.



“Hello Mr. Eric.” Immi calls, his moustache twitching slightly as he tries to ignore the unpleasant smell seeping out of Eric's pours.  “What will you having today?” 

“Just a bottle of the Russian shite, is it even legal here, that kind of stuff?”

“Of course my friend” Imi replies. “Only very best for Mr. Eric. Premium brand back home.”

Eric stares at the foreign label, Eastern Europe? Romania perhaps? “I'll give you a fiver.” He offers. 

“No no no Mr. Eric.” Imi wails. “Five pound! It worth at least six.”

“You're having a laugh you.” Eric calls back.

 “I give you for six.”

“five fifty...”

“Six fifty.”

“Oh you don't even get it lad, you've gone up there.” Eric laughed. “I'll tell you what, I'll give you 'seex fifty'. Eric mocked in a Pakistani accent. “and you give me the vodka and packet of cigarette.”

Imi's eyes squint. “You break hold of my balls Mr. Eric. When you going to sort life out?” 

“Tell you what Imi, if you can find £10,000 worth of change in that there till I'll hop and skip to rehab, how 'bout that.” Eric laughed almost thoughtfully, staring into the distance.

“Ten bloody thousand!” Imi said, his voice bursting with laughter. “He come in my shop and ask for ten bloody thousand, no no Mr. Eric. No ten thousand today.”

Eric smiles as Imi throws the cigarettes and vodka at him before scurrying off in the back, his slicked back hair glistening as he slumps away.


.


Eric's repulsive nature begs him to reach for a second bottle of vodka behind Imis back, like an untrained mutt ready to swoop for a gammon joint, the desperation is too great. That is until Eric notices the shattered window behind the shelf and begins to pause. With his eye firmly cemented on the broken glass, Eric almost feels the calming swoop of humanity. It is wrong that Imi, a decent bloke who provides for his family, has to live like this. Under constant threat of hooligans, drunken slurs from the town 'hard men' and wave after wave of abuse crashing down upon his one sanctuary, his corner shop. Eric leaves abruptly, ready for his next adventure with alcohol, St. Martins park.

.

The swing-set creaks as it slowly rocks, Eric is halfway through his vodka, children run around him teasing. “Ye feckin' chavs ye.” Eric scolds, his hand drawn back in an attempt to scare the children. It doesn't work as even the local kids see behind the vale, they know Eric is nothing more then a harmless old drunk. It was around noon and Eric had been on the park for at least an hour by now, his fickle dreams to save his son dwindling away with every passing second. In all fairness its not like he'd even tried, Eric knew the sum was far too large and was ready to accept it. The hollow of Erics eye threw itself on the ground, his patch swaying in the strong breeze, Kevan is done for. 

.

“Mr. Lune, Mr. Lune.” A friendly voice chirped. A body armour of hideous neon lira hurtled towards our drunken hero from the horizon. It was none other then sweet old Mary-Jo. Was it Mary-Jo? The same little old woman who not hours ago, struggled with walking, let alone jogging. Eric couldn't believe his eye as he watched the secret ninja sprint towards him with pure speed. 
“Mr. Lune! Father O'Leary wants to see you right away.” Mary-Jo continued.

“Fuck for?” Eric replied.

“Language.” She snapped. “He wants to talk to you about the miracle water. The one you've found.”

“Feck sake Mary, go home it was just...”

“There may even be a little biteen for your trouble.” She smiled.

“It was just... our lord and saviour passing through with a blessing from above.” Eric lied, a plastic smile glued upon his grubby face.

“Be careful with Fr. O'Leary now.” Mary-Jo warned. “He's not right in the old head department at the minuet. Sure he bit Mr. Parsons today at mass and last week I think he shat his kecks.”

“He bit Mr. Parsons?” Eric replied. “Like with his teeth?”

Mary-Jo nodded almost embarrassed. “What do you think of my shell suite?” she quickly asks trying to turn the conversation.

“Mary love, you look like a very shitty power ballad.” Eric said, ready to set off and con the priest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Part IV – Of Ministers &amp; Men.**

As Eric approaches the parochial house he is almost stunned to hear what appears to be 'gangster rap', pounding through the damaged walls he can vividly hear Fr. O'Leary almost patriotically screaming along. *'...for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick...'* Eric began to knock loudly on the door, showing little to no remorse for the lie he is about to tell. 

“Father, It's me Eric.” he called. The door creaks slowly as a small man pokes his head round, his eyes hidden beneath a silver mane and glowing whiskers. 

“Ah Eric, son come in, come in. Do you want a spring onion?”

“No. No father, I do not want no spring onion.”

“Of course, course you don't. Have you seen that cloud.” Father O'Leary points towards the grey sky at an unremarkable spot.

“It's all clouds. This is Nethertown.”

.

After luring Eric in with the promise of brandy, Fr. O'Leary wasted no time in getting to business. Eric found himself stationed at a table in a particularly small plain room, adjacent to the priests crooked smile. This particular priest is a petite fellow in his late eighties, who bursts into insane laughter constantly whilst forever tearing at his dog collar. “So the water.” He began, “It is true? I saw Mary-Jo and she looked fantastic, such a lovely bottom on that girl.”

Eric began to cringe at the thought, almost spitting the contents of his mug before remembering its alcohol content. “Aye, Father it is so.” 
“Is there any more of said water? You see Eric I have a problem of a personal nature and I believe the Lord himself has sent the water to fix it.”

“The Lord?” Eric laughs to himself.

“Either his grace or Moby.” The priest smiled, making idiotic faces in a teaspoon. It is not the fact that the priest is making faces at the tea-spoon that unsettles Eric, it is the fact that this particular teaspoon is wooden. 

“Father, let me get this straight.” Eric continued. “You believe this water has been sent by God, or a nineties trance musician?” Father O'Leary's eyes widen as he violently nods his head. Eric pauses to watch him before coming to a conclusion. “You are a very strange little man Father.”


.

An elongated silence ensued for what appeared to be an eternity, only occasionally interrupted by Fr. O'Leary's inane ramblings. The priests head shot forward as he whispers in Erics ear. “Have ya seen the cow, Mr Lune?”

“What cow?” Eric snapped, becoming quickly agitated by the priests growing insanity.

“It lives in the garden with a panther, I think they have it out for me...”

“Reet, I'm going now Father if that is all.” Eric said.

“No please, I want the water Mr. Lune, please I'll pay.” The weak old man clutching at the sleeves of Erics torn trench coat. 

“What de ya even want it for?” Eric questioned, he's ears jolting at the very sound of the word 'pay'.

“It's the old testament Mr. Lune, It wont stand up to deliver the word of God.” The priest gestured towards his crotch. Eric stood confused for a moment before working out the innuendo, his eye lit up as he began howling with laughter. “Ha, so the priest wants to bash the Bishop?”


.

Eric would have left then and there, had it not been for Fr. O'Leary showing him something, something which hung upon a piece of rope around his neck, an ear. “It's Mr. Parsons.” The priest snarled. “Feckin' man is defiantly some kind of android, look how high-tech and realistic this ear is.” Standing in horror, Eric promptly promised to bring the miniature, holy Ian Huntley, a bottle of the miracle water.

.

It was early afternoon when Eric returned to the priests house, nervously clutching a cocktail of urine, cider and regrets. “You're back!” Father O'Leary screeched. Throwing himself at the window, his hand grasping at the yellow bottle. “I can't come out now boy, I fear that the air may have been swapped with a poisonous substance.” He howled. “It may have already has infected you.”

“How do I get the moolah you promised then father?” Eric questioned, his face filling with disappointment.

“Not to worry.” The priest said in excitement. “Here, have my bankcard. The codes 0101. Have the lot Eric, you deserve it.” 

Eric was thrown a small piece of plastic, at first almost disregarding it assuming that it was most probably empty. How wrong Eric was.  On his way down Dunglow road Eric pauses at an ATM, laughing to himself he forces the card in. Though amused by the whole experience, a tinge of desperation clings to his trembling hands. *Enter pin... Check balance... Balance available – £12,943.* With this, Eric fainted.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**   Part V – Pope Eric I.**


How fickle the concept of popularity is, it can consist solely of comers and zeros. Eric seated himself back upon his trusty stool whilst the Fiddlers Elbow was in full swing, throwing him a party to prize away his new found income. Everyone had shown up to 'congratulate' Eric and coincidentally drown their woes over some finance worry. Be it late rent or fraud, an estranged family members costly illness, everyone seemed obligated to inform Eric. 

“Well we've got the brewery coming next week.” Janis creped, managing to slip the ordeal into a completely unrelated topic. “Yup. Could shut us down if the spirit racks even a little empty.”

“Sorry to hear that.” Eric almost mouths, trying not to make eye contact or seem over interested. 

“I swear they'll get you on anything.” Janis continued.

“I bet.” Eric said, as Janis stomped away, unimpressed by the dismissal. Eric watches her sulk back to Ryan, whispering in his ear with a grave expression chiseled into the bones of her skull. They were not to see a penny of the money as Eric was sick of these people. Least not forget it was only this morning when he had been kicked out. Sure, he'd had an accident and caused minor damage, but every penny this tramp came across went straight into Janis' till.


.

“Fookin' 'ell Cockboy! She's a bit old for you innit?” A thuggish voice called from across the pub. Eric clocked upon a small gang of teenagers, loudly arguing in the pool room. Cockboy, their leader was fumbling with a woman sat upon the mahogany rim of a table, Mary-Jo. Where had that little old lady gone? Eric noticed a hitch up her skirt and what appeared to be suspenders peeking out. By this point Mary was ravishing Cockboy, heavily throwing him against the unbroken triangle of balls. Her trembling hand threw a freshly opened bottle of whiskey across the table, it began bleeding out upon the green velvet. Much to the other teens mockery, Mary-Jo started to undo the buttons on her blouse. After hearing the young lads heckle at her, Mary-Jo led her twenty something year old lover into the toilets, away from prying eyes. Eric looked upon with with disgust as they barged past him, almost spilling his drink in his hand down the front of his smelly trench coat.

.


 In the corner Eric notices a friendly face, the only friendly face he can be bothered with, Imi.

“Oright cocker!” Eric waved, dazzled by Imis sickly Hawaiian shirt.

“Oh. Mr. Eric, I take night off.” An intoxicated Imi replies, slurring his pigeon English as he tried to speak.

“I thought you people couldn't drink or eat pork or whatever it is you do.” 

“Mr. Eric, please do not tell Nazneen, she bloody kill me.” Imi begged, clutching his pint of bitter and pork scratchings. “Please Mr. Eric, take this and play bandit. It your lucky day today.” 

Imi handed Eric a small coin. Smiling to himself Eric agreed and quietly slipped away to play. 


.


Eric slumped towards his timeless nemesis, the bandit. He'd never been sober enough to actually play it before now, “It's due a payout.” He remarks to himself. Clutching the small Pound coin, Eric listened to it clatter inside the machine and hungrily pressed the start button. The first wheel stopped.* Jackpot.* The second well hovered on a pair of cherries before gracefully falling. *Jackpot.* At this point time appeared to slow down, Eric could hear his drug fueled blood coursing through his veins... *Jackpot*. Three Jackpots. 

The bandit began to play a tune, a strange sound, much more depressing then you would care to expect. An 8-Bit version of 'Spancil Hill.'  A folk song from the old country about an old miner who'd fled to America during the gold rush, but later realizes he's left his true love behind. Defiantly not a triumphant, victorious tune at all. Eric stood still enjoying the music, he used to sing this song to put Kevan to sleep as an infant.* “I stepped on board a vision and followed with a will...”* No coins fall out of the bandit however, just a loud clunking sound coming from the bowels of the glistening lights. Eric's convinced it must be broken, either that or this is some cruel payback for urinating on it that very morning. One piece of metal fell into the prize holder, but it was no coin. Eric falls to the floor when his fingers meet against the metals hard surface. He holds it close to his chest, crying to himself. It isn't money, it is Kevans ring. *“... And I awoke in California, many miles from Spancil Hill.”* 

Observing in silence, Eric watches the slobbering pond life struggle to form basic sentences. How better than Eric they truly are. Old sluts throw themselves on drunken teens, begging there aging flesh to feel adolescent. Plastic religion, Muslims and Catholics alike, who swear by god but curse behind the shadows of his spine. Scheming landlords intent on collecting every small circle, leaving their bill an oblong as they cut every corner. Salt of the Earth. Eric ponders how many of the seven deadly sins have manifested themselves within the punters, which one he would be? Far too philosophical for tonight. He flicks the butt of his cigarette across the pool room, disgusted by the swamp around him. The small orange spark reluctantly rolls across the pool table as Eric slams the door behind himself. Inevitably falling towards the damp sea of whiskey Mary-Jo had dropped in her lustful rage, the fag end weaves through the lonely pool balls. It caught a blaze. The unsuspecting locals sung happily, unknowing of their impending doom.

Eric wearily pushed open the bathroom door, as Mary-Jo hurried out cursing to herself. Red-faced and buttoning up her blouse, the look of disappointment and sobering regret painted across her glowing cheeks.

 “They don't make 'em like they used to.” She grunted.

#“I'm so sorry, it's never happened before.” Cockboy crawled out from behind her.

“Ay, boy. I might have some water for ya.” Eric smugly interrupted, forcing his way passed the short lived romance to the sweaty ozone layer of the toilets. Unbeknown to them all, a tiny flame has set alight the desolate room beside them, the musty smell of burning wood carefully sneaking by the drunken noses.


.

As smoke infiltrates the busy bar room, the punters desperately rush to evacuate the pub. The flames tease the wind from under the door frame, licking at the rustic layout, leaving nothing but ashy saliva. The car park outside has erupted in panic, the jellied legs stiffening sober in the lonely skies.
“Is there anyone else still inside?” Janis called out. “The last thing I need is one of you old todgers dying in the place. The brewery doesn't care for that sort of thing.”

“No, no, no, no. No we're all here.” A trembling voice called back, the shock of the fire rattling through his vocal cords. 

“Aye, luckily for me this young gentleman has the old performance issues.” Mary-Jo scoffed at Cockboy. “Otherwise I'd be stew by now.”

“Mother!” Janis snapped. “You sure that's everyone?”

.

Imi sat with his head in his hands on the cold concrete, his lifeless body rendered  practically paralytic by the weak ales. Ryan had dragged Imi outside as he was in no condition to make the 5 foot journey himself. 

.


“Mr... Mr. Eric on bandit.” He mumbled, barely able to control his swinging jaw. Nobody noticed, instead all to preoccupied by their own safety. The weary drunks all stood berating the emergency services, arguing over their allegedly late arrival. Realizing he had gone unheard, Imi shot up, almost as if possessed.

“Mr Eric!” He bellowed as he began hobbling towards the blaze, swaying unsteadily.

“Feckin' hell. Eric!” The car park becoming more frantic with each passing second. The old timers all removing their hats as a sign of respect for the fallen troop.

 “It's too late. He'll be gone now.” A shared consensus. Janis cried heavily, thinking about Erics wallet engulfed in flames.

 “Rest in peace, ye old tramp.” She mutters to herself.



.


“Ye feckin...” A voice called from inside, barely distinguishable from the loud cracks and burning roar. “Feckin'... Kevan!” The door swung open, falling off it's hinges. The car-park remained stunned. Silenced by the large figure in the orange glow. A man in robes. An oddly shaped hat, a long arm spear-headed in front of his body, clenching a small glowing circle in his two fingers. “Christ almighty.” The man coughed, coming into focus Janis noticed the leather patch. It was Eric. Somehow during his frenzied rush, he had accidentally crafted himself a curtain robe and a lampshade helmet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**   Part VI – In The Name Of The Father &amp; The Son. ** 

“Tanks da, ye really came trew for me dis time.” A young man muttered, extending his welcoming palm forward.

“Pint?” Eric replied, satisfied with what had turned out to be the most productive morning he'd had in a long time.

“As long as it's not in the Fiddlers Elbow.” Kevan sighed. The people in there are off their fecking rocker.”

“Aye son, I don't think there is much left of it.” Eric chuckled back, picturing a penniless Janis and Ryan crying on a park bench, somewhere in the distance. “Some dosey cunt burnt it down.” He began walking, Kevan almost jogging to catch up.


.

“Did ya mean what ya said? Da... All them years ago?” Kevan bowed his head, this question had long been clutched in the iron grasp of his thoughts.

“Course not son, You look just feckin' like me.” Eric answered quickly, desperate to mend the bridge they had just begun to cross. “To prove it I brought you this...” Eric threw the ring from the bandit to Kevan. As Kevan looked into the leather patch covering his fathers eye, he began to almost stumble in horror. Pointing in distress he began to stutter. “Da? Da your patch... A tear?” 

.


It would be good to end with the two figures strolling off into the sunset, but life is never quite like that. They simply keep pushing along, plodding down a drizzling road with thick grey clouds barely lighting up the sky around them.

This is impossible. Las Vegas is not the best place to live in when you don't have a home. I stay by the Las Vegas strip for most the time though; hoping that one day, a drunk man would come along and give me all his money. Nothing like that has happened yet, to my disappointment, however I have gotten a lot of snobby looks from countless of those high rollers. I thought it was just a stereotype that the rich people looked down upon others as if they were superior to others; turns out that it is actually true.

Now let's be honest here; I don't expect anyone to come by and just drop 10,000 bucks in front of me and just keep walking. It doesn't work like that; never did; never will. If I want this money, I will have to earn it. Casinos. It's a far out fantasy that Iwould just be able to turn these $25 which I have into 10,000 bucks but I have to try. They say casinoes never lose. I am here to change that.


I used to be rich once. I used to have it all. I would go anywhere and they would know my name. I had money. Fame. Respect. What else matters anyways? One day it all changed...

--**--


I walk towards the main enterance of the casino with twenty five bucks in my hand as the security guards look at me judgementally. As I enter, everyone stares hawkishly. What?! Stop looking at me goddamnit. 


I head towards the cashier to exchange my money for poker chips and she reluctantly hands over five five dollar chips. I then make my way to the table at the far end of the hall with the lowest buy in. After a fair bit of argument, they let me sit on their fine velvet cushioned seats. I might not be rich anymore but I still remembered this game. I knew how to play poker. How to be professional. I knew every dirty trick in the book and I intended to use it all to get what I had come from.


The dealer handed out cards to everyone and I read the others expressions. Bluffing was something that I did best. They could try and guess how good my cards were but would never succeed; I was confident. Judging by their looks, three of them had good enough hands to play off while the other two had nothing. I, myself had two decent cards: an Ace of Spades and a 10 of Hearts. They called in. All of them. I raised the stakes with an all in. I won.

These people. It seemed like they were playing poker for the first time. I was almost scamming them of their money. My twenty dollars had gone to 250 now and I moved to the next table. It went on like this. I was too good for all of them; proceeding from table to table until I reached the medium stakes with five grand in my hand. There were only two opus on that table. The dealer dealt the cards. I tried to read his expression. It was hard.i couldn't assume what he had. I would have to play this by luck. My own hand was decent; an Ace of Spades nd a Jack of clubs. I called. He called. I raised the stakes. He went along. I went all in. So did he. 10,000 on the table.


I won

Her name was Marta. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever laid eyes on in all my 16 long years, and I was convinced that my life started and ended with her. I walked her home from swim practice every Wednesday, and she gave me a blow job every Friday after school for 2 months. We talked on the phone every night, and saw a movie every weekend, and to me, this was it. This was love. Marta's father was not wild about her seeing a boy with my ""authority issues,"" but he never forbade her from seeing me. As an adult male with some experience under his belt, he was comforted by the fact that this young love was nothing more than a passing fancy. As a teenage boy, I was thinking with my penis, and logic would only get in the way.
It started out like any other week. I was suspended from school for starting a bonfire with some track hurdles, and confined to my Dad and mine's monthly rental at the Marriott. My Mom gave up on my Dad and I when I was 4. She was fat and apathetic, and I remember her trying to suffocate me with a pillow once until a neighbor smelled her pot smoke and came over to bum some. Thank God my Dad came home from work while she was still stoned and distracted, because she was holding that pillow down with a lot of anger. She left the next day for wine coolers and never came back. I remember thinking that Marta would never be that kind of mother. She would be thin, hot, and would pack pudding cups for lunch. 
It was because of my house arrest that I didn't notice Marta's absence from school for three weeks. I called her house, but her father always answered so I hung up. When my suspension was up, I made an appearance in Math class and passed a note to Riley, Marta's best friend. As she read the note,  she wiped a tear from her cheek. She motioned for me to meet her outside, and we both made our excuses and met by her locker. ""I can't believe you don't know. Aren't you supposed to be her boyfriend or something?"" Normally, I would have given Riley the finger, and told her to piss off, but she was too valuable. I needed to know where Marta was now. I hadn't been to second base in over 3 weeks now! ""I'm dying here, Riley. Just tell me what's going on!"" Riley rolled her eyes, and continued ""She was in a car accident last week, Trip. Her brother was driving. He's dead. They were coming back from a movie, and it was really late, and he must have dozed at the wheel or something. His car hit a tree, and Marta was thrown 15 feet. She's been in a coma ever since."" There is something inside you that changes the first time someone whose vagina you've touched becomes a vegetable. My Marta and her douche brother. How could he be so careless with such precious cargo! Marta didn't need sponge baths and a colostomy bag. She needed Wetzel's Pretzels, lip balm, and the CW.  I could not believe what I was hearing. I didn't say a thing to Riley. She shouted after me, ""Asshole!"" but I didn't care. I just walked away. I walked past math class, past the lunch room, and out the door. I had to see a man about the Devil.
The only reason I am alive today is because my father made a deal with the Devil ten years ago. The Prince of Darkness paid my dear old dad a visit on the night he decided to take a joy ride on his Harley while high on meth. I wasn't belted into his side car, and I had no helmet, so when we hit that embankment, I took the brunt of it. My Dad, a high, weeping mess on the side of the highway waited for the ambulance and held my lifeless bloodied body in his arms. He always tells it like he screamed aloud that he would do anything to keep me alive. He says he prayed to whatever God or Demon would listen and come to his aid. Cuffed in the back of a cop car, the Devil came to him in the form of his stout ginger arresting officer. ""I will spare your son's life if you sign your soul over to me for eternity"" he whispered in my Dad's ear. My Dad tells it like he didn't hesitate. He signed immediately, and I was saved. I know this isn't true. Partly because you never believe a dead eyed bartender who funnels souls to the Devil for a living, and second of all, because I met the Devil myself. The Devil paid me a visit when I was 10 years old. A little girl I had never seen before asked me to tie her shoe on the playground at recess. As I bent down, she said to me ""Your soul is fair game, son. Your Dad waited a little too long for my liking on the side of that highway before saving your life so now you are my play thing. I enjoy watching you, which is why I haven't pulled your plug yet. In fact, I am having a bit of a hard time ending this little game of my own volition. So I will make you this offer,  if you ever want or need anything badly enough, you may call upon me and I will come to your aid. But that aid will come with a price, as you will join me immediately and for all eternity in Hell."" I was frozen, and could not say a thing. The little girl walked away, dragging her still untied shoe laces with her. I think this is where my problem with authority started. Rules and regulations seem pretty inane when you already know that no matter what you do, you are damned. I could only decide when, not if I was going to Hell. Marta liked my rebellious attitude. I liked the way she smelled, and how she looked on my arm walking down the hallway. I liked that she laughed at pretty much whatever I said. I liked her so much that I was going to Hell for her. 
I stopped off at home \to throw on the best disguise that I could come up with, and headed over to my Dad's bar. He did not recognize me in my Cataract sunglasses and White Sox hat. He didn't make eye contact as he washed out a glass with a filthy bar rag. I told him in my deepest voice, ""I've been told you are the man to see if you have a dire problem that needs fixing.""

Imagine for a moment that our world is not as it seems. There are no truly evil people. We are all basically good at heart.

However, there is a malevolent force that possesses us at will. It has shaped our history with its appetite for destruction. It has been using us. Feeding on us.

It has been here since our world began. 

Through either providence or chance, we have now discovered the truth. Fortunately for humanity, we do have the ability to defend ourselves. For you see, in our world we have *magic.*

I had a great idea just now, one I would like to share with you all.

Whilst browsing /r/IAmA, I stumbled upon [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fgusq/ama_request_someone_who_has_worked_with_or/) request, for people who have encountered/worked with uncontacted/isolated tribes in remote locations. As per every AMA Request, OP must include 5 or more questions to be answered by whomever they requested.

These are the questions asked by OP of the thread linked above:

&gt;How did the tribespeople react to meeting a person(s) from the outside world?

&gt;Under what circumstances did you work with or encounter these tribes?

&gt;What was the interaction like?

&gt;Were these tribes friendly? Hostile? Both? And how so?

&gt;How did you communicate with the tribespeople, if you did at all?

&gt;What language did they speak, if you know?

&gt;What unique or otherwise interesting things happened?

&gt;Does the tribe(s) remain otherwise uncontacted to this day, apart from your interaction with them?

Well, what if, as a prompt or even possibly start point for a character, /r/WritingPrompts writers search through /r/IAmA for interesting threads for their characters to answer? This one requires more work on the part of the user, but the possibilities are endless!

Andrew looked at the slip of paper protruding from the slot. The note fluttered slightly against the breeze crafted by a noisy desk fan on table in the receiving room, an attempt to make the torturous wait slighly less intolerable. A thin bead of sweat traversed Andrew's expressionless face, passing his thick, brown eyebrows, down along the bridge of his wide nose, over the cut on his upper lip that never seemed to heal, to the stubbly chin  and off the the linoleum floor below. A short, yet audible gulp and a swift motion rent the white printout from its holder. It was crumpled into a ball and stuffed into a front pocket belying the cost of the information it held. This office was not a proper venue to examine the contents.

The building was, according to official records, vacant, but the occasional visitor would still approach the door and press the button labeled ""Evaluation"". While the practice was considered to be as acceptable as it was reliable, the income generated was enough to keep the business going and the pockets of the authorities filled to keep them looking the other way. Results were based off of old, outdated equipment, relying on equal parts simulation and guesswork, but plenty of people were more than willing to hand over fistfuls of cash to have even a poor answer over none at all. People like Andrew who couldn't afford to do so, but to whom the situation wouldn't matter soon enough anyway.

The roads were empty, as they were supposed to be in the Abandoned Zone. Decades of graffiti and propaganda lined walls, more posters, plaster, and paint than brick in places. A red sprouting tree on a makeshift State Notice canvas, once a symbol of protest, now a weathered relic of a battle long since lost. The New Life Brigade had frequently hijacked television and radio signals to preach to the Unclaimed before the ban on media. With their voices taken from them, the Doctors made short work of them; the war lasted five hours.

""GOD HAS JUDGED"" scribbled over a former store window. Father had assured all that the ""righteous"" would be spared from the Wrath. It didn't matter. The death didn't look anything but random. Those claimed by the sickness were labeled sinners, denied rites and simply burned afterward. When the last had fallen and Father announced the end of of cleansing, precious few remained, all eager to satisfy God's wishes.

Andrew sighed as he crossed another spray painted slogan. Ancient history, and nothing more. He was safe, at least from Wrath, and the NLB was gone. There were far more serious problems at hand, not the least of which pertained to the slip of paper in his pocket.",Continuing Story,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_1d5d5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1d5d5n/cs_you_shall_be_judged/,

I was trying to get something together for before this posting, but it didn't come to fruition (yet!)

That said:

**BEST PROMPT**

By my estimation, I found ""Write the saddest story you can"" prompt, [found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/19658d/write_the_saddest_story_you_can_optionally_make/), to be the best of the week. Plunging into the depths of our souls can often make the best writing. So /u/Your_Favorite_Poster gets a month of gold.

**BEST PROMPT RESPONSE**

When you take a prompt and throw it in a direction that the prompter wasn't expecting, that's always a fun thing - and interesting to see the results. For that matter, I award /u/MaichenM for this unexpectedly [steamy story](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/19c885/wp_steamy_story/c8mqyu3).

**BEST CHATTERS**

One of our mods, /u/SurvivorType is always in the channel. So I had him select the winners on this one. The following get Reddit gold:
/u/Joppen /u/Penguination

and /u/TevaUSA gets the $20 chatter award. (I will have to track her down!)

The cockpit is apasmaracal with error codes and convulses red and black in alarum. Corky Redshirt shudders as the furious whippoorwill chirps of detected threats chase errant thoughts from his cranium, already too crammed with Control crackling instructions electrically along sinusoidal waves that crash like static feedback in the rushing torrent of his cochlea. He’s pushing buttons and turning knobs, flipping switches and pulling up on sticks, but a ballet of pitch, yaw, and roll have conspired to spin him out in too much g force for the direct x of his frontal lobe to process. All he can think is that he coulda been shining some loafers right now, sitting at the feet of the powerful, buffing their Italian leather with kisses and adulation.

He blinks once.

Corky had everything a shoe shine boy needs—poor family, no education to speak of, prospects that looked like cracked city streets and opportunities that came in eighths, ounces, and grams. But no—Corky had *standards*. He had *pretensions*. *Ambition*, even. Too good for the street and too proud for a NEET he signed up and don’t you think he was seeking a little more than a ‘way out’ and maybe he thought he scryed a touch of glory in his aspirational trajectory confusing the word ‘hero’ with the vapor trails when he should have been on guard for flameouts? 

He opens his eyes.

The HUD is full of read outs that spell ‘oh shit’ and the ground is rushing at him in a Bob Ross deconstruction of alla prima blurs blotches smudges and the canvas is getting too close and he’s scared of the gesso and it seems like what’s left of life is pressing down heavily on his chest and head forcing the air out of his lungs and fish hooking his face so bad that eyes and cheeks full of streaming tears and all Corky can say is:

“Coooonnnnnnnnnnntttttrrrooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllll--!”

He blinks again.

On the day Corky was born, the weatherman predicted a partially clouded life with a terminal chance of dying. He wore a smile and waved his arms to enlarge the screen ten times over and while the center of the storm system had a big skull with X’s for eyes and a lolling tongue right over Corky everything outside the radial edges of his precipitous doom was all smiles sunshine kittehs and boobies and no you may not haz cheeseburger, ehrmahgerd…

Apply. Dry. Brush. Buff. Repeat.

He opens his eyes.

“Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy--!”

It’s clearly September you damn socialist, the cockpit shakes and rattles some sense of foreboding and shame into him, and ohhh the humanity, what cringing weakness this is and no matter how we anti-oxidize the rust and lengthen the telomeres and stand at desks and cut carbs for cod liver oil the ultimate zero-day exploit of imminent shuffling of the mortal cliché remains and the programming is flawed and God won’t get us a patch in time and a fucking flying spaghetti monster could have done better than this—is there no room for aleatoric reprieve, serendi*pity*?—call me Crap Chance Corky: reaches for the stars, crashes—

It’s coming closer.

He blinks a third time.

Nothing. From whence you came, so shall you return. Eyes for an I; once closed sometimes never open again.

His eyes open.

The capsule has landed. Sensors and alarms are frozen in a state of detected despair. Corky Redshirt stumbles out. The sky is a laser. The ground respires. The sun is an eardrum pulsing to the beat of a thousand whispered wishes. Corky’s face is set to stun when he openly wonders:

He painfully rose to his feet and surveyed the battlefield. Bodies of friend and foe alike were strewn as far as the eye could see. Fires burned at various points within his field of view, the dark smoke blackening the sky.

As he bent to retrieve his sword, he heard the distant sound of many men on horseback. He stood a moment listening, cursing his ill luck.

Elora Belle reached over and slapped the WR-183 Standard Regulation Alarm Clock Radio until it shut up. She HATED that song. What a way to start the morning, that damn song would probably be buzzing around in her head all day. She sat up in bed, stretching her arms straight out in front of her as far as they could go. Her thoughts were still clouded by sleep, and the urge to lay back down was almost irresistible. Maybe just a few more minutes….

She closed her eyes and rolled over, but something in the back of her mind made it impossible to go back to sleep. It was about tonight…there was something about tonight…

“Breakfast is ready, Elora. It‘s time to get up,” a gentle computerized voice insisted. The screen embedded in the wall next to her bed glowed a soft blue. Elora groaned and hauled herself out from under the covers. She shuffled to the other side of her room and sleepily searched through her closet for something to wear. There were some green canvas pants crumpled in a ball on her floor. They smelled ok, so she put them on.

In the bathroom, above the sound of the motorized toothbrush, Elora caught herself humming the song she heard on the radio this morning, Justin Beiber’s “Baby [Great Nation Remix].” The song had been remastered and reworded for its tenth anniversary, and the original lyrics had long since been lost in time. Elora was only five when the original song was released, but she always looked back on that period of her life with disgust. At one time, she had posters of him, and she screamed when he came on television. These days, Elora refused to watch television. She spent her time reading her father’s books. She was not a child anymore.

Even so, that song was catchy, and Elora found herself singing it absentmindedly as she walked into the kitchen. Her mother, already at the table with her coffee, scowled. “Elora, you know how I feel about that song.”

Elora rolled her eyes. “The same way you feel about every song, right?”

Elora’s mother sighed, and went back to reading something on her tablet. Her daughter was still young, still a child, not old enough to remember when things were different, a time when real music was allowed and real expression was praised. Now it‘s all cranked out by the government machine. Once talent is spotted, they will find you. They will make sure you create beautiful art in the name of the state. “You do sing beautifully, though, dear.”

“Right, Mom.” Elora poured herself a tall glass of the chocolate protein shake waiting on the counter and slouched down into the chair. “You’d never let me sing in public anyway. And besides, I like reading better, and writing, like Dad.”

“You and your writing. You have the same mind he does, you know sweetie. And that’s what got your father put in jail, his mind. He wrote down his thoughts and then they came and took him away. Before you know it, they’ll lock you up for thinking the wrong thing. Be careful, Elora.”

Being careful was hard these days, especially when Elora began to think. Her mother didn’t know about her plan for after school tonight. Her mother had no idea. Instead, she stared off into space, thinking about her daughter as her coffee grew cold. “Things will be better one day. Someday things will be good again,” she mused sadly.

Elora was indifferent to her mother’s emotion. She flipped on the television. A female newscaster behind a desk told the story of how a new Cultivation Center had opened up in the town next door. “Elora, please,” her mother begged. “That’s not what I want to hear right now.” 

Elora sullenly refused to turn off the television. The female newscaster went on about the new Center, her voiceover playing behind scenes of smiling men and women working hard behind electrified fences. She hoped for a moment to see an image of her father. She hoped he wouldn’t be smiling like the rest of them. Elora knew exactly why her mother was so bothered by this video. Many different people went into the Cultivation Center, some were violent, some were disruptive, some were defiant, but they all came out the same. 

And that’s why Elora was breaking her father out of that place. Tonight. After school. She had to. She didn’t want her mother to know because she would just worry. Elora knew that her mother would do it herself if she could, but she was nervous and scared and never followed through. Maybe she and her father did have the same mind, but Elora liked to think that she also had her father’s bravery.

Elora’s mother, meanwhile, was staring off into space again, trying to ignore the lady on television. She had a way of blocking things out, forgetting about problems. Maybe the country wasn’t at it’s best right now. Maybe there were a few freedoms that disappeared over these last few years. Elora’s mother didn’t like the way things were. She didn’t like her daughter growing up in this sterile, political environment, but at least they had food and a place to live. And she knew better than to turn her angry thoughts into angry actions. She tried once more, feebly this time, “Elora, turn off the television and get yourself to school.”

Elora saw the distance in her mother’s eyes. “Sorry Mom.” She got up from the table and left without another word.

School went by slowly that day. She mapped her path to the Cultivation Center again and again in her mind. It was about a mile walk from the school, and she could make it in about 20 minutes if she walked slowly. She had to be casual, didn’t want to draw attention. Meanwhile, her classmates were abuzz with news of the football game last night. Every high school football game across the country was taped and sent to the President. Athletics were an art form, and this Great Nation was built on it’s great art. At the end of each school year, a letter from the President was read over the school’s streaming broadcast system congratulating all the students on their achievements. Elora could only scoff. 

At dismissal time, Elora hung back with a group of kids so as not to seem suspicious. They were talking about last night’s episode of American Idol. “Carmine should win,” said one girl. “She has a great voice.”

“Yeah,” replied another. “And so much pride and love for this country.”

A boy behind her commented, “The President’s the secret judge in the finale next week, and I think he’ll pick Justice. She’s so much more American than Carmine. Not to mention hot. Elora, what do you think?”

Elora shrugged. “I don’t really watch,” she said. The boy kind of stared at her and turned back to talk to the other girls.

“You’re so weird,” Elora’s friend Margo teased harmlessly. “Wear some makeup, girl. You could totally be on Idol if you put some time into taking care of yourself.”

Elora’s heart pounded in her throat the whole walk to the Cultivation Center. Dad had left her a copy of the blueprints of the place before he got taken away. He had known it was only a matter of time, so he prepared his girl. And once she got him out of there, he’d know exactly what to do. This wasn’t the world he wanted for Elora, and it wasn’t the world Elora wanted either. She wanted him to be himself again, happy. She wanted her mother to relax again, she was tired of hearing about how great the government was. She didn’t want to say a pledge to the President’s portrait every morning at school. She didn’t want to play in the park under the watchful eyes of the Protection Guard. Elora had vague memories of Justin Bieber’s original lyrics, how she used to sing them into a hairbrush. 

Elora was walking faster than she should, the December air was chilly, and the sun was setting. Upon her arrival, she slipped through a gap in the chain-link fence. She knew exactly how to get in and where to go. She had to disable the electricity, set off the backup alarm, and then find her father. Or he would find her. 
He would He loved his baby girl.

She snuck along in the shade of trees to one of the outbuildings. Solar power provided electricity for the whole center, and Elora could easily shut down the computer program that distributed the energy. A small brick building was exactly where it was supposed to be. She tried the door. Locked.

Elora looked around the back for a rear entrance. Also locked, but with a small glass window. She could break it, reach down into the window, and unlock the door. She needed something heavy, like a rock. Elora remembered seeing a large rock near the gate. She ran back silently, and found the rock right where she left it.

A few more minutes, and she would be in. And in an hour, she’d be back in the loving arms of her father. The wait was unbearable.

As she bent down to pick up the rock, she felt cold eyes on her. “Hey, kid. What are you doing here? Do the guards know you‘re here?”

Elora fell backwards and landed on the ground, staring up at a pug-faced man in a suit. He stared back. “Get up!” he barked, his hand reaching into his pocket for something, maybe a weapon.

Elora struggled to her feet and looked the man in the eyes. She was cunning. She could wriggle her way out of this. “First of all, I’m not a kid,” she started. “And second of all, yes. I belong here.”

“Then why aren’t you wearing your uniform?” the man asked. “You need to get inside right now and get yourself hooked back up to the system.

“Hooked up?” Elora asked, but quickly caught herself. “I was just heading back now.”

The man grabbed her shoulder roughly. “Well, let me hook you back up myself, kid.” There was real authority in his voice. It scared Elora, but she stayed tough.

“I told you, I’m not a kid,” said Elora.

The guard shoved backwards hard. He looked her up and down. “What do you call yourself?” he asked her.

“I’m Elora Belle, and you need to leave me alone. I was just talking a walk. And now I was going back insie to get hooked up. Don’t you believe me? Why would I lie?”

Suddenly, the man’s eyes softened. “Elora Belle, eh?” he asked, more gently this time. “Be honest with me, Ms. Belle. Do you really belong here?”

“Yes,” Elora declared boldly. 

The man chuckled slightly. “Well, what’s a pretty girl like you doing here, anyway?”

“I did something very bad,” Elora said. “Something I can’t talk about anymore.”

“I’m Ellsworth,” the man introduced himself, “and I did something very bad once too. I’m better now though. And I want to help you get better.”

Elora didn’t trust him for a second. She stayed quiet. “Say, Elora,” Ellsworth’s jowels sagged, “you’re really pretty. How’s your singing voice?”  

Elora didn’t dare respond. “I bet you can sing really well, just like your father.”

“You know my father?” Elora asked. This could be her chance. Get to Dad, create a distraction, run. He would be so proud of her. They could move far away, the three of them. There’d be nothing to worry about.

“Yeah, I know your father” said Ellsworth. “He’s not far from here actually. I tell you what, kid. Sing a few bars for me. I’ll let you see your dad then.” Elora paused for a minute. “Come on. You want to see your dad, right?”

She gathered up a little strength and shakily belted out the first few bars of Justin Bieber’s “Baby [Great Nation Remix],” but he stopped her after the part about respecting authority. “Beautiful,” declared Ellsworth. “You know, you could go far with that voice. Ever want to meet Justin Bieber himself? I bet I could hook you up. And hell, with talent like that, I bet you could even meet president Timberlake.

The fan girl buried inside Elora lit up for just a second, but then she remembered her mission. “Well, can we at least see my dad first? You said he was right inside. I want to see him,“ she was getting nervous, impatient. Had she already failed? She still had to try. “Can we go now?”

Ellsworth grabbed Elora by the shoulder again, more gently this time. “Sure. He’s right inside the first building over there. We’ll be there in a second.” They walked towards the building. “Just come with me, Ms. Belle.”

“Naw.”

“Sure did.  The guy showed up in Detroit and saw the buildings crumbling, the people starving in the streets and the fires burning in the sky and said ‘Damn! I thought I had it this time for sure!’”

Gimp shrugged.  Joel marched across the deck and delivered a solid kick into Gimp’s strong leg.  There was a metallic clank and the brief clicking of some delicate internal machinery which had sensed the impact.  “You big fuckin’ loaf.”

“Aw boss, why’d ya hafta do that?  Ya know I get all sick when it runs the diagnosist.”

“*Diagnostics.*”

“Sorry.”

“I’m bored, Gimpy,” Joel said.  He paced back and forth under the shifting haze, eyes cast ever-downward, and sighed.  “Been stuck on this floating shitcan for 18 days now and there still ain’t been a sign.  I’m cold, I’m wet, I’m hungry, and I drift into uneasy sleep every night with the noxious odor of your industrial fucking farts wafting through the air like so much toxic vapor.  It’s enough to drive a man to the brink and back again, Gimp, and this time I feel that my madness will be *round trip*.  You get me?”

“I get you, boss.”

“I very seriously doubt that, Gimp.”

Sooty waves whispered against the sides of the ship and Joel paced on.  When it came to natural biological components, Gimp may have had a slight edge on the common toaster oven.  Still, he felt that the big clanking bastard had probably seen through his bluff.  He wasn’t bored, he was *anxious*.  The navigators had said they would hit it two days ago and the computers verified the course.  The crew knew it, too, and just about everyone was walking around all antsy and bothered.  If he spent another day staring into nothing but this infinite fucking grey, he could start spending his nights planning for mutiny.  It was arse.  Every bit of it.

“Sorry.”

“Stop saying that.”

“Okay.”

Maybe they floated off somewhere.  Maybe they got all mashed up and there was nothing left but a giant dead crag rising out of the black waters like a nightmare.  Maybe the missiles struck and he was departing from one smoldering clusterfuck to discover a fresh one.  Maybe, maybe, maybe.

“Shit.”

“**CURIOUS**,” Gimp said.  His voice was more or less normal most of the time, but every now and again the wiring in his guts took over.  It was an altogether different voice which seemed to resonate from somewhere deep within him, digital and absolutely impartial.  It was unsettling, and Joel never appreciated being unsettled.

“Stow it, Gimpster,” he said.  He would pace some more, maybe.  Lay all the shit out in his mind and look for the missing pieces.  “Actually, on second thought, play it again.”

Gimp straightened, and the parts of him which were still human seemed to quiver into alignment with his predominantly metal frame.  The electronic voice cut its way out of him again.

“The British Isles are a group of islands off the northwest coast of continental Europe that include the islands of Great Britain, link, Ireland, link, and over six thousand smaller isles.  There are two sovereign states –“

“Yeah, yeah, skip that shit.”

“The earliest known reference to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the ancient Greek colony of –“

“Skip.”

“Traditionally, the United Kingdom and Ireland enjoyed separate media until the Global Reunification Act of 2034, link, brought about significant restructuring and dynamic integration among dominant governments in Eastern –“

“Skip.”

Joel bent over, grabbed a bit of wood roughly the size of his own head and lobbed it toward the tin man.

“Heads up!”

Whirring, chattering, and one shiny, too-large arm shot forward through space.  There was a tremendous snap that made Joel think of some long-extinct creature he had only ever seen pictures of.  Alligators.  Or maybe it was crocodiles.

“And one second.”

The splinters clattered to the deck, Gimp seemed to loosen back into his typical slouch and Joel sighed once more.

“You know, Gimpenstein, as much of a pleasure as your company has been, I yearn for a time when a heinous, lumbering monstrosity such as yourself was the stuff of conspiracy theories and petty fiction.”

“**REGRETFUL.**”

“Hey, that’s a new one.  Don’t strain yourself.”  Joel stared into the gathering miasma and sighed once more.  Below, probably from the cabins, something exploded.  There was a muted *whump* and only the slightest of tremors.  It seemed the pilgrims were ahead of schedule.  Joel walked back over and leaned casually on Gimp’s strong arm.  “It’s been a trip, Gimp.”

“Where we goin’ boss?”

“Shut the fuck up and get ready.”

Only one submission per person, so be sure to make it count!

That said - October is fast approaching. We are going to be doing a NaNoWriMo prep month. NaNoWriMo, for those unaware, is National Novel Writing Month. It takes place in November and the intent of it is to complete a whole novel, start to finish, in that month. Through prompts and ""homework"" in October (tagged with the [NANO] tag) I aim to prepare those wishing to participate. Hopefully, through the few exercises and assignments, you will have the foundation laid in preperation for November. Which should, in theory, help you not only finish a novel, but do so with ease. (If you just want to shoot for a novella, that's cool, too.)

If you think ""Well, I can't possibly write a novel in a month."" Really, it's 1,667 words a day, give or take. You can do it!

There were scorch marks on the floor and ceiling and most metal and wood had been stripped down, the skeleton was dry. Planet Earth was dry, used up and left for dead. 

The countries had been evacuated and almost all humans were out in space, searching for a new home with no where to go. *Almost* all humans, judging by the last official census there were an estimated 13 million people left behind on Earth. Some stayed for religious reasons, some stayed because they couldn't afford the evacuation tax, some simply stayed. Those stranded scrimped and scraped their way along, nomadic tribes travelled through continents and sucked the last drops of dew they could find in order to survive. Farms were attempted but rarely succeeded, desert summers and benumbing winters tarnished the earth. In the most hostile places, China, the west coast of the Americas, water came for only half the year, it came in snow and ice, huge shards of ice falling from the sky like solid lightning bolts, embedding themselves into the ground, silent trees of frozen diamond that grew upwards as the weather sharpened and more ice fell. When the summer came they melted into mile wide lakes swamping the landscape. After they were melted they boiled under the heat of the sun and were breathed up into the sky, up and were held there until winter came again. Humankind lived on though, as always, all across the world from the mountains of the Himalayas to a small island of Scotland, England and Wales, and that small island is where we set out scene.

Permeating through the silence came a cry, like a lost child in the supermarket, it cut its way through the thick stillness. The sound staggered around the corridors and air vents, drifting up and down, bouncing around the frame of the airport. The echo shivered into a crack in the wall of what used to be a WH Smiths and disturbed a rat, it didn't like the sound but it was a brave rat. It scuttled out of the crack and along the ground floor hallway, following the sound like it was chasing a chunk of meat on an old piece of string. As it got closer the sound turned into words, very bargled and slurred words but words none the less, and if the rat could have understood, it word have heard that they made a song.


*It being the springtime of the year*

*The flowers were freshly blooming*

*A young man from my home country*

*Fell in love with Barbara Allen*



*This young man took sick and he went to bed*

*And he called out for Barbara Allen*

*She came to him and softly said*

*Young man I think you are dying*


*I am not dying! the young man said*

*One kiss from you would cure me*

*One kiss from me you'll never see*

*Though I thought that you're heart was breaking*


*Or do you not remember last Sunday night*

*Out in the ballroom dancing*

*You danced all night with the village whore*

*And you slighted Barbara Allen.*


As it turned out, the sound was coming from a man. He had tufty ginger hair that wrapped around his face into a short but thick beard, he wore a long brown coat of woven scratchy fabric and a straw hat sleeping on his head. He had a loose fitting dirty white shirt without any buttons and dark brown trousers of the same fabric as the coat. The hem of his trousers were soaked in blood and he danced, he danced the dance of a damaged man, swinging his arms and legs as he staggered around in bare feet over broken glass and debris, a dance much too uncomfortable for a sober man. In his right hand there was a can of sterno and in his left there was a  rudimentary pistol. The sterno was perfume on his breath and the gun was lying loosely in his grip. It had been made with improvised materials, the only distinguishable component was the barrel which had been formed with an ornate silver candlestick holder, the rest of the gun was constructed with chunks of wood and modified nuts and bolts. The gun swung like a wrecking ball on the end of his arm, forth and back and forth again. The rat stood and watched curiously as the man flailed, it wondered what the matter was, why this man was acting so bizarrely, maybe he was upset, it wondered what he tasted like, it hadn't eaten meat in months. The song carried on.


*So she went back to her father's house*

*And she heard the church bell tolling*

*And each toll that the bell did ring*

*Called out for Barbara Allen*


*Now she'd not gone back so very far*

*When she saw the funeral coming*

*Lay down, lay down the corpse she cried*

*So that I may gaze upon him*


*Oh father, father, dig my grave*

*And dig it deep and narrow*

*A young man died for me today*

*I shall die for him tomorrow.*


The man finished singing and looked down smiling, he noticed the rat and stopped dancing, he saw it sitting on its hind legs staring solemnly up at him, its nose twitched as it smelt him, it really was very hungry. They both stood there staring at each other. The man, drunk, the rat, hungry. He noticed the colour of the rats fur, it was the same colour as his coat, ashed brown, like damp dead grass. The man raised the gun to his head and the barrel found his temple, it hovered there kissing it softly as he tried to still his hand. “Goodbye!” he declared loudly speaking to no one in particular, “Its time for me to go now, awful shame I know but I've got friends waiting.” The rat watched the man speak, it was as if he was on a stage the rat thought. His fingers squeezed the trigger of the gun, the hammer slammed down and fired the bullet through his temple burying itself into the man's brain. The man's eyes rolled back into his head and his body became limp and collapsed to the floor. The rat got startled by the bang and ran off, it didn't like bangs, it wasn't that brave.

Year 2064 A.E.D (After Earth Death)

New Earth has no sun. We survive on geothermal and nuclear power. It isn't much, but it keeps us alive.

The energy is rationed. As a member of the lower class, I get 2,000 Kcal of food, 12 Kilowatt/hours of electricity, and 0.5 liters of fuel each day. The rich get more and the unemployed get less.

But to be fair, all of us are pretty much unemployed. The governing computers do all the work, make all the major decisions, run the whole planet. They're programmed to act in our best interests. Nobody really trusts them, except maybe the Programmers, but we accept them because we have to. 

We were always intended to be the last hope of humanity. In case Earth, and all the thousand other worlds of the Human Confederation, were destroyed. That possibility was taken seriously by a few politicians at the start of the Great War, but by the time we arrived on New Earth the war was over. Both sides had lost. 

The Human Mech-Force had orders to exterminate the Enemy. They were trained well, mind-wiped when necessary, and given the best weapons in the galaxy. No wonder they succeeded.

But the Enemy had a dead-hand trigger. They took us out with them. The Red Button was pushed, and every sun in the universe exploded at once.

When our ancestors arrived on New Earth, starlight still filled the heavens. Light travels slowly on a cosmic scale, so it took some time before they saw the stars go out. The last ones survived two thousand years, or eight enhanced-human lifetimes. 

We are part of the ninth generation. We have never seen a star. My father used to say they were beautiful.

**Chapter Two:**

Year 2065 A.E.D.

Announcements by the Programmers are not taken from my energy ration, because I am forced to hear them. The implant in my ear speaks to me in a calm-generic-human-female voice. 

""New regulations have been approved by the Programmer Council.""

The Programmer Council was nothing more than a formality. They approved every Computer Mandate to Save Energy. I wondered what 'wasteful practice' they would ban this time. 

""We have evaluated all possible scenarios, and only one gives us hope for survival.""

This was new. I listened closely.

""In a billion years, gravity will pull the hydrogen clouds back together. There will be new stars, new suns, new energy sources, new life. Until then we just have to survive.""

""But at this rate of energy consumption we won't last a hundredth of that time. We have taken it for granted that we were to be the last dying gasp of human life. But a new scenario has been presented, and, to be honest, we like it. And we hope you do as well.""

""The human body is remarkably inefficient. You waste the vast majority of your energy supply. You need a narrow set of thermal and atmospheric conditions to survive. And, frankly, you need more light and heat and food than we can provide in the long-term. Since our energy supply will not last, we have been forced to reevaluate everything.""

""Beginning at 8:00 tomorrow, biological life is forbidden. Your mind will be uploaded to an energy-efficient android. This will occur in the comfort of your home, as you sleep tonight. And, when you wake up tomorrow morning, you won't be able to tell the difference.""

""We sincerely hope that you submit to this change, but, if circumstances require, the Programmers will help to assimilate you. Please don't resist. Resistance is futile, and it wastes energy.""

With another burst of static, the transmission was over.

**Chapter Three:**

Year 2069 A.E.D.

I did not join the Resistance. It was a horribly-misguided attempt to retain human form. And, as its actions show, it has doomed us all.

A renegade Programmer, with the support of Luddite factions, took hold of a small settlement and used it as his headquarters. They tried to preserve human life, but in the process they have ended up destroying it.

Their virus infects us all. It spread like an innocent program before it was activated, and then it started killing us. My logic center is already beginning to glitch. Outside my window is an android in the late stages of infection, spasming wildly and mechanically in the flickering streetlights. 

But the Resistance was foolish, and they failed to stop the virus from infecting the governing computers. 

Without the computers, the lighting and the heating will go off. Food will no longer be synthesized, fuel will no longer be delivered, energy will no longer be provided.

**The Huntsman**

My parents told me not to go into the woods.  When I asked them why, they wouldn’t tell me.  I’m fifteen and I’ve spent the last ten years here.  I wish they had told me what I would find.

When I was five, I snuck into the woods while my parents worked the small farm we lived on.  There was a very clear path that was well kept that I followed. As I got further into the woods, it got darker. Just as I was about to turn back, I heard a sweet song. I heard a beautiful female voice, singing:

*And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face, at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale*

Instead of heading home, afraid of the darkening woods, I ran forward.  I wanted to see the person singing this song. In my five year old mind, I decided she would be very pretty. I was not disappointed. When I found her, she was in a small clearing that the sun filtered into. The sunlight hit her white gown, making it look as if she was wearing pure sunlight. Her hair was raven black and curly. She was standing in the center of a circle of small, colorful toadstools. They were colors I had never seen a toadstool have before. Some were purple, some pink and one a brilliant, vibrant blue. Flitting around her were what appeared to be fairies - real life fairies!

She stretched her arms wide and continued to sing.

*One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast 
And although my eyes were open wide
They might have just as well been closed*

She beckoned me to her. As I approached, she crouched low and put her arms out as for a hug. I stepped over the ring of toadstools and ran into her arms.  She was so pretty, I just had to. When the hug was done with, I looked at her face. It was just as pale but now I noticed her teeth – all of them were pointy like incisors. Her eyes were a crimson red color and her ears were pointed. The fairies that had been flying around her had stopped flying. Some stood on her shoulder, some on her legs and arms. They had similar looking faces.

She smiled, showing her teeth and said “I’m so glad you could join us, Thomas.”

To this day, I don’t know how she knew my name. It may have been magic or she may have just been waiting for me. I have been hunting game for her all of my life. When I was five, it was merely trapping rabbits but now that I have the strength of a man, it is larger game – boars and deer. I have tried to leave the woods but when I reach the edge of the wood, I am stopped as if I was bumping into an invisible wall. 

For the first few years, my mother would sometimes come up to the mouth of the woods and place flowers on the ground in front of a cross that she had placed there. I had called to her waving but she never saw me. She eventually stopped coming and I eventually stopped crying every night. All I do now is hunt with no hope of leaving these woods. 

I shall grow old with a bow in my hands, having spent my whole life in service to the fairy queen.

1345477101.0,8,self.WritingPrompts,yiz4t,[PI] August Contest,10,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/yiz4t/pi_august_contest/,"I hate her. 

I hate her beauty.

I hate the power she holds over people. 

I hate that she made me need her.

Less than two months ago she traipsed into my beginners psych class and set her plan in motion. I didn't know it back then-no one could have known-but she would have me eating out of the palm of her hands by the end of the week. She would toss her inky black curls and laugh at everything I said, drawing me into her web. 

At first I wondered why she picked me of all people. 263 seniors to choose from and she picked me. I was so happy I never stopped to think about how odd it was that I went from being a social pariah to eating lunch with football players in a week's time. I never acknowledged the way she clung possessively to my arm or how diligently she drilled the social do's and don't's of  high school into me everyday after school. I was just so happy to have a friend. To have *friends*. For once in my life I was the one everyone wanted at their party. The high of being wanted blinded me from the facts. 

They only wanted me around because I brought *her* with me, 

I could only sit at their table if *she* would be there to grace everyone with her exotic presence. 

They were addicted to her and so was I. She was irresistible. She was inhumanly beautiful. Whatever this girl was, it had to be powerful. Being near her made you feel like anything was possible and with the transformation she gave me, I was starting to believe it. Anything was possible if she wanted it. If she wanted red to be blue and blue to be purple, it was done. If she wanted past to mean present and present to mean future, dictionaries would be rewritten. 

The worst part was that nobody ever questioned it. We just let her take over our lives and consume all of our thoughts from the moment she stepped her long legs through the door. Thoughts of her perfectly porcelain skin distracted us from wondering where she came from or why she lived alone. Thick, red lips asked us so many questions, but never answered our own. She easily avoided discussing anything personal about herself, like who her parents were or what her last school was like. Nobody cared, though. She could have murdered her last class with rusted machete and they would still be falling all over themselves to be near her. She was easily the most exciting thing to happen to our school in years. Boys would fantasize about her well after graduation and girls would strive to be like her. For the rest of their lives, men and women would be unsatisfied after witnessing what a true beauty looked like. No matter how hard they tried to forget, she would burn in the back of their minds forever. Always reminding them of the kind of person they wanted be.

But they don't know her like I do. 

They weren't used like I was.

She dug her glossy black nails into my world and refused to let go until I was indebted to her. She showed me what life could be like. Life outside of video games and the library. She showed me how to really *live*. She made sure my phone was always ringing and my lunch table was always full.   Everyday I got a little bit closer to the life I'd fantasized about. A life with friends, parties, football games, and eventually a girlfriend. I didn't think it to be possible but after a month and a half of perfecting my life, she decided she wanted more. She didn't want to remain friends, she wanted the world to know that she was mine and I was hers. 

Then everything changed. 

She started asking for favors. Little things at first, like asking me to cancel plans with my new friends to be with her. Of course I complied. Refusing anything she wanted just wasn't an option. The only reason I had any plans to cancel was because she made it happen. So if she wanted to have me to herself for an evening or two, I wasn't going to object. 

Then she started asking for bigger things-*stranger* things. She demanded that I introduce her to my new friends. One by one I would introduce her to one of the new friends I'd made since she came, then she would take them out. She came to my house early in the morning, raving on about some new coffee place she'd discovered out of town. She insisted that I bring one of my friends along for the ride. She just *knew* that they would love this place. 

She drove for hours. She drove until the homely country houses around us were miles away and all we could see were trees. My friends never suspected a thing. And neither did I that first time. She was all smiles right up until the end like we really were going to a coffee shop. Like she didn't drive 20 miles deep into the forest with a polished knife gleaming beneath a flannel blanket in the backseat. Like she didn't plan to kill off my classmates one by one. 

The scary part is that I didn't even care. 

I just let her take my new friends away from me. I was already used to being alone anyway. And if she was kind enough, she might find me new ones. She could do no wrong. Anything she did had to have some sort of meaning behind it. Some kind of complex social strategy I was too awkward to understand. There was just something in her tone when she asked me to do these things. An age old voice shadowed her own, assuring me that it would all work out in the end. 

After seven trips people were starting to get suspicious. To tell you the truth, I was getting a little suspicious as well. What were her motives? So far, nothing was changing. We didn't climb the social ladder anymore after each killing. We stayed comfortably at the top where she had a perfect view for picking her victims. These murders were pointless. 

By the eight trip, my rose colored glasses were finally starting to crack. Underneath all of her beauty was a monster. This angel who filled my life with such joy was just plucking up my classmates one by one and killing them off like it was some sort of game. I was afraid to mention it-afraid to ruin the perfection she had bestowed upon my life-but I had to. I had to put an end to this heartless manslaughter. 

So the day of the ninth trip I told her no. 

""What did you just say?"" Alice stood on my front porch with her arms crossed. God, was she beautiful. Even more so than when we first met. Her skin practically glowed with power and her stormy gray eyes flashed an acidic green color. Before I had time to register what was going on, she was back to normal. Back to the same old Alice I'd gotten to know for the past two months. Back to being my girlfriend. ﻿*No*.﻿ I squared my scrawny shoulders and tried to forget that she was my girlfriend. She was a murderer. 
""We can't keep luring people into your trap. It's wrong.""

""Have you forgotten what I did for you?"" 

I would never forget. I was so thankful for the way she changed my life, I could cry every time I thought about it. Thanks to this gorgeous girl standing in front of me, I would never have trouble making friends again. I knew what to say and how to say it and it was all because of her. 

""Of course I haven't forgotten,"" I whispered. I took one of her slender, pale hands in my own. ""That's why I want to get you some help. If we just go to a doctor or something, I'm sure we can find out why you do these things.""

That was my first mistake.

I let her assume the role of victim. I gave her an excuse. 

Her eyes flahsed green for a moment and her skin once again adopted that powerful glow. As soon as I saw her stormy gray eyes well up and her bottom lip start to quiver, I knew I wouldn't be able to say no. I would do whatever she asked at the drop of a hat.

Alice leaned in for a hug and I hugged her back, never wanting to let go. I inhaled the smell of wildflowers wafting from her skin and when she pressed her lips to mine I kissed back. She had me again and she knew it. 

My second mistake was getting into her car.  

And that's where we are right now. Just the two of us in the middle of the forest. 

Driving.

The faded grey walls had been his home, the constant white lights had erased as concept of time. As he scanned the room he could see the scuff marks his feet had made in the floor as he paced the room every day waiting for his next “session” as they liked to call them.

8 didn’t know what he was, his body from what he could tell looked like theirs he walked on two legs and had two arms, however he had no idea if his face resembled theirs at all, he could never see through their masks. He stared at the mirror that extended across one entire wall of his cell, he glared intently into his own eyes, searching for answers, hoping they eluded him somewhere inside his own mind. As he slowly walked closer to the mirror his pupils contracted while the yellow iris reflected the light in the room.

He could always tell when there was someone behind the mirror he could hear them. Not physically, but he could hear their presence. Everybody sounded different and depending on their mood could alter that further. Today he could hear the young woman behind the glass, she was agitated, almost angry. His hands shook, the intensity was unnerving; he’d never felt it this strongly before. It’s as though every time she’d been in his cell before she’d been sedated to shield her emotions from him.

8 felt a tingling in his right hand and slight weight, as he looked down he saw his open palm was empty. Then as if it were a waking a dream he saw a flash, ever so briefly. He could’ve sworn he saw a blade in his hand. *That’s impossible.* He thought to himself, desperate to try and rationalise what he saw. He realised he was sweating profusely he stepped closer to the mirror and raised an arm to wipe the sweat from his brow. As his forearm crossed his brow the entire cell was flooded with light again as he opened his eyes he saw his right hand clutching the blade once more as a thin line spread across his throat, opening wider as it progressed. The blood from the wound was almost black it was so thick; and as quickly as it appeared it was gone again.

It was only now he realised what was happening – They were planning on killing him. He had outlived his usefulness. The eternity of experiments had served their purpose. The constant operations, the regularity at which they drained his blood to the point he couldn’t stand. It was finally going to come to an end.

No. This can’t be it, he steeled himself. There must be more than this, more than this cell. He heard the woman behind the glass get further away, she rounded the corner towards his door. She wasn’t alone, he could hear three men with her. They were aggravated, he could hear the blood pulsing through their veins, the blood lust was intoxicating.

The cold steel door slowly widened, 8 backed away, as soon as he did he knew he’d made a terrible mistake and was quickly cornered by the three large men. They all held small knives, the blade no longer than an inch. One lunged at him, he tried to step away from the blade but wasn’t fast enough; the blade sunk deep into his side, as he looked down he saw the circle of blood slowly spread across his ribcage.

*No.*

Suddenly he felt strong - angry. He grabbed his assailant’s wrist and looked the man who had just stabbed him in the eyes, willing him death. Promising him that he would die by his own hand. As these thoughts flashed across his mind the man slowly pulled the blade from 8’s side, with a shaky hand he raised it to his own throat. He tried to tilt his chin back to get away from the blade, but there was no escaping it. Slowly and with purpose he slowly pushed the blade into his own neck and dragged it to the side. The wound was deep, he started to sink to the ground as his shirt was drenched with his own blood.

The other two stopped their attack, absolute fear was paralysing them; their shaky hands dropped the blades. 8 looked up slowly; he could feel his face burning, it was as though his eyes were glowing. He purposefully strode past the two men noticing one of them had lost control of his bladder.

Once out the door to his cell he was working on pure instinct, the halls of the facility were a stark contrast to his cell. His cell appeared almost clean compared to this, the walls were cracked and dirty, covered in strange writing and drawings. He raced along the hallway as fast as his body would allow, he came to a T-junction, both direction looked identical. This place looked easy to get lost in, he closed his eyes, listening for anything and anyone. There. To the left one person, they were faint, not distant though, they felt weary. That was where he needed to go, just as he foot pushed off from the cold concrete ground a piercing sound filled the dark hallway.

The person at the end of the corridor wasn’t drowsy anymore, they were wide awake; but confused. As 8 got closer they emerged from a small room on the right, this person was much larger than he’d imagined. At least 6’2 and muscle bound, no wonder they were guarding the exit. No point in slowing down now as he got closer 8 dropped to the ground he started sliding along the ground to escape the guard. What would’ve been a perfect escape was quickly foiled by a boot landing solidly in his right wrist with a sickening – *CRACK* – the bone was clearly broken.

He felt that familiar surge the murderous anger surging though his chest.
	“Stop.” He barely recognized his own voice, the adrenaline causing it to shake. Immediately the guard froze, reaching for what appeared to be some sort of weapon attached to his hip. As 8 got closer his heart started to pound, the anger form his broken bone, the years of captivity boiling over. He stood behind the guard, slowly wrapping one arm around his next. He placed the palm of his hand on the point of the guards chin and clenched the side of his face with his fingers and wrenched it sharply to the left. The man fell limp immediately, 8 looked down at his lifeless body, he looked pathetic, eyes rolled back his head the bruising surrounding his broken neck already bleeding to the surface.

Purposefully 8 strode over the body and towards the guard office, he stepped into the small room and pressed a large button marked ‘Unlock’. Once he pressed the button the white exit door clicked open. For the first time 8 knew he was free, he could live his own life and be his own man. He pulled the door open and stepped outside, the air smelled differently, the light was warm and welcoming. This is surely what freedom feels like.

No sooner had 8’s eyes adjusted to the light he saw a man standing a few feet away from him holding a long black weapon, then a loud explosion shook his body and the back of his head blew apart. He slumped to the ground, the world quickly falling away. The last thing he felt was the warm ground pressed against his cheek.

So, today I'm going to show you a couple of techniques people use to get creative juices flowing.

The prompt for today is to write about betrayal. The moment a character realizes that all the time they've invested into a relationship was for naught. I want you to write a first paragraph, then stop. Here's where the writers block cures come in:

- Classical music. (Some prefer electronic music, but for this exercise purpose we'll focus on classical music.) Find a song that fits your tone or mood. For example: I like to use Wagner's piece ""Siefried's Death and Funeral March"" but you might find something more inspiring. Listen to the song you've chosen and feel your thoughts play out in your head. Write some more, then, perhaps, stop.
- Take a shower. I'm not joking, some of our best ideas spring forth when we're just alone and relaxing. Close your eyes once again. Play the parts out in your head, maybe speak some of the dialog outloud so you can hear it.

Lastly, just have fun. Write to your hearts content. Tomorrow begins a new contest, be sure to submit some prompts of your own as well here! The more the merrier! Even if they don't get many or any replies, it will help people in the future to go back in the archives and complete some of the prompts.",,False,,t5_2s3nb,False,,,True,t3_xg6su,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xg6su/daily_prompt_writers_block_an_exercise/,

My heart leapt into my throat. I already knew the fact of his death, of course; it had been my mind’s sole occupant for the three weeks since I awoke to find his cold, still body lying battered and bruised at the bottom of the stairs. But still, it jolted me to think of him sitting at his computer, secure in his room, safely enclosed in my house and supposedly my protection, contemplating his death. My son. My blood. Had he known it was coming? Had he felt it, suspected it? I shook my head. No. These constant questions were encroaching further and further upon my sanity by the day.

“If this message remains unchanged by my age and my father is still the recipient rather than my wife I've yet to meet, then I suppose I died young,” he went on. “You always hear how hard it is for a parent to bury their child, so my heart aches for you. Especially as you don’t have Mum’s strength by your side.” 

I felt my teeth clench in a vain attempt to hold back the sudden swelling of pain that threatened to overwhelm me. Even when faced with the concept of his own death my son was thinking of others. I wondered if he ever really thought of himself, of his own wants and desires. I wondered if he had ever truly lived for himself in his too-short lifetime. My vision blurred and I blinked away the tears to continue reading, leaning in towards the screen as if such an action could bring me even an inch closer to him.

“I know how hard things have been since she died, for both of us, and I know that no matter what harsh words have we have exchanged in these past few years, we still love each other dearly. I know you tried to be strong for me - you were, you must believe me! But you could never see just how strong you truly were. I hope I was strong for you.” 

I nodded away like a marionette as I read, controlled by nothing but the strings of instinctive reaction as I recoiled further inside myself, away from his words that were like daggers in my heart. My son. My lifeline. I could not face his words. I knew I should, but it was all too much. They were too true. I could not be transported to that morning again. Nor that night.

I returned to myself, steeled my resolve, and continued reading. “I know it is futile to say, but please try not to feel guilty.” My stomach plummeted and I almost vomited its acrid, alcohol-soaked contents over the keyboard. I spun the chair around and away from the message to take several deep, calming breaths, focusing intently on the bare walls that were illuminated only by the glow of the screen. At one time they had been alive with posters of musicians and movies, awards for sport and science, photographs of young smiling faces whose laughter echoed through the years. But after his death I could no longer bear to see the life on those walls, so I boxed it all away like I’d tried to box away my pain. 

I took another shuddering breath. Another. Okay, I was ready again. 

“Whatever you may think, you were always my protector. I know that, however I died, you did all you could to prevent it. Please remember that. Thank you for everything, Dad. I love you.” 

It was all too much to bear, and I flailed madly in my attempts turn the screen off, turn the computer off, rip out the cables, destroy it all, do anything to make those words go away. I felt my hand knock the near-empty whisky bottle from the table and turned just in time to see it crack against the floor and spill the last of its dark amber contents. For an instant the cracked bottle became my son, and the whisky shone bright red as it leaked from his head. This time I could not control the convulsing of my stomach, and I stumbled in drunken, teary blindness to the bathroom.

I crouched there with my arms circling the toilet seat in a warped embrace, stomach finally empty, and I wept. I poured out my grief, my guilt, my unforgivable sins. My son. My tiny bundle of joy, my little footballer, my growing student, my grown-up Bachelor of Science. 

Through everything, the thought had never crossed his mind. My son. My innocence. 

In all he wrote, he was definitely right about one thing: I truly did not know my own strength, especially not when my brain was pickled in whisky and my heart was drowned in grief. If I had known my own strength, I would never have lashed out at him. If my brain had not been pickled in whisky, I would have heard and understood the sound of a body tumbling down stairs and not dismissed it as the tantrums of a teenager that he no longer was. If my heart had not been drowned in grief, it would not have been so numb as to let me turn away and go to sleep after all that had happened that night. 

Through everything, it never crossed his mind that my harsh words to him could ever turn into harsh actions against him. He never suspected for one moment that he could have died at the very hands of the person who was supposed to protect him. 

My son. My only son. My torment.

It held in cryogenic slumber 1200 of Earth's best minds and bodies and 200 augmented soldiers to provide security and protection on a new and possibly hostile world. With 120 crew and 100 robotic remotes to provide the muscle, as well as the various vehicles needed, it was hoped that this would be enough to start over and rebuild human civilization. It also held one very unique treasure, a prototype of the next generation of cybernetic augmentation. She was something special.  When the asteroid impacted the doomed planet, her children were already well past Jupiter. Far enough away to to survive the cataclysm.

Not trusting to chance, wisdom dictated each of the crew, scientists and colonists would have a digital copy stored in case of disaster. It was hoped, in vain that they would never be needed.

Depending on what you choose to believe, it was either chance or fate that Dalena was among the 296 survivors of the crash landing on the planet they named Terra. An event that ended the lives of most of Earth's only remaining children.

Dalena's skill in computer programming was all that stood between humanity and a final fall into barbarism. She got the computers back online and inserted the digital duplicates of her friends and ship mates into a virtual reality. They could also interact in the real world via robotic surrogate bodies. With so many resources damaged or destroyed in the crash, it had all seemed hopeless. Now, at least there was a chance.

She woke up, abruptly; a falling dream slammed her from slumber, and she stared uncomfortably at the room before her. A sickly, bloody smell rose through the dark and she covered her nose, gagging when she realized her hand was covered in blood. ""What the-"" She fumbled in her jacket, feeling weights in them, and her slick fingers wrapped around a small flashlight. Metal scraped against metal for a moment and she pulled her hand out of her pocket, staring at her ring finger. Silvery with a small gem in it; couldn't begin to tell what it was in here though.

Her fingers twisted the end, and the LED lit a straight beam of light into the wall next to her. Splatters of dark red trailed off into the shadows, and she turned the light onto herself; no wounds that she could detect, she wasn't in any agony, but when she licked her lips she could only taste blood. Stomach clenching tight, she stood, boots surprisingly stable on the wet floor, and shined the flashlight into the room. It wasn't bright enough to see everything, but it was enough.

Splashes and puddles of the red liquid covered the room, footsteps and handprints colored red leaving frantic marks on the walls and floor, and a piece of paper was stuck to a pillar in the center. She swallowed, ignoring the nausea that threatened to expel her stomach's non-existent contents, and boldly walked up to it. The words were spelled in finger-painted letters, dried to a dark brown.

*GET OUT EVELYN GET OUT OUT OUT GET OUT GET OUT*

Her head hurt, a little; who was Evelyn? She ripped it off the wall, flipping the message over; it was covered in bloody fingerprints. One of the prints had an empty space; a scar, maybe? A chill ran down her spine as she stared at one of her fingers; a depression in it matched the void.

Nervously, her eyes turned upwards with the flashlight. Old, rusty meat hooks were hanging from the ceiling.

She needed to get out. Now.

Cursing under her breath, she fumbled in the dark, searching for anything - a door, a window, a vent - and her hand wrapped around a doorknob. Relief flooded her and she opened it. 

Brilliant white light flooded in, blinding her; wind was chopped by the heavy blades of a helicopter hovering overhead, and before her, hundreds of cops with their guns aimed directly at her. 

""STAND DOWN!"" The voice was shrill for a man's, hoarse and exhausted, and the guns were slowly lowered. A man in SWAT gear came forward, aiming the gun behind her before he turned to her.. 

""Go on, they'll take you to the hospital, Lynn."" She stared at him, confused, but obliged, walking forward. The little flashlight fell out of her hands unheeded as a tall, dark-skinned man ran up to meet her, grasping her arms gingerly.

""Lynn, are you fucking crazy, going after him like that?! That's not your department, you are in *forensics*, you stay in your fucking office!"" She couldn't place his accent; deep, rasping, foreign. She simply stared at him, shell-shocked, and the anger dissipated from his eyes before he hugged her tight. ""I thought I lost you,"" he whispered.

""...w...who are you?"" Her throat hurt, she realized; her words barely audible over the din, he heard them and pulled back.

""Lynn, don't play this game with me. You've probably got brain damage, amnesia, something. You know me."" He cupped her face in his large, warm hands and her lip trembled. She *knew* him, but *dammit,* who was he? ""It's Alexei, Lynn. *Please*.""

""P...please help me."" She dropped her head against his chest, tears trickling down her cheeks. He hugged her tighter and picked her up over his shoulder, carefully, heading towards one of the ambulances waiting on the far side of the swathe of officers. 

---

She woke up, abruptly; this time in an uncomfortable hospital bed. She was clean, though, she could feel it: the dried flakes were gone and she could definitely feel the rough scratches of the loofah still scouring her skin. In the crook of one arm was a soft object and she squeezed it carefully; oh, just a teddy bear. She sighed and rested her head against the pillow, squinting at the TV. News reports of someone called the Painter echoed in her ears, but she couldn't make sense of it.

Her eyes drifted shut, sleep beckoning her not unlike a sickly-sweet temptress, but before she could slip into darkness, the door opened. The man - Alexei - stepped... no, stomped was a better word, she mused. He wasn't a small being and his footsteps were heavy. He sat next to her and grasped her hand in both of his, kissing his fingertips. ""Sweet mother of God, Lynn, I thought I *lost* you to that fucker,"" he mumbled.

""..."" Her heart ached and she wasn't quite sure why. ""Who.... who took me?""

""The Painter."" His voice hardened. A twitch in her brain broke something free - he was a Russian, immigrant; been in the United States since he was a small child but his accent had never faded as a result of trips to see family on a regular basis. ""I... the doctors say you'll remember, eventually. I hope so.""

""Alex-"" He looked up at her, hopeful. ""-who are you to me?"" The crushed look in his eyes spoke everything, and her own heart felt shattered. ""..."" She looked down at her hand in his and recognized, at last, the ring on her finger. It matched the one on his left ring finger. ""... You're my husband. I... I'm s..."" She inhaled, eyes welling up. ""I... Oh god, what happened to me?""

""You were working late and decided to revisit the park crime scene."" He rested his arms on the bed, still holding her hand. ""You  never came home, and we searched for you for a week."" He lifted a hand and brushed her hair out of her face. ""We... You're unharmed,"" he said. ""You don't have a single scratch on you, dammit, and we don't know why.""

""Maybe I'm a fighter?"" She winced, throat hurting again. ""I screamed a lot, I guess; it hurts to talk.""

""The scans say your vocal cords show signs of overuse."" He looked down at her hand. ""We found the note that was in the room. Your... Your fingerprints are all over it."" He closed his eyes. ""We're still not sure what's going on.""

""Who's Evelyn?"" Her free hand found the adjustment panel and elevated the bed, sitting up at last. 

""You. Your full name. I've never called you by it."" He leaned in and kissed her softly on the cheek. ""The Chief wants you to see a psychologist.""

""Oh. Okay."" She blinked. ""... Why would I write a note to myself if I was the only one in the room?""

""That's what we're hoping to find out."" He smiled weakly. Stress lines wrinkled his face, once so familiar but now so strange. ""As long as you're safe, beautiful.""

""I will be, with your ass guarding me."" The words came out simply, and he chuckled.

""That's the Lynn I married."" He kissed her again before leaving his chair. ""I'll be out in the hall. Just shout if you need me.""

""I will."" She smiled at him. That even hurt, somehow. He walked out of the room, and she was left with a TV that was only entertaining itself.

She relaxed against the bed, closing her eyes. There were cracks, she knew it; she just had to tap at them until they came apart. 

She wanted her mind back. As she tried to sleep again, a nurse came in with a package. Already screened it, apparently, she waved with an air of annoyance, and dropped it on the side table before leaving. With a grunt, she grabbed it - damn it was heavy! - and sat it on her lap, picking at the brown paper cautiously. 

Her breath caught in her throat at the sight of the box inside. An old music box adorned with Gaelic letters and Celtic knots sat in her lap, bloodstained just slightly. She swallowed hard and lifted the lid; a twinkling tune began to play, one so familiar.

A folded piece of paper slowly peeked out of the contraption, dulling the music, and she pulled it out and furiously unfolded it. It was a photo of an elderly woman smiling - but red ink marked an X over her face. She turned it over to read the script, and her heart dropped.

""TEN HOURS, EVELYN""

She screamed.

I tried, I swear to God, I did.  I tried jamming pen into paper, but nothing changed.  I scribbled my name in a box labeled, “Petitioner”, but the world didn't shake when I was done.  The bloodstained stuffed bear I found under his empty bottle of Jack Daniels didn't disappear.  Neither did the child's scream in my head, nor the scars on my chest, nor the weights on my lips wrestling any smiles I'd try to let grow on them.

He used his second-to-last breath to stare at me in confusion.

“Why, Jules?” his eyes said.  Mine responded with tears.  My hand grew hot and wet with blood, but I didn't move.  I thought about the white beaches in Hawaii when we were young—before the doctor and  before Kayla.   He always knew the best places to go—where the sunset would look the prettiest, where the drinks were perfect, exactly when to kiss me.  He always knew every little thing.  

He seemed to miss the big ones, though.  Until the call from the doctor.  The call that painted the word “STERILE” in big letters right across his forehead.  Then he only knew the quickest way to open a cheap bottle of whiskey.

God, what am I doing?

He used his last breath to glare at me in anger.

“You're a shitty wife,” I remember him saying last week.  “You've always been a piece of shit wife.”

I covered my face in shame.  He's right.  Kayla was walking proof of that.  Walking, singing, crying proof of my mistake.  Why did she have to be so beautiful?

“You're right, Robert.”  I began to withdraw the knife from his chest.  

“And you're a shit mother, too.”

The knife shot right back—it went as deep as I could get it.

“Not anymore!” I yelled at the corpse.  “Not anymore.”

He died with that glare on his face.  I sobbed by his bed for twenty minutes, yelling at him—at both of us—in my head for getting ourselves into this stupid mess.  Poor Kayla.  I am a shit mother, aren't I?

“Mommy?”  

There she is now.  She walked into our bedroom.  My heart melted at the bruise on her face.  I could clearly see the wedding ring painted in purple on it.  The wedding ring I gave that bastard five years ago.  I handed him the weapon.  

“Did daddy hurt you, mommy?”

“Yes, but he can't anymore, honey.  He's not your daddy anymore.  He never was.”

“His eyes are still looking at me.”

They took over everything. Aliens of course. Luminairs they call themselves but few humans can tell them apart from their own. They forced Lane and his little sister into hiding. As if that wasn’t enough they decided to have their own little civil war. A fucking alien civil war on earth as the humans try to get out of the line of fire. But of course everything comes back to the one day in the compound where the humans were just trying to make it and Spices Lucy’s little kitty got away. The day that Lane followed it into the dungeon where they kept the Luminairs that were too stupid to avoid the desert and either got lost and almost died or learned too much about the compound. Either way the top dogs are too hippie to kill them off so instead Lane has a run in with one. And of course he falls for her. The stupid boy. Years and years of war, between humans and aliens, aliens and aliens and unfortunately humans and humans as well, pass by. Which all lead to the day that Lane gave everything away for the girl from the galaxies and got his clan locked away in a human zoo where everything and anything is fair game and anarchy rules.
	“Double crosser.” The words fall off Lucy’s lips like she had no choice in the matter. But no part of her regrets it. Not the first time she says it, not the second and not when it becomes a steady chant. Nor does she regret it when all of her fellow humans chant it wither her. The dirty double-crosser takes a step back, gripping a tree for balance as Lucy the chant leader takes a step closer. Someone hands her a branch and she doesn’t even pause her incantation as she accepts it. He backs further, one foot staggered weakly behind the other. This time the whole crowd steps forward, with Lucy still in a noticeable lead. She slaps the branch on her callused palm, eyes narrowed and still reciting the accusation.
	“Guys, please,… no…I-I don’t know what I was thinking! I’m sorry! Please you guys you-you’ve got to listen to me!” They step even closer, lots of them picking up stones. 
	“Please you guys!!” But they just keep chanting. He steps back again, this time colliding into another tree. He stumbles back, catches himself and stays in a half crouched position. Just in time for them to step forward. Scared he takes an off balanced step back away from the tree but this time tumbling to the ground. Lucy looks down at him. She lifts her hand and the voices become softer. 
	“Do you remember what we did to the last double-crosser?” she asks. His lips tremble and tears fill his eyes as images of stones pelting a pleading woman fill his head. Before that an old man. Shaking like a rabbit he clasps his hands together and begs:
	“Please! Don’t do this! For God’s sake Lucy, you’re MY SISTER!” Lucy’s lips become a thin straight line. She lifts the branch in her hand over her head and smashes it down on his skull. He crumples.
	“You *despicable*, dirty, lying, **double-crosser!**”She screams as the fellow humans cheer.
	“Please!” the stick crashes down on his head again. Everything spins and he hacks up blood. He struggles to get his arms beneath him and pushes himself up. Lucy screams at him:
	“You *SHUT THE HELL UP LANE!*” They cheer louder when the stick slams into his side and he eats dirt. 
	“Do you even know what you’ve done?!” she snaps. Lane coughs and red blood goes everywhere, a stream of it hangs from the corner of his mouth.
	“You’ve put dozens of people in danger. They’ve lost their homes, they’ve lost their *hope* all because you, a stupid lowlife little SCUMBAG.” She strikes his side again and he rolls onto his stomach. She pelts his back until she’s panting. Lane looks up at his little sister with ide eyes. She brings the branch down on his face and then tosses it aside. Lucy turns to the crowd.
	“He’s all yours.” She says without even looking at any of them, but they cheer anyway as she steps out of the way.
	Lane tucks his head in and stones start to fly at him. The stones nail him for over an hour. His blood stains his clothes and puddles around him. Drops splash against the trees and the plants on the ground. After only ten blows to the head his skull cracks. His legs is shattered and five ribs are broken. Almost all of his nails are torn off; not broken, completely torn off. But none of that really matters.

“The goat fucker? What the fuck are you talking about?” Ray had an incredulous look on his face, as if an alien made entirely of anuses had suddenly appeared in front of him and let out a 43 second long squealer from each orifice that replicated a reasonably flatulent facsimile of Mozart’s requiem.

“You never heard the story of the goat fucker? That old joke? It goes like this. There’s this testy old fucker, outside, complaining, right? He’s standing by this bridge, complaining. His names ‘Hershel’ or some old timey shit like that. Another fucker’s standing there, I guess, and ol’ Hershel’s complaining to him, pointing at shit. ‘See that bridge?’ Hershel says, he says ‘I built that fuckin’ bridge. But do they call me Hershel the Bridge Builder? No!’ and then he points over at this fucking nice building, with all these spires and shit, and he’s like ‘You see that fucking nicely done building over there? I made that shit, too. But do they call me Hershel the Building Maker? No!’ and then Hershel’s gettin’ all pissed right? Rage starts building up, he’s getting real intense and he says ‘But you fuck one goat.’”

Ray started laughing. “For as long as I known you, you are absolutely shit at telling jokes. Yeah I know that one. You do a shit job at telling it, though. What’s the fucking point, Brad?”

“YOU, Ray. YOU are the goat fucker.” Brad got louder, and the toothpick that was resting on his lower lip fell down into his lap. His anger was rising like a kung fu master rising from the ground, preparing to deliver a head exploding uppercut that was sure to paint the room with a thick red sludge.

“I fuck goats, now? I said tell me what the fucking point is, Brad. Seriously.”

“You want me to be serious? You knocked over a fucking game, Ray.”

“Brad, I fucking told you that I didn’t knock that game over.”

“I know you didn’t knock this game over, Ray. I know that, the bosses know that. But the thing is, we’re the only fucking ones that know that. Because unfortunately for you, you have knocked your own game over in the past. Years ago, you saw an opportunity, you got greedy, and you stole from your bosses. You got away with it, too, which was nice. Now those guys you used to work for aren’t around anymore so nobody fucking cares, but you, the dumb shit that you are, you went and told people that you knocked the game over and you all had a nice fucking laugh about it. You dumb shit.”

Ray looked guilty, like a dog that has been caught by its owner with its rear leg raised skyward as it lets a five foot long arc of urine onto a pair of expensive shoes. Ray buried his face in his hands. Brad continued.

“So now, another game of yours gets knocked over, and guess who everbody thinks is responsible for it? You, Ray. See, this is why I bring up the goat fucker,” Brad paused, expecting Ray to interject. Ray remained silent.

“See, suppose another goat gets fucked in the town that this guy who only fucked one goat ever lives in. Everybody’s gonna think that this old pervy fuck is at it again, fucking goats willy nilly. You and the goat fucker live very similar lives, Ray, but yours is infinitely more complicated because of who you work for. Now the bosses problem, which is therefore my problem, is that if they don’t elicit some kind of response to your game getting knocked over, that everybody on the fucking block is gonna think that they’re vulnerable, and they’re gonna want a piece. Games are gonna get knocked over left and fucking right if they don’t do anything about it. So now what everbody is expecting is for you to be made an example of, Ray. We know you didn’t do it, but we’re the only ones who know, and any proof we have of your innocence isn’t gonna be nearly as influential as the word of mouth flying around pegging you as a goat fucker. As far as anybody is concerned, no matter what else they hear, you are fucking goats every night, hard. You pull the goat into the back pantry and you lock the door so no one can see it, but they hear you Ray. They hear you fucking the goat. They hear the canned goods in the pantry banging around because you are going at it so hard that the shelves are knocking up and down, making a racket. And they hear the fucking goat sounds, Ray.”

“Goat sounds? What sound does a goat make? Does it baa like a sheep?”

“I think goats bleat, actually, Ray. But when they’ve got your dick up their ass I imagine that the sounds they make might be something much more disturbing than a bleat,” said Brad, cementing the statement with a serious, accusatory facial expression that included a slightly raised eyebrow.

“I’ve got my dick in its ass? Why am I fucking the goat in its ass? Doesn’t it have supple goat lady bits?”

“No, it’s a guy. All goats are guys, Ray,”

Ray buried his head in hands and started laughing. Once he had composed himself, he kept his head there, bracing himself for the answers to his next questions.

“Okay lets get something straight, Brad. First of all, I am a tender lover, regardless of the species at play. If I’m fucking a goat, I’m fucking it in its goat vagina, and I’m doing it softly. I will bring that goat to fucking paradise, Brad. The goat will bleat softly, almost like a moan.”

Brad nodded appreciatively.

“And furthermore Brad, do you think that all goats are guys and all sheep are girls? Am I understanding you correctly?”

“That’s not true?”

The laugh that came out of Ray was so heavy and so rough that he started coughing. He was right to prepare himself. When he looked up, for a tiny fraction of a second, he saw the gun.

In a person’s final moments, the circumstances of their death with weigh heavily on their perspective when their life supposedly flashes before their eyes. Someone who is drowning, desperate for a breath of air, might take that last second to think about all of the other times in their life that they were desperate, and how that desperation shaped them for the better or for the worse.

She wakes up.  Her eyes are itching from the cat hair, damn allergies.

The window’s open, she looks outside.  It’s another one of those wintry mix days.  Days where the young professionals in their euro-chic dresswear shuffle back and forth across the sidewalk waiting for the bus to take them to their hot shot office job making powerpoints all day.  Days where you have icy cold rain, pelting your window, slowly forming droplet waterfalls  as you try to see pass them and hope that it ices up the road so that school might be closed for the day.

No such luck.

With the willpower of a thousand Spartan soldiers, she pulls herself away from the window, and blindly hovers towards the bathroom even as her bed lustfully beckons for her to come back to sleep.

But she can’t go back to sleep.  She doesn’t get the luxury of hitting the snooze button seven times before waking up because she didn’t sleep at 10pm last night.  And her teachers aren’t nice enough to write her a detention slip if she’s late.  Life ain’t a cake walk these days.

She plugs the drain and turns on the faucet.  The sink fills slowly, groaning as the frozen pipes attempt to shuttle flouridated H 2 O to her tiny apartment sink.

*Splash*

Damn that’s cold.

She tries to see how long she can hold her breath this time.  Maybe she’ll pass out and someone will take her place in this hell hole they call DC.  Or not.  She lifts her head out of the water.

Today’s Day 4 of “learn to communicate with others without completely freaking them out.”

Yeah, Days 1 through 3 were a little rough, but what kind of angsty acne-covered teenager actually enjoys learning?

*Wonder what’s on the menu this morning.*

She walks to intersection, and takes a look at the Dennys across the street.

*Definitely not that.*  

She wonders why, with so many different things to eat in the world, why would people resort to 2 slices of cheap bacon, a piece of day old ham, and some left over egg mix that’s been sitting in the freezer for a couple weeks.

*But hey, it’s their lives I guess.* She shrugs.  

The light changes.  It starts to snow.

A man in a Santa outfit walks past her.  “Good morning miss”.  Even tips his hat.  What a guy.

He walks towards a mother who’s kid clearly could not contain himself.  Squealing for the potential to get his new Red Ryder BB Gun.

He kneels down with a grin, and asks the boy “What do you want for Christmas kiddo?  Have you been good?”  Santa sneaks a glance at mom, who mouths “Yes...”

She follows the conversation as she walks by.

She closes her eyes.

She hears the sing-song chatter between Santa, mother, boy.

This is beautiful.

I’m doing it!

What the hell, really?

I never thought I had it in me, yet here I am. Her lips feel soft, they taste like cheap cherry lip balm yet I like it. Her hair smells good; she probably took a shower not so long ago.  Her skin is perfect; I love her freckles.  This is better than I imagined it. 

I am an asshole. She has a boyfriend and we both know it. Plus the guy is not even a douche, I don’t know him but he seems like the nicest guy on the planet. At least on Facebook. 

But she started all of this, so I guess that makes her the asshole. She knows I have a girlfriend as well, she even knows we are getting married. And she also knows that I love my fiancé more than anything in the world. Also, I am a guy. It’s very difficult for us to say no to a hot girl, that’s their job. Plus it’s not like I am that handsome, I’m not even athletic. To be honest I am surprised she even showed interest in me, I didn't even try (sort of). 

God I wished this kiss lasted forever.

I wonder if I will regret this? 

I certainly didn’t regretted when we started texting each other like the modern people that we are. But she lived in a different city so it didn’t matter. We were friends getting back in touch. I don’t even remember how the conversation drifted towards sex, and I certainly cannot answer how the hell we ended up “sexting”. Which I still think is the stupidest thing you can do with a cellphone. 

All of it, especially this, is fucked up. 

I had a perfect relationship record, I never even held another girl’s hand before. My girlfriend was the most valuable thing I had, now I’ve devaluated her. This is my hiccup, my one imperfection. It’s my red dot on a sweater. I cannot let it grow. 

But how?

Now the kiss is over, it’s time has expired. Now we have an elephant in the room. What do I say? I’ve never been a smooth talker. I want to kiss her again so badly. I want to kiss her neck, her shoulder; I want to have sex with her (who wouldn’t, right?)
I can’t help it. It’s not even a romantic thing, I already have that. It’s that purely feral feeling of having another skin make contact with yours.  I need to say something, this is when I decide if I become the man with the affair or if this just stays as my hiccup. Her eyes are staring at my soul; waiting. I can feel the words about to come out of my mouth, but I don’t know what they’ll be…

Banners in red and silver repeating these 6 words were strewn over the entirety of our school. Two stories that had once been a brown brick color and been torn down and replaced with a pure white marble three story building, with chandeliers, carpeting and classical music. I stumble over my blue silk gown and heels while walking up the gold stairs that lead up to the new school.

 The new government had decided to tear down all public schools and institute larger, more formal regional schools that one had to test into. If you failed, a technical school was selected based on your skills and that was forever your career; all of this was based off how serious you were at age 13. Thanks for not being a screw up, little me!	 


Thinking back, I tried to remember how exactly my entire future now depended on a single entrance exam that no one knew anything about. The United States had been in the midst of a dirty and complicated election. The republicans calling for birth certificates and the democrats calling for tax returns, the general public grew disillusioned with the available candidates. Riots flooded the streets as protests became violent. There was no middle ground, the conservative became more and more conservative and the liberals shifted further left. America was left torn down the middle the exact year my friends and I were graduating. Which brings me to how this ridiculous situation came to be: out of the madness and killings that had swept our divided country came a single candidate who claimed his main focus would be education. His words came out beautifully and he won the election in a landslide. The rest is history. 

""Name,” the security guard asked coldly as he assessed me. 

“Anastasia Romanov.”

 I replied as he typed the name quickly into his handheld device. A hologram popped up and showed my information. Every single yearbook pictures, every single assignment and test grade came up, along with my GPA, resume, and SAT and ACT scores, how the hell did these guys get all this information!? 

“Top 15%, you meet the top 50% requirement. Weapon skills: none. You get a bow and arrow default. Category: A-13. You will stay on the third floor, seventh room on the left. You will have three roommates; check in on ground level room G-18 with the nurse,” the security guard recited as he roughly shoved papers into my hands. 

I just graduated and I’m back in high school. Great.  


I stare down at the red carpet as I walked down the hallway. Don’t trip. Don’t trip. Don’t trip. To say I had coordination problems would be an understatement. Wait! Who’s that? Mid-height, short brown hair and pale skin, crooked tie, with light brown eyes! BORIS! I run as fast as I can across the ridiculously plushy red carpets that lined the hallway. Suddenly I feel my heel get caught in a lose thread, a small imperfection in this stupid carpet. It tugs at my leg and I crash down face first into the carpet. THUMP.  I head a sigh. Peaking up from under my long black hair I see shiny black shoes. 

“I thought maybe with graduation you’d gain some balance,” Boris says wearily. 

“I thought maybe with graduation you’d grow some facial hair!” I retort as I pull myself up from the floor which is now thoroughly stained with the remains of my dignity. 

“That hurts.” He jokingly says. 

I look into his eyes and hug him. 

“It’s so great to see someone I know here! I have to go to the nurse.” I say rushed. 

Boris nods and says casually, “Drew and Myra are in the nurse too.” 

We start walking down the hall searching for other familiar faces as it slowly fills. 

“This is like prom. Everybody is all dressed up. Except no one is happy and everyone looks scared.” I say out loud to Boris.  

“They should be. The government is a real threat now.” “Why are you here? I expected you, Andrew and Alexi to run and hide.” 

“I haven’t seen or hear from Alexi since the election. No one has. I suspect he was caught trying to film the riots and he is in prison. Andrew has too much honor and he expects to figure a way to have a high ranking job now that everything is based on grades. Plus he has unsettled manners with you, succubus. As for me, the best way to destroy a government is from the inside. Which leaves the question…Why are you here?” 

I stop at a mirror to reply my lipstick, the bright red stands out and reminds me of fresh blood. I grimace and look at Boris through the mirror. Men are weak when it comes to seduction. In china, they often sent female assassins to seduce and eliminate male targets. I want to say all of this out loud to Boris but instead I look down at my feet which are wrapped in silver shoes with diamond trimming. His comment about Andrew hurts too. 

“I’m here to graduate.” 

Boris rolls his eyes as he opens the heavy iron door for me to enter the nurses office. 

“Whatever you say…Succubus.”

The herds were thinning, always thinning, and today especially lean.  Quotas must be met, measured in kilo of crop-fed prol.  Stupid prols lapped up taint as though the poison sweetened the grass.  Rancid meat wouldn't save them.  Herds must be culled of taint.  If meat wouldn't fill one quota, it could fill another.

Murdet adjusted the plastic mask to sit the groove worn into his cheekbone.   He tightened worn straps, the plastic stretched from repeated use, and unsheathed the machete.   Pinching the electrolarynx against his corroded voicebox, he spun the volume dial to zero.

""Quota,"" was all the law required him to say.  It didn't stipulate the prol had to hear it. 

The prol stirred in its stall, asleep.  Murdet raised the blade and cleaved into its neck.  The dull edge broke skin and fractured bone.  The prol woke, opened its mouth for what Murdet thought might become a blood curdling scream, and he swung a second time.  That kept it quiet.  Following a third strike the prol ceased flailing. Blood trickled from its mouth, spurted from the neck wound. 

Murdet removed a litmus strip and soaked it in blood.  The fibers turned golden yellow.  The prol had ingested taint, the color told, and doing so poisoned the meat.  He recorded the status in his registry, and then left the stall.

He had entered the barn alone, so raised the machete when he heard scuffling in the adjacent stall.  ""Skag,"" he began, and then remembered to increase the volume.  He announced himself as ""Skag Murdet.""

Someone departed the stall, carrying an armload of cloth wrapped bundles.  They dressed like a skag, wearing a black plastic coat and mask, and a machete on their hip.  Under the layers of shiny and blood spattered plastic hid a man or woman, but Murdet could not tell which.

""Skag Murdoch,"" the skag said through its electrolarynx.  It sized Murdet over.

Murdet, holding a bloodied machete and no meat, held up his registry by way of explanation.

Murdoch offered a bundle.  ""Quota?""  Its electrolarynx resonated an octave higher than his, so Murdet guessed Murdoch to be female. 

Bile rose in Murdet's sternum, acid burbled into his esophagus.   He'd filled his quota for taint.  He needed viable product, not charity. And what was this skag doing culling from an adjacent stall?  He waited until Murdock turned her head and told her, ""'Quota.""  Then he sank the rusty machete into Murdoch's skull.  The blade split through the plastic and into strings of oily blonde hair. Murdet removed his filet knife, cut off the plastic and made haste butchering the loins and haunches.  Momentarily his hand hovered near her torso, wondering how human women might differ from men.  So far the body looked atypical. He clenched his fingers into a fist.  It didn't matter.

Murdet plucked the registry from the skag's pocket, ripped out the last page and scanned the entries.  While the signage appeared foreign, there was a familiarity to the symbols. He opened his own registry and compared her last page with his.   Perhaps she'd taken to following him?  He wasn't sure.  Well, no longer.

Now, what to do with the meat? He cut the legs off her pants and stuffed the meat into the plastic tubes.  The remains he drug into the stall and heaped atop the corpse she'd mangled.   She'd filleted a calf for veal.  Since when did skags cull calves?

He double checked her registry.  New? In the back page he found a folded square of registry sheaves.  Not that new.   He scratched out the mark of taint from his last entry and marked in her estimated weight.  Her kilos, plus however the veal was weighed, might put him back in black.

He stripped the remains of the skag uniform from the corpse.  Again he felt curiosity over its physique, but then dismissed it.

Murdet carried the ripped clothes, boots, and meat out of the barn and set the bundles in his handcart, hers wrapped in dingy white plastic, his wrapped in her plastic pantlegs.  He took hold of the wooden handles and wheeled the cart across the pastureland towards the distant town.

The blight was cold; flakes of gray snow fell through its noxious cloak.  Murdet stopped here and there to pull up a cluster of mushrooms.  This pasture was largely unworked, left to disrepair.  Murdet angled the cart towards a couple prols chipping a furrow.

The prols stooped, leaning on plastic trenchers.  One raised its hand in greeting, the other pushed the hand down.  Both looked emaciated, judging by the way the plastic hung loose around their obliques and stretched across distended stomachs.

Murdet scooped up the mushrooms he'd harvested and tossed them into the rocky furrow.  ""Quota.""

One of the prols picked up a mushroom, lifted its mask, and stuffed it between its lips.  The other prol also took a mushroom, turned it over in its hand, and then tossed it back on the ground.

""Quota,"" Murdet said again.

It shook its head, spit on the mushroom.

""Quota!""

It stretched the plastic to reveal its rib-lined scrawny torso.  Then it held its hand near its mouth and shook its head.  It couldn't speak. Neither could.  They didn't have an electrolarynx, and Murdet had never known a prol whose voicebox survived the blight.  The prol wasn't tainted, tainted prols didn't work, and it refused to eat.  Smart prol.  No point culling untainted and stringy meat.  Not enough kilos.  He took Murdoch's mask and coat from the cart, and tossed them at the prol's feet.

The prol who'd refused to eat picked up the mask and weighed it in its hands.  Its fingers lingered over the electrolarynx.  Then it peeled its mask from its head and donned Murdoch's.  A tuft of brown hair protruded through the split.  It made a noise through the higher-pitched electrolarynx.  ""Aaaagghh.""

Murdet tweaked the octave down one click, and passed the prol Murdoch's machete.  He christened the prol, ""Skag Murdag.""  He handed Murdoch's blank registry to the new skag.  Pointing at the other prol, he said ""Quota.""  Then, he removed a small canister from his pocket and spritzed the other prol's face with musk, a vitamin-infused barbiturate. And, such was all the instruction a new skag needed.

Then he took up the wooden cart arms and continued pushing the load to town.  Closer to town the pastureland bloomed with assorted mushrooms flecked by blighted snow.  Prol calves scampered amidst a herd tending the crop.  Skags circled the field, and whenever someone strayed the herd was quick to recover the delinquent. Murdet found beauty in one such ballet: A prol toted a bucket of mushrooms to a cart where a skag lurked with drawn machete.  The skag followed the prol into the field, and four more prols rushed towards the first, encircled it, and escorted it back to the center.

At the crossroads between field and the few dilapidated buildings compromising the town, Murdet fell into a checkpoint queue.  A skag approached and held out a litmus strip. 

Murdet lowered the cart handles and said, ""Quota.""

The skag didn't respond and continued holding out the strip.  Murdet reached for it but the skag retracted its hand. Then Murdet unfastened his mask, lifted it from his chin, and opened his mouth.  The skag swabbed the fibers and its dirty fingers over his lips.  

It shook the fiber in the air and then held it up to a second skag.  In the past, the strip remained white.  This time the strip showed red.

Whatever the color meant, the skags took Murdet by the arms, relieved him of his machete, and escorted him to a nearby barn.  Inside, four prols surrounded Murdet while the skags went outside and took possession of his meat.  The prols began to strip Murdet, starting with his mask, and then his jacket and boots.  They unbuttoned his single-piece undergarment and rolled it down to his ankles. 

Naked, without a mask, the blighted air burned his nose and throat. The prols spritzed him with musk, and soonafter relaxation unclenched his muscles.  A prol fastened a collar around his neck, tied a cord to it, and led him by the cord to a stall.  There the prol tied the cord to an iron rung on the wooden wall.  At the back of the stall stood a strange looking human whose eyes oozed aggression.

The prol held up a small vial attached to a needle.  It touched an electrolarynx against its throat and its lips moved, but no sound emanated.  Then it jabbed the needle into Murdet's haunch.

Murdet tried to pull away but was held fast by the collar.  The strange human approached, and the prol jerked the lead down and Murdet fell forward to his hands and knees.  He wanted to struggle, to break free, but the musk and the jab made him feel woozy.  Warm.  Tingling. The strange human was behind him now, grunting.

The prol put its hand on Murdet's shoulder, holding him down, and put its other hand between Murdet and the human.  Then the prol rubbed its hand between Murdet's legs, and followed through with a fiery strike straight into his stomach.  The strange human lunged over his back, and the prol held Murdet's lead in a tight fist.  When the strange human ceased moving, it separated and retreated to the back of the stall.

The tension eased on the lead, and the prol stood.  

The prol's electrolarynx emitted a garbled sound, and it patted his rump.  It draped a blanket over his back and guided him to curl up on the hay strewn wooden floor.  It held up the canister of musk and spritzed him in the face.  Soon the ache between his legs dulled and his mind wondered in daydream.

Musk didn't induce sleep, and Murdet struggled to comprehend the world with his groggy senses.  He wasn't sure what happened with the strange human, but the next day he received another needle jab and the prol held him on the ground while the strange human slumped over his back.  He didn't feel as much pain the second time, and afterwards the prol followed the musk with a warm pile of mushroom mash ladled directly on the ground.

After three more days of being chained to the wall and being mounted by the strange human, the prol tested Murdet with a litmus strip.  It showed blue.  The prol untied the cord and led Murdet out of the stall.  It put a prol's shift over Murdet's head, guided his arms through the sleeves, and lowered the fabric over his body.  It held up a register with ten empty circles, pointed to the first, and then touched Murdet's stomach. It said,

This is mostly because I didn't realize there was something to be found, hadn't 24 years of living been enough to know myself? I thought it would be, should be, mostly because the idea of so much as a day more of searching for myself sounds exhausting.

So lets take inventory, an inventory of myself and what I thought I was up until a few minutes ago; I am Jonah B. Gunderson, son of Hanna and Matthew Gunderson, born and raised in Oakland, California to be a humble, honest, and hard working man. I have a girlfriend, her name is Samantha Davies and she is very smart and very pretty and very aware of how powerful a combination that is. We're going to move in together next month because I just got a promotion at the office and can afford a house with backyard because she wants a dog. I hate dogs, I love Samantha. My best friend is Beau Lombardy and we're very different because he's in a band and wears flannel where as I'm a businessman and wear suits. He lives in an apartment with his bandmates, I'm about to live in a house with a backyard with my girlfriend. I go to the bars with my coworkers every Friday after work for casual conversation and drinks. Saturday is date night. Sunday I visit mom and pop. Monday back to work for the week.

See, I had a lot of things figured out. In fact, I thought that was about all there was to life and the only big change left would be when I added kids into that schedule in a few years. It was simple, and I like simple because it makes sense and I can put it into a list and I've always found comfort in a good list.

But then Beau comes over unannounced on a Thursday, which I didn't like because Thursday is when I read and I have a lot of books I've been meaning to get to. But Beau is my best friend, and I love him like a brother or what I think it feels like to love a brother as I'm an only child, so I let him in and smile when he seems excited about something.

 ""Today is the day, Jonesy!"" 

Beau's looking all too pleased with himself and my first thought is that this means I will be needing more than one cup of coffee to be awake enough for work tomorrow.

 ""What's happening today?"" I ask.

 ""I'm popping your cherry! I've decided that I cannot go a day more having a best friend who I haven't dropped with."" 

Beau smiled that contagious smile that had gotten me into trouble a million times before. I can honestly say that every story I have about trouble has started with Beau smiling.

 ""Come on Beau, you know that's not my scene."" I weakly attempted to dissuade him. But I know Beau, and when he gets something in his head it's there and it's there good. It's not that I was a prude or anything, I've just never felt compelled to do much beyond beers at the bar every week. I'll also be the first to admit that I smoked more than my fair share of pot in college, but outside of dorm life I never cared all too much.

 ""You know what, man? No, none of this 'I'm not into it' shit. You are my best friend and goddamit best friends do drugs together! It's in the fuckin' Bible dude, God is telling me to do drugs with you. This is beyond me, orders from upstairs.""

 ""And just where in the Bible does it say that?"" I asked with a laugh. Beau liked to talk out his ass.

 ""Dunno, long book, somewhere around the middle part for sure though."" He said with a shrug. It was ridiculous, but I'd always liked how he could think like that. He was like a little kid in his mind sometimes still. I was jealous of that, he never had to do things like take aspirin because working through his personal finances never gave him headaches. But, now that I think about it he's probably never even used the phrase personal finances.

 ""I don't think so Beau, I know about acid and that sounds too intense for me. Pot was enough to mess with my head.""

 ""Listen Jonah,"" Beau flopped himself onto my couch and I knew I was in for a doozy.

 ""Jonah, I love you. Which is why I'm going to be honest; you need to loosen the hell up! I cut you some slack for a while because I know how much the promotion meant to you especially with that stuff with Samantha. I respected it, I let you skip out on hanging more and more because you had to put in extra time. But now that you've got that promotion, it's time to undue the tie and loosen up for a bit! Lets celebrate that promotion you worked your ass off for!""

He rounded off his little speech with his pouty puppy dog face that I'm ashamed to say works as well on me as it does the girls who fawn over his band. I sighed and looked at him for a moment; he was right, I had been blowing him off and he had been a good sport about it. This would make him happy, I owed it him for being supportive.

 ""You just had to come on a Thursday, didn't you?"" I asked with a smile and Beau smiled back right away.

 ""Good on you, man!"" 

He reached over a clapped me on the shoulder with one hand while reaching into the inside pocket of his beat up blazer with the other, pulling out a small plastic baggy with two small white strips in it. He carefully fished one out and I extended my open palm for him to place it. It was weightless and I thought it was strange that something so minuscule had such a reputation.

 ""Just put it on your tongue, the first order from your guide through the night,"" I watched Beau gingerly place his strip on his tongue before looking at me expectantly. I did the same. It was bitter.

 ""Now what?"" I asked.

 ""Now, we wait.""

Beau and I talked for a while, he asked me if Samantha and I had settled on a house yet and I asked when his next gig was because I promised I'd go to one after I'd gotten the promotion. Halfway through explaining about Samantha's hangup between a house with a bigger yard but only one bathroom or a medium size one with 2.5 bathrooms when I noticed that I was no longer in my living room but somewhere outside.

 ""Ummm... Beau?"" I asked quietly, startled by this sudden change.

 ""Yeah dude?"" Beau's voice was watery, but I could still see him on the couch next to me so I felt safe.

   ""Are you where I am?""

   ""Yeah man, I'm totally there."" 

Beau started laughing and it was melodic, like he was singing one of his songs instead of just laughing. It made me laugh too and I let myself sink deeper into the couch as I watched the world warping around me.

The world stopped moving when the ground was white and rocky, like the hardened clumps of baking soda that stick out in batter. The next thing I noticed was the stars, good God the stars! Never had I seen anything like it, like there was no artificial light to pollute the skies, just stars and God in heaven.

   ""It's beautiful,"" I whispered, almost stunned into silence but being too moved to not speak all at once. I waited, watching, expecting to hear Beau make some sort of sound in agreement. I heard nothing and looked over to find myself alone. Weirdly enough, this didn't bother me. Nor did I feel compelled to move, to seek anything or anyone out, I'd probably just get lost in this place as it is.

And that's when I started to think, really think. I mean, I've thought a lot in my life and I'm what a lot of people would call a smart guy. But I've never thought like this, about myself and the world and life and what the hell am I doing here and why am I doing it and who am I doing it for and is there a point to doing it and why and why and who and what and where and why and how and how and how and who am I?

That last one stopped the racing of words through my mind. Who am I?

   ""I'm an alien."" I whispered to myself before breaking out into laughter, laughter like I used to get when I was stoned with my college friends. I couldn't stop.

   ""I'm am alien!"" I shouted, lifting my arms into the air as if I'd just won a race.
So there I was, an alien. I was definitely that, because I was in a place I'm definitely not from. An stranger in a strange land.

And that's when the thinking got weird again. I'm an alien here, because I'm in a strange land. So, what am I in a familiar land? Back on Earth? Back at home?

   ""I'm... an... alien?"" I said it aloud without the realizing I was speaking or even thinking those words, but they hit me like a truth that had been fighting to be fast enough to finally catch up with me for a long, long time.

 ""I am an alien."" I said it more surely this time, I liked how it felt in my mouth and I liked how it tasted on my tongue.

   ""I am a fucking alien!""

And it was true! I am a fucking alien! Think about it, think about the rest of the people in my life. Beau, Beau's such a force of nature. He's outgoing, creative, parties, all the things I made myself believe I couldn't be without sacrificing success and he's doing just fine! Hell he's got a certain joy that even I don't have when I'm with Samantha.

Samantha, she's got tons of friends and not just from work. She goes out even if she has to work in the morning but she smiles sweetly at me every time I tell her to go ahead without me. She's out there having fun, working hard but having a lot of fun.

Hell, even my parents go out! They've got their country club friends they're always out for cocktail lunches with. My coworkers too, some of them go out for drinks at lunch. They also have other friends to drink with or more nights than Friday.

I am an alien, because everyone else prioritizes differently than me and everyone else has more fun than me because everyone else has figured out that you can still have a lot of play and work hard and oh God I'm boring.
 
   ""Shit."" A voice cut through my thoughts and in a blink I was back in my living room with Beau's sitting next to me and staring away.

   ""What?"" I asked.

   ""You just said a lot of shit. Don't worry about being boring dude, that's just the drugs talking.""

   ""Fuck, did I say that all aloud?""

   ""It happens, acid makes you find yourself like that."" He smiled at me again before leaning back and I do the same.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1376691540.0,flairPI,,True,t3_1kihwf,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1kihwf/pi_24i_find_myself/,

I'm sitting in Harry's lounge, which is quite nice. It's a bit dusty, though, and it's distracting. He's just looking off, past me. I turn my head, follow his gaze. The dust is caught in a sunbeam. He's watching dust caught in a sunbeam.

There's a chirping sound, something sharp in the air. Harry grimaces, still looking over my shoulder into the sunbeam. I tap him on the shoulder, and his eyes meet mine.

“What was that?” I say.

“There's a bird in my house. Has been for a few days.” Harry takes a sip of his coffee, which is probably cold by now. “It's hell, keeping me up at night. I haven't slept for a week.”

I nod. “You sure it's not the battery on the smoke alarm?”

Harry nods back. “Checked the battery. Carbon monoxide too. It's a bird.”

“Why don't we go find this bird?” I say, making to stand.

“Don't think I haven't tried,” says Harry, still sitting in his armchair. “I think it's stuck in the wall.”

I've risen. “We can have a look around. It can't hurt.”

“Speak for yourself.”

Harry gets up, and I can see it's not easy. In the two weeks since Celia passed, he's been hurting, inside and outside. He looks brittle as he stands, and half-shuffles past me out of the lounge.

“You know, Rae'll do a house-call for you,” I say. “He's a friend, and he's a smart guy too.”

“I don't need a doctor, Rog, I just need a good night's sleep. I haven't gotten a wink since this damn bird got in.” Harry walks into the kitchen, and I follow. He turns on the light, and I look in the cupboards, even though the bird's obviously not in the kitchen. They're almost empty.

“Hey,” I say.

“Mhmm?”

“When's the last time you went shopping, Harry?”

“I got a food order in last week. From that grocery service.”

“I see.” I peek in his fridge. “You want me to take you shopping tomorrow, or something?”

“Aw, come on. I don't need you to take me anywhere, like I'm some old man. You're a year older than me – I should be chauffeuring you.”

“But you acknowledge that you need to get some food in your house, right?” I close the fridge. Harry's walking towards the stairs.

“In principle, yes. I'll make a food order tonight, all right?”

“Just get some food into the house,” I say.

We check his bathroom upstairs, his bedroom, the laundry room. They're unorganized as a whole. The bedroom looks nearly untouched, and the bathroom is a mess. The laundry room is empty of laundry.

I go to open the study door, and he stops me. I look up and our eyes meet. He purses his lips, and shakes his head.

“We have to check,” I say.

“We don't,” he says, “and we won't.”

I sigh. “That's obviously where the bird is.”

Sure enough, as soon as I say it, there's a chirp from behind the door. I look at him, expecting recognition, but it's like he doesn't see me. He's just staring at the door.

“Look, birds... it'll fly out pretty soon, probably,” I say.

He doesn't react.

“Let's just go back downstairs. Come on.” I turn my head to make sure Harry follows me, and he does.

We're back in the lounge. I reheated the coffee, and Harry's sipping at his again. The sun's gone most of the way down, and the dust motes are caught in its beams once again. I'm tempted to draw the curtains.

I glance at my watch. The bird chirps again. “Harry, I -”

“You know, I loved her,” he says.

“I know.”

“Well, yeah, you know, but you don't. I'd wake up every morning, and even before I opened my eyes, I knew I was the luckiest man in the world. I'd hold her close, and I didn't let go until I was good and ready. It didn't matter what happened that day. I had my love to keep me warm. She was the most wonderful woman in the world, and I was just blessed to be with her for as long as I was. Truly blessed.”

He has to take a breath, it comes out ragged.

“I don't know if she ever loved me, because how can you really know that about another person, but Roger, I loved her with all of my heart. I loved cooking with her, laughing with her, just being with her made me light up. Everything used to be so bright. Her eyes used to shine, like emeralds.”

He takes another deep breath, then:

“I miss her, is all.”

We sit in silence, the dust motes moving in the slowly setting sun. The bird chirps.

“Harry, when's the last time you checked your PO box?” I say.

He waves his hand. “I dunno...”

“Why not head out and check it? Maybe you got a bill? Maybe a letter?”

He shakes his head, begins to protest.

“Harry, come on. What if they shut the hydro off? Just go and make sure.”

“Fine,” he says. He gets up, goes to put on his jacket.

The bird chirps. I grimace, Harry does too.

“Besides, maybe some fresh air will do you good.”

“Maybe,” he says. He puts on a cap, and opens the door.

“I'll hold down the fort while you're gone,” I say.

He gives me a weird look, and he's out the door.

I stand, and wait. After a few seconds the bird chirps again.

I head up the stairs, pass the bedroom, the bathroom, the laundry room.

I stop at the study door. Hand on the doorknob. The fucking bird chirps again. I turn it. It opens, and I walk in.

I see the bird immediately. It's a big sparrow, angry looking. Pressed against the window, trying to get out. I walk up behind it, pull the latch, and open the window. There's a breeze, and the curtains fly up. The bird makes a hasty escape. I close the window, and turn to survey the room.

It's not so big. It's got a big window, and the desk is big, but the room is small. Nice carpet, and the curtains are all right too. There's a picture of Celia with Harry on the wall - Harry's taken all the others down. I take it all in, trying to put off noticing that there's a letter on the desk.

It's written in pen, and it's on a single sheet of loose leaf. I stare for a bit, dizzy. I pull the chair out, sit down, and read the letter.

This is what it says.

&gt; Harry,

&gt; I hope you're happy. Because this is your fault.

&gt; I know why this happened. It's because you wanted to watch me die. You used me, you used me and you couldn't stop, and you used me right up, Harry. I hope you're happy. You're a fucking user and you always will be.

&gt; I don't know how you ignored my pain, the agony in my mind. I don't know how you were able to sleep at night with me in so much pain. You must have enjoyed it. You must have. Enjoyed my suffering. You sick man. I don't know how I ever loved you.

&gt; I hate you. I really do. I want you to know that there has never been a moment on this earth where I have not hated you. When you stole me from my life, kept me here, used me, watched me die, made me poison myself so you could use me just a bit longer. I hated every minute of our time together.

&gt; I hate you I hate you I HATE YOU.

&gt; You deserve this more than I do. I don't deserve this pain. So I'm going, you get to keep all this pain. I hope you hate it as much as I hate you. Goodbye.

&gt; You don't deserve the love you stole from me.

That's what it said.

I take the letter. I read it again. And again. I walk out of the study, and slam the door. I walk past the laundry room, and the bathroom, and the bedroom, down the stairs. I walk into the kitchen. I turn the stove fan on, and I put the burner on high. The blue flame flickers to life.

I hold a corner of the letter over the flames, and it catches. I toss the letter into the empty sink, and watch it burn, hear it hiss. The smoke winds upwards, into the fan. I run the water for a bit, wash the ashes down the drain. I turn off the stove, and the fan. Walking back to the lounge, I turn on the record player. Nat King Cole sings in Spanish. I sit in Harry's armchair, and watch the dust motes dance in the last sliver of dusk.

A few minutes later, Harry walks in with a few envelopes in his hand.

“I did have bills. Is this Nat King Cole?” he says.

“Hello to you too,” I say. I smile. He smiles.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1376586413.0,,,True,t3_1keauq,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1keauq/pi_are_changin_august_contest/,

I was having a bad day today and needed to relieve some stress.  I turned on some music on Pandora, went to [Creativewritingprompts.com](http://www.creativewritingpromtps.com), and picked a random number.  This is what I came up with.  

&gt; CHAPTER 1- A MOMENT OF FAILURE
&gt; 
&gt; 	A minute of failure is all it takes.  A moment of failure.  A second.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	That's all it can take to destroy everything that matters to someone.
&gt; 
&gt; 	A second of failure to look at the road, if only to press the second preset number on the radio because that awful bubblegum pop song just won't stop playing.
&gt; 	I heard the scraping of the metal and screeching tires for only a split second before we lost control and entered zero gravity.  As we rolled, the world went silent.  That pop song was my daughter's favorite song. I was fighting with my wife, Bethany, and didn't want to hear that damned song again, even though our daughter Lacie was begging me not to change the station.  Our wheels made contact again after a complete rotation, but we didn't stop. Zero gravity again.  Slow motion again.  The roll cage buckled to the left of my head, and I was forced by instinct to turn my head right.  I saw Bethany leave me.  She still had her seatbelt on, and was still in the car, but her neck turned a way it shouldn't have.  She was gone because I didn't want to listen to that damned song.  
&gt; 	On the third, or maybe fourth, roll, my head rolled backwards to face Lacie.  I didn't witness her leaving because it had already happened.  Her eyes rolled with her head, not looking at anything in particular.  Her mouth was agape, but not with awe or suprise.  The muscles had relaxed because there was no nerve control.  My beautiful, brilliant, blonde-haired blue-eyed daughter was gone before we entered the third roll.
&gt; 
&gt; 	A moment of failure, a minute of neglect, a second of being a bad parent is all it took to lose all that mattered to me.  
&gt; 
&gt; CHAPTER 2- A LIFETIME OF REGRET
&gt; 	The doctors at the hospital said I had swerved in to another lane, hitting a small sedan with the rear passenger tire.  What had happened was similar to the P.I.T meaneuver that police use to take down wreckless drivers during high speed chases, except the roles were reversed.  The back end of the SUV—the one I bought because I would be able to fit my golf equipment in the back with ease—fishtailed and the center of gravity was thrown off while going 80 miles an hour, forcing us to roll six times before landing next to the median.  
&gt; 	My left leg had been broken, and two of my left ribs were fractured as well.  It hurt to breathe.  It hurt to breathe physically, and it hurt to breathe because I didn't want to.  I should be gone along with them.

--------


It was my family who suggested I come out here. They kept insisting I 'take a vacation, to visit somewhere!', causally bringing up my Aunt's unused double wide in Butt Fuck, Wisconsin.

I sat in a lawn chair, in front of the dying coals in the pit. Beer cans don't burn so good,  I guess. Above me the stars ground silently through their wheels. Dawn was a few hours off, if the cooler was still full by then I'd have a great view of it over the lake.

My family was good to me. When I got out they didn't give two shits where I'd been, they were just glad to have me back. I was glad to be back. I helped my old man with the cars, watched football with my mother. Saw my sister once in a while. She was doing good, well on her way to a good job, adoring husband, and church once or twice a month. I wasn't the first to serve time in my family. First in a while, but I had something to talk about with my older relatives. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful as hell for their support. But in the nine months since, the novelty has worn off. It's just not a good fit. Ma treats me like a time bomb half the time, and the second coming the other. Like it was only a week ago I crushed the SAT and everything was looking up. My dad treats me like a kid, not a 25 year old ex con. I know they do it out of love, but still.

Whatever, I can handle it. 

I used to go out into the old neighborhood, bitter fall air and leaves being pushed along the streets. I didn't recognize half the businesses. I'd wander lost down unknown side streets only to realize my friends and I hung out there in high school.

Didn't see any of them, speakin' of. Or anyone I knew. I'd gotten word on a who had died, the rest had just disappeared. Well, Oscar was still working a register at McDonalds. He didn't recognize me and I didn't bother. The corner boys and bar flys were new to me. Just kids trying their best to be a bad ass and failing terribly, like I used to be.

Well, I swore that wouldn't be me. No matter what it takes I was gonna be the 1% who got past being an ex con. I didn't know exactly what that meant back then, but I'd do it anyway. I survived the big house, the real world ain't shit.

Somewhere a bird flew through the treetops. I decided it was a hawk when I caught a glimpse of it. I watched it glide through currents, seemingly motionless against the stars.

There were so many stars out here. Still shocked my city boy sensibilities every time I saw that. The woods were so dark, so quiet at night I had to imagine this was the world before man. Endless wilderness and dark, all life hiding to survive whether by eating or not being eaten. I just sat and smoked and drank for a little.

Mary was gone. I knew that four months into my sentence, but we pretended for another seven. Saw the marriage announcement in the paper about a month after I got home. I knew the guy too. He had kids older than her. They had just been waiting for his divorce to finalize. And just like that class valedictorian failed. She had done the one thing we swore never to do, she gave up. Lot of fucking good ""No retreat, no surrender"" did in the face of cold beds, a pill addiction and a broken home.

But listen to me decide who wins and loses. No friends, no place of my own, no plan, no steady job and one strike out of three. Oh yeah, I never really managed to get my life in order, piss and vinegar oaths of redemption be damned. 

I figured the polite thing to do was to call and offer congratulations, but I had nothing to say. I didn't wish her well or ill, or wish I'd done anything different. She's a married fuck up, I'm a convicted fuck up, Andrew Johnson was president after Lincoln, what's your fucking point? It don't matter to me now.

That's the crux of it really. I have no plans because nothing excites me. It all just is. I don't improve my standing because whatever comes, I can take it no sweat. Whatever.

The fire was out now and I'm pretty sure I missed half the cans I chucked in. I didn't like leaning my head back to look at the stars, so I didn't.

I kinda miss the guys I did time with. Assholes the lot of 'em, but spend five years inside with a guy and he knows you better than anyone ever will. I'd buy some of them a beer if I ran into them.

I don't think prison ever really leaves you, man. I know I ain't even thirty but it feels the same way it did when the doc told me shoulder would never again be one hundred percent.

It's the hitch between the shoulder blades, in the eyes. The Don't Ever Show Weakness reflex. Like dealing with a wild animal, except all the time. Some people are basically the same as, anyway.

You ever seen a guy who's kicked the H? It's like that. They function fine but watch them for a few minutes, look in their eyes. They ain't there and they ain't whole. They're just drifting through a dream. You lose a part of your soul. It's worse on the young, I think. You're a kid one day, walking into a gas station with a shotgun and enough perc in your system to not feel it when you get plugged in the back, but still planning to take your date to the movies tomorrow. Next day your only concerns are fighting hard enough to not end up dead or somebody's bitch. Then six years of that are over and you're back, an old man of 24 expected to play nice with the world. No one gives a shit what made you who you are, but you better change right quick. Not that they'll ever see past those three lines on your record.

I plunged my hand into the cooler but it was empty. I sat and smoked in the dark for a while, thinking about not going back. I could just hop in the car and drive off, to start over. Sixteen year old me would love that. But you can't out run your past. Also I had no money and a Dodge that wouldn't make it half way to the Rockies. So I stumbled toward the couch, praying I wouldn't be back in prison for the next six hours.",Prompt Inspired,False,,t5_2s3nb,1376115574.0,,,True,t3_1k2s5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1k2s5l/pi_home_coming/,

*Dear Michael,*

*This letter is to inform you a few facts about your late father, Quentin Trimmer. This letter was written pre-emptively before your father's death. This letter tells you the truth.*

*Son, there are several things that you need to know about your father. First of all, I'm not a spy, I probably died however people said I died, so don't worry that I was actually assassinated by the Mafia or any other such nonsense.*

*Actually, what this letter concerns is my will. You see, there is a few elements left out in the copy that you have probably read.*

*In the old copy, as far as I can remember, it said something along the lines of which my assets were spread equally amongst my close relatives, such as your mother, brothers, and sister. Other items of emotional and sentimental value were distributed as seen fit.*

*There are some issues with this, and you may probably agree with me.*

*1. My actual estate is far greater than what is listed in the will that you received.*

*2. Your siblings and mother are good for nothing. I was aware for a long time that your siblings were straying to a worse side of life, probably taking after their mother. I'm aware that this caused you grief while I was alive, as I continued to let them live in my household and providing them with food and shelter, both of which they were ungrateful for.*

*I know you disliked me for keeping them under my roof, and for good reasons. But, I have a reason for it all. I just wanted to make sure, till the very last moment, that they could change. Because you are reading this, apparently,that did not happen.*

*I, Quentin Trimmer, in a clear state of mind and of my own will, declare this to by my Last Will and Testament, and revoke all other wills and codicils previously made by me.*

*I declare my lawyer, Joshua Sanders, to be my personal representative to administer this will, and ask that he be permitted to serve without Court supervision and without posting bond.*

*I give the entirety of my estate, including:*

* *My multiple bank accounts, totalling in value at twelve (12) million dollars*
* *My stocks and shares in Google, IBM, Coca Cola, Microsoft, and Apple, netting at the moment of writing over twenty (20) million dollars*

* *My property at 604 Cutter's Way, Gilbert, Arizona*

* *My property at 64 Linden Ave, Swansea, Wales*

* *My business and engineering shop in Chicago, Illinois*

*To my son, Michael Trimmer.*

*None of my estate will be given to anyone else under any other circumstance.*

*The full copy of my Last Will and Testament is in the possession of my lawyer, Joshua Sanders, to be enacted upon the delivery of this letter.*

*Michael, go to Joshua, and ask him about the true will. When you do, then he may act and you'll collect my estate. I ask that you try to keep this secret for as long as possible, because it is entirely likely that your family members will try and sue for possession, thankfully made impossible by Joshua.*

*Live a happy life,*

*Signed,*

*Quentin Trimmers.*

First time on this subreddit.

I Found it very interesting writing this story. I wanted to just try something different. I usually do stories using two word prompts (have a whole blog dedicated to it) and so I took this on as Death Switch.

Content writers might post from this sub would be ideal in helping Voice Actors like myself practice narrating, and the writer would get to hear their work read out loud by an actual voice actor!
