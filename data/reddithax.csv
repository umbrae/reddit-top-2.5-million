This makes everyone subscribe and replaces the unsubscribe button with an unclickable subscribe one to fool users into thinking they are still unsubscribed:

	    position: fixed;
	    top: 0;

This does the opposite; it makes everyone unsubscribe (someone might want to use this if they infiltrate a subreddit by becoming a mod and want to remove subscribers) and fools users into thinking they are still subscribed with that fake subscribe button from the last example:

	    z-index: 1000;
    }

    /* non-clickable remove from frontpage button to keep users thinking
       that they are still subscribed */

    .option.add.active {

I've written up some details on how you can black out your subreddits on April 22nd. The result will be something like /r/sircmpwn.

Follow these steps:

1. Back up your subreddit sidebar and CSS.
2. Edit your subreddit settings. Change the page title to ""Subreddit Unavailable"" and change the sidebar text to [this](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/a4c3667690e85dd18876/raw/0bcf9514f4cae0ec1001fde717b1d3d6d4916c10/gistfile1.txt). Also, disallow submissions from non-approved submitters (set your subreddit to ""restricted"").
3. Upload [this image](http://i.imgur.com/6szrjUL.png) to your stylesheet. Call it ""alien"".
4. Replace your CSS with [this](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/235cc8899c01d4ef0069/raw/565ec0edb505cc947968c06fe0d779da20dfe4ef/gistfile1.txt).

And you're done! Thanks for helping to stop this dangerous bill.

To reset your subreddit, you can go directly to the stylesheet page (http\://reddit.com/r/&lt;your subreddit&gt;/about/stylesheet) to replace your old CSS, and then to your settings from the link in the sidebar to replace your custom sidebar text.

The admins have now fixed it so that preference pages under a subreddit redirect to the main preference page.

Goto [r/chemistry](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/) to see what I did. Everyone's name in the comments and for the byline in submissions has a unique color based on the first character of their name.

* [Random quotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/DEADB33F) [[stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/DEADB33F/stylesheet.css)] ('quotes' are displayed in the top right)   
* [Random images](http://www.reddit.com/r/Extras) [[stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/Extras/stylesheet.css)] (images are displayed in the header)


###See the stylesheet links for the code.###

...[Putting it all together](http://www.reddit.com/r/stunts/)

How it works:

1. Make a ':before' or ':after' pseudo-element using the logout button, position &amp; size it where you want it.
2. Make another :before/after pseudo-element using a non-clickable element and position it so it covers the first one.
3. Check the first character of the hidden modhash input element, style our first pseudo-element with text/image based on the character's value.

Step three is repeated 36 times, to cover all the characters 0-9, a-z.  
This means you can have up to 36 random images/text strings.

Step two is purely to stop the pseudo-element being clickable. As it's an extension of the logout button normally you'd be able to click it. This isn't desirable.

In theory you could have almost unlimited images/strings by comparing more than just the first character of the modhash. Doing this would give you up to 50^36 random images, which is a lot.

The last example /r/stunts adds both a :before and :after pseudo element to the logout button, one is styled based on the first character of the modhash, the other is styled based on the last character, giving us a random images and text on the same page which are unrelated to each other.

The header on the page also has a background image, this acts as a fallback and is used for browsers which don't support pseudo-elements and for logged out users who won't have a modhash value.",,False,,t5_2qtkl,True,,,True,t3_pfj5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax/comments/pfj5f/how_to_display_random_quotesimages_which_change/,

It basically only prevents insta-downvoting, where idiots downvote everything on the new page in a misguided attempt to give their own submission more traction.

It's a small bit of CSS I made for a couple of subs I run which had problems with people mass downvoting new submissions. It disables downvoting for all submissions with less than three total votes (total votes not total score).

Hopefully someone else might also find it useful....

I've been experimenting with the idea of applying this script to a subreddit.

The basic idea is that [my ROBOT9000 user](/user/ROBOT9000) would be added as moderator to a subreddit, and would then watch incoming comments for duplication of past comments. It would then punish any such duplications. As in the original implementation, each new offense raises the penalty level for the next offense exponentially, but the level also decays exponentially over time.

The devil's in the details:

* How to penalize? A single downvote doesn't seem like a sufficient penalty. Removal hides the comment, but also trains the spamfilter. Temporary bans are also a possibility.
* Should users be notified of being penalized?
* Should ""duplication"" mean per-page, per-subreddit, or across all modded subreddits?
* On a more technical note, how can the bot receive all new comments?

Here's my initial proposal:

* A first-level offense gets a downvote.
* A second-level offense gets a downvote and a PM.
* A third-level offense gets a removal.
* A fourth-level offense (or higher) gets a temporary ban of increasing length.

Alternatively:

* As a first offense, users are banned for 5 minutes, and then unbanned.
* Ban times double per offense, and halve every 12 hours.

First things first, it's not actually text, it's an image. So you need to make yourself a 504x104 image with your text (tlc.png in the code below). After that the CSS is straightforward, just set it as a background image for the textarea that disappears on :focus. In /r/AskHistorians, we only show the text for top-level comments, like so:

    .commentarea&gt;.usertext textarea {
        background-image: url(%%tlc%%);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
    .commentarea&gt;.usertext textarea:focus {
        background-position: 0 -104px;
    }

To put it in every reply box, use this:

    .commentarea .usertext textarea {
        background-image: url(%%tlc%%);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
    .commentarea .usertext textarea:focus {
        background-position: 0 -104px;
    }

Note: this isn't a very accessible solution. People who aren't seeing your subreddit CSS, or access reddit with a text-only browser or a screenreader aren't going to see that text. So don't put anything there that's not repeated elsewhere. It's also a bit glitchy, because the text will reappear when people remove focus from the textbox even if they typed something in it (there's no way around that as far as I can see).

I was inspired by, and pretty much based this on, the sports logos going up in /r/soccer, /r/hockey, and /r/baseball. Though I had to change a few things to make it work like I wanted.

Basically, the script can assign a tag of my choosing to a specific user, to show up next to their name whenever they post. It does require a CSS edit for each user and/or tag I want to add. 

By way of explanation, in /r/exmormon, we have one group of very clearly defined enemies... anyone who defends mormonism. I've picked out the ""TBMs"", or True Believing Mormons, that I know of on reddit, and labelled them as such for when they post in my reddit.   I have no interest in censoring or banning the users, but I think it may be of some value to my exmormon readers to know automatically when they encounter a TBM.

It serves two goals:

* Show the modqueue in the chat
  * Also allows users to approve, spam, or remove links
* Run polls to gather input from multiple moderators

Here's an example chat log:

* /r/minecraft
* /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu (yeah, who cares)
* /r/awwnime
* and many, many, many more

Anyway, here's how you do it wrong (taken from /r/awwnime):

    a[href=""/pleased""] {
      width: 142px;
      height: 80px;
      background-image: url(%%pleased%%);
    }

Why is this wrong? Well, because it uses `/url`. What it should be doing is `#url`. Here's how it should look:

    a[href=""#pleased""] {
      width: 142px;
      height: 80px;
      background-image: url(%%pleased%%);
    }

This is better because anchor links like this **don't leave the page when clicked**. All the subreddits listed above will **take you to a 404 page when clicked**.

You should also add this:

    cursor: default;

Which will remove the hand pointer when you hover over the images.

By using the CSS3 :target pseudo-class you can add conditional styles to any element with an id, which are shown when the element's id is after # in the url.

On reddit, various id'd elements can be hijacked to change different elements on the page when they are targeted, using sibling and child selectors, allowing pages to be styled differently based on the url.

For example, links containing certain strings can be highlighted using #siteTable:target a[href\*='string'].

We're coming up on 15 thousand users and I want to whore up the stylesheet for the occasion. Two big changes are planned:

1. A baby interrogator from *Brazil* positioned at the bottom of the screen

2. Twelve different ""submit link"" buttons, with eleven of them linking to pictures of destroyed bridges overlayed by the words ""PRIDE"" and ""FIDELITY"" in block letters. All are lined up as they would normally be, with the actual link hidden amongst them. 

[**In picture form**](http://i.imgur.com/ufT2A.png)

The problems I'm facing are thus:

- I've no idea how to edit the submit link button, hide the ""create a new community"" button underneath, and add multiple new images to the sidebar which look exactly like the submit link button. 

- I can't figure out how to make only one baby interrogator positioned directly in the centre. Here's the CSS for that:
    
    #header-bottom-right::after {
        background: url(http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/aXhP7Qk5yPNT1rBE.png) left top repeat-x;

Preview : **/r/stage_mindashq**


Details are in the [wiki](/r/mindashq/wiki) - some parts still to be detailed out, and here are some Salient Features in short

+  **Distinct header** to make the top look sleek and light. The local subreddit name is seen very prominent for easy identification and is easily click-able with large area.
+  **Compact links and comments** to utilize space better, esp the bottom area for deeply nested comments.
+  Readability improvements.
+  **100% text-only** theme, no images required for the standard theme.
+  **Modular CSS** for controlled and easy to manage changes with opt-in modules (custom css code) and images as needed - working 7 modules based on common reddit tricks
+  All areas (moderator, and user pages, wiki-pages, submit link pages etc) treated well. suitable for use with stylish, or stylebot across reddits.
+  [RES compatible](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) (top bar, never ending reddit, night-mode, notifications et al).

there are a bunch of dummy posts, do preview the comments area and see the super compact comments!!

Would be glad to have your views, feedback and thoughts.

It's a CLI tool for manipulating subreddits. It's still pretty young, but I have two working utilities: reset and duplicate. The former allows you to reset your subreddit to the default settings and styles. The latter can copy any subreddit's style and settings into yours.

Say I want to reset /r/sircmpwn to default settings:

    srutil reset /r/sircmpwn all

This would reset all settings, styles, and the like on /r/sircmpwn. I can also make it fine grained, only resetting certain things:

    srutil reset /r/sircmpwn css,images,settings,sidebar,flair

If I wanted to copy /r/reddithax into /r/sircmpwn, I could get all the styles and settings and such like this:

    srutil dupe /r/reddithax /r/sircmpwn

You can get the code [here](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/srutils). The readme there describes how to use the tool, and has a link to binaries if you don't feel like compiling it yourself. Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

What do you guys think? What other things could I add? I'm thinking of a backup/restore tool that creates a local copy of all the data needed to restore your subreddit styles/settings, but I don't have any other ideas at the moment.",,False,,t5_2qtkl,1365634053.0,,,True,t3_17rwyv,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax/comments/17rwyv/srutils_manipulate_your_subreddits_from_the/,

Up to now, it outputs the users Reddit homepage headings, along with links to the comments section of each.

It can easily be extended to scanning comments and new posts for items of interest - like swearing - and then email the Mod, or if you wanted to program it, remove the offending comment!

Once the program starts it logs you in, so everything you do on Reddit through the program is as an authorised user!

pa.reddit.com

So, you could run multiple layouts to the same page by making a section like:

    html:lang(pa) body {background:(%%bgv2%%)}  
    html:lang(pa) .header {position:fixed; left:0; top:0; right:0}
    etc.

You could even have the same code above and add more, only with html:lang(nv) and different stuff. So now you have 3 versions of the same sub (don't worry, users can't tell which one someone is using). How do you effectively present them to users? How about adding links to the sidebar or header and all it takes is one click to switch 'themes'.
___
Whoa, that seems useful for something like a Red vs Blue sub... But what else can it do? Well, you could do a functionality over-haul. For an example, click /r/trueclop (NSFW) (this is for education only dammit) and see the differences between the normal sub and the enhanced sub (link in header changes both ways). Leaving it unflipped back will be fine for most of reddit, but you should take out that 'pa' and change it to 'www' so you don't end up somewhere you never knew existed in a sub you may frequent.

Wiki pages or Contact pages anyone? Click /r/MLPhelp (SFW, but still ponies) and click the contacts link in the sidebar. This one takes a tad more than just switching the address: you need to create content. Well rather, you need to add content to your sub description in h3 (3 hashmarks \#at the start of the line) and hide it by default. Description example:

    ###[Click here for contacts page](http://pa.reddit.com/mlphelp)  
    ###Contact 1  
    ###Contact 2

Accompanied with this CSS code:

    .side h3:nth-of-type(n+2) {display:none}
    html:lang(pa) .side h3 {display:block; position:absolute; left:50; top: 210}
    html:lang(pa) .sitetable.linklisting, html:lang(pa) .side h3:nth-of-type(1), html:lang(pa) .neverEndingReddit {display: none}
    html:lang(pa) .side h3:nth-of-type(3) {top:240px}
    etc for each 'nth type' so they get spaced out.

You could also do this with paragraphs to make a wiki page. Furthermore, you're not limited to choosing just one of my examples in here and you can even do some combining (such as contacts page, but in alternate page layout as well as default layout), but that'll take a bit more to explain.
___
There's plenty this type of code (it really is closer to programming than markup at this point) can do that I haven't covered and plenty more I haven't thought of, I'm sure.

There might be some other features you saw that interested you after clicking either of those subs above; just check out the stylesheet and borrow whatever you want. I want no personal credit, but it'd be awesome if you added this somewhere to your CSS:

works in the most important sense:  it doesn't cause a page reload if you click the resulting link from the full comments page.  Naturally it causes the full comments page to load if you click the link on another page, e.g.,  on the page for the permalink for my comment.

A common complaint I've seen has been the overuse of the same tired old phrases in submission titles. These titles have become so prolific that they have become a meme in and of themselves. The problem is that while the title may be annoying, there is no compelling reason to completely prohibit such submissions, and indeed the majority of mods have no desire to do so. The submissions themselves are usually pretty interesting.

As many of you know, [/r/pics](/r/pics) has recently adopted a new set of rules, prominently displayed in the sidebar, that is aimed at cleaning up the front page of the once meme-and-screenshot-riddled subreddit. One of my co-moderators, roger_, developed some useful css that will display a big red warning beneath blatant rule violations, so they stand out and hopefully users will downvote/report such submissions.

Last night I took the liberty of modifying some of that code to include a warning on several unoriginal, extremely overused ""meme"" submission titles as well. Hopefully it will significantly reduce the amount of these types of titles in the future, by both educating the OP that these titles are undesirable, as well as implicitly encouraging our users to downvote such submissions. However, if the submissions are upvoted anyway, they will not be removed, because they technically violate no rule.

Not sure if this is the best way to approach it but I couldn't find any preexisting methods.

The subreddit is [/r/lipogram](http://www.reddit.com/r/lipogram/) [[stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/lipogram/stylesheet)] and we wanted tabs that didn't contain the letter ""e"" to match the point of the sub.

Basically I hide the original tab text thusly (the ""http"" selector makes sure the submit link/text tabs aren't busted):

    ul.tabmenu &gt; li a[href*=""http""] {
        padding-top: 13px;
        height: 12px;
        border-bottom: 2px solid #5f99cf;
        color: #fff;
        font-size: 0;
        overflow: hidden
    }


And then I replaced the text and styled it - this area still needs me to go back and optimize now that it's working


    /*hot tab*/
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li a[href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/lipogram/""]:after {
        content: ""what's hotâ€½"";
        color: #E4F0FB;
        font-size: x-small;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #5f99cf
    }

The border is added again just to hide the tops of the original text because they peek over the original bottom border.

Finally, you have to fix the selected tab, restyle the replacement text, and hide that border. 

    /*selected tab fix*/
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li.selected a {
        border-bottom: 4px solid #fff;
        overflow: hidden;
        color: #fff
    }
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li.selected a:after {
        color: #ff4500;
        border-bottom: 0px
    }


The tabs I replaced were: hot, new, controversial, top, saved, comments, and related.

    .sidebox.submit .morelink a {

Note that this makes a *copy* of the /m/ multi, which means (among other things) that any changes subsequently made to the /m/ multi by its curator will *not* be reflected in the copy.

Well you can look at them in one of my subreddits here :) : http://www.reddit.com/r/leURSURS/comments/1bdqyp/smileys/

By matching against the href attribute, you can add conditional styles to links. This can be used for tagging by adding things to the url like example.com/page#foo=bar or example.com/page?post=123&amp;foo=bar (anything that won't change the page requested). Because the urls of self posts have the first few words of the title in the url, this can also be used to distinguish self-posts based on tags at the beginning of the title.  
  
CSS:  
  
    a[href*='url substring'].title:before{
        /* content before link: */
        content:url(%%blah%%);
    }

    a[href^='string at beginning of url'].title{
        /* css rules for link */
        color: red;
    }

    a[href$='string at end of url'].title:after{
        /* content after link */
        content: ""blah"";
    }

That's `href*=` to match any substring in the url, `href^=` for a string at the start and `href$=` for a string at the end, then `.title` to style the title links, `.title:before` to put stuff before them and `.title:after` to put stuff after.

Just doing a quick little write up of how they work in case you folks want something similar for your subreddit.

A new Pokemon game is coming out, and users wanted a way to hide spoilery links. So, I added a spoiler link flair and the end result [looks like this](http://i3.minus.com/ibyOHJOf2y4keB.png).

1\. Create link flair template for spoilers that submitters can use.

2\. CSS:

    /*Spoilers*/
    .post-submitter .entry .flairselectbtn:before {
        content: ""Click here to mark spoilers: "";
        color: #f00;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title {
        color: #fff !important;
        background-color: #fff;
        display: inline-block;
        height: 21px;
        border: 1px solid #000;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:hover {
        color: blue !important;
    }
    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:visited:hover {
        color: #551A8B !important;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:before, .flairselector .linkflair-spoiler a.title:before {
        background: #FFF;
        color: #000;
        content: ""Spoiler"";
        display: inline-block;
        height: 19px;
        padding: 0 5px;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler .thumbnail img {
        display: none;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler .thumbnail {
        display: block;
        width: 70px;
        height: 54px;
        background: url(%%spoiler%%) no-repeat;
    }

    .linkflair-xyspoiler .linkflairlabel {
        display: none;
    }

    .flairselector .linkflair-spoiler a.title:before {
        padding: 0;
        height: auto !important;
        top: 0;
    }

    .flairselector .linkflair-spoiler a.title {
        background-color: #fff;
        color: #000 !important;
    }

    .linkflairlabel { display: none; }
    .flairselector .linkflairlabel { display: block !important; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; }
    .flairselector .title { display: none !important; }

The CSS is a bit longer than I thought it would be, but it does a lot:

* Adds ""Click here to mark spoilers"" to posts you've submitted to encourage users to mark them
* Restyle the actual link to make it white on white until you hover
* Restyle the flair to remove the flair text, but not in the flair selector
* Restyle the flair selector to make the selection easier on the eyes
* Add ""Spoiler"" :before the links
* Replace thumbnail with spoiler thumbnail

You can use it to create a local zip archive of:

* CSS
* Subreddit images
* Flair templates
* Settings
* Sidebar

And then you can later restore this is something nasty happens. You can also create backups of subreddits you don't moderate, if that's your kind of thing.

Additionally, you can use this tool to produce pre-packaged subreddit themes, like /r/edurne, and distribute them to other moderators, who can then easily apply those themes to their subreddits.

To compliment these changes, I also added the ability to specify the username/password of a moderator from the command line arguments when you run it, in case you want to put it in cronjob or something similar. See the readme for details.

[Another r/tcs mod posted about this a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax/comments/eul60/request_looking_for_help_implementing_stickies_at/), but I thought I'd recap what we've done for anyone else who wants to a guide on how to use the code (especially since we stole all this code from others in the first place).

It's actually pretty simple to setup and very easy to update:

**Step 1**: Add this CSS to your subreddit's stylesheet.

    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li a {
        border: 1px solid #fff;
        background-color: #7575CC;
        padding: 2px 6px 2px;
        color: #fff;
        text-decoration: none;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-size: small;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li a:hover {
        border-color: #000000;
        background-color: #8A8A33;
    }
    .titlebox form {
        position: static;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol {
        list-style: none;
        position: absolute;
        top: 55px;
        left: 209px;
        z-index: 200;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: table;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li {
        display: inline;
        margin: 0 3px;
    }

Based on the size of your subreddit's icon, you will need to change the ""top"" and ""left"" values in the "".titlebox .usertext-body .md ol"" selector, in order to get the placement correct.  You can also change any of the ""#"" values for different colors.

**Step 2**: Setup an ordered list in your sidebar (i.e., the description setting in ""community settings"").  For example, this is our current code:

    1.  upcoming meetups:
    1.  [board games 1/11](http://redd.it/ezplv ""Fantasy Flight Event Center at 6:00 PM"")
    1.  [bowling 1/13](http://redd.it/eza7z ""It's at EP Brunswick Bowl, maybe. Starts at 8:00 PM, maybe."")
    1.  [d&amp;d night 1/13](http://redd.it/ezibq ""D&amp;D or Bowling?"")
    1.  [bar meetup 1/14](http://redd.it/exknx ""New thread not posted yet"")
    1.  [coffee meetup 1/16](http://redd.it/eyl3b ""New thread not posted yet"")
    1.  [risk tourney 1/23](http://redd.it/ez22s ""Club Underground in NE, will coincide with that week's coffee meetup"")

The CSS moves these items from the sidebar to the top of the page.  Any items you add will automatically be appended to the top, so you shouldn't have to mess with the CSS again.

Our solution is far from optimal at this point.  It'd be nice to have the stickies wrap gracefully (as it stands, they sometimes extend the browser window horizontally, and then wrap onto other content).

Press the bookmarklet while on the comments page of a story in a subreddit you moderate and a star will be added before it.

## Technical stuff:

The bookmarklet loads an external script because the jQuery callbacks weren't firing with all the code in the bookmarklet. There may be problems with multiple people editing the css concurrently (if two people try to add a star at the same time, one may save over the other's edit). Make a backup in case it eats your css.

One can't use @media, as Reddit doesn't recognize it, and you can't use -*""webrenderer""* because mobile browsers use the same as desktop. (Such as webkit and iOS)  
  
  
The closest thing that I can think of to make a mobile safe site, is to link mobile users to mo.reddit.com\/r/subreddit  (any two letter combination works, mo for mobile), and have special CSS for mo.reddit.com\/r/subreddit than for [www.reddit.com/r/subreddit](/r/iamannoyed ""Does anyone know how to undo linking when you type www.something.com?"").  
[](/sp)

To do this, we must specify in CSS what language you want the CSS following to be implemented for.  
Here is an example:  

    html:lang(mo) .side{
     display: none;
    }
  
If you do this, then all people on mo.reddit.com\/r/subreddit will not see the sidebar. This can be used for every CSS property.   
[](/sp)

this is regarding setting a very different looking linkflair for special kind of posts.

Please let me know how do you find it, if there are similar approaches or ways to do this in a better manner, or possible pitfalls in using this kind of methods.

and an explanation as follows :


The mod-posts, announcements, meta posts - that is essentially a self post made by moderators for special purposes relating to subreddit, so that should have high visibility; but gets no karma being a self post.  

Such posts are generally voted up only for visibility, there is no competitive scoring relevant for them.   

With the above considerations, a css class name ""meta"" is available as link flair, that'll set the presentation of a post distinct, and tag the text in a very visible format that sets it apart from the rest of the links listed.   
The rank and the scores are disabled for this post, and upvote remain.   
However, some readers may want to express displeasure and just as a possibility, they may want to downvote a modpost to let mod know of their views. So upvote and downvote both are kept. It is easy to let go of downvote button, but I'm not greatly moved by the cause to hide it.

Also, the upvote/downvote can be below the tag, but they are looking more proper being above. But this can be changed.

The text for such a link flair can be as long as possible, so ""Meta"" and ""Announcement"", both will work and shift the title text and rest of controls appropriately. 

---

Mostly, these posts have no thumbnails associated so no problem handling that, but there might be 

* an overlap of `RES-keyNav-activeElement`
* the link flair selector, and the link flair settings may look slightly weird (the meta tag goes off on right edge) is there a way to control these?
* any other problems other than these?


please do give your comments as feedback to fill in the gaps

Thanks in advance.


**edit:** found that /r/politic is assigning a ""meta"" class to every single link as flair; so here the shifted tag display will clash with thumbnail.

In such situations, it is best to hide the thumbnail - or have a different class than ""meta"".

I'll let it be for the time being. And given the feedback, may change it in future.",,False,,t5_2qtkl,1366093813.0,,,True,t3_1cbhrc,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax/comments/1cbhrc/distinguishing_moderator_meta_posts_with_a/,

So I recently re-did the flair for /r/pokemon, and I thought you guys would appreciate learning more about how it was done.

So reddit has a hard limit of 350 flair templates, and won't let you add any more. Well, now there are more than 600 Pokemon, so that obviously wouldn't do.

Solution: A bot that sets user flair based on private messages.

### Design

* A bot that responds to private messages with ""Set flair"" as the subject and a number as the body. It sets the sender's flair to that flair number.
* A nice page for people to click on pokemon to get to the reddit ""compose message"" form and send the request.

Here's how I did it:

### CSS

The easiest step was to set up the flair styles. The stylesheet is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/about/stylesheet/). Here's the generic flair styles:

    .flair,.wiki-page a[href^=""/message""] {
        background: url(%%masternew%%) transparent no-repeat;
        border: 0px;
        vertical-align: middle;
        display: inline-block;
    }

The `.wiki-page a[href^=""/message""]` was added for the clickable flair listing. Each link looks like this: `/message/compose/?to=pokemon-flair&amp;subject=Set+flair&amp;message=&lt;pokemon number&gt;`, so this styles any link on a wiki page that starts with `/message`. You can see it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/wiki/flair).

In the selectors for each flair, I also added some wiki-page styles: `.flair-1,.wiki-page a[href$=""=1""]`. The wiki selector takes advantage of the fact that the links end with `message=&lt;pokemon number&gt;` and uses that to select them.

### Generating Markdown

I didn't really want to manually type up the table that appears on the wiki page. [Here's the code I whipped up to do it for me](https://gist.github.com/70ea01bdf611e4d35999).

### The Bot

The actual bot takes advantage of my [RedditSharp](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/RedditSharp) library for working with Reddit. The bot's code is [here](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PokemonFlairBot). We can't send private messages without answering a capcha (unless you have enough karma), so it doesn't inform users when they give it a bad message. Instead, if they don't give it a valid Pokemon number, it just sets their flair to missingno. [Here's all the code that handles message parsing and setting flair](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PokemonFlairBot/blob/master/PokemonFlairBot/Program.cs#L49).

### Notes

* I know the markdown generation could have been in python or something, but I already had visual studio open
* `Thread.Sleep(60000 * 5)` is probably not the best way to time things in 5 minute intervals
* The bot also handles removing posts on blacklisted domains, which isn't covered by this post

I asked earlier on this subreddit for an Xmas theme a while back and changed my mind in between to make a winter theme. Becauyse I'm not selfish I'll share my [spoils](www.reddit.com/r/fredericton). Basically what I did was change the header for a christmas-y image and then changed the mail box/karma box for a light blue, that seemed to give my subreddit a nice look for the season.

Here's the code:  

    /* Christmas Theme ############### */

    /* Header Image */
    #header {
        border-bottom: 1px solid white;
        position: relative;
        background-color: transparent;
        background-image: url(%%winter%%);
        z-index: 99
        }

    /* bar with karma and mail */
    #header-bottom-right {
        background-color: #C2E0FF !important;
        color: black !important;
        border: black !important;
        }

    div#userbarToggle {
        background-color: white !important;
        border:none
        }

    #header-bottom-right a, #header-bottom-right b, #header-bottom-right span {
        color: black !important
        }

Basically, where it says ""background-image: url(%%winter%%);: you can add your own lovely wintery image, I just used google to find a hi-res pic and put it in. Also, for those (like me) who don't quite know how to add an image to their CSS spreadsheet just reply to this post or message me, I'll be glad to help you out :)

Lastly, I will not accept any reddit gold for this (if you chose to do so), send it to [heatheranne](www.reddit.com/u/heatheranne) for giving me the code in the first place, without her reply to my initial post no one would have a slightly wintery subreddit.

It was a fairly time consuming thing to do. 

/r/Badkarma exists to root these jerks out, but it isn't very popular and it's still a bitch to ban people from multiple subreddits every time there's a new thread. 

What I was thinking is a common bot. If a special statement is made in a /r/badkarma thread by a designated poster there verifying the person in question as a scammer, the bot pays a visit to every subreddit it moderates and adds that person to the ban list. If we could get all the exchange and altruism subreddits on board, it'd centralise /r/badkarma and make tracking scammers a painless, efficient prospect.

This bot would have three functions:

1. Trawling /r/badkarma for some sort of designated item, either a CSS change or a phrase by a particular account

2. Taking the user mentioned in brackets from the title and added them to the ban list of any subreddit it moderates 

3. Using the message mods link of that subreddit to notify the moderators why that person was banned, linking to the bad karma thread. 

I don't know anything about bots so I'm not sure if those functions are even feasible, but mannnnnn I suck yo dickkkkkkk for a bot like that.

1293903320.0,6,self.reddithax,eul60,[request] Looking for help implementing stickies at the top of our subreddit's front page.,9,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddithax/comments/eul60/request_looking_for_help_implementing_stickies_at/,"I am one of the mods of the local meetup [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/) in the Twin Cities. We are trying to make it easier for people to find information about upcoming meetups by putting a sticky at the top of the front page with links to the relevant threads.

For starters, we've borrowed the CSS from r/pics:

    /* Announcement Sticky Note (Shows when logged in), stolen from /r/netsec*/
    body &gt; .content &gt; .sharelink ~ .sitetable:before {
        content: ""Help improve /r/pics by checking the new queue - report spam &amp; upvote new submissions."";
        background-image: url(http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh0u_11.png?v=dfkbc4fna8g7e1jvy81pgiqwdga78fz6lpgr);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        font-family: verdana, sans-serif;
        font-size: 12px;
        color: #555555;
        text-align: left;
        padding: 10px 0px 10px 40px;
        margin: 15px;
        display: block;
        width: 70%;
        -moz-border-radius: 8px;
        -webkit-border-radius: 8px
        }


We are hoping to improve functionality by putting clickable links in the text of the announcement, but I don't know CSS and the usual reddit link syntax from the comments system doesn't work. If anyone knows of an easy way to do this, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Also, it would be even better if we could find a way to post multiple stickies. If anyone out there knows of a way to do that, it would really help us out.

**UPDATE (1/5/11):** I was able to resolve this by borrowing an idea from [r/Portland](http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland) (which was apparently originally developed by redditor [jamt9000](http://www.reddit.com/user/jamt9000/)).  This takes every line in the sidebar that is styled a certain way and adds it as a new tab in the header.  In this case I used the ordered list syntax since we don't ever use that in our sidebar.  If anyone else wants to use this concept, feel free (but please be sure to give credit to jamt9000, as I just copied the original code and made minor changes):

    /* This concept was originally developed by redditor jamt9000 */
    /* this positions new tabs up top, using text from the sidebar (specifically, ordered links) */

        /* Doesn't float right if not individually stated */
        padding-left: 3px;
        padding-right: 3px;
        padding-top: 3px

Is there a way to do this? I was thinking, if possible, something along the lines of distinguishing the post or adding a ""twitter"" flair to it. Is this possible?

I've looked into twitterfeed.com, and that's nice and all, but there might be some posts I don't want seen on twitter. I could add filters, but sometimes a post might have words that I didn't add to the filter list and ends up showing on my feed.

So, is this possible?

**Edit**: So I found [this link](https://github.com/ketralnis/reddittweeter), which does everything but NSFW links.

After looking through the code, I found a line that says:

    if data.get('over_18', False):
        return

How could this be set up to only add ""Approved"" links? I guess it would look something like this:

I'll walk you through step by step to explain what's happening. This is the first time I've used link flair, though I'm kind of familiar with user flair, link flair is a bit different it seems.

Step 1: The user picks a link flair. [Everything works great.](http://imgur.com/YIRNo)

Step 2: After refreshing the page, the link flair works just fine.

Step 3: Uh oh, my 4/5 review was two generous. I'd like to make it a 2/5. [WHAT IN THE WORLD?](http://imgur.com/1AIEq)

Step 4: After selecting the proper link-flair, it still works, but the menu is confusing.

Please help!

Here's the code for one of my flair segments:


    .linkflair-fivestars .linkflairlabel{
      background-image: url(%%review%%);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-position: 0px -51px !important;
      height: 12px;
      width: 50px;
      content: """";
      display: inline-block;
      background-color: transparent;
    }

I can't figure out how to get it to work. I'm sure I could make 5 separate review images instead of an image map, but I don't want to have to wast my image count. I'd much rather learn! Thanks for the help. :D

Update: I reversed the order in the CSS list (put 
.linkflair-fivestars before onestar) and [the opposite happened...](http://imgur.com/3wamw)

Update: Someone, please help me... I've changed all images to individual files instead of an image map, and it's STILL doing this. It makes no sense.

I've looked at [FIR](http://stopdesign.com/archive/2003/03/07/replace-text.html) and [a bunch of other techniques](http://css-tricks.com/630-css-image-replacement/), but they all seem geared towards replacing a chunk of text with a pre-defined image for the entire word or phrase.

Let's say I'm using [this image](http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2swlq_18.png) for the font.

I *can* just make a new link for each letter... but then the user would have to type something like this to make it work:

    [](/H)[](/e)[](/l)[](/l)[](/o) [](/W)[](/o)[](/r)[](/l)[](/d)

That seems like a lot of typing for a simple ""Hello World"".


Instead, it would totally rock if they could type something like this:

    [Hello World](/font)

...and have every letter in ""Hello World"" be replaced by the appropriate sprite.

1. Removes the downvote button
2. Adds a big tick button for upvote
3. Removes all comments that are not options (specified through css)

Things I want to do:

- Remove the comment box
- Display the upvotes below the option, eg: ""Vanilla (6 upvotes)"".

but...

- This has totally lost me, the unique form ID is dynamic and css doesn't support wildcards so I can't just do ""xxx display:none"" and if I make the box off by default then no submission can have commenting. I want to do it on a per submission basis. 

       .cloneable[value=""formid""]{
         display:none;
       }

- This isn't possible with purely css, the data has to be called via json so I'm going to turn that into a greasemonkey plugin.

So yeah, can anyone help with number 1? I really have no idea how to hide the comment box on a per post basis and it's very irritating, I'm sure it's somehow possible though... 

It works on a per submission basis and integrates flawlessly with a current subreddits styling and I built a generator for it (enter submission url and it creates the css for you) but with the comment box there it's really frustrating! 

*also yes I am aware people can still downvote and comment with this styling, but the comments are not displayed and the greasemonkey plugin will make the voting issue moot, it'll be based off of total upvotes, not up - down!*

I'm a complete noob when it comes to implementing this kind of thing, but I know a little about coding in general. 

I've done some google-fu and found a fair bit that may help in my quest. This includes [bf3stats api](http://bf3stats.com/api) which looks like it may have to be a middleman for me as dealing with battlelog's api direct looks and sounds like a nightmare. 
Also [this](http://forum.p-stats.com/threads/610-Sig-coding-Collection-of-useful-functions) from their forums seems like a treasure trove of code for what I'm thinking of doing. Plus I also found [this](https://github.com/tmiller/bf3-reddit-flair) that was written by another redditor (can't find his username or would contact him on here) for the main bf3 subreddit, but I believe this is not in use and may have been only for when the battlelog was in use for the Beta which was more api friendly.

Anyways apologies for the long read, but if someone is feeling generous / is up for the challenge and can help in anyway, I'm struggling to work out what would be the best way to make this into an easy way for people to fetch the detail for their soldier from battlelog to go on their flair along with their prefered platform (this can be set automatically from battlelog also i believe) and their location regionally within the UK (not on battlelog).

If not, do you guys have any other ideas for controlling large flair a little better, or are we doomed to have to remove all the big ones?

I tried adding this block of CSS, which is a bit better, but not perfect:

	.flair {
	border: none !important;
	top:20px;
	position: absolute;
	padding:0px;

[This is what it looked like](http://i.imgur.com/4S6Pu.jpg). I'd love if the content could justify to the width of the image, though I feel like that wouldn't be possible. Would it be possible to at least center the images horizontally in that block without resorting to manually setting the *left* on each individual piece of flair?

Usually the admin or one of the mods will change it up with a picture of one of the subscribers on their boats or whatever else is relevant at the time, and I thought it would be a handy idea to make the picture click-able to its source.

As it is the picture is just there as a background set not to repeat high up on .side.  Because I've never coded CSS before or much of anything for that matter I've spent the last two nights hacking together a probably stupid means of achieving a click able image.  If you go to [/r/fuckingbored](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingbored) where i'm a mod and have been playing around with it all you can see my progress.

The first thing I figured out was that I could replace links with images, so I dropped my link into the description box and used the following which is pretty basic:

&gt;.side a[href=""/r/fuckingbored""] {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 295px;
    height: 200px;
    background-image: url(%%cat%%)
    }

I should probably (and maybe will eventually) be satisfied with getting a linkable image in the description box there, but I figured I'd keep trying to position it above everything as it was originally in /r/sailing so I pressed on.  I found that I could use 'before' to force the picture to the top of the side bar, but I couldn't figure out how to make it link anywhere because it was just a static background.  Then I figured out/asked for help from a mod that the various local subreddits had clickable links floating around in the header (see [/r/boston](http://www.reddit.com/r/boston) for where I ripped to code off from) and combining everything I learned thus far I realized I could use the original code of replacing links to replace the floating links in Boston's header with my picture and put it anywhere.

I couldn't figure out how to actually get it to float *in* the 'before' code of the .side though, and I also couldn't figure out how to just force an empty space above the sidebar, so I used '.side:before' to place a white image to hold the space then just used positioning to move my picture into place.  All this code is in the sub's [CSS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingbored/stylesheet.css).  Also, please excuse the dumb tags I added to my friends' names; give me a small amount of control and I will abuse it to my most immature limits. 

So in the end I've essentially figured out how to do what I wanted, but it seems very sloppy and inelegant to me (as most of my few forays into coding end up) and was wondering if you guys knew a better, cleaner means to put a linkable image above everything else in the sidebar.

tl;dr: I spent two nights hacking together [CSS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingbored/stylesheet.css) I ripped off from other people and barely understand to make something (somewhat) functional, is there a better way to do it?

This should be doable through Greasemonkey as reddit provides an empty style tag in the header of all pages, but my ability with Javascript is rather limited. Perhaps you'll find more help over at /r/reddithax.

I use a 22"" 16:9 monitor. At 1920x1080, the reddit page is definitely too wide. I have to look across the entire space which seems uncomfortable, especially since most sites are centered. In some cases it is useful, but not here. Is there any greasemonkey plugin that would fix this? Take a look here - the bottom version is much more readable IMO:

However, I had descriptions of the flairs in the flair templates itself. I soon found out that if you try to enter an unacceptable entry (ie. blank) it will revert to the default as set in the flair settings of the subreddit, which out prevent someone from using just the flair picture.

After a bit of tinkering, I found this solution to the problem.

    .flair:after { display: none; }
    .flairoptionpane .flair:after { display: inline; }

    .flair-something:after { content: ""sample text""; }

This set up enables your users to see an example text written beside the flair picture when viewing the flair selection popup, however still allows them to set their own text for the flair, and most importantly still allows them to use image-only, by not entering text once they have chosen their flair.

I'm certain that I have the necessary skills to make this happen, but it looks like reddit might be a little to restrictive to make this a possibility.

Does anyone have any information about how I might accomplish this (if it is even possible at all)?

Whenever a comment from subreddit A is linked by subreddit B, subreddit A's header image is displayed next to the link in subreddit B.

[Example of what I'm talking about](http://i.imgur.com/TIMOz.png).

Notice the ""We love SRS"" icon next to the link to r/circlebroke, the corgi icon next to the link to r/SRSWomen, and the big blue bird next to the link to r/shitredditsays. (There are no thumbnail icons for SRSMicroaggressions, SRSMen, or SRS Discussion).

I switched it up and [made my own custom icon for each subreddit](http://i.imgur.com/TTCRj.png).

     /*~~~~~~~Getting rid of the default subreddit thumbnail~~~~~~~~~~*/

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href\^=""http://www.reddit.com/""] img
     {
          display:none;
     }

Explanation:

    a.thumbnail.loggedin img

selects the thumbnail image for a specific subreddit (although it only works for users that are logged in, which is one downside to this code). ""display:none"" ensures that it is invisible *and* that it does not take up space.

     [href^=""http://www.reddit.com""]

is an attribute selector that selects only links that begin with Reddit.com.

On a side note, 

     [href*=""reddit""] 

would select links that have the case-sensitive phrase ""reddit"" somewhere inside the link. I am going to use this selector in the rest of my code.

And also, 

[href=""http://www.reddit.com""] 

is a selector that would select links that are *exactly* http://www.reddit.com/

These selectors are case sensitive, which is a pain in the butt, as you're about to see. These selectors also only work with CSS 3.0, so this trick may not work with older browsers.

---

Now to replace the thumbnail with a creation of my own:

      /*~~~~~~~Shit Reddit Says~~~~~~~*/

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""]:before,a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""Shitredditsays""]:before,
      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]:before,a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""SHITREDDITSAYS""]:before
      {
           content:""Shit Reddit Says"";
     }

      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""],a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""Shitredditsays""],
      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""],a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""SHITREDDITSAYS""]
     {
     color:#550000;
     font-size:10px;
     font-weight:900;
     text-align:center;
     background-image:none;
     vertical-align:middle;
     text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #AA8888;
      }

Explanation:

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""ShitRedditSays""]:before,a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""Shitredditsays""]:before,
     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]:before,a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""SHITREDDITSAYS""]:before

This selects the box that contains the subreddit thumbnail image, provided that the relevant link contains the text ""shitredditsays"", ""ShitRedditSays"", ""SHITREDDITSAYS"", or ""Shitredditsays"". 

This selector is case sensitive, so I had to iterate each and every possible way that someone can capitalize the letters of the subreddit's name. 

I also needed to separate each individual selector with a comma. I also have to insert the selector "":before"" after each individual selector so that the ""content"" property will work properly on all of them.

       { content:""Shit Reddit Says"";}

This inserts the words ""Shit Reddit Says"" into that box that *used to* contain the thumbnail image. The content property only words on selectors that are ended with the phrase "":before"".

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""],a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""Shitredditsays""],
     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""],a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""SHITREDDITSAYS""]
     {
     color:#550000;
     font-size:10px;
     font-weight:900;
     text-align:center;
     background-image:none;
     vertical-align:middle;
     text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #AA8888;
     }

This selects the same exact box all over again, except it doesn't use the ""before"" selector first. It then formats the text inside that box so that it looks nice and presentable.

---

Now, the rest of the code is just meant to do the exact same thing to SRSWomen, SRSMen, SRSMicroaggressions, and SRSDiscussion, provided that the previous code successfully eliminates the default subreddit thumbnail.

Check out the awesome [peach logo](http://e.thumbs.redditmedia.com/yh6G5Kw9SRZ5234v.png) on http://www.georgia.org . It's used at the end of shows made... in Georgia. Since I mod /r/atlanta, I want to give one of our users a special tag to signify this. That, and I'm interested in learning how this stuff works.  Currently I've looked at the other threads and somehow come up with this:

    .flair-gaorg {
      background-image: url(%%GeorgiaOrg%%);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      height: 25px;

[What I want to replace it with](http://i.imgur.com/vjDmG.png)

I've got the default CSS sheet all formatted but I'm having trouble in the 6k lines finding the styles for that menu. I'm also not exactly sure how I should go about placing that image there. The alien was easy as they have that widget that does that for you now but I don't want to mess that up. I could certainly add it to the header background image. Then it would just be a matter of styling that link so that it doesn't display any text and moving it's hit box up, to the left and making it bigger. 

Then again that may screw up the rest of the menu items. And since I can't find them I can't be sure how they are styled. 

Anyway, any thoughts would be appreciated. I've had a few courses on CSS but I'm certainly no expert and I'm much better at creating it from scratch and dealing with my own CSS and than I wading through a ton of someone else's work.

Reddit is an awesome site, but with awesome content at an even more awesome quantity, a big problem begins to emerge: **clutter!** I decided to try my best use what I know about design and user-experience to dramatically update Reddit using a mixture of complex and simple-subtle design. However, I have a big problem with proposing my design. In order for this to be taken seriously, the design needs to be functional in an example subreddit. 

This is where one of you guys come in. I need someone who is up for the job of implementing this design into a functional subreddit that *may* push the envelope in terms of creative scripting. However this is a great opportunity for one of you to show off your skills to the reddit team, and I will absolutely ensure that you are generously credited for bringing a renovated-reddit to life. Essentially, you are the engineer in this project, and I rely on you to be cooperative and collaborative with me while we work out the kinks, despite how many bumps in the road we hit. I'll do my very best to make your job easier, and I hope you will be able to return the favor.

**On the flip side of things** I would also like to hear constructive criticism regarding the design. What would you change or add to it to enhance the user-experience and user-friendliness? Comments like ""ugly"" or ""shit design"" will be ignored, and really don't help me build this. I want to build a reddit for YOU, and I want to know what you would want in a ""perfect reddit.""

Main problems I've noticed in Chrome:

* Inconsistent placement of hover elements vs non-hover. This can lead to rapid back-and-forth switching between the two styles when the cursor is in the right spot.
* Indentation for new paragraphs goes way too far left in Chrome, but works fine in Firefox.

Problem in all browsers:

* Can't highlight text in answers to copy. Instead, the entire 'block' gets dragged. You can select if you start highlighting outside of the block, though.

You can see the result in [r/CHIBears](/r/chibears).

I had originally created a simple table for a subreddit to display the Records and the conference records of all the teams in their conference.  It seemed like enough for them but I wanted more.  Enough of me being egotistical.

This is a bit difficult to understand and the way I explain it may make it worse but I will try my best.  Some people who really know CSS may scoff at what I describe but I figured I'd share with all the sports people out there.

There are two things in particular you will need to understand:

* Different stylesheets on a subreddit (using body:lang(as))

* The nth-child() specification

Using body:lang(as) will create a ""separate"" stylesheet for your subreddit but contain it in the same place as the custom one Reddit allows you to edit.  **It will also inherit whatever values given by the original custom stylesheet** (aka anything not preceded by body:lang(as)).  This is important because if you give something the attribute `display:none` in the stylesheet you must reset it, with maybe `display:table`, in the body:lang(as) attributes.

The nth-child() attachment to the attribute allows you to pick the object you want but it may be a little hard to understand as it was a little difficult to figure out for myself when it started getting finicky with me.  Odd children are either `nth-child(odd)` or `nth-child(2n+1)` and even children are either `nth-child(even)` or `nth-child(odd)`.

Here is what I put in.  I know the explanation wasn't especially sufficient but I got through this with pure experimentation and you can do it too. =]

I started thinking about it when I made badges for the game developers who submit their work to WebGames, and I thought it would be neat if everyone could get a little badge, and work their way up to getting cooler and cooler badges (1 at a time only though) as a way to get everyone more involved in the community and what not. Posting helpful comments as opposed to ""this game is bad and you should feel bad"" could be a criteria for points. I think it would also be an awesome thing in /r/Zombies. 

I have no idea how the scoring system would work, other than me just getting 30 more mods to come in who regularly check reddit at all times and make note of anyone who scored some points. Maybe I am thinking too grandiosely.

I'm a big fan of reddithax, you guys helped me build [r/NaziHunting](http://www.reddit.com/r/NaziHunting).  
Well we've had some issues with downvoters taking all the new articles off the front page, so I've taken down the downvote button but I'm not satisfied with this solution.  

My question is, does anyone here know if it's possible to make it so that the downvote button doesn't submit a downvote, but still looks like it is functioning normally? It's ok that it wouldn't appear to change the vote count.  

Thanks for any assistance!

I don't need help on how to do it, because I have a general idea on how I would code it. I do need feed back. Would you find this useful? Do you think other people will enjoy it? What are the downfalls? Etc.

Here is my idea:
The site will probably be called RedditRape. The general purpose of this project would be to let owners of subreddits make money, and let general users feel in charge.

How it would work:
An owner of a subreddit can site up for our site by simply providing email, password, and paypal account that they would like their money to go to. They then add the RedditRape bot as a moderator to their subreddit afterwords.

A regular user can sign up to the site and purchase ReditRape points. They can use the points that they've purchase to temporarily change a user's user-flair and/or temporarily ban a user from a participating subreddit.

Everytime a user spends points on a particular subreddit, those points go to the subreddit that someone did the action to. Ie: say if I spend 10 points changing someone's useflair on /r/trees (if trees participates), /r/trees RedditRape account will be credited 10 points. The owner of that subreddit can then cash in those points.
