November 2011, I published the concluding sequel, Sulfur. I first wrote these novels when I was fifteen and caught in the thralls of adolescence. Approaching these as an adult has been exciting and rewarding. The story is loud and dramatic and occasionally dark, and I would recommend it for any teen or YA lover interested in an epic adventure involving magic and kraken and ornery princes. (Notice: both novels contain violence and some adult themes.)

December 25th through December 27th both Farro and Sulfur will be available for free through Amazon. I hope you will pick up a free copy, fellow readers, and enjoy it as I have!

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US, presented as a series of vignettes.

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

If you're reading these words, you can read the book.  [Here are all of the free Kindle apps you can use.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771)

If you download the book and read it, consider leaving a review of the book on the Amazon product page or over at Goodreads, so other people will know whether it's worth the investment.

Please feel free to take one. Take both. If it's close, maybe we'll race them (I've done that before, and it was fun).

Happy Thanksgiving, Redditors in the U.S. and Americans abroad! 

For the rest of the world, they're available in India (sadly that's lumped in with the U.S., so I can't see if someone's downloaded it from there, let me know if you're there and you have!) the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and now Japan. 

Enjoy!

**Edit 1** I have derelicted my duties at the helm of mashed potatoes and stuffing (I know, it's B-team stuff) to bring this update. Competition is *tough* in the Kindle free store. Aunty Ida is at #23,201, with Paradox trailing behind at #26,316. Both books have hit the boards in the UK (thank you, UK redditors) and Paradox has found a place in Germany (thank you, German redditor!). So far no action in the other parts of the world.

Uh oh. I've been found out. I'll be back.

**Edit 2** The turkey's been eaten (well, some of it) we were stuffed by stuffing (but not sweet potatoes because the dog got them before they went back in the oven. Seriously. From the top of the microwave underneath a cabinet. She took two and didn't disturb the rest. She's short. We're waiting for the surveillance footage to determine if she can, in fact, fly). The race is *on!*

Aunty Ida has a commanding lead, just the way she'd want it. She's at #1,216 in the free kindle store, and #36 in humor (!) while Paradox trails at #1,619 overall and #45 in humor. In the UK, Aunty Ida leads as well. Germany, holds steady, while newcomer Italy joins the race.

Aunty Ida is smug. She gets inventy when she's smug, watch your brain.

**Edit 3** Well, Aunty Ida is holding her lead, but both titles slipped a bit. Aunty Ida is at #1,263 overall, and #41 in humor, while Paradox is at #1,671 overall and #48 in humor. Aunty Ida pulled out her soldering iron. Please hold on to your metals, precious or otherwise.

**Edit 4** Aunty Ida's not even checking over her shoulder, as she gains ground and Paradox loses it. Aunty Ida is at #1,241 overall and #38 in humor, while Paradox has fallen back to #1,768 overall and #49 in humor. Could it be that time is not on Paradox's side?!

**Edit 5** Well, back to the nosebleeds they both go, but I'm willing to confidently call it, even this early, for Aunty Ida. I don't think that Paradox can bridge the gap. Maybe it'll get her next time? Aunty Ida would like you to remember to mind your thoughts!

I posted a couple weeks ago announcing my promotional giveaway of my teen duology, [Farro](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZZSPC6) and [Sulfur](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063S2LN2). Shortly after the promotion ended, I released my newest novel, Umbra, which I bring forward today.

Umbra is a darker fantasy with more adult themes. The story follows three characters as they band together to save the survivors of a vicious attack. I would recommend Umbra for any teen or adult who loves adventure, magic, or lovecraftian-style monsters. 

Pick it up this weekend (January 12th through the 13th) for free and enjoy!

X-post from http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/rw3az/my_1st_ever_book_is_free_today_on_kindle_a_10000/
 
 I've just published my first ever book. I certainly didn't do this to make money (whatever money is being raised, I'm adding to our fundraising total) - I just wanted people to read our story.

In 2010, myself and two friends took part in the Mongol Rally. A challenge to get from the UK to Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia in a month. The rules are simple - no support crew/assistance, no GPS, no car with an engine bigger than a 1.2 litre.

We travelled through 15 countries, met some of the most amazing people ever, had our eyes truly opened by the worldwide generosity and inherently goodness of the world. Of course, you still had a few questionable characters!

We raised £15,000 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. 

If any of you fancy a light read about our travels, or wanted to know more about the Mongol Rally itself, then please do download it, and I hope you enjoy it. It's FREE today!

Info about the book:
The year is 1971. The place is Detroit. Harry Levin, a scrap metal dealer and Holocaust survivor, has just learned that his daughter was killed in a car accident. Traveling to Washington, DC to claim the body, he learns that the accident was caused by a German diplomat who was driving drunk. This is only the beginning of the horror for Harry, though, as he discovers that the diplomat will never face charges – he has already been released and granted immunity. Enraged and aggrieved, Harry discovers the identity of his daughter's killer, follows him to Munich, and hunts him down. What Harry finds out about the diplomat and his plans will explode his life and the lives of everyone around him.",,False,self,t5_2td0q,False,,,True,t3_17iu3w,http://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/comments/17iu3w/free_copies_of_voices_of_the_dead_a_thriller/,

Naturally, the judges are some of the world's most despised men, and are appointed protectors to keep them from harm.

The story is told from the point of view of one of the protectors who suddenly finds himself being judged by the man he is sworn to protect.

Here's a little excerpt, Scene 20 ...

**20.**

In a tiny border town named Tranquilidad,a siege was taking place as the sun began its hard and mirthless climb into the faded desert sky. Twelve of Tranquilidad's one hundred eighty residents were holed up in the town's stout little Catholic church. The heavy doors had been locked and barricaded well, but the ornate stained glass windows were fair game - the gibbering pack outside soon smashed them in, and the refugees fled to the basement. The basement door was even heavier, reinforced with ornate bands of steel and securely fastened with a deadbolt, but the infected were not easily discouraged and had been battering away at it ceaselessly for almost forty-five minutes. The terrified townsfolk could hear their friends and relatives going berserk above them, kicking down the pews, ripping down the hanging chandeliers, and randomly attacking one another.

Among their number was Father Alvera, a middle-aged couple and their teenage son, some ranch hands, a couple of ranchers, the town's sheriff, and a dark-haired girl of about ten who none of the group knew. She was catatonic from shock, and had both a black eye and a bad bite wound on her upper right arm. The flesh was torn and hanging raggedly, the tear seeping blood and yellowish curds of fatty tissue. Father Alvera had cleaned and wrapped it up as well as he could with the church's dusty First Aid kit. Everyone else in the beseiged group had managed to avoid sustaining any major injury thus far.

Very little was being said. Everyone was either pacing restlessly or sitting on the floor against the wall, staring at nothing ... except the sheriff. The sheriff kept his piercing gaze trained on the nameless little girl. Deep suspicion lined the man's ruddy face, and something else, something hard and resolved. Father Alvera noticed this, and it troubled the priest. He stayed beside the girl, sitting on the floor with her and holding her limp hand. The girl's light brown eyes were glassy and unfocused. Occasionally, as a reflex against the sting of dust, her eyelids would slowly close, then ponderously open again. The priest wondered if she could see or feel anything, if the information gathered by her five senses was even reaching her brain. What was she *experiencing*, in her mind's eye?

""They don't give up, do they?"" This came from a tall, sturdy young Native ranch hand. He nodded up the shoddy wooden stairs at the door. It had been shuddering under the forcible blows of the crazed attackers for so long now that they were all beginning to tune the racket out. ""I don't know if running down here was the best idea, after all. That door can't hold up-"" 

""Stand up and step away from her, Padre. She's bit,"" the sheriff rasped, suddenly. He pushed himself up the grey concrete wall with his feet and stepped forward, the hard heels of his snakeskin boots creating flat, clomping echoes against the floor. His face was bleak under the round brim of his dusty hat. 

Heart pounding, the priest locked eyes with the sheriff and, slowly and clearly, said, ""This isn't the movies, Lance. Okay? This is real life. They aren't *zombies,* up there. They're living, breathing *people,* not the undead. This affliction is natural in its cause, not *super*-natural, and when the *proper* authorities are able to get here - not *you*, Lance, I'm talking about men who are thinking straight,"" Alvera emphasized, angrily, ""they will have a *rational* explanation, and this horrible thing will all get sorted out soon enough. You will *not* harm this little girl. I ... will ... *not* ... allow that."" He pulled the unresponsive girl closer to him, shielded her with his arms.

""Yeah, maybe they *ain't* dead, but there's that *other* movie,"" one of the ranchers chimed in, ""you know, with the virus that's like rabies, or something. Could be like that. She could have it, turn any minute and start in on us."" Even in the weak light emitted by the bare forty-watt bulbs that hung from ceiling, the rancher's hired help blanched at this idea visibly.

""Screw that! Someone shoot her!"" the teenage kid burst out, and his mother slapped him upside the back of his shaggy head, *crack.* He clutched at the point of impact with both hands and whined.

""Oh, come on! That's just *stupid!*"" her husband spat out, angrily. ""You're grown men, that's bullsh-""

""Is it, feller?"" asked one of the cowboys, and he stared the older man down. The cowboy was lanky and tough-looking, with a face like cracked leather. His gaze was flat and cold. ""What made all them folks upstairs there decide to start beatin' and eatin' on us, then? Didn't like their ole lady's eggs 'n grits this morning?"" The cowboy's hand drifted to the .45 holstered inside his denimn jacket. ""Step away now, Padre. We got to do this, before she turns on us.""

The man's wife barked a sarcastic laugh, *""Ha!""* The woman was stocky, greying and looked like she was not one to quietly suffer fools. ""How would that even be possible, now, huh? It all happened so fast. No one was sick beforehand.  That's not how a virus works. There's always a period of time when you start coming down with symptoms. You tell us how that's even possible, huh?"" the wife demanded of the men. Her eyes were wide and wet.

""I'll tell you what, darlin' - this obviously is the result of some bio-chemical, government military experiment gone bad, the way I see it,"" the sheriff expounded, pulling his sidearm out of its black leather holster, ""or maybe the fucking terrorists did it. The guys that are always hollering and firing their rifles into the air on TV whenever they blow something to Hell and back. Does it *matter* how it started, or *why?* It's *happening,* and I don't want to die, Father ... and I don't want to become one of those poor souls upstairs, either. Now, maybe I'm wrong, but maybe I'm *not.* I'd rather be wrong than dead, any day of the week. She infects even one of us, and we've got a spiraling problem on our hands, see? Now y'all pardon my language and *step the fuck aside.*""

He straightened and steadied arm, his .40 Smith and Wesson now trained directly at Father Alvera's chest. The rancher and his hired hand both stepped forward and did the same with their own guns. The wife clutched her son by the shirt and crowded back into her husband, whose eyes blazed with disbelief.

""*Wow,* hey, Barney Fife and posse - uh, I'm not usually the one to say shit like this, but chill the fuck *out*, man,"" said the Native ranch hand, looking dismayed by this turn of events. He circled away from the drawn guns. 

The other rancher, a short, wide Mexican, shouted, ""Hey! You guys gone *loco,* man? Put your guns away, eh? What you doin' that for, I thought the crazy people were upstairs!""

""Shut up, Lopez,"" the sheriff snapped. He glared at the priest, who was now completely covering the girl with his robes, and looking back at the firing squad from over his shoulder. With a tone of finality, the sheriff told Alvera, ""Do as I say right *now,* boy.""

Sweating, the priest tautly replied, ""I *won't* do that, I would *never* do that, and your soul will burn in *Hell* if any of you pull that trigger, do you understand? You will suffer torment and agony greater than anything those crazy people upstairs could possibly inflict on you, because it will be *forever.* Do you understand? Stop this, don't do-""

""I don't believe in any of that crap,"" the rancher said simply.

""Don't try and go all *what-would-Jesus-do* on *me,* Padre. He'd do just as we're doing right now, for the greater good of the rest of us folks down here. Listen to me, dammit - are you listening? This here is your absolute *last* chance, man, I'm not shittin' you. Get out of the goddamned *way*."" The lawman's lip curled with impatient disdain. His round, florid face was set and determined. The girl was already dead, in his eyes. The priest could join her or not, but the girl was already dead.  

""As for me, well, shit, I dunno about there being a God or no God, or maybe a *different* God ... but I'll take my chances,"" the cowboy drawled. His face tightened. His eyes narrowed. Talking was done. The shooting was about to start.

*BLAM! BLAMBLAM!* Three concussive explosions snapped out, and the sheriff, ranch hand and rancher all suddenly dropped in a spray of bloody brain matter. The smell of gun powder was sharp in the air, and everyone's ears were ringing. All heads turned to Lopez, who had a .357 Colt at his right hip, his opposite hand resting on the hammer.  

Lopez holstered his weapon. His face was struggling with a mixture of anger and sorrow.

""I had to, Padre,"" he whispered hoarsely. ""I think that God ... He, uh, I think He's gonna understand.""

Summary:
Published by Penguin/InterMix, August, 2012 First in an all-new series of mysteries that could happen only in Tokyo… Yumi Hata went to school in the U.S., but now—back in Tokyo, living with her parents  and working as an English translator—she no longer fits in with Japanese society. If not for her friend Rika, Yumi would feel completely isolated, so when Rika is found dead—suspected of jisatsu, taking part in a suicide pact—Yumi is devastated. Fortunately, the police investigator in charge of Rika’s case is Yumi’s old schoolmate Kenji, who also wants to clear Rika’s name. As Yumi and Kenji dig up more evidence, they discover that Rika’s “suicide” is not what it seemed. The closer they get to the killer, the stranger their encounters with the fringes of Japanese society: the lost souls who flit in and out of the shadowy world of suicide websites; the sisterhood of Lolitas; a bartender who hides a dark secret behind his bizarre collection of Alice in Wonderland action figures, and a technical wizard who does his best work while being served by costumed waitresses in an Akihabara ""maid cafe."" The clock is ticking as they race to find the killer before the next victim is targeted…",,False,self,t5_2td0q,False,,,True,t3_177lxb,http://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/comments/177lxb/free_copies_of_nightshadea_japanese_mystery/,

This has been quite a ride and you have been so helpful and supportive in my self-publishing experience thus far. I'm giving away free review copies of Legend of Xaloria to anyone who messages me or shoots me an email (trip@tripellington.com). I'll assume that you want the MOBI (kindle format) unless you let me know otherwise. Also, feel free to put it on as many devices as you wish (no DRM protection on it).

DESCRIPTION:

From author Trip Ellington comes the debut of an immersive new fantasy novel. LEGEND OF XALORIA tells the story of Jake, a young boy living in the not-so-distant future where virtual reality is indistinguishable from the real world. Ignored by his mother, and alienated from his classmates, Jake loves to spend his time building Xaloria, his own virtual fantasy world.

In Xaloria, Jake lives out his dreams to be a great hero, of helping others in need, and of being liked. When his mother makes yet another major family decision without even telling him about it until after the fact, he decides to escape to Xaloria and play with his only two friends. He didn’t expect his world to come to life…

Just so you know, my short story, **Second Chances, Ltd.** is now available for the knock-down price of *zilch* for this weekend only.

In case you need a little more convincing, here's the blurb: 

*When Toby Randall's life falls apart in the space of eight hours, he's left wondering how he'll ever recover. But a chance meeting in a bar leads him to Second Chances, Ltd, where Toby discovers that not everything in life is irreversible.*

*Second Chances, Ltd. is a 6000 word page-turner of a short story: a cautionary tale of time travel inspired by the works of Stephen King and Dean Koontz.* 

Readers in the US can download the story [free on Amazon right here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007YJ73P0). Those in the UK, like myself, can [grab their free copy here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007YJ73P0).

I hope you enjoy it if you decide to give it a try, and thanks for reading!

So, I just wanted to let you know my book ""The Twelve Stones"" is available for download today FREE on Amazon. It's a five star rated novel that people really seem to enjoy!
Linky: [The Twelve Stones](http://www.amazon.com/The-Twelve-Stones-ebook/dp/B0070CSKE4)

And a short description in case you're not convinced:

Twenty two years ago, Alex McCray found the first of the Twelve Stones, a set of powerful artifacts left for Humanity to find and use to save Earth from certain destruction.

Returning to his hometown of Onyx, California, Alex reunites with his father who returns the stone Alex found so many years ago. Their reunion is cut short however after Alex's father is murdered by billionaire industrialist Rupert Kline, a madman who will stop at nothing to collect all twelve stones for himself.

Driven by revenge, Alex McCray vows to bring his father's killer to justice and keep the remaining Twelve Stones out of Kline's hands.
A thrilling tale that mixes romance, cutting edge science, and oh yeah, the fate of human civilization.

In 1976, Evan Branko was the one kid in high school who everybody hated. No one hated him more than Dean Johnson, the king of football in their small town. Ten years later, Evan still hasn't gotten around to leaving Minnesota, while Dean has gone on to the NFL. But when these two collide at their high school reunion, Dean's startling revelations to Evan force an unlikely bond of friendship between the two. Now that Evan can no longer blame Dean for his last ten years, will he be able to grow up, or find love? Will Dean find acceptance? Grab a coffee and a Winchell's fritter and find out.

Amazon Description:

Simulated realities. Malevolent gods. Obsessions, paradoxes, and murders. These twenty stories reflect on consciousness and its predicaments. The collection begins with short pieces and fragments; ""Prologue?"" and, later on, ""Eden Hypothesis"" envision a dawn of thought, while “The Fun Machine” imagines its end. The middle third of the collection is devoted to science fiction: ""Sugarless"" and ""The Last Engineer"" dwell on the problem of self-awareness, the hard science fiction tale ""Thought Process"" develops a detailed premise based on physics and computer science, and “Careful with that Razor” is a satirical response to Isaac Asimov’s science-and-religion-reconciled tale “The Last Question.” The final third of the collection opens with the drug-fueled rage and despair of “Ivan the Terrible,” which sets the tone of revenge and regret. The stories “An Example to the Men,” “Broken,” and “A Man for the Empire” depict an authoritarian, dystopian medieval world, and the collection ends with the apocalyptic, last-gasp fantasy dirge “Rain Ghosts.” The common thread running through the collection, as manifested most explicitly in ""The Celestial Puppeteer"" and ""Careful with that Razor,"" is cosmic paranoia.",,False,self,t5_2td0q,True,,,True,t3_s37wk,http://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/comments/s37wk/the_celestial_puppeteer_free_for_this_week/,

Book Summary:

Quinn Robbins never planned on sacrificing anything. Her life was perfect - everything she thought a teenager's should be. But all of that is about to change. What starts out as curiosity over the strange behavior of the reclusive William Rose quickly leads her to an adventure she never could have imagined - to the discovery of an alternate universe where time works differently than it does in Quinn's world - a world where even simple electricity is advanced technology, and where medical knowledge is desperately needed. Stuck in this secret world for ten days, Quinn will discover that sometimes we find ourselves - and who our real friends are - in unexpected places. Seeds of Discovery is Book One of the Dusk Gate Chronicles, a new Young Adult series that has been described by readers as ""The Chronicles of Narnia meets Cinderella."" Go on an unforgettable journey with characters who will find their way straight into your heart.",,False,self,t5_2td0q,False,,,True,t3_1d3zlr,http://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/comments/1d3zlr/free_copies_of_seeds_of_discovery_ya/,

It's full-length, professionally edited and proof-read, and the plot has been described as a bit of a cross between Quantum Leap and Stargate SG-1. Here's the link:

http://www.amazon.com/The-Reintegrators-ebook/dp/B00DD0UQCG

And here's the blurb:

**Welcome to Oakmont Academy. Study hard, make friends, and whatever you do, don't get lost in the Metaverse.**

*Tormented by crippling panic attacks and desperate to find a way to help his catatonic father, Teddy Cartham is running out of options. When he receives an invitation to attend the elite academy where his father once taught, he believes his luck is changing. Until he uncovers a shocking secret—his new math teachers are Reintegrators, members of an ancient cult dedicated to exploring alternate universes. With the help of his classmates and some unlikely allies, Teddy searches a maze of bizarre worlds for the key to his father's shattered mind. But deadly surprises lurk in the depths of the Metaverse…*

Thanks!

PREEMPTIVE TL;DR: Links to download my free novella in [kindle](http://db.tt/Qi2wZpOn) and [epub](http://db.tt/yNISuXty) formats.

I'm Christopher Ruz, a Melbourne based author who writes pulpy, sexy spy thrillers under the pseudonym D.D. Marks. My Olesia Anderson thriller series is a mashup of Bond and Bourne, with a bit of erotica stirred in. I've gotten great reader reactions so far on both Amazon and Goodreads, but I'm atrocious at publicity. So, with the release of the fifth Olesia Anderson story just last week, I thought it might be time to give away book 1 to interested readers.

&gt; Dirty Deals follows Olesia Anderson - sharpshooter, quick-talker, and corporate spy-for-hire - as she's given a second chance by her shadowy employers, the Blackrock Association. A Lockheed engineer has stolen the schematics for a new missile defence system, and Lockheed wants that data back... along with whoever he was planning to sell to.

&gt; It's supposed to be an easy job - get in, shake down the engineer, get out. But with a gorgeous foreign agent and a gang of uzi-toting teenage thugs thrown into the mix, Olesia will have a hard time keeping her head on her shoulders...

Dirty Deals is 24,000 words long - a quick, pulpy, action-packed read. The book is available free in [kindle](http://db.tt/Qi2wZpOn) and [epub](http://db.tt/yNISuXty) formats as a direct download (giving anything away through Amazon is one hell of a hassle, and a time limited giveaway doesn't seem fair to me).

Thanks for your time, and I'd love to hear what you think of my work. If you enjoy it, a quick tweet or review on Amazon or Goodreads would be fantastic. Take care!",,False,self,t5_2td0q,False,,,True,t3_1bmy0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/KindleFreebies/comments/1bmy0p/dirty_deals_the_first_in_a_series_of_sexy_spy/,

Synopsis and Info:

'Exiles of Arcadia' blends history and fantasy to create a world that is as real as the past and as personal as childhood.

Primus Seneca has lived most of his life in exile. Ten years ago his father led an army against the ruthless dictator Tiberius–and was crushed. Now the general plans his revenge from the snowy heart of the Boreal forest, and sixteen-year-old Primus is eager to join his father’s legion. But once he is sworn in, Primus begins to unravel family secrets that will shake his faith in the cause, his father, and the very nature of the gods.

'Legionnaire' is the literary debut of author James Gawley, a PhD student in Classics at the University at Buffalo. Read more at www.exilesofarcadia.com.
