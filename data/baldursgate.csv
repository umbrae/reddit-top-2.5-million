&gt; Dear Friends of Baldur's Gate,

&gt; We recently removed Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition from sale on Beamdog and the Apple App Store. We've taken this step at our publishing partner's request as we attempt to resolve a number of contractual issues.

&gt; Unfortunately, until this matter is resolved, we are unable to release the latest Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition patch or Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition for Android.

&gt; This also prevents the launch of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. I sincerely apologize to the series' fans and promise we are working diligently to remedy the situation.

&gt; Regards,  
&gt; Trent Oster  
&gt; President, Beamdog &amp; Overhaul Games

Also on the page is a small FAQ with info on Android, BG2:EE, and the upcoming patch:

&gt;- **I have already purchased Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog or the Apple App Store. Will I still be able to download and play my game?**  
&gt; Yes. If you have already purchased Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog or the Apple App Store, you can still download and play your game.

&gt;- **Why is all of this happening? What caused this issue?**  
&gt; We are unable to discuss details of the complex legal matters surrounding this issue at this time. Please be aware that we are extremely unhappy with the situation and are doing our best to work past it. We have put a lot of hard work into this series, and are eager for fans to see it.

&gt;- **When will Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition be available again?**  
&gt; Unfortunately, we cannot offer the game for sale until all issues with our publishing partner have been resolved. We do not have a specific date for when the game will be available again.

&gt;- **What is in the next Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition patch?**  
&gt; The next Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition patch features:

&gt;  - *An updated user interface that allows for high-resolution scaling and transparency.*
&gt;  - *A new renderer featuring enormous performance improvements, and compatibility enhancements for Intel graphics chipsets.*
&gt;  - *A new font system for sharper, clearer text.*
&gt;  - *Full German language support, including new German VO for the expanded content.*
&gt;  - *Subtitles in movies.*
&gt;  - *Over 135 gameplay fixes and enhancements.*
&gt;  - *We are unable to release this patch until all issues with our publishing partner have been resolved.*

&gt;- **What's the status of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition?**  
&gt; We have been developing Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition for some time now, but until all issues with our publishing partner are resolved we cannot officially announce or offer this game for sale. This has resulted in significant amounts of wailing and gnashing of teeth amongst the development team.

&gt;- **What's the status of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition for Android?**  
&gt; We cannot offer the game for sale until all issues with our publishing partner have been resolved.

It has come to my attention that Baldur's Gate is a very confusing game to those who haven't play 2nd Edition D&amp;D. In an effort to alleviate this somewhat, I am compiling a guide to character creation, the game's rules, and some basics of party composition. Beginners, you are welcome to use the guide in its current form. It shouldn't lead you too far astray. Experienced players, I would love to hear some feedback. Let me know what you think is good, what you think needs more work, and what needs to be added that the guide doesn't cover. Thanks bunches.

Here's why.",86,11,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/16psmx/if_you_buy_it_on_steam_for_convenience_sake/,"It appears that Atari went over Overhauls head and put BG:EE on Steam since they own the digital distribution rights and not Overhaul. It's bittersweet for me to see BG:EE on Steam for a few reasons.

**1)** In order to get BG:EE and BG2:EE up and running, Overhaul had to make a pretty harsh royalties deal with Atari. So by making another deal with Steam, Overhaul will see very little for each game sold through Steam. In fact Steam will get more money per game sold than the developers will.

""Royalty-wise, Steam is making way more than we are per copy, so it is a bit bittersweet."" **-Trent Oster via Baldur's Gate forum**


**2)** There are going to be people, probably a lot, who really want to play it on Steam. However, it is unlikely that Steam will allow Beamdog product keys of BG:EE to be used so that people are forced to purchase the game again on Steam. This is going to get a large group of people to ask for a refund from the developers at Beamdog so they can purchase it on Steam instead. By doing this, Overhaul loses a huge amount of money per game sold as it goes to Steam instead.

""This is through Atari, and I'm saddened to say we have not been able to reach an agreement around Steam keys yet. We're trying."" **-Trent Oster via Baldur's Gate forum**


**3)** Overhaul cannot push updates to Steam directly or even see how well the game is doing like they can through Beamdog. So when a patch gets pushed it will likely have to go through an additional process before it gets applied.

""Atari has the digital distribution rights for the Baldur's Gate license. We can't deal directly with Steam but we'll still receive a portion of the sales. We can't push updates ourselves and we won't know how well it's doing until Atari tells us."" **-Coriander, BGEE team member at their forums**

**TL;DR** Atari and Steam get most of the money, Overhaul loses out, Refunds from Beamdog to buy on Steam are deadly, and don't expect same day updates like on Beamdog. If you choose to buy it on Steam please also consider buying it on Beamdog to support the developers! Potentially cutting the amount of money the developers get is going to be detrimental to the possibility of another Baldur's Gate game.",,False,self,t5_2t07j,1358448236.0,,,True,t3_16psmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/16psmx/if_you_buy_it_on_steam_for_convenience_sake/,

Paypal funding (most recent report): ~$150,000

Total: **~$4,150,000**

Project Eternity is the most funded video game Kickstarter ever (EDIT: third most funded across all categories) and has received massive attention from the online community.  It is truly awesome to see the support they have received and the love they have for the project.  I plan to follow their updates very closely and anxiously await the release of Project Eternity.  I hope we can all appreciate the fact that, in the simplest terms, **we are getting a modern Baldur's Gate!**

Congratulations Obsidian, and well done everybody!


EDIT: As awesome and relevant as this is for us here at /r/baldursgate, there is an appropriate /r/projecteternity subreddit where most of the news and updates can/will be posted.  If you truly want to follow the details of the production, go check it out.  As for us here, of course any news on Project Eternity is still welcome as I am sure a majority of us are still interested, but for all the little updates and details, /r/projecteternity will probably stay better updated.

I've actually even dreamt about it a few times! I dreamt that I sat in a lively tavern, chatting with a sorcerer in trouble. Only a few things has sparked my imagination like this game has!


A lot of newer games try to be immersive by trying to make the graphics look as realistic as possible, but I feel like these games oft backfire. I often get very immersed, only to be pulled right out of the game when a dead guy suddenly starts to clip through the wall. Baldurs Gate's graphics are more like an impressionist painting, lacking detail but gaining in your imagination. I can fill in all the details myself! 


I actually played BG2 BEFORE the first one, but I did not at all get into it. I simply didn't understand the system, and I didn't know what I was doing. This time, playing BG1, I checked some tips videos on youtube. Doing that helped me a lot in understanding mechanics and such. Now I find the game really enjoyable, and rewarding. It is still a challenging game though, but hey.... you can't expect a party of naive younglings clearing out an Ankheg nest!


I love story based games, and these old Infinity games seem much easier to get into now that I have some experience. After BG1 I think I'll play Planescape: Torment while waiting for BG2:EE to come out, which I assume it will. I'm also looking forward to the new crpgs coming out; Project Eternity and Torment.

&gt; [For PC users, we have a beta big screen mode: put this into your baldur.ini file: 'Graphics', 'Scale UI', '0',](https://twitter.com/TrentOster/status/275683412579348482)

I have not seen mention of this in any of the recent posts here or threads on the forums.  I am unable to test it currently, but it sounds like it could solve some issues with the UI being too large on monitors.

How to edit baldur.ini:

1. Locate the baldur.ini file and create a backup.  It should be at My Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\baldur.ini
2. Open baldur.ini.  Preferably not in Notepad, but it works.  Wordpad works better.
3. Add the line to the end of the list like this:
 * 'Graphics', 'Hardware Mouse Cursor', '1', **'Graphics', 'Scale UI', '0'**);
4. Save baldur.ini.
5. Play BG:EE.

~~If you test it, try and put up a screenshot for the rest of us.  Thanks!~~

EDIT: /u/NapalmFrog has uploaded a trio of in-game shots with the UI scaling turned off:

* [Game view [2560x1440]](http://i.imgur.com/uRYK7.jpg)
* [Pause menu [2560x1440]](http://i.imgur.com/dDHPW.jpg)
* [Game map [2560x1440]](http://i.imgur.com/yuBMc.jpg)

/u/enderwalcott uploaded a pair of comparison screenshots to help as well:

* [Old and busted [1920x1080]](http://i.imgur.com/hcUqy.jpg)
* [New hotness [1920x1080]](http://i.imgur.com/hb7Qd.jpg)

There are some issues to be sorted out, but ideally this will get some official support and the option to toggle it in the Graphics menu.  EDIT: Trent has spoken:

&gt; [We'll add the button. The issue is scaling. We need to render all items at the same scale, so it is all or nothing](https://twitter.com/TrentOster/status/275720943429627904)

1360565538.0,38,self.baldursgate,18ap3p,[Under the Hood] How to get party NPCs to fight.,43,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/18ap3p/under_the_hood_how_to_get_party_npcs_to_fight/,"This is some info that might not be available all together anywhere. 

As you may know, a lot of party members in Baldur's Gate don't really like each other. But there are hidden interactions in the game that many players might not get to see.

So, how does the conflict system work? 

TL;DR: ~~poorly~~ Magic.

Long story: Ok, well sometimes you'll hear a party member call out another party member (or praise them, whatever), this moves the conflict staging forward, and after a certain number of antagonistic interactions (the number is randomly generated each time you load the game), there comes the chance for that check to give the option to fight. That chance is determined by a number of factors; the ""base chance"" that a fight has to occur, your PC's charisma score, and some other ""hidden"" factors for each NPC interaction. The thing to note is that the chances are tied to the NPC who initiates the fight, not tied to the fight itself occuring.

For example, let's take an familiar interaction. The easiest fight to see is the Edwin/Dynaheir (and Minsc) fight. Recruiting Dynaheir at Knoll Stronghold with Edwin in the party gives a scripted conflict, and though you can defuse it their through dialogue, they will eventually come to blows (100% base chance of occuring) after a certain amount of time antagonizing each other, that they get to make a chance to actually fight, ending with Minsc usually bashing Edwin's head in nine times out of ten. However, if you can split them up, having Minsc and Edwin will not actually trigger a fight, but will increase the chance of  Dynaheir and Edwin going at it one-on-one. In addition, there is another hidden modifier in having Alora in your party, which increases the amount of time they'll tolerate each other (i.e. weights the random number generator in favor of higher amount of interactions before they fight).

So for some specifics:

(The percentages were taken from the original game code, by Felinoid at Sorcerer's Palace, based on the likelihood of the conflict beginning dialogue being triggered)

* Edwin vs Dynaheir (100% for both, so basically whichever one rolls the lowest number of interactions before fighting.)

Other non-cooperative party members include:
 
* Khalid and Jaheira who have a serious beef with Xzar and Montaron (Base 50% chance), but Xzar and Montaron will never initiate it. 

* Eldoth who'll pick a fight with Shar-Teel (50%), and Shar-Teel who'll fight back (33%.)

* Quayle is disgusted by Tiax (33%) as is Branwen (10%), but Tiax will only attack Quayle (5%)

* Yeslick hates Kagain (29%).

* Ajantis who'll attack anyone who's evil (10% but you can call him off). 

In addition to these conflicts, there are a number of others that are programed in, but, with normal play (i.e. no cheat console), will never come to blows: Tiax can attack Branwen (0%), and Viconia and Kivan can also come to blows (base 0% for both of them starting it).

Here is a list of a number of ""known"" hidden modifiers (the ones marked with an * were gathered from corroborated personal testimonies around the internet and may not actually be modifiers, might just be coincidences. As far as I know there is no complete list).

* Your Reputation score: some conflicts will not happen with a high Rep, while the chance for others are increased, and vice versa. Usually, if the NPC is unhappy with your rep, the chance of conflict increases.

* The PC's Charisma is 17 or more (or if PC is a Paladin or Bard) will reduce the amount of conflicts to very, very low chances, the exceptions are Dynaheir vs Edwin, and Ajantis* (who doesn't give a fuck). 

* Alora is in the party: the Dynaheir/Edwin fight will take longer to occur.

* Xan is in the party: Ajantis will never attack anyone (Xan ""talks him out of it"").

* Having Minsc in the party: Reduces the chance of Dynaheir starting the fight to 50%. Does not affect Edwin's chance, though.

* Finishing the Naskel Mines quest increases the chance of the Khalid, Jaheira, Xzar and Montaron brawl*

* Refusing to mention Xzar and Montaron's similar mission to Naskel when first recruiting Khalid and Jaheira affects how soon they'll fight* (it's unknown if it increases or decreases it). However, the earliest they'll fight is upon leaving the Friendly Arm Inn, the first time after recruiting Jaheira and Khalid (confirmed).

* Having Quayle in the party will prevent Branwen from fighting Tiax (instead, for some reason it'll trigger Quayle's fight with Tiax, instead of Branwen's). This one is possibly a bug, which may explain with Tiax will never attack Branwen.

* Having Safana reduces the chance of Shar-teel fighting Eldoth, but having Skye in the party increases it.*

* And others.

1375105116.0,35,self.baldursgate,1j9wrp,Just finished Baldur's Gate for the first time. Here are my thoughts.,47,12,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/1j9wrp/just_finished_baldurs_gate_for_the_first_time/,"* **D&amp;D Mechanics are terrible for video games.**  Is anything less satisfying than the save/rest/oh-crap-random-enemies/reload/rest/rebuff cycle after every major fight?  Is it really tactical to rest &amp; ""relearn"" different spells, cycling through your entire spellbook, just to figure out which obscure buff counters the obscure curse this particular boss casts repeatedly? I posit: No.  These mechanics might not be so bad in a leisurely-paced tabletop game where a DM can adapt the challenges of the monsters ahead to match the characters who are playing with him, or ""speed up"" time where appropriate.  But in a computer game they are mostly tedious and I don't think they add any particular layer of strategy beyond ""save frequently so you can meta-game.""
*  **The tone is surprisingly modern.** Going into this game, I was thinking of it as a ""classic"" and ""Bioware's first ever RPG"" -- something from the past that later RPGs would build on.  But what's really striking about it is how not-classic it feels.  The tone alternates between serious and humorous quite suddenly, and both other video games and RPG cliches are frequently taken to task.  To top it all off, the protagonist - whose character is made evident via the journal entries and dialogue options - seems pretty cynical about the whole endeavor, frequently being outright sarcastic or otherwise belittling the predictability of the events around her.  Somewhat ironically, this ""classic"" almost reads as a parody of RPGs more than a genre-defining piece itself.
* **The protagonist is ""fixed"" not entirely unlike the way Shepard is.** Her options in dialogue frequently amounted to ""nice"" or ""nasty"" versions of the same thing, much like the conversation wheel in Mass Effect.  In some ways, Baldur's Gate is actually more linear than Mass Effect - there aren't any particularly big choices to be made.  You can generally be good or evil, and sometimes kill some dudes instead of talking (or talk instead killing some dudes), but despite hours of aimless wandering in the early game, the course is essentially fixed.  Considering all the internet fanboy whining about how much deeper and more sophisticated the older RPGs are supposed to be (when compared to modern Bioware stuff) this was surprising.
* **The expansion content is generally superior to the main game content.** Although the expansion content features less open exploration and more linear sidequests, I found most of it to be considerably more developed and interesting than the main game.  Better integration of story throughout the gameplay (rather than an infodump at the beginning/end of a quest) and more condensed, interesting content all-around. 
* **Christ, that was long.**  Speaking of content - this game is HUGE.  The scripted/main content alone is enormous, and if you count the time I spent dying/reloading, than this game easily ate up hundreds of hours of my life over the last few years.  I didn't do every little niggling quest, but I think I saw all of the major elements.
* **Character progression is really satisfying.** The double-edged sword of D&amp;D is that, since the combat is so hard and the save/rest/rebuff system so infuriating, every little improvement in your characters stats (mostly via items, not leveling) makes a huge difference and feels very good.  Maybe for not totally the right reasons, though.

I'd apprecaite any feedback that you guys have.

Edit:  To give you an example of what I mean, while I really enjoy Warcraft 2; I can't in good conscience recommend it to veterans of modern day RTS.  Simply due to the lack of being able to designate groups, and being only able to select 9 units; it becomes unplayable for those use to those mechanics.

But I guess I'm not just looking at it it tersm of gameplay, but it terms of graphics, story, pacing, etc.

I Started a new game on a whim and figured, ""Disregard plot, defeat Drizzt Do'urden"" I basically sent up my whole Multiplayer party around mirroring/countering/defeating his adventuring group. Halfling assasin(regis), Dwarven Fighter(Bruenor), Elf Ranger with dual wielding(Drizzt), Half-orc berserker(Wulfgar), Elven Archer,(Cattie-brie) and a human wizard (Harkle Harpel). I built the whole game with trying to match/defeat them as well as carry out the plot in mind.

I even name my main character Drizzt Do'urden. [Important]

All items went to mirroring or countering them. I got the lion summoning statue to counter guen, got the best armor and equipment I could. (Side note... Elven archer with the plus 3 bow and armed with the Equalizer is one of the most devastating characters ever.)

So I play through the whole game looking to live out a childhood fantasy and play with and against Drizzt Do'urden. Here's the kicker... I come out of the underdark and move on getting very excited to play with my childhood hero. 

Apparently they designed the AI specifically to counter people with my dreams. Drizzt got VERY pissed at my use of his name and attacked me without any option to be on the same team. Just called me out for copying him and attacked. So i couldn't play with him. All I could do was kill him...

I grew up playing Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment when they came out, and only recently gave Icewind Dale a shot.  I had always heard it was the lesser of the Infinity Engine Holy Trinity, and in many ways it is.  

Perhaps it's just my fondness for the other games, and my long un-quenched thirst to play them as if for the first time, but Icewind Dale is a truly incredible experience so far.  What it lacks in storyline/lore or NPC banter it makes up in other areas.

First off, I think it feels the most like an actual pen &amp; paper D&amp;D experience out of the three titles.  Your party has hardly any backstory, there is no ""main"" character, and there's more dungeon crawling than the other titles.  I feel that the lack of a main character or any banter helps me get attached to all the members of my party rather than a single one as I can easily imagine their opinions and interactions.

I also feel that the game is mechanically very sound.  There's still some clunkiness to the UI which was fixed in the later games, but generally it just feels like the level progression, difficulty curve, and loot progression was done better than the other games.

So, I'd love to hear other opinions on IWD (or IWD2) - what did you like/dislike about it?  Is my view just completely clouded by my thirst for a new Infinity Engine game, or is it as good as I think?",,False,self,t5_2t07j,False,,chaos,True,t3_1dcrtx,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/1dcrtx/i_am_really_enjoying_icewind_dale_the_first_one/,

*Greetings fellow Bhaalspawn!*

With the release of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition approaching, we are all getting very excited.  We (the mods) wanted to do a little something to show our appreciation for your dedication to this community and to celebrate the rebirth of our favorite game.

We could think of no better way than to hold a contest for all of you with **five (5)** copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition up for grabs (and maybe even some custom flair).  Even better, there is not just one contest, but **three contests!**  We are extremely excited to be able to offer you all this opportunity and cannot thank Trent and the Overhaul team enough for making this possible.

Before I get into the details of the individual contests, there are a couple basic rules we need to enforce across all three contests:

1. **Only accounts created on or before 11/21 with positive comment karma will be allowed entry.**
2. **Only reply to this post as an entry to the contest.  There will be an official reply to this post for questions and discussion.**
3. **The contests end on Tuesday, November 27 at noon EST (17:00 UTC/09:00 PST).  No late entries will be accepted.**

Other than that, play nice and have fun!

***
##Contest 1: Murder Mystery!

Prizes: 1 Copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*There is a murderer wandering the Sword Coast as we speak! Nashkel native Noober was found, murdered, in his home last night.  With the iron crisis, increased bandit activity, and Commander Brage on the run from the law, the town of Nashkel has requested your assistance in the investigation of this grisly crime.  The local officers have determined the body has been moved from the original location of the murder and that there was sea salt caked in the victim's hair.  Additionally, the victim died from a series of slashes and stab wounds, but none higher than his stomach.  If you can help solve this case, the reward will be great indeed!*

This contest is similar to the board game ""Clue"" if you are familiar with it.  However, we will not be releasing any further clues aside from what is in the notice above.  In order to win the copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, you must correctly guess the **location** of the murder, the **murder weapon** used, and the **name of the murderer**.  We know there is little to go on, so this is a bit of a guessing game.  But, with the clues available, your options should be greatly narrowed down.  Again, in a reply to this post, you must correctly guess:

1. The name of the murderer (restricted to recruitable NPCs available in BG1+TotSC)
2. The murder weapon used (restricted to weapons available in BG1+TotSC)
3. The murder location (restricted to overland locations available in BG1+TotSC)

Anyone found posting multiple entries will be disqualified.

All we can say is, good luck!  If multiple entries are correct, the winner will be randomly selected from among the correct entries.  If none of the entries happen to be correct, we will award the prize to the person who guessed the closest and if there are multiple equally close entries, the winner will be randomly selected from among them.
***
##Contest 2: Trivia!

Prizes: 1 Copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*Puzzled are you, by the murder so grim?*

*Maybe your mind is a little bit dim.*

*Seen all there is in this land, the Sword Coast?*

*Finish my quiz first, and then you can boast.*

Okay, bad rhyming aside, this contest is pretty simple.  There are a series of trivia questions below relating to content in Baldur's Gate+Tales of the Sword Coast.  Get them all right and you can win a copy of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.  In order to enter, you must **PM your answers to me** before the end of the contest.  Do not include your answers to the trivia in a reply to this post please.  Any posts found with answers to the trivia questions, even if incorrect, will be removed and the user disqualified.  We want to keep it fair for everyone.  Now for the questions:

1. In your very home of Candlekeep you are attacked by a pair of would-be assassins.  What are the names of these two?
2. Near the ambush after leaving Candlekeep, there is an item stashed in the trunk a tree.  What is it?
3. The artist Prism required emeralds to truly bring life to the face of his sculpture. Who was he sculpting?
4. In the heart of the bandit camp stands the leader of the Black Talon, Taugosz Khosan.  What is his nickname?
5. Infiltrating the Cloakwood Mines you find a pair of Boots of Speed.  What was the catchphrase of the original owner of the boots?
6. The Thieves Guild in the city of Baldur's Gate took a liking to you.  What is the password to enter their hideout?
7. A famous priest is visiting Candlekeep when you return.  Who is it?
8. If you are arrested by the Flaming Fist when you return to Baldur's Gate, you can escape with some help.  Who helps you escape the Flaming Fist prison?
9. The Demonknight who has taken over Durlag's Tower has a powerful artifact to assist him in battle.  What is it?
10. After travelling the entirety of the Sword Coast, you encounter many colorful characters.  Who is your favorite?

Remember, your entry for the trivia contest **must be PMed to me**, not included in a reply to this post.  Any posts found with answers to the trivia, no matter how (in)correct, will be removed and the user disqualified.  Also, only one entry per person.  There is no rush beyond getting the entry in before the end of the contest, so take your time to perfect your entry.  After you have entered, **you will not be allowed to adjust your entry**.

I imagine we will get a number of correct entries for this contest, so, again, the winner will be randomly selected from among the correct entries.  There is no benefit to being the first one to answer.  We want everyone to have a chance to enter.
***
##Contest 3: Raffle!

Prizes: 3 Copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

*Ok, I've just about had my FILL of riddle asking, quest assigning, insult throwing, pun hurling, hostage taking, iron mongering, smart arsed fools, freaks, and felons that continually test my will, mettle, strength, intelligence, and most of all, patience! If you've got a straight answer ANYWHERE in that bent little head of yours, I want to hear it pretty damn quick or I'm going to take a large blunt object roughly the size of Elminster AND his hat, and stuff it lengthwise into a crevice of your being so seldom seen that even the denizens of the nine hells themselves wouldn't touch it with a twenty-foot rusty halberd! Have I MADE myself CLEAR?!*

This contest is the easiest of them all.  Anyone who replies to this post will be entered into a raffle to win one of three copies of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.  Even better, if you entered a guess in the murder mystery contest, **you are already entered for the raffle!**  If you reply to enter the raffle and later decide to try for the murder mystery, simply edit your original reply with your answers for the murder mystery.  Remember, only one entry per person.

***

We hope you all find these contests as fun to enter as we have had creating them.  Remember, **all contests end Tuesday, November 27 at noon EST (17:00 UTC/09:00 PST).**  Any entries received after that time will not count.  Hopefully the contests and rules are straightforward enough.  If anyone has questions, there will be an official reply to this post where you may ask questions or discuss the contests.

1355975026.0,24,self.baldursgate,155cpx,How to get GOG's Baldur's Gate II Complete running semi-natively on linux,28,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/155cpx/how_to_get_gogs_baldurs_gate_ii_complete_running/,"Hello, children of Bhaal! Today, I downloaded [Baldur's Gate II Complete from GoodOldGames](http://www.gog.com/gamecard/baldurs_gate_2_complete) at $9.99 (a bargain, if you ask me, considering it will take &gt;100 hours to get through SoA + ToB), which was a risk, as I currently do not have windows. I couldn't get it working well with Wine, but I found an even better solution. There is a project called GemRB which allows you to run Infinity Engine games natively under Linux (after installation with Wine). I ran into a multitude of problems, but I have it working beautifully now at 1280x1024 resolution. Here is a guide so no one has to endure the same headaches. Be ready to get your hands dirty. Also, thank god for open-source software.
    
* First, install BGII by using wine to run the GoG setup file. If you encounter an error (such as I did) that says too many winprocs are running, you'll have to follow some extra steps (**EDIT: See edit below**): 
    1. Remove wine from your system (Save any configs if you want to use them later)
    2. Download the latest Wine source [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Source/wine-1.5.19.tar.bz2/download).
    3. Extract the source package, navigate to /dlls/user32/winproc.c
    4. On lines 48 and 49, MAX_WINPROCS and MAX_WINPROC_RECURSION are set to 4096 and 64. Change them to 8192 and 128, respectively (A janky-ass workaround, but it works and hasn't caused any problems for me).
    5. cd to ../../tools, run ./wineinstall. This will compile wine, and it might take an hour or two (not kidding). As the installer says, you should probably go out to lunch or rent a movie or something.
    6. Run winecfg to set up wine for first time configuration.
    7. NOW you can run the GOG setup file with wine.
* Download GemRB from wherever you want... If you're on Arch, it's [in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=15281). I believe it's in the Ubuntu Software Center. Search around, and you should find it.
* Copy /etc/gemrb/GemRB.cfg sample to ~/.gemrb/GemRB.cfg and use GemRB.cfg to set up your game. Some tips here:
    1. Every CD path should point to *your/wine/install/location/Baldur's Gate 2/data/*. The GamePath should be set to */your/wine/install/location/Baldur's Gate 2*. 
    2. gemRBPath should point to */usr/share/gemrb/*
    3. PluginsPath should point to */lib/gemrb/plugins/*
    4. If you need any more help with this, run ""man gemrb"".

* Run your game simply by typing ""gemrb"" or using the gemrb binary executable that you got when you downloaded and installed GemRB.

Have fun! Higher resolutions should be supported pretty well. 

Also, I had a problem with mouse scrolling speed that I fixed by adding:
    
    Mouse Scroll Speed=50
    Keyboard Scroll Speed=100

under [Game Options] in Baldur's Gate 2/baldur.ini.

This has been tested on Arch i686. I can't promise anything, but I can damn near guarantee that it will work on your distro.

I got Shadowkeeper working for BGEE. Here's what I did:

1. Follow directions for Windows in the OP at http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/6950/player-how-to-getting-mods-to-work-on-bgee/p1
2. This will allow you to access Item/Spell/Creature Browsers, but no saved games. The following steps will allow saved games as well:
3. [Open an elevated command prompt.](http://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/69221-how-open-elevated-command-prompt.html) If you are using Windows XP, and your user is in the Administrators group, a normal command prompt will do. The link above is for Vista/Win7 users.
4. Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data\00766 or wherever your chitin.key file is
5. Type the following:

    mklink /J .\save\ ""C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\save""        
6. Run Shadowkeeper. It will probably tell you your installation path is incorrect, or it will load your legacy BG2 installation.
7. Go to Settings, then Installation Directory.
8. Browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data\00766\ or wherever your chitin.key file is saved.
9. Click OK. It will warn you that the Shadows of Amn executable was not found, and if you are sure. Click Yes.
10. It will tell you to restart Shadowkeeper. Do so, and you're in.

Backing up your saved games before editing is HIGHLY recommended, even moreso than before.

That's all!

1349153832.0,23,self.baldursgate,10sw9q,Why are some people so defensive about the idea of adding extra multiclass options (e.g. Druid/Mage) in BG:EE?,25,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/10sw9q/why_are_some_people_so_defensive_about_the_idea/,"While reading some threads on the official forums, I noticed some very outspoken positions regarding the addition of additional multiclass options. ""It's not true to the original game."" ""It'd (further) unbalance some classes."" Granted, some of the requests--like fighter/mage/cleric/thief--are a bit ridiculous/munchkin-y. However, I believe others would legitimately add some extra flavor to the game. 

For example, in the BG2 manual, due to a possible typo or forgotten revision, half-elves are stated to have fighter/druid, druid/mage, and fighter/mage/druid as multiclass options. Obviously, only fighter/druid was implemented. Beyond the manual, if you were to go back to the 2nd edition rules, you could also have combinations such as ranger/druid or even ranger/mage (from what I gathered from other forums; I don't have any personal experience before 3e pnp). 

I understand balance would be an issue, and the main focus of BG:EE isn't to add more classes (rather, it's to add more content and make the game accessible). But if they **did** take the time to add more combinations, would it really be a bad thing? I don't see how it would really impact those who don't want the extra options. It's not like if I played a druid/mage in my game then it would ruin someone else's personal game. And if I personally didn't want the new combos, I just wouldn't play them.

Perhaps if classes are externalized (not sure if that's the right term) sufficiently, mods will pick it up.

(possible spoilers),25,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/p5pjd/what_was_your_first_time_playing_baldurs_gate/,"Did you start from BG1 or was SoA or ToB your first exposure to the bhaalspawn saga? What class did you play? Who was in your first party? What do you remember about your initial impressions? Were you a D&amp;D noob, or did you come from other forgotten realm computer games and/or PnP? 

My first experience with the game was when I was in 7th grade shortly after Shadows of Amn was released in 2001. My friend's older brother blew through the game as he had played the first game and was eager for the second. My friend and I sat in the closet that his family computer was kept in and spent hours creating characters, playing through Irenicus' dungeon, and exploring Amn. I remember the quest arc through the slums district blowing me away the most. I was pretty much instantly sold and bought it at Wal-Mart for myself shortly after. I had had no prior experience with D&amp;D and very little experience with computer games. In fact I think it was the first one I ever bought for myself.

My first character was a fighter/mage/thief because I had no idea what was powerful and figured that 3 classes is better than one. I absolutely loved pick pocketing everyone so most of my thief skills went to that. I didn't have any mind for tactics so all of my mage spells went to strait up damage spells, and most of the time I just ended up meleeing everything anyway. My first party was the first 5 good/neutral people I ran into so: Minsc, Jaheria, Arie, Anoman and Yoshimo. I remember getting pissed in Spellhold when Yoshimo betrayed me and getting Imoen back, severely underleveled. I ditched her as soon as possible and picked up Jan, who was still underleveled but a hilarious character to have around where as Imoen just seemed whiny. I didn't really get into the game play and mechanics until my second and third playthough usually, but I found the story and fights so engrossing and epic that it kept me going. I learned about cheat codes not far into my first playthough, (editing the .ini file made me feel kind of like a hacker) so I abused the hell out of them. I ctrl+J'd around all of the maps and spammed ctrl+R'd on my party though most fights (and still was not able to kill any of the dragons). Despite all of this noobishness I rushed home from school every day to play and have come back to the game and played BG1 - ToB+Ascension at least 4 times since then. I hope I never get tired of this series.

My friend and I found Suldanessellar hilarious because we pronounced it ""Sold-in-a-cellar,"" and to this day we are still able to recite the opening lines of the torture scene and shadow thieves invasion in the beginning. "" 'MORE. INTRUDERS. HAVE ENTERED. THE COMPLEX. MASTER.' 'They ACT sooner than we had anticipated...No matter, they will only prove a slight delay...' ""

Also the manual for this game was amazing. I still read over it occasionally, mostly for nostalgia's sake.

Ok, I should stop here because I can go on forever.

UPDATE!! -
The trapping Drizzt between removed party member strategy works. For them to not walk away, make sure you are standing right next to them. When Drizzt can't escape from the formation, ask them to leave one by one and make sure you are close to them so they don't move away and only just stand to talk to you. Do this for each character and if they come as a group like Dynaheir and Minsc then you need to keep them on one side when you drop them from the group so they don't both move away from position. Once all four npc have been removed from your party list they'll trap Drizzt in the middle and then you can rain arrows and summon monsters at him.

1354666912.0,20,self.baldursgate,14aj68,[BGEE] Game Update #2 - Build 2009,26,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/14aj68/bgee_game_update_2_build_2009/,"In case anybody missed the announcement bar, a new patch for BG:EE has been released.  [Here is the official forum post.](http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/10340/game-patch-1-0-2009)

&gt; As Trent pointed out [Here](http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/10327/new-game-update-2-build-2009), a new patch has been released, which will update your game to 1.0.2009 when you install it from the launcher/client.

&gt; By popular demand (and because, really, I should have posted one last time too), here's a list of the fixes that have been implemented with this patch:

&gt; Crash Fixes:

&gt; - Multiplayer connecting to non-host bug fixed

&gt; - Fixed Right click map crash bug

&gt; - Crash reporting has been improved

&gt; - Fixed crash for OpenGL drivers that don't support compression

&gt; Text/Localization Fixes:

&gt; - Fixed Neera dialogue problem with Edwin in party

&gt; - Fixed Rasaad dialog loop

&gt; - Updates to English, French, German text

&gt; - Fixed Dorn looping dialogue problem

&gt; - Fixed Neera and Rasaad item descriptions

&gt; - Bastard sword strength requirement description updated to 11

&gt; - Help tooltip says 'Help' instead of 'Rest'

&gt; - Fix for Half-Orc Biography

&gt; Added or Improved/Fixed Features:

&gt; - Version # now displays on main screen

&gt; - Added support for 'Program Options', 'Maximum Frame Rate' 

&gt; - Fixed function key assignment issues

&gt; - Added autosave for Start of Black Pits

&gt; - Added toggle for hardware mouse cursor

&gt; - Improved Mouse Wheel support

&gt; - Min/max damage correctly displays strength modification

&gt; General Fixes:

&gt; - Dorn stuck in Kryll cutscene fixed

&gt; - Fixed Dorn movement on early Kryll letter retrieval

&gt; - Fixes Gallus in the Black pits proficiency selection

&gt; - Disabled stairs in tutorial until Belt tells you to use them

&gt; - Lothander / Rasaad bug fixed

&gt; - Flaming Fist reputation loss bug fixed

&gt; - Neera plot Thayan bodyguard XP fixed

&gt; - Fixed party members attacking each other bug

&gt; - Tranzig not using spells fixed

&gt; - Fixed Neera is busy and won't rejoin party bug

&gt; IMPORTANT: Send us your .dmp files!

&gt; In order to fix things more efficiently, the developers have asked that .dmp files be brought to their attention. A .dmp file is important for finding the source of a crash, which then makes preventing future crashes easier.

&gt; If your game crashes, the game now creates a .dmp file under Documents\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\crash, which you can email directly to me at beamdmp@gmail.com and I'll make sure it gets seen. These .dmp files are invaluable for figuring out not just what's happening on your system, but also why it's causing your game to crash, which will allow the developers to find a solution.

&gt; Finally--and this is very important: Do not install a mod on your game unless it has been confirmed to be compatible with the Enhanced Edition. This is ultimately the root cause of a lot of the problems people are experiencing (or enough to warrant this reminder, at least). If you're wanting to use a favorite mod, just be patient; a lot of the modders are beta testers so they've had a bit of a head start, but it still may take some time to update all of them. Installing the old mods can cause instabilities in your game, which may cause the game to crash or render it otherwise unplayable.

***
EDIT: [Regarding crashes and being unable to start the game](http://forum.baldursgate.com/discussion/comment/177296/#Comment_177296):

&gt; The problem is the non-start issue is a variety of a bunch of different issues depending on the person.

&gt; There is a fix there for some drivers that don't support compression, so this should fix a few more - in addition, the executable had the vc libraries linked a bit ago, so that should fix some more... 

&gt; Step #1 for anyone who can't start the game, though: UPDATE YOUR VIDEO CARD DRIVERS!

&gt; http://www.geforce.com/ nVidia

&gt; http://game.amd.com/ AMD/ATi

&gt; http://www.intel.com/ Intel

&gt; We're still crushing bugs as we can. IF YOU CRASH after getting this update, send me a message - I'd like you to send me your crash dump file so that we can get some more information on what's causing the crash issues for people.

Looks like a good list and a good start to ""Patch Week"".

1351795013.0,23,self.baldursgate,12gxts,New and Improved Sidebar,23,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/12gxts/new_and_improved_sidebar/,"Greetings fellow Bhaalspawn!

I am constantly astounded by the dedication of the Baldur's Gate fanbase and so proud to be a part of it.  The activity generated in this subreddit is truly amazing.  There are always newcomers with questions on getting started and veterans with wisdom and stories from years of experience.  You all have made this subreddit a resounding success (there are almost 2,500 of us now!).  Keep up the good work!

****
As for the updates, I would just like to take a moment to point out a few of the new bits of the sidebar.

1. We have an announcement bar!  Okay, maybe this is cheating as it is not part of the sidebar and I am sure you have noticed by now (it has been up for almost 2 weeks).  If there is something truly exciting going on, expect it to update, but for the most part it will remain with a default message similar to what it is currently.

2. GOG.com is not the only place to buy Baldur's Gate online.  Sure it is convenient and has its perks, but it is only fair to point out alternatives.  GamersGate is the only one that I have found, but if you know of others, please let us know!

3. There are so many resources online for the Baldur's Gate games.  Mechanics summaries and overviews, walkthroughs, comprehensive guides of areas, items, monsters, npcs, etc.  These are just the best ones I know of.  Again, if you know of others, please let us know. EDIT: Other Infinity Engine games were not explicitly included because of space restrictions and relevance.  However, many sources of Baldur's Gate information also have resources for the other IE games, so similar information is still close at hand.

4. Modding for Baldur's Gate is still very active and has been seeing a resurgence with the Enhance Edition announcement.  Not to mention all of the older mods which are still perfectly functional and useful.  Hopefully, between all the resources included, anyone can find whatever mod they are looking for.

5. I am making a separate point for this because of its subjective nature, but the ""Recommended Mods"" section is not supposed to be a list of everybody's favorite mods.  It is just a bare minimum of the best mods to make the games their most enjoyable at a basic level.  These are the mods you should be able to refer any newcomer to and say, ""You need these to play the game.""  Hence BGT/EasyTutu and Widescreen being the only ones listed for the time being.  If everyone can agree on some of the fixpacks/tweaks to be included, they can be added, but the list should remain small.

6. There is now a ""Related Subreddits"" section.  Right now it is rather short, but if anybody has recommendations, that would be great.  Keep in mind, things like /r/gaming and /r/games are popular enough that we do not need to include them.


That should be all of it.  If anyone has any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, please speak up!",,False,self,t5_2t07j,1351795310.0,,level,True,t3_12gxts,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/12gxts/new_and_improved_sidebar/,moderator

Ive tried google but im having a hard time figuring out what class to play so i decided that once again reddit shall be my knight in shiny armor!

There are a few classes that intruiges me and i need your expertise people. First off

The Archer! I always liked archers but i have no idea how to make an archer in BG. Do i take a ranger or a fighter? or a thief? What does a ranger have that a fighter does not? I am really lost on this one.

Secondly, the Paladin! Is there actualy anyting more to the paladin outside of being a fighter with the Turn undead ability? why does charisma benefit the paladin and how the hell do i put stats in FOUR different attributes?! Is a cleric a viable choice as a paladin-like character or are clerics more wixard like spellcasters than heavy armor wearing spellcasters?

Lastly, the Wizard and the Thief! With these guys there are actually onlt one simple question... Should i stay away from them the first time i play? Im comparing BG to NWN but with BG being a more ""hardcore"" game and since wizards are borderline worthless early on in nwn, will i even get past the early game as a wizard in bg? not to mention as a thief.

Ok guys, I've been working on a tutorial all day today.  I've tried to keep it as simple and as accurate as possible.  I've already done one successful install using it on a spare computer I had.  I've included many screen shots to help with the process.  I'm still going through it double checking everything, I have two things left to do - format it for easy ready, and host the 5 files.  I want to have everything hosted in one spot so you don't have to do like I did and search the internet for hours trying to find exactly what you need with so many broken links out there right now.  If anyone has an idea of the best way to host them please let me know - its literally only 22mb for all 5.  In the mean time I'm going to be double checking everything.  Thanks!


Hey guys,


I'm just wondering if anyone else is playing the big world project.  For those that don't know - its a mod that essentially installs a MASSIVE amount of mods for BG1&amp;2.  Tons of new areas to explore, items, major quests, side quests, NPC's, romances - everything.  (To put it in a different perspective, my Baldur's Gate folder is now over 48GB - not a typo)


Honestly, with as much content as it has it feels like a BG3.


With that said, I haven't seen anyone on this board say a word about it...


I *think* this might be because much of the installation info for BWP is outdated - many of the links for necessary files are missing or are hard to find.  I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a detailed write up that we could put in the side bar.  I saved all the files that I needed and I scoured the internet trying to make sure I had everything I needed - in other words, it was at least 5-6 hours of searching and troubleshooting.


Mods - Would something like this be side-bar worthy?  I can't tell you how frustrated I was to find 3-4 installation guides that had wrong or incomplete or outdated info.

I was light on tankage so i was trying to make hay with things like aerie and haerdalise.

he was unstoppable

he was one hit stunning aerie, he was knocking my tanks up the stairs and out the door. to this day, korgan might not have landed yet

most of the party couldn't even hit him and nobody was scoring any serious damage. it was like stick fighting with a cement wall


.... but oddly nobody in my party was dying either so it dragged out for an unnaturally long time, to boot
mage spells were emptied, clerics ran dry as i fired off every last vestige of arcane goo in a desperate attempt to do something, anything

potions were burnt through like diet coke at a mentos convention

it was beyond hopeless. It was futile. I fought for all i was worth, but i was losing, bad, and I knew it
and finally, just as the last glimmer of a vestage of hope was dying away
there was a most anticlimactic little POOF and the big red dragon was no more


and I'm like, what? Then i'm like, WHAT THE HELL? I spent the next ten minutes cycling back through the dialogue trying to figure out what i had missed.....


turns out jan jantzen had lobbed a chromatic orb at him, and the big guy failed the save.


and lo, did jan throw back his head and unleash a roar of triumph, a roar of victory, a roar that would make any stalwart barbarian tremble at the threat of being morphed into a squirrel, just like a certain unfortunate red dragon, on this mighty day of turnips.

So.

I ask you folks, where should I start? I assume that I'll want to do at least some patching/mods/etc, if only for resolution support. I already own all of the titles via GOG, but I also have ready access to the 'original discs' if that aids with the installation process. Once I have the game installed (I'm not afraid of a multi-step command-line intensive process), what class would be best to start out as -- assuming that I'd take the character straight through?

I started replaying it a couple of days ago and I remembered what i hated the most about BG2.. magic users...

I find enemy wizards are ridiculously hard to deal with. They buff themselves with lots of defensive buffs. They throw spells that deal insane amounts of damage. They use status effects on my party that almost always hits (charm, etc..)

When i finished the game years ago, i used a lot of cheap tactics against them like: 
1.summoning hordes of monsters from afar as cannon fodder, then sleeping, then summoning again until all the powerful spells of the enemy is spent.

2.spamming yoshino's traps before combat, sleep, then more spamming.

Although it got the job done, it's feels kinda cheap to do. I want to fight them head on, but i feel I will just get obliterated by enemy wizards. Any tips for this BG2 player?

(i.e. against the party of douches led by a dwarf in the inn, just outside the first dungeon. I think it's a typical example of a hard encounter. A fighter that hits like a truck, a rogue backstabbing me, a wizard and imp throwing tons of crap at me... I had to retry a lot of times.

I am writing this because I am in the middle of writing my Master Thesis in marketing and business innovation, and I was in the lucky position of being allowed to write about computer games industry, and using Baldurs Gate as a case study. So in trying to  use the Baldurs Gate subreddit, to help me gather data, I am writing here.    
    



So what do I need from you?
Well my thesis are taking on one of the big questions: Why do people make mods…? (It might be phrased just a little bit different in my paper, but that is the idea of it) 
…And to answer this question, I need you to help me.    
   

So you might be thinking, ehmm what does this require from me, will it be costly, will it be time consuming etc.? 
Well – Firstly I need you to answer some questions, either as answers in this thread, or if you are a bit more shy, via a PM message to me. 
Then I need you to indicate, if you will be interested in helping my further by letting me contact you, with follow up questions, and maybe an interview (can be done with Skype or another preferred communication form, both in text or voice). If you do not feel like being contacted further, I will still very much like to have your answers , just answer no to the last question and then I will bother you no more – just don’t let the contacting part being the reason that that you reject answering the questions in this thread…    

   
So what will you get for doing this:
Well, since I am a poor student, the thing you will mostly get is a very nice “feel good” feeling in your stomach, for helping another in need, and maybe you also end up learning a thing or two about you own secret and dark motives for being part of the modding community (but I can not guaranty it).
So if you are up for it please answer the following questions either in a comment in this thread, or in a PM to me, if you feel your answers will be to private for a public  forum:    

    

We start with a typical ASL, set up, so:     
What is your age?
What is your gender?
What country are you from?     
     

Then I also need some specifics about your relationship with Baldurs Gate:    
What was the first Baldurs Gate game you played (BG1 (with or without ToSC),BG2 (With or without ToB) or BG:EE)?
When did you play your first BG game? (Just in general terms, like “when it came out”, “Years after it came out”, “just recently” etc.)
Which of the games and its expansions have you played, and have you finished them? (BG1, BG2, BG:EE, ToSW, ToB)
Have you played through any BG games more than once? If yes, which ones?     
    

And now I need some information about what my thesis is actually about: 
Have you ever successfully made a modification to any BG game? (Succesfully here meaning, could you still play the game after the modification was made and the modification did modify something inside your game)
If yes, what? (If you have modified many things, then just make 1-2 examples, and list the rest generally (like weapons mods, NPC mods etc.)  
-	In which game(s)?
Do you consider yourself a “modder”? 
-	Why/Why not?
If you consider yourself a modder, please answer the following questions, if not, just skip these questions:
Why do you decide to start a new project?
Do you make mods that you do not use in your own games? If yes, why?
How do you get your ideas? (Could be other people that have requested something, or your own needs for a solution to a specific “problem”, or something completely different)
Do you enjoy modding, while you are doing it?
If you had to finish the sentence:” I would rather spend my time modding than…” what would you finish the sentence with? Please give at least three possible answers.     
     


Okay second to last section of questions (we are almost there…) (And the people not identifying as modders can jump back on the wagon here):
Do you ever download mods for any BG game? 
If yes, what mods do you typically download? (Just list them, if it is more than one)
Why do you download those mods? (If more types, just list a short explanation for each one)
Would you enjoy BG games less/more/the same if there were no mods available?
Can you identify mods that are, in your opinion, the same or better quality, as the core game?         

     
Okay last section, a bit about your playing habits generally:
What game genres do you play the most (Maximum 3 answers)?
When buying a game, does it influence your choice, whether the game can be modified or not?
Which games have you played recently (last 3-6 months)?      

    

And, will you allow me to contact you for further questions or interview?     

    
With hope that many of you will help me by answering this,

I may not be quite as visibly active as I used to be, but I still check in regularly throughout the day (and have some projects behind the scenes, but shhh!).

As for today, I am pushing out the work I have done on some new flair options.  Up until now, we really did not use flair except for the occasional official account or as contest rewards.  But an idea came to me a while back and I thought I had a pretty decent idea for some flair options.  You can now choose to edit your flair and select from a range of 165 [in](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/od1B0zUeuZXDaDAz.png)-[game](http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/e9h_lUbvPOgUAWV6.png) [status](http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/L7JUHi5PPWkjaaly.png) [symbols](http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sUOBoo5GHp0Z9CBr.png).

Additionally, I am unlocking the ability for you to customize the flair text as well.  It took me a while to decide to allow this, but it should be set up so as not to cause unneeded clutter.  For the accounts which previously had unique flair, I am looking into setting up something slightly more special.

I realize some symbols are missing from the listing, but as I find them/time, I will add them.  Also, I am aware a number of them are difficult to make out on such a bright, white background.  It will not be a problem forever, but for now we will have to make do.

I hope you all enjoy!

EDIT: I have uploaded a new sheet of images.  It looks like a couple of the old ones broke in the process, so if your's is not showing up, you should just have to reset it.  There appear to be some slight spritesheet overlap kinks I need to work out.  Also, the bams from BG2/BG:EE handle the transparent parts of the icons a little differently from the original BG, which means a few of them are a little tough to make out.  A darker background would probably alleviate this, but I will see what I can do to get them looking decent[.](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WnoSlbBcGoHWBQrV.jpg)

EDIT2: Fixed some graphical issues caused by spritesheet overlaps.

1320148902.0,19,self.baldursgate,lwc38,Just beat BG1 for the first time! My thoughts...,21,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/lwc38/just_beat_bg1_for_the_first_time_my_thoughts/,"First off, I loved the game. If what follows sounds like a laundry list of complaints, it's pure nitpickery and nothing more. This has been one of the finest RPG experiences I've ever encountered, and am looking forward to ripping through the rest of the Infinity Engine games soon. Now then, these nits aren't going to pick themselves...

My first problem: I hate the magic system. I think it's clunky and discourages experimentation. My PC was a mage and I spent most of the game literally sitting on the sidelines throwing rocks at enemies because I wanted to save my spells for a really hard battle. I also don't understand it from a RPing perspective; How the heck can you ""memorize"" multiple copies of the same spell? Why do you forget it after casting it?

My second problem is with how brutally you are punished for not saving after every few steps. Don't get me wrong, I loved the challenge this game provided. It's way harder than any other RPG I can think of. But when you're walking down a hall and spring a trap that kills half your party, that's not challenging; it's a cheap shot, and it's even worse after half an hour or more of unsaved progress. There weren't a lot of these moments in the game, but the handful I came across irked me.

There isn't enough equipment, especially in shops. At the end of the game I had something like 100,000 gold and nothing to spend it on. After the first few trips to the blacksmith, the only things I needed to buy were arrows and bullets. More often than not, the stuff you do find in dungeons isn't even that exciting; ""Long Sword +2"" is great in function, but doesn't exactly stir the imagination.

I also think the game is a *little* too talky. My game felt like 60% talking, 40% fighting, where I may have preferred the reverse of that. I started up Icewind Dale after beating BG, and so far I like the pacing of it better (although the story is way more generic than BG...). It's also too short. I was only level 9 when I beat the main quest, and that's after doing most of the side quests in the game. I hadn't even unlocked level 5 spells. I haven't done the expansion content yet, but I wish the main quest would bring you to at least level 12 or 13 without having to grind xp.

I think those are the only problems I had with the game itself. Everything else I didn't like about it was because of my own ignorance of D&amp;D rules. For example, what maniac would want to play a mage from the beginning? At least dual into it after one fighter level so you have more HP and can use bows. For crying out loud, **use** the expendable items you find. Potions, wands, scrolls, use them all. Selling them gets you a lot of money, but once you're initially equipped a few hundred gold will last you the entire game.

The good stuff? Party management is a breeze. Once you set your initial formation in the beginning, you never need to worry about keeping your fighters on the front line and ranged in the back. Inventory management is not quite streamlined, but it's way less clunky than a lot that I've seen, even in more modern games. The characters you can recruit are entertaining and cover a wide range of casts, alignments, and personality types.

IWD2 offers new classes and races because it uses D&amp;D 3e instead of 2e. I like the ability to create substantially unique parties to experiment with. My current party is:

* Human rogue (swashbuckler style, 2-weapon focus)
* Half-Orc Barbarian
* Aasimar Druid
* Dwarven Ranger

Installation: Put this in your BG2 - SoA/music directory. Click yes to replace the existing file.

Warning: you might get sick of the music after hearing it for a while, though.

1. Make sure BGEE.exe and Baldur.exe are not running
2. Go to ""%localappdata%\Beamdog"" and rename the BGEE folder
3. Go to ""%programfiles(x86)%\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\Data"" and rename ""766.beam"" and ""766.status""
4. Go to ""%UserProfile%\Documents"" and rename the ""Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition"" folder (Note: THIS IS WHERE YOUR SAVEGAMES LIVE.)
5. Start the Launcher again.

This should fix most issues.

For other issues:  
An updated version of OpenAL (2.1.0.0) that is more current than the one found on the Creative home page (2.0.7.0) can be found here: 
http://www.mediafire.com/?8wya3v4zx0hvgm1

If you have the issue of the game not starting after you clicked ""Play"":  
Open the Startmenu, search for eventvwr.msc and open it. Go to Windows Protocols, Application. If there is an application crash of Baldur.exe there, UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS. If you already HAVE the latest drivers, copy the crash information from there and email support@beamdog.com

Some logfiles can be found at: ""%localappdata%\BeamDog\BGEE\Logs""
These may be of interest to some of you.


I will update this thread as information pours in - however, right now, I'm going to sleep, since I can't play thanks to a crash. :(


**Major Edit, fixes for the game not launching at all/crashing instantly**:  
If you have a Laptop with nVidia Optimus: Rightclick baldur.exe, choose to launch with the nVidia GPU.

If your game will not launch and eventvwr.msc shows crashes related to:

* DLLs who's name starts with ""msvc"": Download dxwebsetup.exe from Microsoft &amp; install it. Download the Visual C++ 2010/2008/2005 Redistributables and install them.
* atioglxx.dll: If you have this, you can probably get it to work by having some application running that uses video acceleration or similar. Applications that have been reported to work: iTunes. (Did not try) Media Player Classic Home Cinema Edition with DVXA rendering - this worked for me, in my case using LAV for the DXVA, but I guess other options will work too.

**Murder Mystery**

Winner: kynax

*The town of Nashkel has sent their heartfelt thanks for the efforts of all the individuals involved in the investigation of the grisly murder.  With your efforts, the location of the murder was definitively identified as nearby the lighthouse on the coast.  With the overwhelming accusations of the halfling Montaron, he was located and arrested.  In a disturbing turn of events, Montaron was found innocent of the murder of Noober.  His alibi held up and his short sword did not match the wounds found on the victim.  However, as he was about to be released, Harper agents arrived to take him away and wished to reward your efforts in helping apprehend the Zhentarim agent.  It is unfortunate the killer remains on the loose, but an even more dangerous criminal was taken in thanks to you.*

I would like to apologize here for a moment.  One aspect of this contest was not as clear as it should have been, although it all worked out in the end.  The solution for this contest was randomly generated.  From lists of NPCs, weapons, and locations the solution was random.  The solution we were looking for was:

*Quayle at the Lighthouse with a Long Sword.*

The narrative description was provided to narrow down the choices without completely giving it away, but it is apparent now that the randomness of the contest was not properly conveyed.  Still, the overwhelming majority chose the lighthouse as the location and were correct on that point.  So, according to the rules of the contest, everyone who made that choice (as well as the one person who guessed Quayle) was on even footing for the contest.

Either way comment/pm or add yourself to the list if you want to play. Also including a time frame you are able to play would be awesome. I could even stream it on [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/ch4os1337).

Here's how to get multiplayer working as hassle-free as possible.

You'll need the following:

* $10 or the GOG.com version of BG
* Windows 7 (It probably works with other versions, but I haven't tested them)
* A microphone and Skype (for voice chat), optional

Here are the steps to get set up:

1. **Buy Baldur's Gate from GOG.com** ([Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/baldurs_gate_the_original_saga)) ([Baldur's Gate 2 Complete](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/baldurs_gate_2_complete/))  They are $10 each, but I've seen it on-sale for as little as $5 each.
1. **Install BG or BG2** to your main drive (usually this is your C:\ drive).  Some people have had problems with Windows permissions if they install to the Programs folders, so skip them entirely and make a new folder on your C:\ drive called ""BG"" or something similar.  I have a SSD as my main drive and a hard disk for storage so I put it in the root drive on my hard disk (D:\ ).
1. **Download and install Gameranger**  ([Gameranger.com](http://www.gameranger.com/))  I've tried messing with port forwarding on my router and getting the right IP and firewall settings, but it's a pain to troubleshoot.  *Gameranger just works*, so why mess with a good thing?  You'll need to register for an account.
1. **Download and install Skype**  ([Skype.com](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/))  Gameranger supposedly offers voice-chat, but afaik that's only in the paid-version.  Use Skype and it's free!  You'll need to register for an account if you don't have one already.
1. Open the **Baldur's Gate ""Config"" file**.  Navigate to the folder you installed Baldur's Gate, and open up the ""Config"" application (for BG) or the ""BGConfig"" application (for BG2).  Usually this will open automatically the first time you run Baldur's Gate.  You'll want to max out the Hardware settings if you have an even remotely modern system.  While you're at it, go to the Miscellaneous tab and bump up the cache size to 1000 MB and Path Search Nodes to 400,000.  You'll probably also want to increase the framerate to 40 fps or so.  (Make sure ALL parties have the same framerate or you won't be able to play together.)  Most people prefer to increase the game resolution (1024x768 works well for my screen size) and use Windowed mode.
1. Run Gameranger and have the host **start a game**.  Go to File&gt;Host Game...  Pick the correct ""Baldur's Gate"" game, fill out the fields and press OK.  When you're ready to go, press ""Start"" and BG will automatically open and start the game, landing you in the multiplayer Character Arbitration screen.
1.  (Optional) **Run Skype** and call each other to use voice-chat alongside your game.

My first time playing D&amp;D Core Rules difficulty, it kicked my ass and this was *after* I beat Dragon Age on Nightmare without even really trying. *Side note: I really love DA:O*

Personally I think BioWare is taking steps in a direction that their oldest and biggest fans don't want. I.E. away from BG game mechanics and complexity and more towards action-RPGs (Diablo). Dragon Age: Origins to Dragon Age 2 was IMO a huge step backwards in this regard. 


It's seems except outside a couple top-notched PC developers (CD Projekt Red being one) and the Roguelike community, publishers are too scared to sell 'high risk' games that you can fail in or play 'wrong'. Just look at all the baby-mode options you can turn on in Mass Effect 3 in-case you cant figure out how buttons work, after playing the demo im almost positive I could beat it on normal with my eyes closed. Not only that, but you can turn off dialogue options so you don't have to choose what your character says... In a BioWare RPG. Not that that's an huge issue for me, but I think it reinforces my point. 

**TL:DR** I wish ME and DA were more like Baldurs Gate in game mechanics, complexity and difficulty.

You know, when you start BG1 you are told that Gorion, quite proficient a mage and a harper gave you all his savings (roughly 1xx gp) and you are to buy equipment. Following that all the magical items are very rare, you have to face breaking armor etc... and that is fine in fact, because that's quite realistic. (I'll skip goblins having some peasants' live savings as a loot). Still, for something like half the game everything is fine and magical items are very precious, you're not that rich.
But then something goes wrong and you are becoming move and more epic. In terms of the story and satisfaction it kicks ass, but in terms of  (let's say) realism it sucks. 

It is even more visible in Shadows of Amn. Almost every shopkeeper has some expensive and rare items (katanas for everyone!), magical items are almost everywhere and you can do some gold baths. Really, almost never I faced any gold problems in this game - at least until I wanted to pimp my theatre or do just any item Cespenar could make.

This has led to thinking - how would BG look without all its epicness. Would it be a better game? How would it play with a low-xp party and with only some magical items. I don't mean any special challenge but rather the way the game's world would actually look like.

Also, since BG3 was about to feature some low-lv gameplay, how would it look in this light?

And finally, how does r/baldursgate feel about it?",,False,self,t5_2t07j,False,,malison,True,t3_ohvab,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/ohvab/high_level_of_epic_in_baldurs_gate_discussion/,

So far I've equipped Scarlet ninja-to (in my off-hand, Celestial Fire in my main), Vheilor's Helm, Gauntlets of Ogre-Strength, Wand of Spell Striking, summoned a familiar from a scroll and cast Mislead from a scroll a few times. 

So what other uses have you come up with the most potentially OP'd ability in the game? I imagine there are some fun uses with dual or multi-classed thieves.

edit: What about NPC equipment, Haer D'Alis's swords for example? 

    Kensai/Thief - removes ALL of the downsides of being a kensai: 
    equip armor, helmets, gauntlets, use ranged weapons.

    Wizard Slayer/Thief - removes the downside of being a wizard slayer: 
    equipping magic items. 

    Wield Carsomyr

    Wield Staff of the Magi

    Equip Human Flesh as non-evil character

    Equip Robe of Vecna as Cleric/Thief to significantly reduce casting time.

    Cast Mislead Scroll for endless backstabs. 
  
    Other scrolls that would be good: Time Stop, Tenser's Transformation, 
    Shapechange: Iron Golem, Project Image, Spell Immunity, Stoneskin

    Equip Vheilor's Helm or cast Simulcrum
    
    Equip other powerful helms such as Helm of Balduran

    Equip Amulet of Power

1319817425.0,16,self.baldursgate,lsaq0,Installing BiG World &amp; playing it multiplayer,19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/lsaq0/installing_big_world_playing_it_multiplayer/,"So my friend and I recently decided to play through the most modded, epic version of Baldur's Gate possible. We'd never used the BiG World mod before, and ran into a couple issues along the way that I thought I'd share in case anyone wants to try this for themselves:

* Make absolutely sure you don't install Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II to the default (program files) folder. The installation won't work correctly if you do.

* Make sure you do a complete full install of BG1 and its expansion. In BG2 you just choose ""full"" as the install size, but in BG1 you have to hit custom and check off every checkbox. Don't miss any!

* Install the official ToTSC patch [from here](http://www.sorcerers.net/Games/dl.php?s=BG&amp;f=../Games2/BG/BGTalesUS5512.exe) and the ToB patch [from here](http://www.sorcerers.net/Games/dl.php?s=BG2&amp;f=../Games2/BG2/BGII-ThroneofBhaal_Patch_26498_ENGLISH.exe)

* Make sure you start a new game in BG1, BG2, and BG2:ToB and quicksave at the first available opportunity before installing the mod. I guess the act of saving creates some necessary folders or files.

* Based on the updated date and number of downloads, I was suckered into trying to download the Installpack rather than the Setup [here,](http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showcat=72&amp;s=5887a107e9c7eeb4c2d87311b8387d59) but all you need to download is the Big World Setup 9.10, it takes care of downloading everything else you need and installing it all.

* When you run the setup it will ask you if you want to try to auto update anything. You have to hit ""no"" to find updates or the installer glitches out on a later screen and won't let you continue. Hitting ""yes"" won't find any updates so you might think it's fine and you can go from there, but it won't work. On a related note, to exit out of the installer you have to find AutoIt in your tool tray and exit from there.

* The setup fails in a couple ways along the way. The first is that it won't find all the mods to download. Hit retry a couple times, it got a few more for me when I tried. [This site](http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/bwpmods.php) is the best place to find any mods that are left, but it's still missing a few, so be prepared to google for 'em. In my install (I chose the tactics version of BiG World), I didn't end up finding or using the Touchstone or Nikitalleria NPC mods. I was able to find two missing mods: [Legion of Hell: The Mod itself](http://cias.rit.edu/~dxw7298/BG/LOHMod.zip) on some chinese forum, and [Paladins of Faerun Kitpack](http://cias.rit.edu/~dxw7298/BG/PoF_Kitpack_V5.rar) as an attachment on a BiG World forum post. **EDIT: **Downloads now courtesy of Dim3tapp.

* For any mods you do have to find on the net, put the .zip or .exe into the C:\BWS\BGII - SoA\BiG World Downloads folder that the BiG World setup creates. Obviously your directory can change but you get the idea. You shouldn't extract or install them yourself. Just put the archives in the downloads folder and continue the setup.

* The setup now tries to reconcile what you downloaded with its internal mod list. So you have to go through the missing mods one by one and select the archive for each of the mods it wants. Some of the file sizes don't match up with what it expects, but I forced it to accept them anyway and it seemed to work.

* After downloading all the mods it can (and you supplying the ones it can't), the setup tries to automatically extract them all. In my case it popped up saying it couldn't extract like 20 of them. So go ahead when it asks and say you want to do it yourself. It'll automatically open up each archive it couldn't extract, which is nice. These come in two varieties. The first is a standard .rar or .zip that'll open up with your default archive manager, be it winrar, 7zip, etc. For these, just extract to the default C:\BWS\BGII - SoA folder, not the BiG World downloads folder. The other type of archive is the self-executing type, that tries to extract and then install the mod for you. You want to select the same C:\BWS\BGII - SoA folder for the extraction process, but when the console window pops up to actually do the installation select the option to quit. It's very important that you don't actually install any mods at this point, you just want to extract the files. Some of the initial popups for this type of mod might [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/iOGAJ.jpg) with an Install button, but that's fine because it really means just extract. The installer pops up after and lets you quit.

* After you extract everything, the setup goes and installs all the mods in the right order. This takes hours, so don't worry about it. There are some initial questions in the beginning about switching to 3rd edition rules or something, but not knowing what that entailed I chose no. Other than that, you aren't given any options.

* You'll have to install the [widescreen mod](http://www.gibberlings3.net/widescreen/) yourself at the end. Make sure you change the folder to the right directory.

* After starting the game you'll notice several things. First, multiplayer is out of the box glitched. Every time you save, the characters the other person controls turn invisible until you redo the character arbitration. To prevent this, you have to uninstall a mod called the ToB Extender. An easy way to do this is to find the TobEx.dll file in your BG2 folder and rename it to something else, like TobEx2.dll. Problem solved, no more disappearing characters.

* On a side note, other settings have to be changed via (re)running the appropriate setup .exe in the BG2 directory. You'll notice though that every single mod spat out a setup file there so finding the right one might be difficult. For example, there are a number of ""tweakpack"" setups, but the one you probably want to run is called setup-bg2_tweaks.exe. By default, true grandmastery, wearing magical rings+armor, and unlimited bags of holding (among mods I consider ""standard"") aren't installed.

* The other thing I immediately noticed was some drastic rule changes regarding armor that may not be desirable. By default arcane spellcasting with armor on is possible, the armor just confers a penalty to casting time. I'm not sure how unbalanced this is, my spellcasters usually aren't in combat anyway without stoneskin (at least in BG2), but personally it goes a little too far into the cheat category for me. I haven't found, or really looked for yet, the right setup file to unmod this. I guess with the rest of the game being modded so much, though, you might as well just roll with it. I did see a mod was installed that gives you every option on every cast of Wish. This is a blatent cheat if abused, so I'm not sure why it's on by default.

* It seems like a lot of the added content starts with having to have an NPC join you. As my friend and I made a party of 6 custom characters to go through the entire game, and nobody wants to fall behind in XP (especially this early in the game), it's not gonna happen. I was excited to finally play the ""original"" big content mod Dark Side of the Sword Coast but from the little walkthrough on the website it seems like that's another one that requires an npc to tag along. Maybe a rotating ""6th wheel"" character is called for.

* As mentioned a while ago on this subreddit, GameRanger is amazing. We've been using it and been very impressed. First, it automatically detects the games you have installed and has an excellent system of troubleshooting port forwarding issues. When you join a room with your friends and hit the start game button, it automatically starts up Baldur's Gate for all players and takes you right to the create (or join) game screen with the right information filled out to start playing. Very convenient.

Anyway, that's all I can think of off the top of my head for now. I'll edit this post if anyone clarifies or has anything to add to it!",,False,self,t5_2t07j,True,,,True,t3_lsaq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/lsaq0/installing_big_world_playing_it_multiplayer/,

I was thinking like they did with the MDK2HD or if you remember when Monkey Island 1+2 were redone. The engines were the same, but the graphics were noticeably nicer.

If the graphics are exactly the same,just in higher resolution, then to be honest i see in point in the effort, since there are mods that use the TOB engine anyway(Tutu), and other mods that introduce new npcs.

I know they will work in 2D isometric view and use an upgraded infinity engine, however i REALLY hope we see the game looking better, like we saw with Monkey Island remakes or MDK2HD.

 I felt I was missing something, even though I searched the previous villages for all I could find.

Monsters would destroy me violently several times, and I had to load the save files too often. Combat was really clumsy and un-intuitive, overall hard to get the hang of. Characters would miss too frequently.

I had no idea where to go most of the time, because the monsters didn't feel adecuate to my level. I mean, I have no problem with a game being this open, but I often felt that I could screw up big time if I didn't follow the plot.

I really wanna give the game a chance, but it's too slow also. I would often find myself spending several hours not getting anything done really.

Specifically:

* Open Locks
* Find Traps
* Pick Pockets
* Move Silently
* Hide in Shadows
* Detect Illusions
* Set Traps

I'm going to throw a few questions out there, and would really appreciate it if someone had more information on these things.

**1)** Find Traps vs. Pick Locks for disarming traps? I've read that the Find Traps skill doubles as a Find and Disarm Traps skill. I've also read that Find Trap only spots traps, while Pick Locks actually disarms them. Which is it?

**2)** Do these skills have effective caps? For example, I've never come across a lock that required more than 100 lock picking skill, but it's still possible to increase the value beyond that. Are points beyond 100 in Pick Locks just wasted? If so, does this go for all the other skills as well?

**3)** Once Yoshimo reached 100 in Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Pick Locks, and Move Silently for me, I started dumping his points into Set Traps. I noticed that once I did this, I started getting increased experience points from picking locks and disarming traps. As this makes no sense to me at all, I was curious if that was just a coincidence or not? What is the experience gain from these things based on, if not the seemingly unrelated Set Traps skill?

**4)** Do I have to be out of combat to be able to ""Hide in Shadows?"" I somehow get the impression that's not supposed to be the case, but even with 100 points in Hide in Shadows, I always seem to get a fail once combat has been initiated. Do I just need higher skill levels?

Those are the things I've been wondering about and haven't been able to find a definitive answer on, so I would appreciate any input.

This is the best game I've ever seen or heard of. I haven't been able to make it far into Athkatla because I want to go create a new character and see how the play feels, how the game develops. 

I know the Irenicus dungeon where you start catches a lot of grief - but good gravy! Even there the variety of different things that can happen depending on your playing style boggles my mind. Just for kicks I decided to try out a thief, and so I robbed the genie and got Sarevok's sword without fighting or doing the quest. Whoa. Then I started robbing everything I could find, meaning the lady druids in the grove, got all sorts of potions! Then they started attacking me. This was COMPLETELY different than trying as a paladin, sorceror, and monk. Does EVERYTHING in this game change depending on what you do?? 

Tell me about funny little things like stealing the sword from the Genie that a noob to the BD series like me wouldn't think of, that have caused memorable moments for you!

Even killing Torgal... he's the reason I kept remaking characters. I would play up until that point but couldn't kill him for the life of me, until playing as the paladin I spent some time figuring out what all of Nalia, Aerie's, and Jaheira's spells did, as well as the paladin's draw upon holy might. Buffs, I think you guys call them? Oh my gosh this game is complex!

I like RPGs, I don't like dungeon crawls.

Now, yesterday, I started a playthrough, thinking to finally beat it. Oh, how wrong I was.

I chose the drow monk.

A bit into the game, during chapter one, I talk to captain Sollus and I get the quest to kill monsters in the sewers - another mindless killing quest - which works by counting down from the total number of hundred monsters. It's all fine with the first ninety-nine, but the last one is nowhere to be seen.
I run through the sewers two more times. Thoroughly.

So I go online, and I find a few people experiencing the same thing. Dandy, I think to myself, here I've run into a bug. Ah, well. It doesn't look fatal.

So I keep playing, doing the warehouse and the woods, and when I return I get the quest to talk to the dear captain Sollus again. Uh-oh. Trying to talk to him just nets me the ""Have you killed all the monster yet?"" and no way to pass the quest, or drop it.

So after another three or four trips to the sewers, and no way of skipping this part to move on with the game, I decide that these last three and a half hour, which I'm not about to spend doing the very same thing again, was spent to once and for all eliminate Dark Alliance 2 from any ""Maybe it actually is a good game""-list.

This has led him to a life on the road, adventuring to mostly curb his own boredom. However, deep at heart he is still a good man, and helps people in need (whenever it doesn't inconvenience him TOO much) since he really has no need for money. I attract beautiful, sexy people to my group - safana, coran, neera, minsc and yeslick (that sexy hairy beast) through my cunning rather than charisma. Yeslick replaced Jaheira, since I killed off her husband - so I could have a chance with her - she got a little preachy and bitched at me all the time.

I know she wants my wild surge. 

This party I have is pretty much my good and neutral dream team. I usually roll a Mage, since there isn't any other good options for 2 mages (I prefer that to two healers) in a good party.

I prefer Coran over Kivan because Kivan is boring as shit, and is super quiet all the time, while Coran has 2 really fun quests, AND A DEXTERITY OF 21 NO JOKE.

The Tactics Mod is kind of intense.,17,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/m3ak3/so_the_tactics_mod_is_kind_of_intense/,"So I was playing Baldur's Gate for my umpteenth playthrough, like you do, and I decided that in an effort to mix things up a bit and add some freshness, I would add a bunch of difficulty-enhancing mods. Prime among these was the Tactics Mod [from WeiDU](http://weidu.org/). The number of times that I have played through BG2 can accurately be described as a fuckton, so I foolishly went on to install every single component of the mod, rather than go through the list and pick the ones that didn't sound ridiculous and extreme.

Pride, you heartless bitch.

This is an experience that I highly recommend to all veterans of the Baldur's Gate Saga, as it will challenge, humble, and frustrate the shit out of you.

I am proud to announce that we have officially implemented link flair for tagging purposes.

What this means to you:

* You can choose from an assortment of link flairs to properly categorize your post based on game (this may be /r/baldursgate, but we support and love all of the Infinity Engine games and more)

* The current options are **BG1**, **BG2**, **BGEE**, **BGT/Tutu**, **IWD1**, **IWD2**, **PST**, **NWN1**, and **NWN2**
* To use these new post tags, after submitting a link or self post, click the flair link under your post and select the appropriate flair for your post
* By tagging your post like this, commenters and readers will automatically have a better understanding of what version of which game you are playing (no more Tutu suggestions for BGEE games)
* No more need to include tags like [IWD] in the title of your submissions
* It allows for easier searching of the subreddit by using the term *flair:GAME* in the search field (replace GAME with the appropriate game abbreviation)

The goal is to make it easier to see right from the start which game is the focus of a post and remove the need to include bracketed tags in submission titles.  I am open to including more games or even other tags entirely, but I thought this was a solid start.

Also, with this post I am taking the time to test the newly implemented Reddit sticky system.  This post will remain stickied at the top of /r/baldursgate for at least a day or two.  I do not plan on removing the announcement bar because it still serves a slightly different purpose.

Well I got it earlier this week but it's absolutely insane with the level of depth, character creation etc.  I wish all RPGs were like this now days but that's beyond my point.

I guess I'll just ask a few questions then:

1.  What is a good class for a first time play through to get used to the system? (I know this is running of D&amp;D rule set, which is sweet!)
2.  What's would be a good ""personality"" I guess to setup for this said character (good, neutral , evil?  There are so many!  And telling the difference between them is minimal)
3.  Should I go through doing all the side quest along the way or doing them after the main quest in the game? (I hear your party members can be mad and leave your party if you are too slow in helping them in their quest)
4.  If my personality is set does that mean I can't mix and match? (Like having an evil member in my party even though I'm lawful etc etc)
5.  Would you recommend only have 1 person in the party to use a particular weapon? (IE: One axe, One bow user, one 2h sword user, a staff user)

A lot of mods aren't worth it/break the game badly. However, it is hard to know that without playing them yourself. There is no real consolidated place to get opinions on mods. Everyone knows the mandatory recommendations (widescreen/fix pack), but the content mods have less information (decent amount on NPCs but not much else). Was just going to do BG1 for this topic, since BG2 would be waaay too big.

So I was wondering what people's thought on the various mods were. Nothing formal, just a quick opinion to give newbies and experienced players alike, some guidance with their mod installs. Unfair opinions are welcome, if a mod annoyed you in the first 30 seconds and you never tried the rest, that's fine. Do try to keep it civil though, some people worked hard on these and there is no need to belittle their work. 

Everything below is in my opinion obviously.

**BG1 NPC Project**
Adds a bunch of NPC dialogue, some romances and a few quests. 
Overall, I love this mod. The quest rewards seem in line with BG1 power levels and its some of the best writing you'll see in a mod. I've never played though BG1 without this mod since I found it.

**Drizzt Saga**
I never did much of this mod. When Drizzt joined my party he had 6 attacks a round and a THACO of -6, at level 1. To prevent the rest of the game from becoming trivial, I dropped him immediately and ignored both him and the mod. 

**Lure of the Sirine's Call**
Adds a single quest in the Lighthouse area. Another mod that integrates well and doesn't seem out of place. Short and sweet.

I know some of the modders put alot of effort into modding. I definitely don't want to offend anyone.

I love mods, I haven't played a un-modded game of Baldur's gate since 2007... I realized this when I was writing out an answer for that guys thesis (which i still need to finish). I've played many many of the baldur's gate mods and sometimes I found myself really WTFing at some of the moments that these mods introduced into my game. Especially when you have several on the fly at the same time.

People have made some of the strangest mods for this game.

The worst/weirdest mod for me was an NPC mod called Saerileth:
http://mods.chosenofmystra.net/saerileth/

Now, its a well made mod. It had voicing at a time when there were very few voiced mods. It wasn't any of the functionality that weirded me out. It was the whole 15 year old year having the hots for the PC that freaked me... This mod allows you to marry a 15 year old... it really really squicked me at the time. There was no way that my PC was young enough for a romance with a 15 year old to be remotely possible. In my mind he was 25-30, It really freaked me out when the 15 year old girl was going all romantically gah gah over my character (and that my character had the option to go for it). It seemed like the sort of thing an evil character would do.

Needless to say, Neither me nor that character was interested in the romance and I promptly kicked her out of my party. I wasn't going to end up in Athkatla jail for consorting with a minor... The romance aside though, the sort of things that the character didn't fly with my idea of a 15 year old. Her thinking was altogether too adult and it was really dissonant with me. She was constantly interrupting into everything and was more intrusive that Jaheria. In my mind, she just came off as this really upperty slightly psychopathic 15 year old girl that was trying desperately to act older than her years.

It did freak me out that someone made a mod where you could marry a 15 year old. The ironic thing is that if the character was established to be in her 20s, she'd have been alright for me to be in my party (if a little overbearing and still not someone I'd go through a romance subplot with).

His reputation is 13 and charisma is 18 so it should look a little like:

10 + 5 (charisma) + 0 (reputation) = 15

Am I missing something? are dwarfs (or beserkers) unable to go above 16 charisma even with magical items?

To not get on your nerves or make this look like a rant, I'll start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I think big parts of the plot was very well written, but there are some things I need to clear up/discuss.

The story was very well paced in the start. I really really liked how you started off without knowing anything, only that an evil guy was looking to kill you. Slowly, after finding, talking to and killing underling after underling untill the master scheme of Sarevok gets revealed. The issue comes right after this. I felt that after getting to the top of the Iron Throne, from the second you head off to candlekeep, everything felt really rushed. You spend over 60 hours preparing for this, building up to what looks to be an epic adventure, and then the game ends within less than 10 hours. 

In the beginning, you had barely any money. You had to pick up every single god damn bastard sword to get by, and were lucky if you fought bandits which dropped scalps. Eventually, though, I was banking such a ridiculous amount of money, there was nothing I could buy. Before heading into Durlag's Tower at level 6-7, the last place I went prior to Baldur's Gate, I had 90k Gold. As I got into Baldur's Gate and was ready to find some shops and spend all my money, I had 120k. The problem was, **there's nothing to buy**, and I finished the game with nearly 200k gold.

I haven't played BG2, so I don't know if that clears up alot of things, but, the ending. I ended the game by killing Sarevok, I don't know anything about the other ""endings"", but this fitted the best for my Cavalier. My issue is that there was no ending, you just kill Sarevok and watch a fancy death animation. There were so many unanswered questions; what happens to me, what happens to Sarevok and what happens to the world? Not really relevant to the main story, but it kinda annoyed me that I couldn't finish all the side quests that were stacked up in my Journal.

There also were numerous glitches, probably from Enhanced Edition being buggy, so I can't complain of the core game because of that.

**TL;DR** End-game felt rushed, had too much money and the ending was weird.

Personally, I preferred the over land map as it appeared in BG1 than that of BG2. I say this because the when you travel the a new area in BG1, you have to get there by travelling through several otherwise unexplored areas, that is to say that you couldn't travel there directly after first discovering it's location, you had to travel the the intermediate areas first.

I feel that this process of travelling the world by parts put a healthy emphasis on exploration, and it gave the player a feeling of the magnitude of the size of the world. 

Incidentally, my favourite overland map was in the expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir. It gave you control over your character in the over land map, and made it so that it was possible to explore and discover locations that you had not previously discovered or heard of. It also gave you the capacity of evading random encounters using various non-combat skills. Also, because the different parts of the world had different difficulty of monsters, it made it very exciting and potentially dangerous to explore some areas.

**Got a bug?** Find the relevant forum (there'll be a link in the readme). Take your WEIDU.LOG file from your Baldur's Gate directory. Make a post, put your WeiDU.LOG file on a file upload site. Link to said file. Clearly explain your problem, and the exact error you're having, as briefly as possible. Be polite, and be patient. Someone will help you.

If you don't know where to post because it involves the BWP, BWS or any other megamod install, post on the [Megamod Help Forum](http://www.shsforums.net/forum/193-mega-mod-help/) on SHS. 

I'd like to think we're pretty approachable. If you have a question, feel free to send me a message here on Reddit or at SHS. I might not respond right away, but I will respond, especially if it's short and sweet.

It's funny... after thinking for a while, and there aren't many that I didn't look forward to. In order to give other people a chance, I'll only list a couple!

Just as a reference, all of my favorite experiences are of playing BG2 back to back with a friend over LAN with only 2 party members, so some battles were pretty fun and difficult.

I don't know if I'm a masochist or what, but two of my favorite battles are probably significantly harder with only two people. The first I'd like to mention is fairly early in the game. In the north of Waukeen's Promenade is an inn.. Den of the Seven Vales. My buddy and I would always challenge the adventurers on the second floor to battle, and hope to god we didn't get chunked by the thief Brennan Riesling while trying to bring down that god forsaken dwarf fighter. He was tough as nails earlier on in the game. That battle was always a challenge. 

The other battle I loved was in the Temple District... there's a huge white house where you can fight a fairly similar party to the one in Den of Seven Vales. This is the battle you can nab the katana Celestial Fury from. I guess I just like being outnumbered, but never outgunned ;)

I'd start in BG1 multiplayer and create all 6 characters. Any time I create MP characters I like to create back stories for them and RP in certain ways. All characters would be close friends that grew up together in Candlekeep.

The PC is a male human chaotic good true class fighter called Elkin. He acts the party's meat shield. (Shield of Balduran is just so lol in beholder hives)

Second is a female human neutral good Kensai called Sinéad, that duals during BG2 at lv9 (sometimes I hold off until lv12) to a mage. She acts as my primary ""shit all over everything in my way"" DPS. 

Third is a male human true neutral true class mage called Kai. (I've never known what bonuses you get for specialising a mage, and still don't. All I know is you can't cast opposing school spells, and that just doesn't appeal to me.)

Fourth is a male human neutral good assassin called Logan. He focuses his thief skills on silent moving, hide in shadows and Pick pocket. (Use any item and backstabbing with Carsomyr is just hilarious.)

Fifth is a female human chaotic good true class thief called Sapphy, who duals to a cleric during BG2 at lv12. She focuses her thief skills in traps and locks.

And sixth is a female human lawful good priest of Lathander called Aeriel.

**Brief RP/relationship elements outline**

Sinéad has always looked up to Elkin, being a few years younger than him, and followed him everywhere. When Elkin started training with the keep guard, so did she. As much as she loved Elkin she was never in love with him, instead falling for Kai, Elkin's best friend. The two have been together since their early teens and have a strong relationship. Logan and his sister Sapphy first started as friends of Imoen, the 3 of them would always be sneaking around and getting into mischief. It was through Imoen that the 2 siblings became good friends with Elkin. Aeriel is Sapphy's best friend, but the two became very close and later developed a romantic relationship. (Sapphy was not named with this relationship in mind, I created her before Aeriel and created the relationship with Aeriel :p)

In the transition between BG1 and 2, Kai and Aeriel are killed off. They become [unfortunate victims of Irenicus, just like Dynaheir and Khalid](/spoiler)

With this, Sinéad and Sapphy dual to the classes of their significant others in eternal remembrance to them both.

So now I need two new party members. I go with 2 of the games characters now, as the party interactions are greatly improved in BG2 from BG1.

So I free Jaheira and boot her to the curb, but choose to keep the mighty Minsc with me! Why? Because Minsc is just the best character. Ever conceived. By mankind. Ever. But also because he has awesome storyline interactions with my final choice...

Aerie! I've always loved Aerie as a character and I also want to have the love interest story for Elkin.

So there you go. The party I always seem to come back to and do a playthrough with every couple of years, just because it's a lot of fun! So, who else has a party like this? Whether it be a party containing custom made members or a party using 5 of the game's characters just because you really like them?

I am sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong sub-community. I couln't find any cRPG or Icewinddale sub-reddits, and /gaming seem'd a little too broad.
I will delete, or wount mind a mod deleting this thread if I'm breaking any rules.

So, I finished Baldurs gate 2 and Throne of Bhaal today. Craving more, I instaled IWD2, since it one of the few games of that era and genre I havnt played.

Im including a bard for high Cha and skillpoints in bluff, diplomacy and alike. I know that usually the first character in the party usually talks in encounters and when approched. Is there any way to make my bard the designated talker? 
Will npc with 'scripted dialog' always pick the nearest character? 
Or is it the Player Character that have the first spot in the party?
Are there many such 'scripted dialogs'(approaching npc's and boss talks)?
Or is the cha and skills from my bard always counted for when for example my warrior is talking to someone?

I guess I could either have my bard at the 1st spot, along with the front line fighter (extra micro managing with always making my bard walk back whenever I meet hostiles. And hostiles tend to hate the first person they see)

Or just load every time there's a npc come running towards me to chat (and how does this work in boss encounters?).

(or just placing a paladin first and skipping the bard altogether, but I do love skills like bluff and diplomacy)

Sorry if im breaking any rules and any help would be much appreciated.


Update: I figured that I will just slide my bard to the first spot in the party whenever in cities, or suspecting scripted dialogs.

Help?",13,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/vhrei/picked_up_bg1_again_got_stuck_help/,"So I've had Baldur's Gate (no Tutu or whatever else I've been hearing about) for years, but haven't played in a little while. So one day recently I saw it sitting on my shelf and decided to have another go. And unsurprisingly, I got stuck on the exact same spot as last time I played: The Spider Queen in the second Cloakwood area. No matter what tactics I use, I die every time.

My party looks like this;
Ajantis lvl 3
Minsc lvl 3
Me (Fighter 2/Mage 2, archer)
Jahiera lvl 3
Imoen lvl 4
Dynaheir lvl 3

My save is right in front of the battle and I really don't want to have to go back to town or whatever to get more equipment. So tactical help would be better. But right after this area I'm definitely going to go item hunting.

What I've been doing is having Ajantis use Prot. from Evil on him, Minsc, and me, while Jahiera casts Bless on the party. I have a potion of Fortitude and Ajantis has a potion of Heroism.

Once we start fighting it all goes to hell. I cast Sleep and Jahiera casts Entangle, but they almost never work on more than one enemy. Dynaheir knows pretty shitty spells (Magic Missile, Burning Hands, Color Spray). They all either do crap damage or take her right up into melee where she dies two seconds later. We keep dying from poison a lot, but we only have two antidotes for the whole party.

So, yeah. I really like this game, but when I try 15 times in a row to beat a boss and lose every time it gets pretty irritating. I even moved the difficulty slider down a step (against my better judgement, felt like cheating) and still died. Help is very much needed.

After a rerun of BG (BGEE then BGII + ToB), I felt like coming back to the frozen north.

He's primarily melee, but he does much less damage than our fighter while simultaneously being much easier to hit and having less health. He can't cast useful spells like a mage, can't heal like a cleric, can't CC like a caster of any sort... It's making progressing through the game more of a chore than an enjoyment.

This isn't the first time I've tried to play the game, but only now am I finally sort of getting used to how it plays, and I'm starting to enjoy it!

So, I've decided to come to you to ask a few things, to hopefully smooth out the learning curve a bit.

* Dual Classing. I've read a bit about this, but never really found a good explanation on it. Mainly, I just want to know if it's neccessary, or if single classing is perfectly viable. I've read that it's important to do for Imoen in particular. It seems kind of complicated, and I'm not sure I want to mess around with it yet.

* Combat. I'm still *very* early in the game (recently picked up the two party members from the Friendly Arm Inn, and the random soldier to the north. And so far, combat has just been ""left click monster, wait, win."" I imagine it'll get more complex later, but is there anything I should get used to early when it comes to combat, that I'm not doing now?

* Alignment. My character is lawful neutral, which I interpreted as a person that, whether good or bad, does what the law tells her. At the same time, I've been doing the classic RPG things of going into random houses and looting their chests. It felt natural to me, but then I remembered that the game told me there would be consequences for not following your alignment. And I was just wondering exactly how far this goes. Am I in trouble for giving in to my unlawful raiding impulses?

When BG:EE came out, I decided to play Bers/Druid and (as usual) do almost all the quests there are, visit every area etc. Currently I am stuck on one of my less liked areas from ToTSC and hell, I am just fed up with that character.

So I decided to create a half-orc NE f/t. I collected my party quite quickly, running with Xzar, Monty and Branwen through Nashkeel, picked up Dorn a bit later on and only recently exchanged Branny for Baeloth (she didn't like my rep dropping to 1). And I am having a lot of fun with them!

Why you ask? Possibly because I just ignore a lot of the game. I've skipped some areas, doing things only for money. Importantly, the pacing went up to such high levels I actually enjoy the game like never before. No more going there, bringing that, looking for that. I just go from point A to point B, taking what I can sell or what will come of use in the future. Possibly the only bad thing about is the meta-game knowledge, so I know where I have to go.

You might ask 'What makes your Let's Play so special I should watch it?'

Well, nothing! (Okay, that was probably a bad answer) I simply love Baldur's Gate and wanted to share my love for it with the community by doing a let's play. What you can expect is fairly decent commentary (I have no idea honestly, I can't judge my own commentary), I try to be witty, funny and explain my character's morals, decisions and have them develop over time.

What makes my Let's Play unique is that I am using two characters instead of one. Two brothers with unique personalities and decisions to make, and I role play them together as best I can, which in turn affects what they do and how they make decisions. 

Video quality *might* not be the best (Gonna work on improving it,) But I can't do much while using a 4:3 monitor. First episode is 480p, but I'm gonna work on making the others 720p.

* Put the mouse over the 'reroll' button and stare at the middle of the third and fourth attribute without focusing on any particular number.
* Without reading a single attribute, you can tell if any are single digits (at least my peripheral vision can).  If there are, click reroll.  Don't read any of the numbers if there's a single-digit stat present.
* If all attributes are double digits, read them one at a time and, if you read one below a predesignated threshold (I usually do 12), click reroll.
* When you get a roll of all 12+ numbers (or whatever your threshold is), subtract all the stats from charisma up to strength, and look at your number of distributable attributes.
* If that number is less than your stored number, reroll.  Otherwise, save.

The reason for the 12+ threshold is it is much easier for my brain to process a number I *do* see and react to it instead of trying for numbers I *don't* see.  That is, if I look for 18's, and I reroll a jillion times trying to get it, I will eventually roll a bunch of 18's but muscle memory just clicks 'reroll' again anyway, and I go ""AAWWWWWWWWW FFF-.""  When I follow the above, I wait until my brain has processed a 10 or 11 before I reroll, and I never click unless I see one, even if I'm doing this for a long time.

Following this prescription, I can get a feel for what a 'par' roll is very quickly, i.e., if I get ten 53-58 rolls in a row, then hit a 61, I just take it as a good roll, which usually happens in 10-15 minutes.

**Current Situation**: The Nashkel mines have been cleared, and the child of Bhaal still has no idea of his past.  However, it seems evident that the occurances around him are no mistake and along with his companions, he seeks to uncover the secrets that have eluded him for two decades.




Also, (if by chance you haven't) take a look at the original group play thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/quq3h/its_that_time_again_anybody_want_to_play_baldurs/).

**UPDATE2**:  Mic isn't necessary as we managed without it.  Chat works better for RP anyways.  Still, if the party becomes full, we may need it for simple pause coordination.

Never having experienced this game before, I went with a half-elf fighter/thief and dove right in. I'm at the first large town you come to, and everyone is talking about an iron shortage at a mine, which I expect I'll have something to say about in a bit. Now then:

1. WHY do I hit my enemy one time in every ten swings?

2. Why is everything I sell worth 1 gold?

3. Is it really that easy to die, and that hard/expensive to revive?

4. What is reputation and should I worry if it keeps dropping (I am stealing ALL THE THINGS)

5. That necro guy kept dying so I kicked him out of the party for being useless. Bad?

6. I can only sell certain things to certain people, or am I doing it wrong? Crap is stacking up in my inventory.

7. Leveling, does it ever happen? Jesus.

8. I have found a ton of rings and shit, do they have no abilities or do I need to be identifying them or something? Should I just be selling them if they are useless?

8.5 For that matter, are there weapons with special abilities or stat bonuses? I have seen none.

9. Please explain the magic to me. She knows a spell, but only has a few... uses of it? No mp or whatever? Do they return with time, or inns, or what have you?

10. What in the HELL does D10 or whatever the damage for the weapons mean? I never played D&amp;D or anything...

There are many things that point to some of it like:

Main character lived all his life in candlekeep with the tutor Gorion.

- this makes sense for any human character, but how do long lived races, such as elves or dwarves fit into this mix? From what I've understood, elves and such reach adulthood somewhere after 100 years. That would make Gorion either really old or the charname really young, barely an infant in elf standards. [This ofcourse breaks with all the other bhaalspawn you encounter, assuming Bhaal did not sire them years and years before, which I guess he did](/spoiler)


The ""canon"" party leaves a free selection for the charname

- this mostly leaves him as being non-critical to the group dynamic


There are no neutral warrior NPCs

- Feels like the Charname is supposed to fill this role.


There are also some factors that are present in BG2

- One being: [Imoen, being a human bhaalspawn and also being raised by Gorion](/spoiler)


I think they should have made Gorion be the race of the Charname or some longlived race, that would have fixed the immersion problem at least. What do you guys think? Am I alone in this?

Been playing this game since it came out and I've always been of the impression that vanilla Firkraag is the weakest dragon in the early game. 

My party: PC (Carl Chaotic Evil Gnome Fighter/Illusionist, Jan, Viconia, Korgan and Edwin) which is in my opinion the best and most fun party set-up. My stats are ridiculous due to carefully planned min/maxing with stat items in mind. Everyone besides Edwin has a 18+ strength.  By selling everything not attached to the walls (and a lil' bit of selling and stealing back courtesy of Jan and his 3 Master Thievery potions) I have managed to buy Robe of Vecna and Belt of internal barrier and the strength belt from the adventurers mart. 

Now to the point: Firkraag humiliated me. I died about 20 times before I gave up. I simply don't have enough fire resistance to adequately reduce the firebreath thing Firkraag spams on me. He's also much better at disposing of my summons and why is he so much faster than the shadow dragon? 

My strategy (that failed): Buffed beyond reason, summon 5 fire elemental through item,  2xLower resistance 1xBreach + LOTS of magic missiles from Jan, Edwin and PC plus numerous Holy Smite from Viconia (dangerous move for my party considering alignment) and I never got him down below injured. 

I bet Firkraag is immune to the damage of the fire elementals but they are just there to resist fire damage and distract anyways, any other summons die instantly. 

I used the same strategy with earth elementals instead of fire for the Shadow dragon with much success. It took 2 re-loads to get it right.  

It seems I have much to learn yet so I ask you to help me be more sophisticated in my spell casting. What am I missing here? And don't say gaining 3 levels!

I have a plan on how to play this out but my knowledge about modding is not that extensive so any comments on the following details would be appreciated.

I will play from the beginning of BG1 to the end of ToB doing most of the content that's available in the game and in the selected mods. I would prefer the following:

- playing the same NPCs through the whole trilogy
- keeping both the main character and the NPCs as single-class characters.

I will play the games on insane difficulty. I also plan to include some mods that add more difficult encounters to the game.

I plan to include the following members in my party:

- Zizz - main character, neutral evil fighter
- Korgan - secondary fighter
- ??? - thief, preferably single-class, neutral or evil, who I can keep from the beginning of BG1 to the end of ToB
- Viconia - primarily for buffing, I think healing is not that effective in the BG games
- Edwin - as a wizard
- Xan - as a sorcerer, I love arcane spellcasters and I really like these two guys :-)

My questions:

- Which thief (either vanilla or modded in) would you recommend? Safana comes to my mind but she's not available in BG2 as far as I know.
- Is there a way to keep Korgan for BG2? If yes, how? If no, who would you recommend as a replacement?

I plan to include the following mods for additional content:

BG1

- Dark Horizons
- Dark Side of the Sword Coast
- Northern Tales of the Sword Coast
- BG1 Mini Quests and Encounters
- BG1 Unfinished Business

BG2

- Assassinations
- Fading Promises
- Innershade
- Tales of the Deep Gardens
- Tower of Deception
- Unfinished Business

I'd avoid the very big mods like Check the Bodies or The Darkest Day, but small additions to the plot would be nice. Would you recommend anything else to be added here? Would you remove anything because it is buggy/unbalanced/ugly/boring/etc.?

I would like to make the game more difficult. My plan is to include Sword Coast Stratgems I and II. Would you recommend against it? Would you add anything else?

On the other hand I would like to make inventory management in the game take less time, so I'll be using the projectile/scroll/potion/etc. stacking component from BG2 tweaks. Hmm, I need no advice here.

To enhance the graphics of the game, I'll be using Infinity Animations and One Pixel Productions. For the GUI I'm leaning towards TutuGUI with Widescreen at 1920x1200 and a decent font. However if you have a better recommendation on how to make the game look great feel free to let me know. :-)

Anything else you would add or change? Any advice is welcome.

So my question is as I continue along the Bohdi path, will Keldorn leave again? I want to have him in my party, so I need to know if I can continue safely along this path or just reload.

Anyway, I had my mind set on a mage character and told my friends that if nobody wanted to play as a cleric, I'd be happy to go the multi class route and throw cleric into the mix as well. Now, I've used Aerie before, but have never made a PC mage/cleric and wanted the opinion of you guys and girls. Powerful/weak? Fun/not fun? Difficult/easy? Just overall opinions and whatnot. 

I know it will be fun making this PC multi class for the first time and discovering this stuff out for myself, but I just wanted to get some kind of idea of how challenging it might be. I mostly wasn't sure if one character was enough to fulfill both roles in a full party.

Also, I've been considering specializing and going with Gnome illusionist/cleric as an alternative. Thoughts on this?

Reasons to do so:

* 3 melee, 2 ranged/casters is still a robust party

* 1 less character means experience is split 5 ways instead of 6, meaning that your characters will level up slightly faster

The spell *Magic Resistance* and Carsomyr weren't intended by the developers to stack with anything, so ruling those out.

Wizard slayer X / Thief is a possibility to push it higher, though it will mean that the character isn't viable until very late.  Will have to do the math to see the earliest it's possible to get +15 or +20 as well as 'use any item'.

also, if i multiclass should i have a smaller party to offset the fact that i will level slower? or is that a bad idea?

lastly i have a more vague question. i understand what 1d8 means and all that, i understand lower AC is good and i know how thac0 works. is there anything else really i need to know?

oh actually one more. is it worth having a high charisma if it's my first time playing (sorta, i have played a few hours of bg 1 and a little of 2).  i've read that a lot of people recommend that but i hate to waste points on charisma instead of other important stuff...but i do like story...what do u think?

For what it's worth, PC is neutral good, and the rest of the party currently is Imoen, Khalid, Jaheira, Kagain and Viconia.

Should I wait for BG2EE or can you recommend a good downloading method? One of my favorite things about Baldur's gate is exploration, hearing that BG2 lacks that makes me sad, however a comparison of various aspects between 1 and 2 would help.







A lot of times when I make these posts people say it depends on what you like. Here are some pros/cons for BG1 that might give you some perspective. 




**Pros:**
-Great main story 

-Great characters (NPCs too)

-Occasional dark humor

-Not so much good gear that it feels useless, but when gear does come along it is VERY usable

-Yay exploring!

-Yay multiple ways to approach combat!

-Yay strong bosses that require skill and strategy to kill!

-Yay party building




**Cons:**

-Lack of dialogue

-Occasionally boring and empty locations (arguably adds to exploration)

-Characters themselves actually have less dialogue than some NPCs

-Annoying undoable choices. (Granted dumping
Imoen'a dead body on a bridge wasn't the *best* idea.)

-I often have to reload several times to figure out how to beat an enemy, my fault I know, but feels cheap.

-Side Quests seem unimportant and short story-wise.

-Places like the Nashkel mines are annoying grinds to

Is this all-around party for Cleric/Mage or should I change my party setup?

3) As a Cleric/Mage I won't be in front line swinging Mace of Disruption or Flail of Ages, who should I have as my main ""blunt weapon guy""? Should I let Valygar focus on these weapon types?

**1) Weapon Proficiencies and Dual Classing:**

Let's say I have a level x fighter that I decide to dual class into a mage. My fighter has 4 points in the Quarterstaff proficiency and 1 point in Two Handed Weapon Style. While I'm leveling my mage up to my fighter level, I put one point in each of those proficiences. When my mage level catches up to my fighter levels will my proficiency levels be:

* 4 Quarterstaff - 1 Two Handed Weapon Style?
* 5 Quarterstaff - 2 Two Handed Weapon Style?



**2) Monster and NPC experience scaling**

Are recruitable NPC experience levels dependent on the level I am when I encounter them? If I leave them and then recruit them later on, will they be at the level I left them at, or will they have gained experience in my absence?

In the same vein, do monsters/encounters scale with my character level or is everything in the game a static level?



**3) Armor Class modifier limits**
The game keeps telling me I can't equip more items with an armor class modifier. What's the limit to armor class modifiers, is it different based on class and why doesn't it just stop stacking?

Obviously the RPG style can't handle a completely random world a la Diablo I, but what about any of the following:

* The game ships with a web of (let's just call it) 1000 partially linked sidequests, like The Hidden and Tazok's sewer key, and independent quests (Drienne's cat), but each new game only loads some 300 of them.  A canonical subset of sidequests could be designated and selected with a checkbox at game creation for a repeatable experience.

* Weapons/items are randomly scattered amongst enemies as loot the way scrolls currently are (feels good to get a Mislead scroll off a slaver in chapter 2).

* Wilderness ambushes are partially randomized, both in location and characteristics of bad guys, similar to waylays.

* Traps are partially randomized to keep thieves detecting traps in dungeons.

* Clues could be left throughout the game to suggest where a certain mythical robe could be.  e.g.  in a civilian's diary: ""The Lord of the Windspear Hills wore a new robe at the tavern today... and cast his usual spell at the service bell without taking any time to say the incantation!""  Now you can expect the Robe of Vecna on Firkragg's body.

* Locks and loot are randomized in places like inns to reflect actual travelers coming and going.

I'm **not** saying the game should be entirely randomized.  I just want your opinion on what degree of randomness should the next BG incorporate, if any, and what the max/min limits should be.  Also, please make suggestions I missed where you would like to see randomness implemented.

**EDIT** Guys, randomness isn't good or bad, it's a gaming mechanism (that the IE relies heavily on).  Please keep the ""RANDOM SUX NO WAI"" instinct at bay and contribute, as several have already, your opinions on where you would like to see more and less randomness in the next versions/mods of Baldur's Gate.

**EDIT 2**  Ok, the consensus seems to be in and people would rather see all the content available in every playthrough of BG3, but would like non-unique loot to be dropped randomly.  Also, it seems popular to include all the epic items in every playthrough, but to shuffle around which mega boss has them (e.g., Vecna found on Firkraag one game, Kangaxx the next).

Unfortunately, when this Dire Charm spell wears off my Bhaalspawn gains the red circle of a Hostile. It is as if my character's default state is ""hostile"" and the charm spell is only temporarily giving me control.

Now then, what we are looking for is two new players who have some experience with online roleplaying, not necessarily a lot of experience with the Baldur's Gate games - as this is a wonderful way to be exposed to the story - but that may help as well.

Our party desperately requires a healer of some kind. A druid would be fine, but a cleric is certainly preferred. We could also use a mage, as our only arcane caster is a sorcerer (and what a sorcerer he is!)

A cleric/mage multiclass would be great, and quite a fun class to roleplay as well.

___
Our party lineup is currently: Fighter (Berserker kit), Thief (Swashbuckler kit), Ranger (Stalker kit), and a Sorcerer.
___

Since our thief is a swashbuckler, we could also use a thief who can backstab. Also, since the party is all men, we'd love to have some of you wonderful ladies of Reddit join our cause!

A guy can dream, can't he?

Anyway, please use this thread to apply. RP101 from the link below is considered **required reading**. Again, roleplaying experience is preferred, and female characters are, of course, encouraged.

Looking forward to bringing some new people on!

(PS: We have finished the Nashkel mines and are on our way - slowly - to the Bandit Camp.)

Just seeing if there is any interest in playing this classic with a focus on role-playing. I've always found IWD to be great fun but lacking severely in the RP department, and I figured getting a group of people together to contribute to the storytelling could breathe new life into the game.

Let's hear some thoughts.

I love all the positive responses! Judging from these comments, it looks like people want to play Icewind Dale II. Sounds great to me! I'll write down your usernames along with time zone for future reference. If you haven't told me your time zone yet, please do so, so that I can consolidate everything in one place.

________

*bukkitslayer* After 6pm GMT-5, prefers thief-types

*Eschatos* - Can't play Wed/Thurs, GMT-5

*Cyricist* - Wants to play a Dreadmaster, GMT-5, weekdays after 4pm and free weekends

*NostalgiaSC* - Weekends, Monday or Tuesday, 7pm GMT-8

*excellentlistener* - GMT+0, unavailable next week

*GrooveTherapy* - GMT-6, available after 5 with some obligations interfering

*AnInfiniteAmount* - No response yet

*limee64* - GMT-6, available evenings, can't play evil

*spotlessline* - GMT-5, available evenings
___________________________________________

Once we've got times sorted, we can start talking about party composition and character roles. As stated in **RP101** above, I want people to have put some serious thought into their characters prior to playing, as in my experience this always leads to more immersive and cohesive storytelling.

A couple of personal no-nos I hope we can agree on:

No good or neutrally aligned drow (dark elves). I think we can all agree the Realms have enough of those already.

No good aligned duergar, neutral are passable but probably require mutual affirmative consensus.

Try to avoid (like the plague) making a ""snowflake"" character. For those unfamiliar with RP terminology, a snowflake is a unique, individualized character concept that breaks all racial and social expectations, and generally reflects a player's immaturity and inability to play a character by the book. The reason for this is, when every character in a party is an abberation (drow paladin, half-dragon half-ogre sorcerer, two-thirds vampire barbarian, etc) then suspension of disbelief suffers. No one can believe these ridiculous people all got together in the same time and place and decided to work together. When the backdrop of the story is generally cohesive and fits a certain tone and style, crazy characters like this will tend to stick out and break immersion. This is not to say that interesting characters aren't welcome - quite the opposite! - but there is a difference between interesting and stupid and I just wanted to point it out ahead of time so no feelings get hurt.

______________________________________

Once you've told me your time zone and availability, please start posting character concepts so we can have a group discussion about them and what we want to accomplish as a party.

Thanks for such a positive response!

**EDIT2** After going through your relevant information, I think I've come up with the best solution for game time (that also works with my schedule.) I have classes until 5PM (GMT-8) every weekday and my weekends are hard to schedule for, so I think a weekday will be best. Some of you said you couldn't do certain days during the week, and one of you said Mondays are preferable, so I think Monday is the best day to do this.

*TUESDAYS OR SUNDAYS ALSO LOOK GOOD DEPENDING ON AFFIRMATIVE CONSENSUS FROM THE GROUP*

*NOTHING IS SET IN STONE YET, THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS*

*I ONLY SUGGEST MONDAY BECAUSE GROOVETHERAPY LISTED IT AS A PREFERRED DAY*

I am hoping we can all get together ~5:30PM (GMT-8) on ~~Monday~~ evenings to play IWD2. I know I'm the only one in the GMT-8 time zone, so this will be later in the evening for you guys. The upside is, everyone will have probably eaten dinner so we won't have to take a break during play except for bathroom breaks. In my experience there is not much point to starting a roleplaying session without at least three or four hours free to play uninterrupted, so I hope we can agree on that level of commitment.

Of course, when things really get going it can take longer if everyone is having lots of fun playing together, but 3-4 hours should be a reasonable minimum commitment. I know this will put some of your Monday evenings ending at or around midnight, so make sure this is acceptable for your schedule and your life (and possibly your wife!) before committing to the group.

Please PM me with questions, objections, and/or compliments so I can get a handle on who can play!

Thanks for sticking with me through this process.

Also, please start posting character concepts if you are able!

**EDIT 3**

Here is the [googledoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aod5KcghhuBAdE1CZFktbjlBZDE2cjlGTnFyaU84VVE) that has everyone's schedule on it. Maybe some of you talented planners can analyze it and figure out the best times for everyone. I'm an English major with A.D.D. and all kinds of other excuses why I'm bad at data analysis and stuff. I can list more excuses upon request.

I have adjusted the settings on the googledoc to allow everyone to edit for the most current and accurate information. Please don't be a dick and delete it.

Hey again,

Anyways, what I hope to achieve here is assemble a dedicated (hopefully a meeting every week or two) group for roleplaying through Baldur's Gate 1 + 2.  If you do not know what roleplay is, it is pretty much ""playing in-character"" where you assume the role of the character you made and would react/communicate as such.    
Emphasis on **Cooperation** when discussing roles, plans of attack, decisions, etc.
  
Also, (if by chance you haven't) take a look at the original group play thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/quq3h/its_that_time_again_anybody_want_to_play_baldurs/).  They have a livestream set up so you can watch!
  
Thanks a lot!            

**UPDATE**: Primary Group is now closed. We will begin discussing times. 
Please give me **three** times you would like to meet during the week here on [Steam Group Chat](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rbaldursgate)  I'm Tailwind and will be on chat most of the day.

I included the Icewind Dale games as well because between all of them we have a lot of opportunities to play together.  We live 3000 miles apart, so we try to find good buddy oriented, co-op games in order to talk and stay in touch (when he is around we actually play those PS2 Dark Alliance games, they're entertaining enough for us).

Now for the problems...on his computer, he is completely unable to play the Icewind Dale games and we are unable to play any sort of multiplayer with the Baldur's Gate games.  We have tried running/installing as Admin, UAC is off, tried all compatibility settings, installed the old DirectX files, messed with firewall/antivirus settings (and turned them off), and anything else we could think of.

This seems like a large disadvantage, however...

Let's say that I want a Fighter / Cleric character.
Starting as a fighter seems like the way to go (weapon specialization) and then dual-class switching to Cleric.

Many ""perfect party"" posts suggest dual-class switching characters at 9th level, but my question for you all is, if I Dual-class switch at Fighter level 9, will that Thac0 advancement even matter when the character is a 20+ level Cleric?  Sure, the specialization is nice, but 9 levels of Fighter is less important if you can't actually connect with high-end baddies.

Is Multiclass better at higher levels?  
17th level Cleric AND 17th level Fighter in 1 character slot seems good.

Am I over-thinking this?  Opinions?

I read somewhere that modding Baldur's Gate is quite popular, and I am fairly interested in the Baldur's Gate Trilogy Mod. To my understanding, it said that all 4 games (BG1 + Expansion and BG2 + Expansion) were 'fused' to one game, in which you can do a play through from begin to end. This way the 'flow' from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 will be better (e.g. if you give Jaheira a tome of wisdom in BG1 she will still have the bonus in BG2)


Now, my question is aimed at the people who have experience with the Trilogy-mod. Does this mod also allow you to keep playing with characters from BG1 in BG2, even though they are normally not be available in BG2? Think of characters such as Shar-Teel, Montaron, Xzar, Safana and others. Also, if this is possible, are they treated as if they were just secondary custom-made characters like in multiplayer, where they will not add anything to conversation or express their satisfaction on the group's standing (e.g. Xzar complaining about how all these goodie-goodies make him sick once your reputation rises to higher levels.) or do they actually remain their old quotes and some custom conversations when doing quests?

1) Do you start the game with a full party, or do you pick up your friends after the intro?

2) Can you mix normal NPCs in with your party, or does it have to be a full custom group?

3) Do you create the party all on one (host) computer, or does each player create theirs independently?

4) What is different in character creation between BG:EE and BG1?  I noticed right away that the proficiencies were divided into more groups (i.e. 'Bastard Sword' and 'Long Swords' instead of just 'Large Swords')

5) Are class kits available in BG1 or just BG2?

6) Can you import your full party into BG2 after completing BG1?

But in Hell, where you face Irenicus, the mods make the battle impossible. 

As soon as Irenicus summons, he casts these spells:

* (precast)
* Stoneskin 
* Protection from Magical Energy
* Protection from Cold, Electricity, Fire, and Elements
* Spell Trap
* Immunity: Divination
* Globe of Invulnerability
* Improved Invisibility
* Mirror Image
* 
* Improved Haste
* ~
* Chain Contingency (takes effect immediately)
* Protection from Magical Weapons
* Improved Haste (again)
* Immunity: Abjuration



And after a few seconds (before I have time to cast any spell removals), he casts time stop and proceeds to kill my whole party. If I somehow manage to survive that, he casts a second time stop after that. 

I've tried several cheese tactics, but they don't work with this improved irenicus. I've tried to run in circles around the map, so his protection spells would disappear, but he's too quick and casts powerword stun. I could protect myself against that, but he just dispels all my buffs. I've also tried to retreat to the southern stairs, and just wait, but somehow he knows we are there.

My highest party member is only level 18, so I don't have any lvl 9 spells.

I think this is part of SCS2, Tactics or Ascencion mods, but I am not sure which.

I want to disable the mod that's doing this and just fight the vanilla Irenicus, but don't know what folder to delete to deactivate this mod. 

Could anybody help?

I solo'd basically every area until after Nashkel mines (chapter 3?) but soon found that I needed a thief to complete Durlag's Tower so left that for later. I had initially planned on going back to The Friendly Arms Inn and picking up Jaheira and Khalid but as I'd finished the Mines they were no longer there. Instead I ran into Neera there (I'd already met her in Beregost (I think?)) so picked her up for the group as I'd never used a Wild Mage before and thought it would be fun (it is).

A bit more cheese was eaten when I googled the characters to decide who to pick up. I decided on Coran and Branwen but first had to get the crazy female Druid from Cloakwood so I could go back to the Carnival to un-petrify Branwen. 

As it stands my party is the protagonist on point as main damage dealer (19 str, 18 dex), Coran sniping, Neera throwing Reckless Deowomers everywhere and Branwen healing/buffing. I'm thinking that this might be enough to finish the entire game but as it's been over 10 years since I played through BG1/TotSC vanilla I'm not sure if I have the bases covered. I could always go back for Minsc for an off-tank or hit up Yeslick for more buffs, healing and a bit of tanking.

I've just bought a netbook and am really excited at the idea of playing Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale on it, and it runs max 1024 x 768, so really, why should I buy this EE? The game is already fantastic, the mods are brilliant, all this edition is going to do is add DLC that I don't necessarily want or will mess up the mods as well as the core game changes that will also (and I really don't think there's a way around it) mess up or completely destroy mods because its just not compatible, there's just no way they can guarantee everything will work the same. Also, they've lost the ability to update sprites and whatnot, the soundsets and graphics are fine for me anyway so what point is there honestly to wait a year or two until everything gets an EE? Can anybody think of any positives for me? I'm still going to play it on my PC as well as the netbook so its not like the resolution upgrades aren't appealing to me, but there's mods around that too.

The reason why I don't like the idea of buying the D&amp;D Anthology Collection, reinstalling and playing them is because when BG:EE drops, I'll have to install that over the original and its likely the saves will not work at all, so is there a point in getting into a really deep game when an upgrade is likely going to set me back to point a? Also, its likely I'll be playing the EE vanilla because like I said, its unlikely the mods will convert perfectly, and I assume a lot of these are final versions or aren't worked on anymore and have been abandoned so its not like I can expect working updates for all of the good ones. Lets be honest, its hardly the developers of BG:EE's job to fix the game so it works for third party mods and its likely a sacrifice to be made and just a blind hope that they can make a version better than what is already out there?

What say you? Should I get ready for the long wait or buy the Anthology and get stuck in?

Generally I'm looking for a pretty easy to play RPG game with a not too long main quest line. I don't mind too much about graphics but I'd rather it not be too bad. Oh and it also has to be cheap.

Are there any obvious party mis-matches besides alignment?

Many of the NPCs are also ""unconventional"" precisely because they're weak, but that is not an issue for me. That's just more of a challenge.

2nd Edit: I ended up making another save where he was still alive (so that when they fix it I can just go back to that point and play from there.. I don't mind playing twice!) and then I killed him off and found someone else to take along with me..

Our first session is scheduled for **Tuesday, April 10, 6:00PM (GMT-8)**. It's up to you to figure out what time that is for you, just look it up online if you're not sure. We should get together ~30 minutes beforehand to make a test run so we can bugfix and make sure our platforms are all compatible.

The current lineup (people who have confirmed this time) is:
_______

*Cyricist*, *Eschatos*, *guysholliday*, *limee64*, *NostalgiaSC*, and *spotlessline*.
_______

Sorry for the other people who either had scheduling conflicts or didn't respond. We can always set up a secondary game if there is enough interest, though! Also, our BG Tutu RP CO-OP group that meets on Fridays @ 5:30PM (GMT-8) still needs a sixth member, so PM myself or spotlessline if you're interested in that alternative.

Let's start talking character concepts! Feel free to post backstories and class ideas in this thread, or any lore questions you might have about Forgotten Realms or AD&amp;D in general.

Really looking forward to this, fellas!
_______

**EDIT1** We will be using [GameRanger](http://www.gameranger.com/) to connect. Please post your GameRanger username in this thread so we can find each other.

_______

**EDIT2** Character concepts so far:

*NostalgiaSC* Human rogue/wizard aristocratic type

*Cyricist* Human cleric of Bane tyrannical asshole type

*spotlessline* Half-elf fighter/(ranger?) justicar type

We've got our tank roles filled, but we can always use more frontliners. Looks like we have a solid mage, depending on how far down the rogue track NostalgiaSC decides to go. If it's more of a 50/50 split, we'll still probably want to have a dedicated arcane caster (sorcerer?). We would still probably benefit from having another cleric to handle healing spells since our dreadmaster won't be able to spontaneously cast them, or being less conventional with a druid. Again, depending on how much rogue NostalgiaSC decides to take, we'll probably want a skill based sneak attack focused rogue to shore up that weakness. As far as I know, spotlessline's fighter is Dexterity-based, so we would still benefit from a Strength-based fighter type. I might play a bard if it looks like we need one, since I am a Forgotten Realms loremaster, it would be nice for my character to have some roleplaying justification for knowing a lot about the Realms - so I don't have to feign ignorance all the time. Not set in stone, though. I want you guys to pick things you're in love with, not just ""what the party needs"" right now.

Very exciting!

Paladins aren't allowed in this party because we have an evil member already. Plus if we had a properly played paladin, the party would probably implode after a few minutes from conflict.

I usually start my strategy with pausing right before she starts the conversation so I can start my summons (unfortunately she casts a spell right at the beginning which will kill all but the highest level summons)

My party consists of Me (an archer), Minsc, Jaheira (optimized for elemental summons and combat), Imoen (some good higher level mage spells), Aerie (my main spellcaster. The problem is, if I forget about her for too long, she usually gets cornered by drow), and Saverok.

I set the summons on the drow to keep them busy. Things start to go downhill when Sendai's sorcerer form casts time stop. The gate and meteor always serve to distract me, while Aerie has to keep from getting hit long enough to cast pierce magic. The thief form is easy enough, and this is usually where I slow down combat in order to heal for the upcoming form.

Then invisible fiery drow come. They pile up and are hard to kill. They end up splitting up my party and getting to Aerie and Imoen.

It usually ends with just me and Minsc left over, me resorting to slayer and him berserking. This will get me to the final form, but not past it.

Thanks for any help.

Edit: Yay! I did it! Mrphaethon's trick with the summons worked wonders. Also, insect plague proved very valuable. I also didn't realize that I had the Gate spell with Aerie, so I cast that and it easily took care of the drow. Thanks to everybody!

I've always LOVED Icewind Dale, got it way back in 2002 or so and for the most part it defined RPGs for me. It got me into Diablo and Nox (lesser known Diablo clone, multiplayer was great). But in a way I feel like its ruined my ability to enjoy Baldur's Gate. IWD is linear, very combat driven, and this is a big one for me, you made your party from the get-go at the start of the game.

I've always felt a detachment from the characters you meet and join up with in BG just because I didn't design them. To me it feels wrong having one character you've made your own and having to band up with other npcs that have no correlation whatsoever to your designed character. It makes no difference if they live or die since there will be other characters that will adventure with you, while in IWD your party is there from start to finish. And if a party member ever dies, it is pretty much game over, I can see how the same idea may hold true if you become attached to one of the characters you meet, but as of yet that hasn't happened to me. The farthest I can get is to is when you get attacked at the Inn at the start of the game before I get too aggravated to play anymore.

I'm sorry if I'm ranting, I have nothing against BG. I can recognize it's a fantastic game and want to enjoy it.
