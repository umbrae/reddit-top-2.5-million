Hi all,

This release brings several important fixes, UI improvements, [moderator tools](http://i.imgur.com/S5X6n.jpg), and some alternate ways to [navigate](http://i.imgur.com/bU4UkMj.jpg) and interact with Alien Blue.

Here's what you can expect from this update. I've highlighted the juicy bits, as well as parts of the update that were discussed frequently in this subreddit:

--------------

Jase (alienblue)

Hi all,

I wanted to share another one of my projects that may come in handy for some of you.

Over the past few months, I made a custom **YouTube** client for my daughter (named after her). I figured it may come in handy for some of you too so I decided to drop it on the App Store.

It is completely native, very fast and will run on all iOS 6+ devices (iPad included). For those of you using Alien Blue, the interface should feel comfortable and familiar.

It's a far lighter project than Alien Blue and doesn't carry a lot of bells and whistles, but it may serve as a simple alternative.

So check it out, and I hope it makes life a little easier.

Cheers and very best wishes,

Jase

Many Alien Blue users have reported crash-on-launch/backgrounding issues. I wanted to let you know that I've managed to locate the cause and have already submitted a patch to Apple for approval.

Although there are many suggestions and fixes still left to implement, I had to push this out with urgency.

Along with the crash-on-launch fix, I've also disabled **Readability** by default for non-text-heavy pages - to save you the trouble of switching in/out of Optimal view.

Depending on the current wait time of Apple's approval process, the update should land in about **a week** or so. I'll also have a beefier update shortly following.

Canvas photos are currently broken in Alien Blue, due to a minor change in Imgur's image links. This is affecting all users, so I thought it best to put up an announcement.

I've already patched the issue on my end and the update is awaiting approval with Apple. It shouldn't take more than a few more days for the update to hit your devices. Let's hope it lands sooner rather than later.

Imgur has recently changed their mobile website to include [sticky banner ads](http://i.imgur.com/VEiLV.png) at the bottom of the screen. These ads scroll with the content which can give the illusion that the advertising is embedded in Alien Blue itself.

So I want to re-iterate officially that the ads are **NOT** from Alien Blue. You can verify this by opening the imgur links in Mobile Safari. I don't use advertising of any sort.

I hope this helps to clarify things.

Cheers and best wishes,

Jase

I really appreciate you being so patient with this particular update.  I know it took quite a while to push this through, but compatibility with the upcoming iOS5 created a few challenges along the way.

In addition to iOS5 compatibility, I really wanted this update to bring some much needed revisions to the application (both in design and features).

I'll highlight the juicy bits (some with screenshots) so that you can skim through:

Hope you enjoy it!

Hi all,

Much like the recent set of iPad updates, this new update for the iPhone brings together a lot of tools around subreddit discovery and grouping amongst a host of other improvements. You'll also find the new version of the Canvas feature and the **optimal** browsing view for better content handling.

I'll highlight all of the good stuff so you can just skim through:

--------------

**Discover Subreddits**

Inside Alien Blue, you'll now find a well curated and [up-to-date list](http://i.imgur.com/obJfz.png) of active subreddits ranging across a wide variety of topics. This list is maintained and updated nightly. If you see something missing, you can make a recommendation in any of the categories and they'll be live soon after.

--------------

**Subreddit Grouping**

As it stands, Reddit has the concept of a **Frontpage** that brings all of your interests in one place. [Subreddit Grouping](http://i.imgur.com/0PJgM.png) allows you to create folders like:

* My Favorites
* Fun and Funny
* Thought Provoking
* Safe at Work
* Unsafe for Work (etc.)

Then with a single tap, you will only see the posts for that group. Groups are very flexible. You can re-arrange them to put your most frequented subreddits at the top. They are also **collapsable**. Think of them as having different ""front pages"" for a variety of interests.

It's all **backed up to iCloud** and will sync across all of your other iPads, iPhones and iPod Touches.

--------------

**New Features**

* **Discover Subreddits** by category and interest (PRO)
* **Subreddit Grouping** &amp; Organisation (PRO) (Synced via iCloud)
* [Revised Canvas UI](http://i.imgur.com/SXIQm.jpg)
* Retina **Subreddit Icons**
* Visited Links are synced to iCloud between devices
* **Random** Subreddits (in Explore Reddit group)
* **Flair** (Settings -&gt; Comment Settings to enable)
* Revised UI for Send PM screen (presents captcha only when required)
* **Optimal Browsing** - Renders web articles to fit nicely
* Optimal: Image links are presented without clutter
* Optimal: Youtube videos are presented without clutter
* Optimal: Native Animated **GIF player** (with loading progress)
* Optimal: Native Imgur album browser

**Improvements**

* Specify order of Search results
* View subreddit icons and sidebar info for non-subscribed reddits
* Message Moderators
* Ability to subscribe (or add to group) directly from within a subreddit
* Exclusion filter can now be used to filter out domains
* Added link to create an account for new Reddit users
* Added Setting: Show Voting Icons (Posts)
* Added Setting: Show Voting Icons (Comments)
* Added ""Readability"" to sharing options
* Improved scroll performance in comments
* Support for double-tapping image to zoom-to-fit in browser
* Minimalist display of QuickMeme links (Optimal)
* Improved handling of spoiler tags
* Drastic improvements to animated gif load times (Optimal View)
* Disabled comment graying on touch (distracting when resting/scrolling)
* Revised Login screen UI

**Gestures** 

* Canvas Gesture: Tap &amp; Hold image for comments
* Canvas Gesture: 2-finger tap to upvote items
* Canvas Gesture: 3-finger tap to downvote items
* Canvas Gesture: Drag Up / Down to rapidly switch between grid/full view
* Posts: Drag Posts list up to load more
* Navigation Bar: Swipe right to jump directly to any previous screen

**Fixes**

* Fixed: Navigation bar glitch after watching YouTube videos
* Fixed: Thumbnails occasionally not appearing in posts list
* Fixed: Occasional crashing from unsubscribing from subreddits
* Fixed: Occasional crash when Reddit returns an error when loading comment threads
* Fixed: Post links to subreddits opening in web browser rather than natively
* Fixed: Small memory leak when ""Autoload inline images"" is disabled
* Fixed: Occasional crashes in web browser under low memory conditions
* Fixed: Particular YouTube videos causing crash
* Fixed: Brief flash of white when loading images in night mode
* Fixed: Last line of Self Text clipping in Compact mode
* Fixed: Renamed ""Read It Later"" sharing to ""Pocket""

Hope you like it folks!

Cheers and best wishes,

Jase (alienblue)

A few hours ago, Reddit [changed the URL](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/t7bek/reddit_change_saved_links_now_live_on_your_user/) used to access your **Saved Posts**. I'm scrambling to get an update ready but with the approval process (1-2 weeks), this will take a bit longer than I'd like.

Alien Blue checks the **/saved/** url, and this is no longer operational via the API. Nothing is lost so please don't worry, all of your saved posts are still available on the site.

If you see other users with this problem, please be sure to direct them to this announcement.  I'll need to pull back the iPad update from the approval queue to patch this issue, and will also try to push a point release for the iPhone as soon as I can.

Cheers and best wishes,

I wanted to gather some of your thoughts around the [recent changes](http://i.imgur.com/SXIQm.jpg) to Alien Blue's canvas (image gallery) feature on the iPhone.

How are you liking it so far? Does it feel more practical? Does it feel comfortable to use day-to-day?

The ability to play **gifs and videos** directly from within the canvas is coming very shortly. I'm also porting things across to the iPad, so I want to find out what you like or hate to make the transition as enjoyable as possible.

Cheers!

Jase

PS: I also wanted to offer some canvas related tips that you may not know:

* In full view, tapping the &lt;&gt; button in the center will show you a preview of previous &amp; next images

* Slide up or down to rapidly switch between full &amp; grid view

* 2-finger-tap to upvote, 3-finger-tap to downvote, hold tap to show comments

Glad to see all of you back on the other side of the blackout.  You've probably got a lot of redditing to do, so let's kick it off!

Features:

* **Retina Thumbnails** (currently Pro + iPhone 4/4S required)
* Comment **Link previews** (currently Pro + iPhone 4/4S required)
* Revised **Posts screen** design
* Revised **Comments screen** design
* Revised **Pull to Refresh**
* Secure **SSL authentication** to Reddit
* Indicators for adult content

Improvements:

* Ability to jump to subreddit directly from a post
* Ability to jump to submitter's details directly from a post
* Voting status now reflects in the colour of the score
* Tapping anywhere on an inbox message now marks it as read
* Graceful degradation of graphics for older devices
* Auto-link shortening when sharing with Twitter
* Minor visual improvements to Inbox screen
* Updated launch image
* Mods: **Threaded message** support for Moderator inbox
* Mods: Orangered indicator prioritised over Mod-mail indicator

Fixes:

* Fixed: Context option occasionally not finding the comment
* Fixed: HTML tags displaying in comments
* Fixed: Double spacing around quoted comments
* Fixed: Correct plural presentation, eg. 0 pts, 1 pt, 2 pts etc.
* Fixed: Missing scroll indicators in Inbox
* Fixed: Navigation bar buttons occasionally flickering
* Fixed: Purged from memory warnings when using Show All Images
* Fixed: Facebook and Twitter sharing not working

* Fixed: Https links not responding to tap
* Fixed: Default placeholder text interrupting post creation
* Fixed: Sorting by New occasionally returns no results
* Fixed: Lose place when rotating the device
* Fixed: Subscribing to Reddits occasionally crashes

**Link Previews (RIP Rick Rolling)**

I've put together a server that will create and deliver crisp retina thumbnails of links, so that you can get a glimpse of a link/video/image directly within comments. It's not perfect, but I'm continually improving it.  They are quite small in size, so to get any real benefit from it you need a retina device (iPhone 4/4S).

Note: If a user indicates in a comment that a link is not safe for work (or it is heavily downvoted), Alien Blue will not display a thumbnail preview for that link.

**Edit:** For those of you that want to use the **backgrounds** for Alien Blue 2.5 on your phones, I've uploaded them here:

* [Lock Screen](http://i.imgur.com/v6fIu.png)

Just wanted to give you an early look at Alien Blue for Mac OS.  It's still undergoing development, but it's getting there.  So without further ado, [here's what it's heading toward](http://alienblue.org/mac/).

After so much work, I'd really like everyone to be able to give it a shot to see what you think.  So as development progresses and the application becomes stable enough, it'll be available for a reddit-wide free public alpha so that you can all play with it.

I hope you like it so far. :)

Very best wishes,

Jason M.

_____________________________

Hi all,

Very happy to announce the new update.  This one introduces the Canvas, and I'm crossing my fingers that it works well on your phones.  Even though it is compatible with iOS 3.x, I strongly recommend iOS 4.x for fluidity, stability and improved gesture recognition.

Without further ado, here's what you can expect in this update.  I've highlighted the good bits so that you can skim through:

New Features / Improvements:
_____________________________

* **Canvas View** for browsing/scrolling through images (Wifi + iOS 4.x recommended)
* Ability to send **Private Messages**
* **Fixed broken images** appearing in browser
* Fixed top of text being cut-off when entering text in landscape
* Fixed low-resolution camera icon
* Fixed *italics* not rendering correctly
* Added ""Mark Visited Posts"" option to Privacy Settings
* Added notification in Messages when Reddit is under heavy load.
* Improved **UI consistency** on Create Post screen
* Fixed upside down portrait issue in Messages
* Fixed black background appearing on websites when in Night Mode.
* Improved performance and memory management

New Share Options

* Instapaper (Please see note below)
* Pinboard
* Read it Later (Please see note below)

Note: Sorry for the inconvenience, but you may need to **re-enter** your Instapaper and Read it Later passwords.

Hope you enjoy the update, and please be sure to shoot through any bugs to me at support@alienblue.org

Very best wishes,

There's gotta be a better way to discover new subreddits through Alien Blue! Well, I guess there doesn't *have to be*, but I'd love a feature like this! Maybe it can provide a list based on a term, or it can scan your current subreddits and provide suggestions. Or, maybe some sort of alphabetical list with total subscribers listed or something. What do you guys think? Maybe alienblue can chime in with some ideas too. 

EDIT (Monday morning): Holy shit, over 400 upvotes?! Clearly this is something people would like to see. A few people posted some interesting ideas, like viewing the subreddit's sidebar to see other relevant subreddits, and another person mentioned the difficulty in implementing the system. I'm really interested to see the developer's take on this but I don't think he's shown up in the comments yet.

Lots of fixes and a few goodies in this update. I apologise for taking so long for this major update, I really wanted to spend some time cleaning out old/bloated code and re-writing things to be lighter, faster, and more memory efficient.

So here's some of the highlights:

**New Canvas / Image Galleries**

In addition to a complete [re-design](http://i.imgur.com/ROrg6HZ.jpg), Canvas now supports **GIFs** and **Videos** inline. It can also be launched from inside comment threads.

**Autoplay + TV/Out**

If you have an Apple TV (or an iPad standing on your desk), you can take advantage of Canvas' new [autoplay](http://i.imgur.com/wU2PUKw.jpg) features. Choose a subreddit, hit play and sit back. Alien Blue will introduce and auto play GIFs, photos and (optionally) videos without further user-interaction. You also have a handful of options so that you can customise it to your liking. Just be sure to enable **Mirroring** when connected to an Apple TV.

**Moderation Tools**

I've brought across many of the mod tools from the iPhone version, including [Moderation Templates](http://i.imgur.com/S5X6n.jpg). Moderators can now approve/remove posts, comments and keep an eye on moderation queues.

Hi all,

Over the past several months, I've been working very hard in producing Alien Blue for the Mac OS.  In an effort to bring something really special to you guys and gals, I had enlisted some help a few months ago.

I managed to bring onboard the lead UX specialist from Lonely Planet - [Steven Caddy](http://www.stevencaddy.com/).  You've probably seen his work in almost every iPhone and iPad related Keynote Steve Jobs has delivered from the dawn of iOS.

Since February, he has been exploring every which way the redditing experience can be improved - and rightfully put together some awesome ideas to develop.  New to reddit, he was in the ideal position to evaluate user experience and discover which areas posed complications for redditors.

It gets better.  Lonely Planet's lead Objective-C developer [Yori Mihalakopoulos](http://twitter.com/yori) is also working alongside me so that the application is even more impressive from a technical standpoint.  His work has also been featured throughout Apple's keynotes - and I assure you - he's nothing less than damn impressive.  Together, we've developed a solid set of controls that drive the application.

I wanted to let all of you know how thankful I am for the opportunity to develop these applications.  It was a result of all of your lovely messages and reviews that I was able to attract such accomplished people to this project.

When I initially developed Alien Blue for the iPhone, I had no idea that it would garner so much goodwill.  With the help of these talented people, I'm going to return the favor by making these applications even better.

Very best wishes,

Jason M.

Apple just approved this **sanity** point release for your iPhones.  It fixes a couple of troubling issues that have been impacting your experience of the application.

So without further ado, here's what you can expect from this update:

Release Notes : Alien Blue v2.3.1 + v2.3.2
_________________________________

**Fixes:**

* Critical: Fixed web pages **skipping** to the top
* Fixed **images breaking** when viewed more than once
* Fixed activity indicator persisting after navigating away from browser
* Fixed stability issues for Sharing Options
* Removed Canvas Toggle while Search keyboard is showing
* Fixed crash when attempting to subscribe to subreddits while Reddit is under load.

**Improvements:**

* Added protection around accidentally navigating to **Desktop Youtube**
* Added option to **disable Connection Error warnings** (in Advanced Settings)
* Renamed ""Share"" to ""Send To..."" (to avoid confusion when using non-share options like Instapaper / Read It Later)
* Fixed black status bar on initial launch
* AB now filters out **duplicate post** listings

Thanks all, and again, many apologies for the page skipping issue.  It was one of the more annoying defects, and I'm really happy to see it disappear.

Please note that this is a small point release, and that more significant refinements are on the way for **v2.4**.  I thought it best to deliver these fixes with haste.

Very best wishes,

A quick heads up, the 2.5 update to Alien Blue (waiting for approval) needs some of the newer frameworks offered by Apple, and requires users to be on at least **iOS 4.2**.

If you are on iOS 3.x and sync regularly with iTunes, you may want to backup your old Alien Blue IPA files, on the off-chance iTunes attempts to overwrite it with the newer version.

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the **Apps** folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue / Alien Blue HD
4. Choose **Show in Finder**
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever overwrites your IPA, you can copy this file back in from your backup.

I know it's a pain in the butt, and if there were a more graceful road to transition these applications - believe me, I would.

Best wishes,

Jase",,False,self,t5_2rt3a,True,,,True,t3_o3b5o,http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/o3b5o/alien_blue_users_on_ios_3x_please_backup_your_ipas/,

Hi all,

Very excited about today's update. It brings together a lot of the thoughts I've had around subreddit discovery, and utilisation of groups.  These features are all coming to the iPhone too, so fear not.

**Discover Subreddits**

Inside Alien Blue, you'll now find a well curated and [up-to-date list](http://i.imgur.com/obJfz.png) of active subreddits ranging across a wide variety of topics. This list is maintained and updated nightly. If you see something missing, you can make a recommendation in any of the categories and they'll be live soon after.

--------------

**Subreddit Grouping**

As it stands, Reddit has the concept of a **Frontpage** that brings all of your interests in one place. [Subreddit Grouping](http://i.imgur.com/0PJgM.png) allows you to create folders like:

* My Favorites
* Fun and Funny
* Thought Provoking
* Developer Related
* Safe at Work
* Unsafe for Work (etc.)

Then with a single tap, you will only see the posts for that group. Groups are very flexible. You can re-arrange them to put your most frequented subreddits at the top. They are also **collapsable**. Think of them as having different ""front pages"" for a variety of interests.

It's all **backed up to iCloud** and will sync back to your iPhone once the 2.6 update lands in a couple of weeks. So the effort will scale across to all of your devices.

--------------

Hi all,

I thought I'd share what's coming up in the next set of updates to Alien Blue and Alien Blue HD.  Over the past few months, I've been thinking about the various ways that redditors interact with the site.  Images make up a large portion of content on Reddit, including:

* pornography
* comics
* funny pics
* photography / design

I wanted to develop a different way to consume this type of content, and to make it a nice experience when kicking back on the couch.  Here's a video of how it works:

1338910605.0,390,self.AlienBlue,um710,Alien Blue users on iOS 4.x please backup your IPAs,425,35,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/um710/alien_blue_users_on_ios_4x_please_backup_your_ipas/,"tl/dr: If you're on **iOS 5** or planning to upgrade to iOS 5, you can **ignore this message**.

Hi all,

The new version of Alien Blue for iPhone (v2.6) is almost ready, but it needs some of the newer frameworks and more importantly bug-fixes in the latest iOS versions (iOS 5+).

If you are on iOS 4.x and sync regularly with iTunes, you may want to backup your old Alien Blue IPA files, on the off-chance iTunes attempts to overwrite it with the newer version.

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the Apps folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue
4. Choose Show in Finder
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever downloads and overwrites your IPA, you can revert to this backup.

Although the vast majority of you are already on iOS 5, I suspect that some of you are running Alien Blue on 3G models on iOS 4. Dropping iOS 4 support makes updates inaccessible and I'm truly sorry for that. If I could feasibly support older versions without crippling the updates, I would in a heartbeat.

Even seemingly trivial iOS updates for consumers (eg 5.1 to 5.1.1) actually patch a lot of bugs and stability issues behind the scenes for developers. It allows one-man shows (like myself) to piggy-back on Apple's development and testing rather than create hazardous workarounds of our own.

As I type this, bug reports are piling in - so it's time for me to squish as many as I can before any of you see them.

Cheers and very best wishes!

Jase

I'm not sure how many folks in /r/AlienBlue are moderators, but for a change I thought I'd showcase what mods can expect in the upcoming 2.7 update:

[High-res image - best viewed on desktop](http://i.imgur.com/S5X6n.jpg)

This is the first of set of moderation tools, the second set will be in the update that follows. The features seen here will allow mods to approve/remove posts and notify users of moderation activity in under 3 to 4 taps.

Rather than typing common mod messages and manually leaving comments, the moderator can make use of the stock templates or create their own based on the rules of their subreddit. Alien Blue will then send a message or leave a comment in the background without any further interaction so that the moderator can move on.

The template engine is really flexible and context aware. Here is a [closer look](http://i.imgur.com/ibDRK.png) at how templates can be edited and some of the [tags](http://i.imgur.com/IZdYa.png) that are built in.

The interactions are focused entirely on moderating as quickly as possible on a touch screen, with no unnecessary typing, dialogs, or confirmations.

You'll also have access to mod queues, removed posts and reported links (both at the top level, and per subreddit).

Moderating comments will be coming in a later update. Prior to tackling that, I want to make sure that post moderation is refined first. The subsequent update to this will also see an overhaul of the Mod Mail section.

Hope it looks alright so far folks!

Just a moment ago, one of the beta testers had found that the Canvas feature seems to be crashing from time-to-time.  I'm looking into that one as we speak.  I've still got a long list of outstanding issues to fix from your bug reports, so please don't be discouraged if your suggestions haven't made it on this release - I'm on it.

Hope you like it folks. If you run into any issues, please be sure to shoot me an email at support@alienblue.org.

Very best wishes,

I've used Alien Blue (pro version) since it was released, and it's my most-used app on my phone BY FAR. Because I use it so much, this Imgur thing is starting to really bother me. I've seen a few posts around detailing Imgur issues with albums not showing up, in the wrong order with Optimal, etc., and how you can reset settings to fix some of these issues. I don't know if the problem I have is fixable like that; I'm not a developer, so I can't tell if the issue is with AB or Imgur or both. When tapping a post to go to a direct Imgur image, the vast majority of the time the image doesn't load on the first, second, and sometimes even third try. This is on Wi-Fi, LTE, 4G, EDGE... everything. It's so common that I'm used to it by now. Tap a link, see it doesn't load, swipe back. Repeat another time. Sometimes I need to load Optimal to force it to load, then reload it in Safari mode. I feel like I'm starting to develop a twitch with this reloading ritual. 

My question is WHY? If Jase has gone over it before, this exact issue, can someone link me to it? What exactly is going on? Is AB not getting the right information? Is Imgur unreliable and simply not loading on request? AB users make up a large portion of reddit's traffic; if its an Imgur issue, can we petition the site to fix the problem? Because its destroying the reddit experience. Yes, comments and nearly every other setting and corner of AB works extremely well and has become very polished over time, but reddit uses Imgur almost exclusively for image links, and it's tough to browse normally without getting fed up with the images not loading. So what's the deal?

Please post constructive comments, I'm sure we all love AB and the work that has gone into it. I just had to get this out into the open. I love using AB to browse reddit in my free time but I feel like pulling my hair out with this.

EDIT: I just want to say thank you for the recognition here, I get no karma for the self post and I just wanted these issues to get exposure because they break the experience so badly. Hopefully the problem will get worked out.

Some of you may already be using the canvas on Alien Blue HD for iPad, so this won't come as too much of a surprise.

The iPhone update is currently in the hands of Apple's review team, and **awaiting approval**.

For launch, the Canvas is completely compatible with Night-Mode and supports different themes (for those who aren't a fan of the wood grain).  It is also rich in gesture recognition, so that you can pinch-zoom or double-tap, depending on what is most comfortable for your hands.

It is iOS 3.x compatible, but it's far more fluid when running on iOS 4.

So for now, I'll sign off and report back when the update is available on the app store. :)

1322632695.0,311,self.AlienBlue,muf4c,An explanation as to why small fixes in Alien Blue are taking time.,342,31,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/muf4c/an_explanation_as_to_why_small_fixes_in_alien/,"Hi all,

Lately, there have been some bugs that have been affecting your interaction with Alien Blue.  Some of these have been small and infrequent bugs, others more prominent.

For example, there were small changes in Reddit's API that caused some posts/comments to show weird HTML markup.  This raised questions about 'Why it takes so long for small things to get fixed?'

I know that some people have expressed frustration with how long small fixes are taking and I am sympathetic to the aggravation that these delays cause.  As a user of Alien Blue myself, each bug is not just inconvenient, it is personally embarrassing.  So rest assured, I'm on it.

The reason it takes me time to roll out tiny fixes is that I'm in the middle of coding a substantial update.  Each Alien Blue update results in drastic changes in the code base, as I prototype and explore better ways to improve your interaction with Reddit's content.

Ideally, I would prefer to roll-back the code, fix the tiny bug and then release - but there is no guarantee that things would be stable when building against the latest SDKs.  The fix would still need to go through a full testing cycle to make sure that the rest of the application is functional.

Beta testers of Alien Blue can tell you from experience that the testing period is quite lengthy prior to each App Store release.  Combined with the approval times, this is the reason I try to pack as much into each official release as possible.

When I don't release an immediate fix, it is because I'm not confident that the quick update will actually be any better.  I usually reserve that gamble for when things really mess up (like crashing on launch, unable to authenticate etc).

**tl/dr:** In short, please try to bear with me while I prepare the next update.

After yesterday's tiny 2.3.1 point release, some of you (including myself) are experiencing the browser snapping to the top of the page on particular websites (like nytimes.com).  I just wanted to let you know that I have patched this bug, and am in the process of submitting the update to Apple.

As a workaround, using **Readability or Mobilizer** in AB's internal browser will resolve this issue until the patch is approved by Apple.  Alternatively, if you haven't already updated, you can **skip the 2.3.1** update (which primarily fixes the stability of the Sharing options).

Alien Blue updates typically take just over a week to get through the approval queue, and I hope it doesn't cause you too much aggravation in the mean time.  I'll do my best to speed this update through pronto.

Very best wishes,

Jason M. (alienblue)",,False,self,t5_2rt3a,True,,,True,t3_fy3vn,http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/fy3vn/browser_jumping_to_the_top_in_some_websites_in_231/,

I hope you're ready for some crisp artwork and **insanely detailed thumbnails**.

Although this is predominantly a retina related release, you will also find the following changes:

**Alien Blue for iPad 2.0.1**

* Critical Fix: Non-retina images showing showing on the new iPad
* High quality text rendering in Optimal Article view for iPad 2+
* Fixed: Canvas background distorts when rotating from Landscape to Portrait
* Fixed: Canvas comment count is off-center
* Fixed: /r/Bestof links don't show the subreddit and username unless the pane is forced to resize
* Fixed: Slight misalignment of show canvas button on retina iPad

I'm busily working on the next update which will give you some additional control over the **layout of panes** (and their widths).

Enjoy your new iPads folks!

Cheers and best wishes,

- Jase (alienblue)

Early this morning, I discovered a memory leak that causes the new Alien Blue 2.5 update to misbehave and eventually crash after prolonged use.  I should have caught it earlier in testing, but it only began to manifest as I had more time to sit with the application.

Although it breaks my heart to pull it back out of Apple's approval queue, I decided to patch and re-submit it.  It sends AB to the back of Apple's queue, but I can't knowingly push an unstable release out, despite how excited I am for you to try it.

I've already patched the bug, and will be putting it through its paces over the next 24 hours (to make sure that I didn't screw anything else up) and then resubmitting to Apple.  If all goes well, it should be approved by late next week. :)

Comment Markup
------------------------------
**Bold**, *italic*, quotes, headers and lists should now be rendered correctly.  I am still working on improving the appearance of quoted text as it's not perfect just yet.  I wrote up the comment markup engine in CoreText, so scroll performance should still be speedy.  The only caveat with comment markup and inline links is that you need at least iOS 3.2 (as the CoreText library isn't available in older versions of the iOS).

Inline Links
------------------------------
Similar to Alien Blue HD, the inline links in Alien Blue are very forgiving to large fingers or misplaced taps.  Alien Blue will automatically check the area surrounding your tap for links to minimize any frustration.  Now you can **disable the footnoted buttons** via the Comment Settings if you prefer.

Outstanding Issue :: Missing Subreddits
------------------------------
Quite a few people are reporting that some subreddits are not showing in their list.  For some reason, the Reddit API is returning only a subset of subreddits and I'm looking into this problem as we speak.  In the meantime, I have made **Casual Subreddits** free for everyone to reduce the impact of this problem.

Hope you enjoy this update!  Please be sure to send me a PM or an email if you notice any other serious bugs.

One of the best iOS apps, period. However, I've noticed that using it -- and simply leaving it open, results in significant battery drain on both my iPhone 4 and iPad 2. This leads me to believe it's not isolated. 

Forgive me if this is an issue that is common knowledge, but does anyone else see their battery life plummet with AB?

EDIT: Wow, I had no idea how lively this subreddit was. If only posts /r/Wordpress had these kinds of responses... Sigh.

So far, I'm not the only one who perceives a noticeable battery drain issue pertaining to AB. Perhaps it correlates to iOS6 and the newer AB on older devices. Those of us having issues have been advised to try out an app called Carat to diagnose the problem.

Edit 2, Not Making This Shit Up: Yesterday, after I posted this, I was using AB on my phone all day and the charge held like a champ. Felt like a dick calling out the AB guys, but I still had that massive power drain happen on my iPad in the morning. Fast forward to today. My phone is on its cradle, 100% charge. GF calls me at 11:50 AM, we talk til 12:05. Since then I've been using AB and my charge is down to 72%. It's 12:20 PM at the time of this edit. That is not a linear power drain. That is not normal.

Usually I present the release notes when the update gets approved, but I thought this would put some of your minds at ease with regard to bugs and UI options until the update gets approved.

So without further ado, here are the release notes for the upcoming Alien Blue 2.5.1 update, which will be submitted to the App Store very shortly. I've highlighted the ones that seem most critical based on your comments:

You may have noticed that your inbox is taking longer to load than usual.  This is due to extraneous load on the Reddit.com server recently, and unfortunately falls beyond my control.  Alien Blue isn't doing anything clever here, it's just waiting for a response from Reddit.

The admins are able to put cache to good use on other areas of the site, but your inbox (especially when there is an unread message) is next to impossible to cache.  This is why you may notice the same delay using a desktop browser when you have an orangered (and subsequently entering your inbox will work faster until the next time you have an unread message).

I can't do anything about the response delay from Reddit, but hopefully I can find a better way of masking this delay to you guys.  For example, by pre-fetching unread messages in the background.

Very best wishes,

Jason Morrissey

To save the developer the time of hunting them all down, and maybe help people decide whether or not they want to risk the upgrade, I will try to list all the issues as I find them.

**1. When you manually enter a subreddit, no posts will appear until you pull to refresh**

**2. When sliding back or forward, you dont see the next view until its all the way on the screen, just the textured background** 

**3.While in canvas mode, the bottom toolbar/navigation bar never disappear**

**4. All Alertviews are cutoff**

**5. Actionsheet buttons dont change color when you tap them, making it hard to see if you are selecting the right one**

**6. Manually entering a subreddit and switching to fullscreen mode reveals the background texture where the toolbars used to be**

**7. You can't delete posts, the delete button seems to be missing**

**8. Shit hits the fan when you manually search for a username**

**9. Tapping the navigation bar on the main Reddits view 5 times while not in night mode causes a crash**

If you find anymore issues, leave a comment and ill try to add it to the list.

Astronomy app Stellarium, for example, lets you activate a night mode that makes everything red. That way you can watch it in the dark while looking at the night sky and through a telescope, without losing your night vision.

A red tinted filter is all you need for this to work. I have no idea how hard that would be to pull off though.

The current night mode is really nice, but does nothing to be ""night vision friendly"", it just isn't so sharp and bright.

The added bonus is that while white and blue/green colours will make your brain expect daylight and delay the release of melatonin, red tinted light doesn't have that effect, and so you can more easily keep your sleep schedule healthy. Probably something most redditors using AB could need!

We all like reading stuff on reddit for ages before we fall asleep, but with this kind of night mode you could do that without falling asleep quite as late :)

It's a relatively small update, but there are some goodies here. I'll highlight the juicy bits so that you can skim through:

**New Features / Improvements:**

- **Retina subreddit icons**
- Ability to **collapse side-bar** (bottom left corner)
- Added option: **Resize Posts Pane** to Fit (Legacy Behavior) in Settings
- Added option: Use Original Reddit Subreddit Icons (non-retina) in Advanced Settings
- Improved highlight state for comment icon
- Improved image caching and performance
- Improved **sensitivity** to more easily switch between panes
- Ability to flush all image cache directly from Settings

**Gestures:** (**Visual Guide** available in Settings screen)

- Gesture: [Drag beyond a browser](http://i.imgur.com/KUpKe.png) pane to show comments
- Gesture: Drag beyond a comment pane to show article/photo/video

**Fixes:**

- Fixed: **Post list snapping** upward when switching posts
- Fixed: Occasional lack of visual response for rapid taps
- Fixed: Slight delay after tapping the ""Comment"" or ""Link"" before pane becomes visible
- Fixed: Thumbnails occasionally flickering when switching between posts
- Fixed: Cannot downvote a comment that has a single thumbnail link
- Fixed: Incorrect zoom level when tapping on Optimal browser
- Fixed: Post links to subreddits opening in web browser rather than natively

**Retina Subreddit Icons**

This update begins the introduction of custom high resolution [subreddit icons](http://i.imgur.com/AStmZ.jpg) for Alien Blue users.  Reddit's default subreddit icons don't scale well on retina devices and are often inconsistently positioned.

As you can imagine, creating an icon for each subreddit is an ambitious task, but it will make things look a lot sharper and consistent on your screens. I'm creating and **uploading icons daily**, so please bear with me while I roll these out. I can't take requests just yet, as I'm currently working backward from subreddit popularity.

If you'd like to help me in making these, I've created a page where you can download the [PSD template](http://alienblue.org/icons/) and upload your own. I'll add this to the sidebar for easy referral.

**More control over pane widths**

One of the polarising attributes of the 2.0 update was the use of horizontal screen space. For those of you that prefer more width (like the 1.x versions), this update also gives you some additional options:

- Collapse/expand side bar (changes appearance when you get orangered)
- Compact Portrait Panes (Settings -&gt; Appearance)
- Resize Posts pane to Fit - legacy behaviour (Settings -&gt; Posts)
- Disable Voting Icons (Settings-&gt;Posts)

I've split these into different settings to give you more control over behaviour. I'm still working on improving the balance between the use of screen space and giving enough breathing room to items onscreen so you'll continue to see refinements over the next couple of updates.

Hope you like it folks!

Cheers and best wishes,

- Jase (alienblue)

Alongside the new update for the iPhone, I was able to push through a small point release for the iPad version of Alien Blue to bring some stability, UI improvements and themes.

Here's what you can expect from today's update:

New Features
------------

* [3 new themes](http://i.imgur.com/wYmqg.jpg) (Blossom, Lion, Fire) + Classic Blue
* New **Create Post** screens and camera/image upload support from iPad 2
* Report posts for moderation
* Ability to **up/downvote from Inbox**

Improvements
------------

* Improved visual feedback when interacting with post list
* Improved layout of post thumbnails
* Revised UI for options drawer for Posts
* Revised UI for options drawer for Comments
* Replaced legacy voting icons
* Added grips to ""More"" button to indicate sliding
* Added pull-to-refresh in Messages screen
* Improved layout of post details above comments
* Replaced nesting &gt; with dots for deeply nested comments

Fixes
-----

* Fixed crash when replying to personal messages
* Fixed crash when attempting to save/restore from state
* Fixed truncated usernames in deep threads
* Fixed Comments button glowing incorrectly in Posts list
* Fixed uneven padding on lengthy comments
* Improved compatibility with iOS5

As I mentioned in the Alien Blue v2.4 [iPhone announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/km1u3/alien_blue_v24_iphone_now_available/), there's still a lot of work to do, and a handful of outstanding items still on my list.

This is a comparatively small point release, but I thought it best to get this in your hands as soon as possible to reduce crashing related bugs.  So please don't be discouraged if your reported bug wasn't fixed in this release, I'm on it. :)

Hope you like it folks!

TL/DR: New update = Rage comics + Push notifications (and lots more.) Update may take a couple of hours to become available in your country's App Store.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone,

Apple has just approved the newest Alien Blue update.  So that you can quickly skim through what's new, I've highlighted the most requested features/improvements in **bold**:

New Features / Improvements:
----------------------------

* Added support for displaying **rage comics** inline with comments (Requires iOS 4.0+, iOS 4.2+ recommended)
* Added support for **Deleting comments**
* Insert comment **reply in place** (rather than via refresh).
* **Spoilers** are now hidden behind a tap
* AB now uses **dark launch images** for reduced contrast
* Instant visual feedback of subscribed/unsubscribed subreddits
* Simplified settings/preferences
* Tap &amp; holding on Posts will reveal additional options
* Improved visual response when tapping UI elements
* Improved visual polish when displaying posts
* Show All Images will now only show traffic warning once
* Bookmarklet support for creating posts
* Ability to Restore Upgrade (on new/restored devices)
* Replaced progress bars with activity indicators
* Youtube links bypass Auto-Mobilizer
* Updated button icons for footnotes
* Replaced icons for broken images
* Removed ""Do you want to exit Alien Blue?"" warning in browser
* Removed ""http://www."" from links for better use of horizontal space
* **Bold post title** option available in Settings

Push Notifications (via Boxcar)
----------------------------
Alien Blue now subscribes to a URL scheme that will allow **Boxcar** to launch Alien Blue when you receive new **push notifications**.  Boxcar will be issuing an update on their servers shortly to add Alien Blue support to your iOS devices.  Please be sure to give them a bit of time while they test things out.

Support for fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu rage faces
------------------------------------
Although rage faces will work in iOS 4.0, I highly recommend using 4.2+ as a bug exists in the 4.0/4.1 CoreText that may scale the images incorrectly.

Other Fixes: 
---------------
* Fixed: (Critical) Infinite loop caused when linking to App Store
* Fixed: Some subscribed subreddits not appearing
* Fixed: *Italics* not working
* Fixed: Improved connection error handling when Reddit is under load
* Fixed: Added support for HTML escaped characters
* Fixed: Aspect-ratio distortion of thumbnails
* Fixed: Night-Mode now works with Mobilizer

Random Crashes or Login Issues
------------------------------
If the app crashes on you, or you experience authentication issues, please be sure to launch Mobile Safari and check Reddit.com to see if the site is down.  The Reddit API can act unpredictably when Reddit is under heavy load, and this causes issues within Alien Blue.  With each update, I try to improve connection issues, but somehow there's always something unexpected that comes up.

Hope you like it!  Now time to fix things up for Alien Blue HD. :)

Very best wishes,

Many of you have noticed that **nsfw** subreddits are coming up empty in Alien Blue.  A few days ago, Reddit's API [changed](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/itaa1/reddit_change_hide_not_safe_for_work_links_if/) to hide nsfw content unless you explicitly opt-in to see it in your Reddit preferences.

The setting looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/XnoGt.png) and you can make the change directly on the site here:

In the upcoming update, AB will prompt you inside the application to avoid any confusion - but this will get you get back on track in the meantime.

-----------------------------------

Hi everyone,

I'm especially excited about today's update.  This release presents a feature that I've been planning for some time, and one that should make browsing image heavy subreddits more enjoyable.  Here's a what it looks like:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ-XLNDo388
(mildly-nsfw)

It's not perfect by any means, but the sooner you get to play with it, the sooner I can get an idea of what you like and dislike.  I really can't thank the beta testers enough for their help, even though I'm convinced that it was used exclusively for pornography.

So here's what's new.  I've highlighted the best bits so that you can skim through:

New Features / Improvements:
----------------------------

* **Canvas** view for browsing/scrolling through images.
* Ability to send **private messages**
* **Instant comment reply** (without requiring refresh).
* Added support for displaying **rage comics** inline with comments (Requires iOS 4.2)
* Added support for **Deleting comments**
* Spoilers are now hidden behind a tap
* Instant visual feedback of subscribed/unsubscribed subreddits
* **Simplified settings**
* Tap &amp; holding on Posts will reveal additional options
* Improved visual response when tapping UI elements
* Improved visual polish when displaying posts
* Show All Images will now only show traffic warning once
* Bookmarklet support for creating posts
* Replaced progress bars with activity indicators
* Youtube links bypass Auto-Mobilizer
* Updated button icons for footnotes
* Replaced icons for broken images
* Removed ""Do you want to exit Alien Blue?"" warning in browser
* Removed ""http://www."" from links for better use of horizontal space
* *Bold* title option available in Settings
* Ability to **manage/exclude share options**.
* Added ""Mark Visited Posts"" to Privacy Settings

New Share Options 
-----------------

* Thanks to Nate Weiner's [ShareKit](http://getsharekit.com/)
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Pinboard
* Google Reader
* Delicious
* Tumblr
* Instapaper *
* Read it Later *

Note: Sorry for the inconvenience, but you may need to re-enter your Instapaper and Read it Later passwords.

Other Fixes:
----------------------------

* Fixed: Improved connection error handling when Reddit is under load
* Fixed: Some subscribed subreddits not appearing
* Fixed: Infinite loop caused when linking to App Store
* Fixed: Added support for HTML escaped characters
* Fixed: Aspect-ratio distortion of thumbnails
* Fixed: Night-Mode now works with Mobilizer
* Fixed: *Italics* not rendering correctly
* Fixed: Added ""Reddit may be under heavy load"" notification to Messages
* Fixed: Fixed broken image links in Browser View

Hope you like it folks, and please keep me posted if you experience any issues.

Very best wishes,

Jason Morrissey

Edit: I am talking about the option to add subreddits to a group and not the circlejerk+atheism default behavior. Check this image bellow. You can create a group with just some subreddits and access this group individually. Which is IMHO way better than the '+' default way. As you can see I have 2 different groups. One for   Game development and another one for Game of thrones. I can access then by the group or individually. its a killer feature.

There's a lot of functionality to pack on this screen, and most of it is hidden away until you need it.  The features can be swiped left and right (via the little tabs on the left and right).  This is something that I hope will be easily discoverable once you get to play around with it.

I'm crossing my fingers that it will go down well in testing.

Very best wishes,

Hi all,

I've been busily preparing a significant (to put it lightly) update for iPad users. It leans on some of Apple's newer frameworks, and will require at least **iOS 5.0**.

If you're planning on sticking with iOS 4 for the foreseeable future, please be sure to backup your existing Alien Blue IPA files on the off-chance that  iTunes attempts to overwrite it once the update lands.

Here's how you can back it up:

1. Open iTunes
2. Go into the Apps folder in the left sidebar
3. Right-click on Alien Blue HD
4. Choose Show in Finder
5. Copy that file to a safe place somewhere on your drive

If iTunes ever downloads and overwrites your IPA, you can revert to this backup.

Alrighty, I'm gonna get back to making this worth the wait. Cheers and best wishes,

Jase",,False,self,t5_2rt3a,False,,,True,t3_qej6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/qej6o/alien_blue_hd_users_on_ios_4x_please_backup_your/,moderator

I tried the AB client for Youtube (jasmine?) when it came out but it didn't seem to resolve the buffering bug. Needless to say I kept utilizing AB for the task.

------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

The app is crashing frequently for a lot of people since the latest 2.2 update.  If you haven't updated yet, please hold off for a couple of days.

I have issued an **urgent release to Apple** to alleviate these issues, along with a request for them to expedite the approval process.  Version 2.2.1 of Alien Blue is now awaiting approval, and hopefully I can bring back the stability quickly.

To help alleviate the crashes in the meantime, please try to run Alien Blue on it's own (without too many other backgrounded tasks).  This will reduce the impact until the new update is rolled out to your phone.

Sorry for this everyone, I should have caught it earlier.

Very best wishes,

- Jason M. (alienblue)

------------------------------

PS: For those interested in what's causing the problems, it's a badly handled memory warning that causes the Pull-to-Refresh to crash.  This combined with time-outs/bad responses from the Reddit API (when it is under heavy traffic), is causing a lot of instability.

------------------------------

PPS: Please keep sending your crash logs through.  I've patched the biggest culprit that I'm aware of, but there may be other stability bugs remaining.

I just got a chance to try Alien Blue on the new iPad, and it looks like the **non-retina** assets are coming through instead of the high-res images. This was likely due to the update being compiled prior to the iPad announcement (before the newer SDKs were made officially available).

Fear not, I've got an update from a few days earlier still sitting in the approval queue, which should be approved any day now. That update will bring the high-res artwork and ultra-crisp thumbnails to your shiny new screens!

Cheers, and thanks for bearing with me while I fumble around getting things to work on these new gadgets. :)

There is a critical update waiting for you in the App Store, and this should **bring stability** back to Alien Blue.  Please be sure to [send crash logs](http://alienblue.org/faq.html#q8) if the app continues to crash for you, so that I can issue additional patches to Apple.

Along with the crashing issues, I addressed the following:

* Fixed: Poorly rendered **thumbnails**
* Fixed: Re-introduced **rotation lock** into the Settings

Please let me know if all is now working well.  I've had some difficulty recreating the crashes on my phone, so I'd appreciate any re-assurance you could provide as to improvements.

Thanks everyone, and once again, very sorry for the frustration caused over the past couple of days.

Before reporting any issues if your device is jailbroken, restore your device. Yes, it sounds like a pain to do but at the end of the day the developer released the app for the shipped version of iOS. If you decide to run a modified version then it's up to *you* to make sure your jailbreaking hasn't caused the problem.

I open an album, which are containing some sort of ""comic"". But the order of the images are not as it should be, so the ""comic"" are becoming non-understandable.

It may take a couple of hours to appear on your country's App Store, as it has just been approved.

-------------------------------

Hi everyone,

I've been working through a long list of bugs, and feature requests to bring you the first update to Alien Blue HD.  If you have already reported something that isn't in this release, please don't worry, it's on its way.  I prefer to release updates frequently, and sometimes it means that I need to roll out fixes/features over multiple releases.

Here's what you can find in Alien Blue HD v1.1.  I've highlighted some of the features most requested since the launch of ABHD:

Are these updates coming to the iPhone version as well?
-----------------------------------------------
Absolutely.  They're already awaiting approval and should be out very shortly.  I'll put up an announcement as soon as it's live on the app store.

Inline Links
------------------------------------------------
I just want to make a note for those of you who are blessed with larger fingers and often find links hard to tap.  I have developed Alien Blue to also check the area surrounding your tap so that you don't need to pixel-hunt links.  It is quite forgiving to misplaced taps.

Hope you like it.  Give it a shot, and please keep me posted if you run into any problems.  You can [report a bug here on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlueNews/comments/d768a/hd_report_any_bugs_or_suggestions_for_alien_blue/) or shoot me an email.  Also please be sure to [leave a review on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/app/alien-blue-hd-reddit-client/id390863118?mt=8) as these can positively impact the approval process for upcoming updates.

Very best wishes,

Edit: I understand that a single tap opens the options and another tap closes. I was just wondering if there was a timing aspect involved. Like is a quick tap-tap is possible to do an alternative action in iOS. It might not be possible and even if it is, it might be a bad idea.

Just wanted to share how the upcoming Alien Blue HD update is shaping up.  I sent a beta around for testing yesterday, and as soon as I fix up the few quirks that those good folks have spotted, I'll pop this baby up on the App Store to download.

http://i.imgur.com/b8xjL.png

The slightly revised design spaces things out a little better and reduces the use of color to allow emphasis on the content.

I've fixed a host of [bugs](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=w8hhAEEg) and implemented some popular requests.

If the feedback from testing is positive (and stable), I'll be submitting to the App Store this week.

Hope you like it. :)

Over the past week, I've been re-writing the ""Create Post"" screen.  It's a part of Alien Blue that I feel has been subpar, and I really wanted to change that with the upcoming iPhone update.  So I locked myself away for a few days, and re-worked the user experience for creating new posts.

This is what it looks like:

It's far more interactive and approachable now and it's undergoing beta testing (along with the revised comment entry).

I'm creating a suite of [iOS controls/libraries](https://github.com/jasonmorrissey/) for use in the new Alien Blue iOS updates.  With each component, I'm building a Demo project and making them as easy to use as possible for other developers.  They're completely open sourced and BSD licensed so that you can freely use them in your own applications.

The old code base was pretty messy, and really tightly coupled with Alien Blue's functionality - so I'm working my way through and making its pieces far easier to use.

I know that many of you subscribe to this subreddit for Alien Blue discussion (and not necessarily code), so I wanted to see if you guys were interested in seeing posts relating to code components from time-to-time.

So please let me know, and I can be as verbose or as quiet about code as you'd like - after all, this subreddit is about being able to interact with you in the best way possible.

From a desktop browser or mobile Safari, you will now see a 'wiki' tab next to your 'saved' tab.

What is the wiki?  Basically, it's just a better place for us to stick a lot of useful information rather than trying to cram it all into the sidebar.

Right now, the wiki includes a FAQ section for many of the questions that get asked here on a daily basis, a user guide section, and a troubleshooting section for some common problems. There are also links to reddit's FAQ, and /r/help's FAQ. Both contain a lot of useful information for new users, or those who aren't too familiar with how reddit works. 

This is all very much a work in progress, and we will be adding to it whenever possible.

Some of you may have noticed that on-occasion Alien Blue drops the ball and doesn't provide you with consistent link previews for **YouTube** links.  This should all be sorted now:

I'll give it a shot here, and will eat my words if these don't work:

[Video One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI4lFjWoFqc)

[Video Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhRf2mYrZmg&amp;feature=player_embedded)

If you're rocking Alien Blue Pro on the iPhone or Alien Blue for iPad, all of these should now come up without any trouble.

I've also beefed up the smarts when users link to the App Store. As you're all iPhone/iPad users, you most likely hang around subreddits where people link to other apps.  Alien Blue will now present you with the **App Store icon** anytime someone links to an application.

Like this: **(see footer)**

[Angry Birds](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8)

[Tiny Wings](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-wings/id417817520?mt=8)

You get the idea. It's a small detail, but it'll give these types of links a bit more dimension.

I better get back to it! :)  Hope it all looks well so far.

My phone kept track of everything I up'd and down'd, but not once was it sent to my reddit account. Even when I visted the ""Liked"" section in Alien Blue - nothing. However, if I were to go back to the page on my iPhone in Alien Blue, it would show the up or down. 

Did anyone else experience this lack in communication from Alien Blue to Reddit?

* (iPhone/iPad) Swipe a comment to the left to collapse every comment in the thread made by that parent comment.

* (iPhone/iPad; **[PRO]**) When you get to the bottom of the page, there is a switch with 'more' on it. It can be slid left or right to hide all read posts or just load more. (from Sir_Spishyus)

* (iPhone/*Unconfirmed*) Swipe left on a comment with two fingers to open a new window with that comment highlighted. Useful for reading replies to comments that are already deep in the comment's children. (from trackguy94)

Just a reminder that if YouTube starts to direct you to the **Desktop** site rather than the **Mobile** site, you may have accidentally tapped the ""Desktop"" link while viewing a video.  YouTube provides no easy way to switch back to the Mobile site, but there is a way to set things back in Alien Blue.

If you jump into your Alien Blue Settings, and scroll down to the Privacy Settings, you will see an option called **Clear Browser Cookies**.  This should get YouTube working as you expect.
