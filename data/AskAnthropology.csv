But ever since I was a lowly undergrad I heard profs say that Diamond's perspective was way off and that his arguments do not stand, but no one ever really explained why. From what I do know of his ideas, he is clearly an environmental determinist to the extreme, and as [Wade Davis said in a recent book review](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jan/09/history-society), Diamond loves to answer questions that never needed to be asked in the first place. Plus he is not an expert in anthropology or archaeology, which is not inherently a problem if you do good work, but he doesn't.

So can anyone who is more familiar with Diamond than I explain in a more in-depth way just why we dislike him so much? 

Edit: I guess I should add that I think it would be good if a few people actually explained this in the comments.

Since I'm in a field with a few more old fogeys than digital anthropology, I'm going to be posting without identifying my real name but here's a bit about me:

* I recently submitted my PhD thesis and am waiting for my viva (oral defence). 

* My masters' research followed the work of scholars like [Matthew Spriggs](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=matthew+spriggs+radiocarbon&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearchers.anu.edu.au%2Fresearchers%2Fspriggs-mjt&amp;ei=eFkKUuWrJq_8yAHf7YCoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtBz__EyfznJov9q96YXIUNnGj1A&amp;bvm=bv.50500085,d.aWc) in establishing rigorous ""chronometric hygiene"" for evaluating already-published radiocarbon dates. I also did some lab work, learning to prepare materials for AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) radiocarbon dating. I also studied Bayesian modelling of existing radiocarbon dates, which is a statistical technique for improving the precision and accuracy of dates. 

* My PhD research expanded on my masters' research into radiocarbon dating and Bayesian modelling, but also looked at OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) and tephrochronology (dating using volcanic ash). My ultimate goal is to use chronology to link up archaeological and environmental records of climate change and see if there is are any correlative relationships.

* My geographical/temporal area of interest is the North Atlantic from the end of Roman Britain to the present day.

* I have done fieldwork all over the UK, including in the southeast, the Orkneys, and Northern Ireland, and also in Iceland and the US. 

* My general background is in archaeological science, so if you have any questions about non-dating aspects, such as dietary isotopes, materials, or geophysics, I would be happy to answer them or direct you to a source that can.

edit: I'm going to head off now as it has gotten quite late, but I'll check back tomorrow to answer any last questions that people may leave.

I'm hoping to figure out at least three strong areas of evidence that support these theories (but I also want to address the opposition).

This post is more presenting an idea and asking for feedback or further insight than asking an open-ended question, so forgive me if this is not the place for it.

If I understand the term correctly, social capital refers to ones capacity to call in favors (in the form of resources or services - and I use both terms very loosely) from others when in need. It can be earned or gained by displaying that one has the capacity and willingness to offer similar assistance to others when they are in need. It sort of represents an intangible commodity present in relationships of long-term reciprocal altruism.

Social capital may not be consciously perceived as a means to call in favors, rather just as the understanding that one person likes and respects another person.

Is this concept related to the desire for karma on Reddit? It's obvious that we can't turn in karma for favors from those who upvoted us, but it does represent others' approval and appreciation for what we have to offer in online conversation. Could there be a crossover between the natural drive to gain social capital and some users' (myself included) drive to gain karma?

Such widespread use of psychoactive substances would presumably have a cumulative evolutionary impact.

This past winter, I took part in a collaborative design project with fellow students and Engineering Ministries Int'l to devise a sewage treatment system for a particular Kenyan university.

We discovered quickly that the largest design challenges weren't material or structural, but cultural. The university's administration and student body simply didn't agree with what we thought was necessary. Granted, that was their right as client, but ultimately it was very difficult to offer up any solution that met their needs.

A team before this project had designed for them a three ditch oxidation pond (a type of sewage treatment system.) The university ultimately built only one of those units, which failed quickly and produced a strong, rancid odor; in response, the university refused to complete the project or build any other type of oxidation pond, soured by this failure.

I've since realized that the issue lay not in the design, but in conveying the importance of certain aspects to the client -- and we simply did not have a broad enough understanding of their perceptions of water quality to relate that.

The Qin dynasty laid the foundation for ""Chinese"" identity, in Europe Rome did a similar thing. Both standardized and spread cultural products such as writing, measurement systems, money, and bureaucratic institutions across their diverse empires.  

Despite these similartities however, post-Qin China seems to have gone through many more and much longer eras of political unification than  medeival Europe. 

Compounding my puzzlement about this is the fact that imperial Rome maintained control over its lands and people for hundreds of years, whereas the Qin dynasty essentially collapsed after the death of Qin Shi Huang, its first emperor.

If not, what does it do that's not merely descriptive ""area studies""? What are even the big empirically driven debates?",18,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1g8w1a/has_sociocultural_anthropology_jumped_the_shark/,"I'm a sociologist.  For most of the 40's to the 70's, sociology was boring, excepting a few luminaries (Erving Goffman, first and foremost, Harold Garfinkel, Robert K. Merton, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Norbert Elias), it seemed to be going nowhere fast.  Anthropology during the same period was quite possibly the most exciting discipline around: Claude Levi-Strauss, Victor Turner, Clifford Geertz, Marvin Harris, Karl Polanyi, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, A. R. Radcliffe-Browne, Fredrik Barth, Sidney Mintz, Edmund Leach, and one of my heros, Marshall Sahlins, but also many, many others who were really pushing the envelope and engaging in big debates with each other.  Anthropology used to be both cooler and more relevant than sociology, but today I think it is neither.

During the 80's, something changed.  I think Sherry Ortner's ""[Theory in Anthropology since the Sixties](http://www.jstor.org/stable/178524)"" [[ungated PDF](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lundyj/New%20College%20Class/Readings/Sherry%20Ortner_Theory%20in%20Anthropology%20since%20the%20Sixities.pdf)] (1984) describes what happened between the 60's and the 80's pretty well (that is, reflections on anthropology's colonialist past and the grand entrance of Marxism--seriously though, if you're actually interested in socio-cultural anthropology and haven't read the article, please do).  Statistics probably had something else to do with it, as it made it harder for people to generalize based on single cases.  Today, socio-cultural anthropology seems to be content with either navel-gazing reflections on critical theory or remaining largely descriptive (often hoping for advocacy or just featuring beautiful pictures). One of the things is, because the very act of knowing is questioned, there are no big debates--you don't see the classic Marvin Harris vs. Marshall Sahlins debate that you used to.  Granted, I am outside of the field, but it's hard for me to point to a single major debate within socio-cultural anthropology--and the ones I'm vaguely aware of seem to be more psycho-philosophical (""What is the self?"") than empirical.  Shortly before he died, Geertz [said of](http://hypergeertz.jku.at/GeertzTexts/Interview_Micheelsen.htm) Talal Asad, ""I think he is a power-reductionist. He thinks that it is power that really matters and not belief. [...] I suspect Asad is a Marxist who cannot be material-reductionist anymore, so instead he is a power-reductionist.""

Similarly, Marshall Sahlins, commenting on the ""Foucauldian-Gramscian-Nietzschean obsession with power"" that he described as "" latest incarnation of Anthropology’s incurable functionalism"", said in his pamphlet *[Waiting for Foucault, Still](http://www.ugr.es/~aalvarez/observadorcultural/Documentos/Sahlins_2002.pdf)* (pdf) (I'm commenting particularly on the sections  ""Poetics of Culture, III"" [pg. 20-23] and ""Borrrrrring"" [pg. 73-74], but the whole thing is good).

&gt;“A hyper-inflation of significance” would be another way of describing the new functionalism, translating the apparently trivial into the fatefully political by a rhetoric that typically reads like a dictionary of trendy names and concepts, many of them French, a veritable La Ruse of postmodernism. Of course the effect, rather than amplifying the significance of [the empirical examples I discussed], is to trivialize such terms as “domination,” “resistance,” “colonization,” even “violence” and “power.” Deprived of real-political reference, these words become pure values, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing...but the speaker.

As someone who works on the Middle East, these kind of ""anti-Neo-Colonialist"" studies are mainly what I encounter.  Judging from seminars I've attended, there are other schools of thought, both ""activisty"" (""applied anthropology"") and another that's philosophical without getting into power (this type thinks a lot about the ""self"") (I'm bracketing Medical Anthropology here because I think there's actually a lot of cool, interesting work in the field).

There are many things I'm curious about: what happened to empiricism in socio-cultural anthropology?  If you remove critical theory and other bits of popular philosophy, what's left of the discipline?  Or, simply put, has socio-cultural anthropology jumped the shark--is there nothing to it besides a jumble of neo-Marxist philosophy + area studies?

Something about thinking about/rediscovering lost knowledge, I guess.  
  
Another example comes from my reading the fantasy series *The Malazan Book of the Fallen* (the author of which has training in anthropology and archaeology). There are long-lived characters in that series who have wandered and witnessed and who have knowledge of the entire span of history and pre-history.

I have experience in zoology and databases, too. My knowledge of realistic career paths in archaeology -- of anthropology in general -- is lacking. What are some of my options, aside from starting from scratch and pursuing a degree in anthropology? Are field technicians a thing, for instance?

No one seems to want to touch it. Perhaps there is some taboo to the logic there. 



I have long thought  that faith has a genetic component. It has arisen independently in almost every culture and I see good anthropological reasons for faith to be an advantage in regard to group bonding, protection of resources, division of labor, etc. Many primitive religions are combined with astronomy so planting times and harvest times could be determined. 



Here is where my question gets sticky. Speaking to avid several sports fans I have on several independent occasions heard them compare their own feelings of faith to their love of sports. These are simply anecdotal events. There is some archeological evidence to suggest some connection with faith and sports in the past, however. The Mayans incorporated sports into their own religious practices, for example. Even today ceremonial events occur within sporting events that might be interpreted as religious in nature. 



 When I discuss faith here I do not mean the Biblical definition, but rather, a predisposition of a culture or individuals within a culture to adopt a faith. Certainly, upbringing, psychology, group pressure and other factors not related to genetics play a major role in whether one acquires a faith.  



I know anthropology tends to paint genetics with rather wide brush strokes . Are there any studies that correlate faith with appreciation of sports? Or perhaps genes that have a positive correlation to faith?  If it has not yet been done it seems a simple enough study to do: Find the painted people who are screaming at a sporting event and ask ""What is your faith if any?"" :) Religious affiliation is not exactly what I am looking for but the data might prove interesting.

In my youth, for example, my hobby consisted of researching different religions, philosophies, and perspectives and finding the 'common threads' among them. I have always had a knack for finding the core message and underlying current behind things, and enjoy putting seemingly complex things into a reasonable explanation or theory.

I have been very dynamic in my specific interests, but what seems to remain constant is my desire to understand things and to compare them. Naturally, like almost all of the other humans I have been in contact with, I have many questions about my identity, origins, and perceived ""truths."" I have always questioned, and it has been to both my individual benefit and, at times, my regret. ;-)

My current interest is in prejudice and discrimination, the gap between individuals and the groups they identify with -- namely the current trend of LGBT advocacy taking place within the United States and 'Western culture' at late, as well as the resistance seen (namely Russia in the headlines currently). In this specific manner, I have found myself focused upon either sociology or psychology (specifically social psychology).

However, my fear is that I will limit myself too much by pursuing a degree in those disciplines, and that a change in interests will open me up the fact that I am a bit more confined than if I was in the field of anthropology.

Some concerns that I currently hold are the reliability and validity of the more qualitative approach such as ethnography in sociocultural anthropology that does not easily allow replicability of data.

I live in a religious area, so the idea around here seemed to have a mystic basis, for example, that your soul mate was chosen for you in heaven or that through reincarnation you may continually be connected with a specific person (such as the ""Constant"" in Lost.)

Was it ""invented"" by religion, government or Disney to promote families? Is there a biological advantage? Are there just certain types of ""souls"" that match perfectly? Is there any evidence that it could be a real phenomenon or that we are wired to think this way about mating? Is having a ""best friend"" throughout life the same thing? What causes someone to develop such a deep connection with another person?

Edit: I don't know exactly where I got the idea from, but it seems like I'm always subconsciously keeping an eye out for ""signs"" that someone might be my ""soul-mate."" It has finally occurred to me (probably because the idea seems kind of reinforced more where I currently live) that this isn't very healthy.

1) humanity's development and advancement of technology  
2) the changes that technological advancement has had on humanity's development itself over time

I have to explain myself or a second for this question to make real sense: 

Until the neolithic revolution, man had not really developed any sort of effective technology by which he could use to change the landscape around him. Up to that point, the biological evolution of man depended completely and utterly on the environment in which man found himself on his part of the planet. ""We"" started walking on our hind legs when we descended from the trees and gained more mobility, for example. And that environment in which that occurred and that evolutionary advancement was not impacted in any meaningful or unnatural way by people's activities or lifestyles--or technology. It just happened as a natural result of ""hominids"" (I'm not sure of the name) coping and adapting to their environment.

However, once humans developed practices for raising domestic livestock and growing crops, a completely different--sedentary--lifestyle developed. This lifestyle allowed for people to gather in greater density, communicate with one another, share ideas and over the millennia develop awesome technology that humans used to further mold the world around them.

Fast forward big time, and we now have bulldozers, modern medicine, refrigerators, electricity, laptops and the Internet. All of these things affect most of us in very direct ways, and they've certainly changed the way in which people affected the earth, coped with diseases, approached the task of eating food, while making us more sedentary.

So, what I want to know…should humanity's development of that technology over the past ~12,000 years and the trajectory that it has taken us since that time be considered the natural evolution of humans over time?

Because, once humans start to harness the power of technology to shape the environment--in turn considerably changing themselves in the process over time--then it seems like the law of evolution--which had affected us up until the dawn of civilization--no longer applies anymore.

In other words, no longer is natural selection/survival of the fittest in the physical environment/conditions in which we are located determining our lives and what we do, but…rather it's humans now…and human technology and modern social systems--constructions that are completely unnatural…if you're looking at the situation from a biological perspective--that are determining everything.

Let me be more specific, because I fear I'm combining evolutionary anthropology and biological evolution into one discussion...

There are a few biological evolutionary traits/things that have occurred since the Neolithic Revolution: tolerance to dairy products and humans' failing eyesight, for example. I know that the latter is a direct response to humans' more sedentary lifestyle, in which we no longer had to go out and use our keen eyesight to hunt game for survival. Slaughtering the chickens you raise no longer draws you to use that eyesight, so it has diminished over time. I imagine even more wild biological changes in the coming millennia as humans have become couch potatoes. 

Anyway, the question is this: should that biological evolutionary change be considered a natural evolutionary change as defined by Darwin? Because it was not ""nature"" that caused that change--but rather human technological advancement. In other words, the biological evolution of humans will never stop; we will always be changed over time by the conditions in which we live. However, we have come (or we already did come) to a point in which our evolutionary development is no longer natural--or evolution as described by Darwin--but rather a product of human technology. 

Does this sit well with anyone else? That we control--or strongly impact--our biological evolution over time and that, because that evolution is a product of human technology, it has ceased being a natural law but rather a human-created ""thing""??

1. How do you feel that the mass censorship of media affects the well-being of a society?

2. Do you feel that there are any historical examples in which mass censorship has benefited a society greatly?

3. Can censorship ever achieve its intended purpose of protecting a society or will it always do more harm than good?

4. Is there a specific type of government that you feel can use censorship most effectively to benefit their people?

5. The Vietnam war was one of the most documented and least censored wars in recent history, do you feel that the free flow of knowledge to the public during wartime as seen in Vietnam is overall beneficial, or do you think that modern wartime censorship is necessary to protect the people from reality?

6. In cases such as the ""samizdat"" in the USSR, the desire for knowledge despite restrictions resulted in the bypass of censorship methods imposed by the government.  Do you feel as though the human desire for knowledge will always overcome censorship?

7. In cases in which censorship of literature does not entirely preclude the works of literature from being read by the public, do you feel that censorship will fail due to the creation of alternative discourses that entrench the system of censorship?

8. Americans are often labeled as being unaware of global occurrences, and only absorbed in themselves; do you feel that this label can be attributed to media and government censorship restricting the public from accessing crucial information, or do you think that this is due to another cultural occurrence?",,False,,t5_2wl4u,False,,,True,t3_1cuivc,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1cuivc/questions_about_censorshipall_responses/,

Most human states have, throughout history, been based around consolidating power under a single individual, so I take this (perhaps wrongly?) to be something inherent in human social interaction.

Currently, the US is a major source of television and movies internationally, and through piracy the reach of American media is even greater. Have there been other ways in the past that ideas and values have spread through entertainment to the same level? I imagine that the silver screen was able to bridge language gaps better than other forms of entertainment; is this true? 

What have been some other non-violent ways that social knowledge has been spread across cultures (particularly outside Europe or between European countries and other regions) in recent history and the modern era?
