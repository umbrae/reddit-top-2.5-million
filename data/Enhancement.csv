As you all know, the Chrome and Opera web stores have both moved towards requiring addons be hosted there (or, in the case of Chrome, it's not ""required"", but it's a huge pain for non technical users if your addon isn't there)...

For that reason, I've moved towards getting RES on AMO (Firefox's addon librarY) as well.  It took nearly 2 months, but RES is finally there.  Tonight I'll make some tweaks so that you can get auto updated, but if you don't want to wait, you can search it out on AMO.  Please back up your settings first - I'm not sure how smoothly the transition will go.  It'd be great if any of you who download it could report back on that.

In other news: I know there've been bug reports even in the most recent versions, and I've not been hanging around here or /r/RESIssues much.  That's because I've been putting in 50, 60 and even 70 hour weeks at work to get some projects finished up.

To make matters even more delightful - I will no longer have a job to put 50, 60 and 70 hour weeks into in a few short weeks.  The company I work for will be closing its doors.

I'm not 100% sure what I want to do next, I'm still in a little bit of shock as the company I work for is essentially like a tight knit group of friends moreso than coworkers and the prospect of that being split up is really, really depressing.

So... if you're looking for a developer (as a hire, or as a freelancer for a project)... or if you've been meaning to [buy me a cup of coffee](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/contribute.html) but keep forgetting about it... well I'd love to hear from ya.  I live in Chicago and would prefer to stay here if at all possible - totally willing to do remote work for someone who's cool with it.

- Safari users unable to install - I'm working on it. I'm not sure what the problem is but I've got an email in to a contact at Apple.

- Opera users seeing misaligned gear icon - sorry, I'm working on a fix!

- Firefox users unable to save links - figured it out, will be fixed in next release

- All users: Macros not going to the right textarea -- working on a fix also for the next 24-48 hours.

**EDIT FOR THE SUPER ANTSY:** A hotfix that fixes all of the above bugs (Except unable to install on Safari) has been uploaded. No version number change but a new release w/version number change will still come soon.  If you just can't wait for that functionality back - go re-download the extension from the website.

1328218287.0,503,self.Enhancement,p89k9,[Announcement] RES for Firefox users having CPU / memory issues - please read...,544,41,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/p89k9/announcement_res_for_firefox_users_having_cpu/,"Hi all... I was up late last night. Very late.  I've made some ""progress"", but the results are not currently promising.

First, I'd just like to clear something up: I get the impression that some of you think I ""don't care"" about the problems you're having because they don't affect everyone.  Please rest assured I care a great deal.  It pains me to see people saying they've uninstalled RES because it got slow, etc.  You're not paying me for the software, so just about the only joy I get out of it is seeing people say ""I like it!"" -- I HATE seeing people unhappy with it.

Thing is, I'm a human being.  I work a really challenging job that consumes 45-65 hours of my week depending on what's going on.  Beyond that, I come home to a lovely SO who deserves my attention, and 2 fuzzy critters who don't get nearly enough of it.  RES is something I have to find/make time for, so I simply can't turn around solutions as fast as a software development company does when they release an app with a problem.

That being said - the discouraging part of this all is that it seems to not be RES's fault.  I wish it *was*!  I wish I could tell you ""oops, I goofed and wrote this really crappy piece of code that I can just fix and all will be happy.""  I may come back and find out that I'm incorrect and it IS a piece of my code - but so far I don't believe it is.  I've disabled just about everything that makes a native extension ""different"" from a Greasemonkey script, and the performance issues remain.

Unfortunately, it looks like it may be an issue with the Addon SDK for Firefox.  I am doing my best to work with them toward finding out if it's definitely caused by the addon SDK, but I can say for sure that the same code in Greasemonkey runs much faster for those who are suffering from slowdowns.

**One thing I do want to apologize for:** It seems my decision to move off of Greasemonkey, while I had good reasons, may have been premature.  It just made more sense to me to have a native extension rather than relying on a 3rd party plugin.  Especially as Firefox upped its dev cycle to such rapid releases, and the Greasemonkey team had to work so hard to play catchup that it often caused problems for RES users.  That, combined with the ability for native extensions to auto update, made me think it made sense to move to a native Firefox addon.

I still want to keep things in that path.  I think it's the better way to go for the long term future.  Assuming the problem is not RES's fault, I can't imagine the Firefox team allowing their Addon SDK to have such performance disadvantages.  I'm sure this will get resolved.

I want to spend some time working with the Jetpack team to figure this out before suggesting everyone migrate back to Greasemonkey.  I just wanted to let you all know that I am actively pursuing the issue and that it's not being ignored.

**TL;DR:** I am working on it. I see people are having performance issues and it's not being ignored.

I talked to the Reddit admins today to confirm my hunches about why some of you are having issues with Never Ending Reddit (and, in truth, Reddit itself - but you don't realize that!) ... Here's my best attempt at ELI5ing it...

First and foremost: If you do not believe my explanation below, turn Never Ending Reddit off and keep browsing as normal.  You will eventually see a page that says ""there doesn't seem to be anything here"" in red text.  This is what makes Never Ending Reddit say ""reddit barfed""...

1) You can subscribe to as many subreddits as you want, but if you subscribe to more than 50 (or 100 for gold members), your frontpage is only ever composed of 50 at a time, which are randomly selected.  These selections stay ""static"" for approximately 30 minutes -- then a new random selection is chosen.  **This is key to understanding what's going on**...

2) In addition, there's really no such thing as ""pages"" on Reddit.  Instead, you're saying ""give me the links (from my current 50 subreddits at this time) #1 to #[page size] as ranked by voting right now *at this exact moment*""...  When you go to the next page, you're saying ""give me links #[page size] to #[page size*2] *at this exact moment*""...  This is why you may see duplicate links from page to page!  A link that was #23 a minute ago may be #26 now because of people voting things up and down...

So, why does Reddit ""barf""?

There's 2 potential reasons:

1) Let's say you're currently on ""page 6"", and you've been checking out links for 20-30 minutes and having a grand old time...  You try to load page 7 and it barfs... why?  Because - Reddit's random selection of 50 reddits to show you has changed!  ""Show me the next page"" no longer has meaning, so Reddit barfs!

2) Alternatively, let's say you haven't let that much time expire, but you're on a page way down there... page 8 or so...  You're far enough down now that everything has somewhat lower vote totals, so anything getting 2-3 up/downvotes has a bit more ""weight"" to it...  When you ask for the ""next"" page, the URL actually contains a parameter that says ""give me the next page of posts after post ABCDE""...  It's possible that post ABCDE and/or the posts around it have moved so much that Reddit barfs here too.

Reason #1 is something I actually confirmed with the Reddit admins tonight...

Reason #2 is a hunch I've developed anecdotally based on my experiences....

The upshot: RES is going to offer a ""friendlier and more informative"" message for you when you get this error, as well as an easier means of starting over from the top.

No goofy stuff you see today is related to RES, because RES doesn't have any April Fools' jokes in it.

I thought about joking that I was going to cease development on RES, but that wouldn't be funny because it's something I ponder occasionally for real when things get stressful and this subreddit is overrun with repeat questions from 30 minutes ago, or I'm just tired of getting yelled at.

I thought about joking that RES was bought by Zynga and was being turned into a ""Collect the different upvote monsters"" game, but that's almost ridiculous enough to be true.

I thought about joking that RES was becoming a paid only product, but Reddit's so freaking over the top nutso with its damn witch hunts that I figured my place of residence would probably be blown up before all the angry psychos came to their senses and realized I was kidding around...

However:

Paypal takes a minimum fee of $0.32USD out of my account for any donation.  This means that for the 3 of you who recently donated less than that: PayPal took **every penny of it**.

I just went and issued a refund to one of you, and it turns out, that COST ME the $0.10 you donated me! I thought I'd get the paypal fee of $0.10 back that they charged me, but I didn't... so I just paid you $0.10, and PayPal kept your $0.10.  I'm serious.

I appreciate that anyone would donate anything at all to RES, but you may as well understand that paypal takes:

- $0.30 / transaction **PLUS**
- 2.9% of the total of the transaction

meaning, if you donate $1 USD to me, I get

-  $1.00
- -$0.30
- -$0.03 (2.9% rounds up)
- = $0.67

If you donate $0.30 to me, I get $0. Paypal simply takes your $0.30.  I'm not even kidding.  This is just how it works.

I'm happy to work with anyone on making RES better, and ensuring it causes as few conflicts as possible.

However, some moderators are trying to hide/remove RES functionality on their subreddits.  Most often, they're finding hacky ways to hide RES's ""use subreddit stylesheet"" checkbox.

Look: I know you spent a lot of time styling your subreddit - but the bottom line is you're never going to make something that 100% of people like.  Reddit provides functionality to disable *all* subreddit stylesheets anyway - so there are just going to be people who don't see your special CSS no matter what.

By hiding this RES functionality, you are doing your readers a disservice. If they prefer to browse your subreddit (but not all others, necessarily) without the stylesheet, then so be it.  Hiding RES functionality like that is not cool.

Each hack you implement that gets reported to me, I will look for ways to combat.

If it comes down to me having to randomly generate different IDs and class names to make it nearly impossible for you to hide this functionality then so be it. I will do that.  Please don't make me resort to stupid stuff like that?  Pretty please?

- solidwhetstone -- for helping make RES far, far prettier and in many cases easier to use... pushing me to do harder work than I initially wanted to dedicate the time to because it was worth it to make things better.

- gavin19, tico24, s_quark -- for busting their ASSES lately to help with the massive flood of bug reports and support requests... these guys KICK ASS.  

- honorable mention to blind__man as well, who has jumped in and helped lots of people out... thanks!

- Thanks to all of you who have filed detailed bug reports, explaining ways I can replicate the issues and hopefully fix them...  I realize it's frustrating when something doesn't work right, and I appreciate that you're taking the time to help me help serve you better...  I'm not going to lie, I've felt a little overwhelmed lately since RES 4.0 has such a massively grown userbase and so this subreddit has exploded in terms of activity...  It's physically stressful for me to browse this subreddit now... but those of you providing detailed bug reports that make it easy to replicate and fix the bugs are kicking ass... it REALLY helps.. so thanks!

- Thanks so much to those of you who have donated...  While it certainly isn't life changing money, the nice influx of donations is going to help me cover server costs (holy crap, you guys download lots of copies of RES! It's costin' me some cash!)... It also means I can buy solidwhetstone some more steak.

Now, a quick and dirty rant for a few bad eggs:

Please, please understand that while most software you use was made by a *company*, this software is made almost exclusively by *one human being* (with some serious design horsepower / help from *one more human being*)...

Companies usually make software to make money... getting mad at them when they've separated you from your cash is understandable...

RES is free, and while I realize a lot of people have become attached to it, it seems a *lot* of people have lost sight of the fact that they've paid a grand total of $0 for literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of both programming and tech support / bug squashing through monitoring this subreddit.

I've lost my cool with some of these people, and I'm not proud of that.  In fact, I've beat myself up over it a little bit now and then.

However, in retrospect, I've come back down to earth on something:

I have put literally hundreds of hours into developing and supporting RES for free.  I don't owe anyone anything, especially if the first time they ask me for help, it's worded rudely / insultingly and/or is laced with profanity.

If you're not seeing what I'm talking about, that's mostly because the community has been pretty good about downvoting that stuff to oblivion.  Thing is, in order to keep up on requests, I pretty much only view the /new of this subreddit - so I see it regardless of vote totals... and yes, I let it bother me when in fact I should probably just ignore it.

Long story short: I'm done beating myself up over getting annoyed with people who start off our ""relationship"" by being assholes about it.  I've done very well in my personal life by being polite and respectful to everyone I encounter until they give me a reason not to.  In my mind, the internet should work the same way.

YSK that if you're not paying someone, then they are not only under no obligation but also will have no motivation to be polite to you even though you've started things off by being rude to them.

If I'm just blind and missed a recent one, just let me know :)


Basically, I browse Reddit by having my most viewed subreddits on my shortcut bar and individually browsing them. One thing that slightly annoyed me when doing this was when I'd come upon a smaller subreddit, I'd just want to go straight to ""new."" I recently accidentally found that it's possible to do if you double click on the shortcut to make the ""edit shortcut"" window pop up, then in the ""subreddit"" box, simply place ""/new"" after the subreddit name and it will direct you to the ""new"" section every time you click it! I assume that it simply checks what is in the subreddit box and fills it in after ""/r/"" in the URL, so you could do a decent amount with it, depending on your browsing style. I only use it to go to ""new,"" but someone who browses a subreddit purely for a certain type of thread could put something like ""AskReddit/search?q=cars&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on"" if they, for some reason, would want to view/possibly answer recent questions about vehicles.


This was probably way obvious to a lot of people, but I, nor my RES using friends knew about it, so I imagine there are at least a few other people who would benefit from knowing this, as well as some other features that may even be more helpful. Thanks in advance if you share a tip!

This keeps coming up, so I'm hoping a big green post might change that... we'll see...

If you're running any ""ahead of the curve"" browser (alpha, beta, etc), please understand the following:

- It's not a ""bug"" in RES if RES doesn't work in one of these builds.  RES isn't tested with these builds.  It might be a bug in Firefox, or a bug in Greasemonkey, but it's not a bug in RES.  If the only thing that changed between RES working and not working was your browser version - *that is the reason*...

- ""stable"" only means ""probably won't crash"", it doesn't mean ""won't break features"" - I wish browser makers were a bit more clear about this, because I think they give users a false sense of security.

- RES already has to support 4 ""production"" browser versions.  Support for alpha/beta/nightly builds is something that can't happen, because they come out faster than I could ever release updates to RES.

- The biggest problem-causer is Firefox, because Greasemonkey (not even RES!) keeps getting broken by its latest updates.  If you're running Firefox, I beg of you: please don't run a beta unless you really really need to.

I'm fine with people sharing their experiences and trying to help each other getting RES to work.

What I'm not fine with is everything being posted and/or emailed to me as ""bug"" reports... and the angry ""I upgraded Firefox and RES doesn't work anymore, you suck!"" emails I'm getting are completely and utterly unacceptable...  

I'm kind of sick of people treating me like I make my living off of RES.  I make maybe $50-60/month from RES if I average out my donations over time - but I probably put in 50-60 hours of work per month working on it, reading these forums, supporting people, etc...

Yes, I'm posting this out of frustration - but I'm also posting it to inform people.  Browser makers are frustrating me right now by being a bit unclear to users on just what ""stable"" really means - and that's their fault as much as anyone else's.

- /u/gavin19 - has contributed various fixes to night mode as well as other random bug fixes, and has busted his butt off replying and providing tech support...

- /u/Signe - has contributed a number of minor but useful tweaks, including adding RANDNSFW and MODQUEUE link options in the subreddit manager, and (before most of you saw it) moving the gallery controls to the top for easier use.

- /u/solidwhetstone - I can always count on Dan to provide a fresh eye on the way certain parts of RES look and/or function, so I bounce a large chunk of new RES features/interface bits off of him and get his feedback... Icons being slightly misaligned is the sort of thing that I may miss, but Dan will catch... so you can thank him for that.

- /u/s_quark - also running around replying to tons of support requests like a boss...

- /u/tico24 - has also busted his butt providing tech support and is even working on some bigger and better things that I will leave to him to disclose, but I think it will improve the entire RES development process.

- /u/umbrae - contributed the new Comment Hide Persistor module that keeps comments hidden when you collapse them, leave the page and come back...

Upon the release of the latest update for Firefox, I've received some complaints (some polite, some not at all polite) about the ever-hated FOUC -- ""flash of unstyled content"" -- that moment where the page is white before night mode kicks in and makes it dark again.

I'd like to take a moment to give you an update.  For those who don't give a bleep[s?] about the details, the **TL;DR:** is ""I have a fix coming""

Here's the longer version with some FAQs thrown in...

**Q: Why did RES start doing this in the latest Firefox update?**

Truth is, it did and it didn't.  The FOUC is a matter of ""racing to get in the style before you see any of the page"", and every computer is doing things at slightly different speeds, etc - so for some people and on some OSes (e.g. on my crazy fast work machine with OSX it's much less pronounced / often), the FOUC is either nonexistent or not noticeable.

That it ever worked without a flash of white first was frankly a borderline miracle.

So what changed?  Well, Firefox's addon SDK changed - for the better!  However, when code changes, so does the number of things being done and thus the time it takes to execute.

**Q: Great, mumbo jumbo what did you say? How are you going to fix it?**

Well, that's a fun one to answer.  I've spent most of the past 24 hours investigating and working on a fix.  I was up until 5:30am, as a matter of fact, working with a member of the Addon SDK team to get some questions answered.

The solution for Firefox is actually pretty crazy, because in my efforts to find a fix, I discovered a bug in Firefox that seemingly dashed all of my hopes/plans.  It's already patched, but the patch won't make it in until August - so I thought I was dead in the water and unable to fix this for you guys...

Thankfully, this member of the addon SDK team found a way around the bug for me -- and NOT a simple one or anything I'd have ever thought of on my own.

Huge, huge thanks / beers / cupcakes / bacon are deserved by the guy who helped me (who I won't name because I don't know if he wants me to do that).

**Q: What about users of Chrome, Opera and Safari?**

Well, Chrome and probably Safari users are going to see this same benefit.  I'm not sure about Opera yet.  It's going to take a fair amount more research because they don't have a way of loading CSS before the page exists.

You've all done a great job at being patient and providing us with detailed bug reports. As with anything with lots of moving parts, the more things you have- the more things can get wonky. So again- thanks to everyone for being patient!

Help us spread the word about RES 4! There are still a lot of redditors that have never heard of it. Anything you can do to get the word out is awesome.

We have a lot more really awesome stuff in store for you in the next big release (Our list is already 47 items long- and only 2 of them are bugs!)

(TL;DR it's coming),220,26,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/wv3ld/announcement_where_the_hell_is_the_next_version/,"There are some bugs that remain in RES 4.1.2 that I'm not happy about leaving unpatched... big, obvious things like flickr expandos not working, etc...

I know it's been a long time since the last release, so I just wanted to give an update on why that is.  There's good reasons and bad.

Good reasons:

The awesome /u/tico24 has put together a not-so-secret cadre of bug assassins to help beta test RES more formally before new releases.  This takes time, testing, re-testing, re-re-testing, etc...

I'm under no delusions: the next RES likely won't be bug free... but it should be significantly better.

Bad reasons:

I'm working 9.5-10 and sometimes 12 hour days because the economy has made things a struggle for the (very small) company I work for and I'm busting my ass to try and do everything in my power to keep us from going under.  I'm also doing work completely outside of my job description -- I'm normally the director of our technology team and I handle a lot of client relationships, but now I'm writing code ~8 hours a day to help get things back on track.

So, when I come home from 8 hours of banging away at code, 2 hours of dealing with clients, and often 1 more hour of getting yelled at... well... pushing out the next release of RES isn't exactly a task I feel like tackling the moment I walk in the door.  I'm pretty mentally taxed.

Beyond that, Chrome and Opera have also complicated the near future for RES.  Opera will soon ONLY allow extensions that are submitted to their gallery.  Chrome has made it cumbersome enough to install self-hosted extensions that we're already getting loads of ""bug reports"" and PMs that RES won't install from people running beta builds of Chrome that have already adopted this new security feature of making it a PITA.  They're even linking me to the page that tells them how to install it despite these restrictions but not reading that part, I guess :-\

This means that 2 of the 4 browsers are essentially forcing me to stop self-hosting RES, so I might as well submit it to all the addon galleries.

However: this means I have to figure out how to smoothly transition you all from a self-hosted extension to one hosted on its respective gallery during each browser's auto update process -- which is of course handled differently and may or may not play nicely.

The downside of hosting RES on the various galleries (web store, AMO, etc) is mostly that there's an approval process for all 4 of them and they vary greatly from each other in how long that takes.  Users of one browser may get RES 24 hours after I send a build.  Users of another browser may wait 2-3 weeks.  This is something I've ardently tried to avoid.


So, I've got a lot to worry/think about and I've not had the couple/few solid evenings I need to work this all out and push the newest RES (which is very close to ready).

To top all that off, I'm sure I'm unpleasant to those few people around me in my life as a result of this absurd level of stress and that keeps me up at night.. literally... which is why I'm posting this note to you all at 2:30am instead of sleeping.

**TL;DR** I'm working a metric butt-ton of hours and I'm exhausted when I come home so RES hasn't been coming along as fast as I'm sure many of you would like. However, the latest release will come out relatively soon and it'll bring with it a host of bug fixes and a few new snazzy features.

Last week shit hit the fan and my bank account froze due to some troubles with the lawyer debt I had accrued from my divorce. It's still frozen- but [you guys helped me out in a big way](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/v4qub/hey_guys_its_your_ol_buddy_solidwhetstone_my/) by being the primary folks that helped me raise enough money to pay my rent and child support. Both of those have been paid now and I can breathe.

Today I was reminded of [this screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0YZ7qZvI8E) that explained how to use the dashboard. We really need more videos that explain every feature of RES and how to use it. So as a thank you for helping me get on my feet, I'm going to be investing my time into getting RES the support it needs so new users (and even experienced users) can get the most enjoyment out of using RES. It's been a long time coming, that's for sure.

One other thing I wanted to emphasize before I go: In the grand scheme of RES, while the work I have done has been quite visible- the sheer number of hours hb has put into RES dwarfs the amount of time I've worked on it. I fear I may have given the wrong impression when I asked for help last week- that RES was in any way in jeopardy because of my financial issues- and that wasn't at all the case. My involvement in the update process typically only amounts to a few hours as we near a point release- some time devoted to new or improved icons/colors or just testing. While I do check /r/enhancement most days, I don't work on RES every day- so please accept my apology if I painted a picture where RES would be in some sort of jeopardy without my involvement. I didn't make RES. I haven't programmed a single line of code to the application itself (I only wrote the html/css for www.redditenhancementsuite.com). I have only done design work and support. HB is the guy that deserves the credit for making RES awesome. I just wanted to make sure we were clear on that.

So thanks again and keep being awesome RES community. And from the bottom of my heart- thank you.

Well, I don't know how else to get the word out to those I'm unaware of short of posting here - and this sub has gained a few thousand visitors since that post, so I'm posting again in the hopes that this post garners more attention.

Just recently, another discussion about this was started [here, in a thread that's downvoted into the negatives so maybe you guys haven't seen it](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/o7ruk/bug_rapple_requests_keynavannotation_resshortcuts/)

The bottom line:

If there are features of RES that you feel conflict with your subreddit's stylesheet - please contact me! I'm happy to work with you to try and make RES more subreddit-style-friendly...

What I am not cool with is subreddits trying to *disable* parts of RES through stylesheet trickery.  Ultimately, I strongly believe in supporting the users of my software. They installed it because they presumably *want* that functionality... My stance is that it's their browser, and they should get to do what they want with it.

I want to work with Reddit to allow RES to mesh nicely with subreddit stylesheets -- there's some damn nice stuff being done in a number of subreddits and if I can structure RES's html differently, etc to make it easier for you to style how it looks in your neck of the woods - I'm all for it...  please let me know what changes would help, and I'm happy to assist.",,False,,t5_2s10b,True,,resauthor,True,t3_o932l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/o932l/announcement_trying_again_attention_subreddit/,moderator

**Tech info:**

It seems this would be minor, and could be backwards compatible since it's just adding to a JSON structure.  (upvotes-downvotes) is currently stored as ""votes"", so storing one more variable would be enough.  Some structures in PseudoJSON for ""Username"" with [5|2]:

    ""Username"":{""votes"":3}  // current structure

    ""Username"":{""votes"":3,""downvotes"":2}  // new structure ""A""
    // upvotes = votes+downvotes

    ""Username"":{""votes"":3,""upvotes"":5}  // new structure ""B""
    // downvotes = upvotes-votes

    ""Username"":{""votes"":3,""totalvotes"":7}  // new structure ""C"", suggested previously
    // downvotes = (totalvotes-votes)/2
    // upvotes = totalvotes-downvotes

    ""Username"":{""upvotes"":5,""downvotes"":2}  // new structure ""D"", 
    // not backwards compatible, but the simplest

- A number of fixes to night mode (thanks gavin19!)
- Changed how Never Ending Reddit remembers pages to get around a Chrome bug that was breaking scrolling and find in page searches that caused scrolls...
- Fixed inconsistency on subreddit tagger, especially on subsequent never ending reddit pages
- Fixed an opera specific bug in subreddit tagger that was placing ""undefined"" in link titles
- Chrome no longer marks images as visited when in incognito mode
- Fixed 404 issues with dashboard on mail and user widgets when default sort was changed.
- Now allowing sorting by new/hot/top/controversial on user widgets
- Fixed an issue with account switcher menu alignment when pinUserBar was set
- Fixed a bug with dashboard on sorting widgets that had multireddits causing data to be corrupted...
- Fixed a bug with how live preview renders h3 tags (i.e. ###text)
- Fixed a bug with commandline console and sorting from users' profile pages
- Fixed a bug with trying to get info of a logged in user when not logged in (reddit's HTML change broke this)
- Fixed an issue where toggled userbars in some browsers grew by a couple of pixels (thanks gavin19)
- Fixed a filteReddit bug with domains / keyword radio buttons

Ok, so I'm aware of the vote fuzzing. Firstly just so I'm clear, [the number of points shown on reddit is the real number, and the (up/down) shown by res is the fake/fuzzed totals, right?](http://i.imgur.com/l4aTw.png) Or is it the other way around? Because from the looks of it compared to what I've read, I can't figure it out at all.

The fuzzing is in effect and the same for posts *and* comments as well, yes?

Was there some change in the fuzzing algorithm somewhat recently or something? Because it used to at least look sensible, but it seems in the past few months everything's gone out the window and I don't even understand what I'm looking at. 



From most of what I've read about the fuzzing, it sounds like what happens is that fake votes are *added* to those fuzzed numbers to obscure what's really going on. 

Even with all that, I could always look the points on a post or comment, and see at least *some* correlation between that and the up/down numbers on the right. Now everything seems wildly all over the place.

Lately, I keep seeing [things like these](http://i.imgur.com/DhQ8p.png) all the time, and I can't make out what the hell is happening there.

How is there more points than even the total up *plus* down? Is it fuzzing by showing *less* votes than have actually been issued? What gives?

To elaborate on that a bit... Reddit Enhancement Suite started when I responded to a few people's posts on [/r/SomebodyMakeThis](/r/SomebodyMakeThis) - they wanted little tweaks made to Reddit via Greasemonkey...

I put a few of them together and thought ""man it'd be cool if I could have a settings panel to turn these on and off, configure them, etc"", and the first edition of RES was born.

After I started getting a few emails and whatnot asking me questions, I created [/r/Enhancement](/r/Enhancement) as a place where people could ask for support...

For months, this subreddit never grew past maybe 50-100 subscribers.

Now, it's gaining 100+ subscribers a day, and has burst past 15,000!  WOW!

I know I will leave someone out and feel like a big jerkface... but just a few people who have done a lot to help out here...

/u/gavin19 /u/tico24 /u/s_quark /u/blind__man and /u/Jonatar have spent TONS of time helping people solve problems.  Jonatar, in fact, has gone to insane pains to figure out why a certain (small) subset of people are having CPU/RAM issues with RES in Firefox.

/u/solidwhetstone - without whom I of course couldn't have made many of the design/visual improvements I've made to RES.

There are others who I'm sure I've left out... I'll add them as I think of them... feel free to backhand slap me if I've left you out! I'm tired and just excited to see that bigass number 15,000 there...

 * Stacked on top of each other, there're very noticeable performance hits, which make for a bad first impression, imo.

Given all the above, I believe a better introductory experience could be had by having less features enabled by default. Features could be introduced slowly with a ""Tips and Tricks"" dialog and enabled with user input.

/r/Enhancement is clearly growing by leaps and bounds - which has been both good and... well... difficult.  Because of that, I need your input...

**Challenge:**

Anyone who reads this subreddit with any regularity can see that, especially in the last 2 months, the number of repeat questions, bug reports and posts here has grown by leaps and bounds.

Although it frustrates me to read the same repeat questions over and over again - I'm mostly concerned that it is devaluing the idea of being subscribed to this subreddit.  Do you really want to subscribe here if most of what you get is repeat questions from people who can't figure out which browser they're using?

I had posed the idea before of having a RES bugs subreddit, where posts should be directed... What surprised me was that most of you seemed to *hate* this idea...  Some for more pragmatic reasons (like ""nobody'll post there anyway""), but others because you somehow felt it was ""censorship"" or ""too many rules""...

so my question is:  What should I do?  How can I keep this subreddit valuable to use as users?

I certainly would like to spend more time posting cool tips and tricks and highlight things about RES that you may be unaware of, and I promise to try and dedicate some more time to that... but I still don't see that lowering the signal to noise ratio a whole lot...

What do you all think should be done, if anything?  Or do you just enjoy or not mind the silly / repetitive questions and bug reports?  Is the current state of things just fine with you?

Right now, due to RES's domain name matching, it doesn't run properly on ""np"" links when they've been linked via www.np.reddit.com -- This is both good and bad.

The good: Subreddits who've set this up don't want people from external reddits ""vote brigading"", so they've turned off voting for links with np.reddit.com in the domain name via a CSS hack.

The bad: Right now, RES does nothing on these pages.  If I bring back RES on these pages, there's a lot of useful, non-vote-brigading functionality that people are currently missing out on that they can get back.  However, it'd also bring back the ability to disable the stylesheet -- or would it?  That's really up to me.

99.9% of the time, I'm against taking choice away from the user of the browser.  This is why I've fought tooth and nail to keep that ""use subreddit style"" checkbox visible despite subreddit mods efforts to the contrary.

In this case, I may be willing to make an exception, and even hide it myself - because this experiment in protecting your community from ""meta links"" pretty much requires my cooperation.

FF8.0

RES 4.0.2

Win7 Pro x64

All addons enabled.

The primary cause seems to be how well (or badly) certain modules deal with delayed responses ( ~~or possibly delayed submissions or a combination of both - I haven't figured out an easy way yet to determine which leg(s) of the round trip are the most frequent cause of the delay~~ **the delay is 99%+ due solely to waiting for a response from Reddit - the vast majority (again, 99%+) of send/receives themselves are ""0 milliseconds"". The few that are greater than 0 are still less than 10ms.**). Hide-related functions in particular are pretty bad. Hides are submitted and accepted (unless the gateway is actually not responsive for whatever reason) but some may take 20 seconds or more to get a response.

The FF lags/CPU jumps and memory increases appear to roughly correspond with the delays while waiting for responses, especially when there's multiple submissions to the api while waiting for previous submissions - they ""batch up"" and eat RAM until they too are finally processed.

Live Preview/editing comments seems to be hit by the same problem on its own, with the issue unsurprisingly worsened if you're trying to comment/edit in one tab while wait-for delays are happening in a separate tab.

I've played with multiple enable/disable addon scenarios, none of which seem to affect this behavior in terms of whether it appears or not - some of them *worsen* it even further for ""simpler"" reasons, but ultimately the behavior is observable when RES is the only active addon.

Why it happens primarily with FF (with a smattering of other browsers/OSes reporting the same issue) is still a matter of speculation - the primary reason I can think of is that some of RES' function(s) while awaiting responses is stressing the FF javascript interpreter. The fix may be something as simple as relaxing how frequently some of the functions submit and/or check for responses.

**edit: Just discovered Firebug's Network Monitoring feature - will update if that shows anything significant.**

**edit 2: Firebug's monitor shows where the delay is - updating main post.** 

**edit3 tl;dr: 9 hours later. To be clear, at this time I don't think RES itself is causing the problem. It seems to be down to how well browsers (and their javascript interpreters) handle the unusually long delays Reddit has in responding to some of its API calls. Technically-inclined users who want to help sanity-check this should check Reddit's responsiveness during the times your browser starts acting sluggish/eating RAM.**

**edit4: Next day, 9:06 AM EST (right around when Reddit first starts getting slammed). New profile in use, only RES installed. Issues are still occurring, eliminating any possibility of addons and FF customizations being involved. Will now install Firebug and continue from there. I'm going to try to make a tutorial for what I am doing in the hopes that technically-proficient non-programmers may find them useful when trying to help the RES team debug issues they can't reproduce themselves**

**Day 3: With the great assistance of GameFreak4321, the patterns are becoming clearer:  
1.  RES is disk-intensive even when everything is working well. Tests seem to show upwards of 50% of ALL system file activity can be triggered by FF/RES's relatively minor direct disk activity. That can translate into a lot of system CPU time being consumed by drive activity alone. Make sure your hard drive(s), whether RAIDed or not, have write-caching and NCQ enabled.  Consider replacing or not using drives that don't have those options available - they're probably too old to be used for anything but occasional large file saving/backups anyway.  
2.  ~~The FF Flash plugin is a big culprit in file activity. It may help to disable RES' videoTimes option in betterReddit, since that is likely what is invoking the plugin so frequently. The overhead of running the plugin itself may also be contributing to CPU/memory consumption.~~  There's a lot of Flash activity. This could be because of the plugin itself, or from other plugins interference (Flashblock/BetterPrivacy). It's highly unlikely to be caused by RES' actions, but is worth being aware of as a possible contributing factor to CPU overloading.  
3.  It seems that RES' handling of links downloaded in the frontpage causes FF to treat them as if they have been ""visited"" immediately, even if you haven't actually gone to them yet. They are placed in the database FF uses for browser history storage. There are a lot of file locks and unlocks placed on that database, but it seems that they get out of sync, with more locks attempted than unlocks attempted. It's possible that these buildups of unprocessed functions are due to having to wait for loops to sync locks/unlocks. The waiting for unlocks and subsequent bursts of processing, combined with the regular disk activity, are what seem to be causing the CPU overloads. NER may be aggravating this condition on certain systems, but it seems to happen with or without NER enabled.  
Investigations continue**

You'll notice I've never been in your face about soliciting donations.  It's not plastered all over the console or prominent on the website, so I hope you'll all forgive this one post.

If you don't think RES is worth contributing a buck or two for, this post is not for you.  Carry on using it for free. RES hasn't gone ""pay only"" :-)

###So, for those of you who've asked: 

I have recently added Dwolla to the [contribute page](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/contribute.html) but will also be adding it in the about dialog in RES.

[Dwolla](http://dwolla.com) is a micropayment system that doesn't charge fees for transactions under $10, and doesn't charge as much as PayPal or Google for bigger transactions, either.

###Why Dwolla?

If you send $1 through PayPal or Google, I get about $0.67 after fees. If you send me $1 through Dwolla, I get $1!

The ""catch"" is that Dwolla doesn't do credit card transactions so it gets funded a little differently.  This is how they save on processing fees, though - they're not paying processing fees on tiny transactions.

Whether you contribute $1 or $1,000 (hey, I can dream can't I?), it's greatly appreciated.  If you contribute $0, I still love you!",,False,,t5_2s10b,False,,resauthor,True,t3_pf9z8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/pf9z8/announcement_by_popular_request_dwolla_is_the/,moderator

Known issues, etc.",116,17,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/1k1z63/sticky_please_read_before_posting_known_issues_etc/,"Here are some important issues we're already well aware of with RES. Some browser specific ones are also below, so please read both the **general** section and the section for your specific browser!

**General**: 

- Night mode users: RES now disables subreddit stylesheets by default unless either a) you check the ""use subreddit style"" box for that sub, or b) the subreddit puts some code in their sidebar to indicate that their stylesheet is ""night mode compatible"" - this is to avoid clashes between the stylesheets.  A side effect of this is that you will miss out on some CSS-driven stuff like custom image flair - but that's easily fixed by either you or the subreddit mods!

- We're aware of a couple of CSS glitches with image or video expandos on user profile pages, etc. A patch is forthcoming!

- There's a bug with the new ""Parent hover"" plugin where it's not obeying your settings for fadeDelay and hoverDelay - a patch for this is coming also. Apologies for the frustration on this one, I know a number of you hate the delay (which was added because many of you hated that it popped up instantly and often accidentally!)

- Moderators: Please be sure to [read our new article on subreddit styling](http://reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/subredditstyling) and night mode if you want your subreddit to be considered ""night mode compatible"" by RES. 

- In completely unrelated news, my car was vandalized, broken into and my car stereo stolen the other day. That sucked. I'm going to vent about it here. MAN, THAT PISSES ME OFF. HOW RUDE!  There. I feel better now.

**Chrome users**: Yes, RES was disabled automatically by the latest update. Please [read this post about the permissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/1jskcm/announcement_chrome_users_did_your_res_turn_off/) for an explanation of why.  Visit chrome://extensions to re-enable RES.

**Firefox users**: RES 4.3.* is submitted to AMO and is waiting for approval. I'm really sorry that those of you who've been upgraded to Firefox 23 are without RES right now, but there's not much I can do.  Please **do not post direct links to the unapproved version** as it can cause us tech support headaches and can cause you potential problems as well.

**Opera users**: RES has been approved for Opera 12 and 15, but it's pretty broken in Opera 12.  Unfortunately, I'm struggling mightily to fix it.  If any aspiring javascript wizards are interested in helping out, please do let me know.  It's some deeper stuff that's not simple to fix, and I've spent more time than I can afford trying to fix it.

**Safari users**: A few of you have reported you're continually getting the ""what's new"" page every time you load a reddit page.  I still have no idea why this is, and unfortunately no developer or otherwise tech-inclined (e.g. great at debugging stuff) person has been able to replicate it.

Now obviously there's a lot of  attractive gay guys that post there, and also happen to post in one of the many gonewild subs. People definitly go through each other's histories looking for past gone* posts. As it turns out, reddit's interface for going through a post history sucks. So we set out to solve that. 

The solution we authored is a javascript bookmarklet that calls via ajax to a database that is updated by Cron of Mild/Wild/Intro posts in a list of about 20 subs. Obviously we respect deleted posts etc and don't return those in search results, but when run on a reddit page, it places an icon of the appropriate type (Mild, Wild, Intro) next to a users name, which links to an index of their posts. Showing the name of the thread of what type of post it is. 

The Username tags look like this

And the Results page:

There is only a single mention of **honestbleeps** as the author and no links whatsoever to his site or any other (semi-)official channels.

I view this as claiming someone else's work as one's own by way of omission and will be using the ""Report abuse"" link accordingly. I'll wait until later this afternoon to do so in case honestbleeps has any input or comment on the matter.

For those not keeping score in the sidebar - it wasn't that long ago I made an announcement that this subreddit had topped 15,000 users.  Now it's already over 18,000.  Big deal, right?

Well for me, it *is* a big deal - because it means we've gotten WAY more posts here and to be honest the vast majority of them are questions from people who clearly haven't searched for the answers (because they're almost always already here)...

So, I wanted to say **thank you a ton** to those of you who have responded and helped out.

I am only barely starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel after a few long weeks of a rough project and also several days out of town -- and while I've been busy as hell, a number of you have stepped up and provided tech support to people...

for a product you didn't even develop... that you don't get paid for...

So I just wanted to say a huge thank you to my helpful mods /u/gavin19, /u/tico24, /u/s_quark as well as some particularly helpful users like /u/blind__man and certainly others I'm neglecting.  I'd also like to thank /u/gamefreak4321 who has been contributing some code lately.  I'm sure I've missed a name or three and I'm making someone feel unappreciated by forgetting their name here -- I promise it's because I'm busy as hell, not because I didn't see you help someone out or don't care - I'm sorry :-\

""Hey, that list looks familiar, didn't you just thank them a couple of weeks ago?""

Yeah. And once wasn't enough. These people are busting their damn balls to help me help all of you...

I don't see a whole lot of users responding to them thanking them for providing answers to their questions - so please, remember to thank people who are taking time out of their day to help you.  Even if none of these guys did help you - RES tag them as ""super awesome"" and remember to say hi and brighten their day next time you run across them in another subreddit or something...

Going through bug reports and having to scan comments (sometimes buried ones, sometimes not) to find details on a bug because someone purposefully ignored RES's guidance on bug posting, however, is cause for concern.  It's pretty difficult (thus intentional) to post a bug report as an imgur image.

Just to be clear, here's what it looks like to try and post a bug report as an imgur link -- it takes special effort to ignore RES's guidance:

[first, you have to click a button saying you want to submit a bug report](http://i.snag.gy/J0uA4.jpg)

[next, you have to say you're **sure** you want to do that](http://i.snag.gy/tAGgG.jpg)

[next, you'd have to notice RES selected a ""text"" post for you, and change it to link, while ALSO ignoring instructions to please post screen shots in selftext](http://i.snag.gy/3jc2b.jpg)

It takes a pretty determined effort to submit a bug report as an imgur link - so I don't feel like this is some sort of massive mod hammer / showing of power.

Essentially, you would hit a key and then it would automatically jump to the next parent. Sometimes, one gets bored of a certain topic that the siblings of a parent are talking about, and I believe that a 'jump to next parent' feature would be enjoyed by many. 

Thanks for creating RES, I absolutely enjoy it! I think this little feature change would bring it from a 10/10 to 11/10 for me. 

EDIT: Seems like the solution to this has been told to me by a commenter...

When you get RES installed on a new computer, everything will be exactly how you like it. And if your current local settings ever get wiped- your settings are right there waiting for you.

&gt; The reason it will cost money is that it will cost me money to provide to you. It requires a central server to store your data as well as perform logical operations on that data (so that ""syncing"" truly ""syncs"" rather than just copy/paste). There will also be some features above and beyond your settings/data that also require a central server to operate.

Look, all that's needed is a way for the user to specify an alternate settings file. If you use Dropbox, you could tell RES to use a settings file on your Dropbox directory, and it's all automagically synced.

If you have a Google account, then Google Docs could be used to store the settings.

More tech-savvy users could use other methods, all involving private accounts.

It would be cool, if when you subscribed to a subreddit, you could adjust how much of it's normal appearance you would get.  So say, I felt like I was getting too much of r/aww, I could lower it to say 50%, so theoretically it should front page half as much as it would normally, and I would get a more appropriate mix of that particular subreddit I wanted.  

To piggyback off of that, you could set a percentage of /r/all you wanted on your front page, essentially feeding in just a little bit of new/random content that you're subscribed to in hopes of finding new subreddits you liked. r/all might be a bad place to start that with because you'd just be getting the most popular links.

Instead of the new comment box colors? http://i.imgur.com/vTyIjJV.png

one problem with this would be the comments with low upvotes but 0 downvotes thus has a %100 approval. Maybe there could be threshold like 50 or something votes to assign a color to prevent this so they stay neutral until then.

I'd like to make something abundantly clear here:  I'm all for free software.  RES is free. Donations are optional.  So optional in fact that even with several hundred hours poured into RES development and support I've received just a few hundred bucks in donations.

Actions speak louder than words, and I see no legitimate intent from him to improve upon RES or Reddit, etc.

It's good to know who I've seen before and whether what I saw was worthy of upvotes or downvotes -- this seems to enhance a sense of community.

But there are times when I find myself downvoting someone I've previously upvoted, or upvoting someone I've previously downvoted, which lowers the absolute value of the tag following their username (or possibly makes it vanish entirely if the net gain equals zero). Though this accurately reflects how worthy of karma I've found their content, it does not accurately represent how much of their content I've seen. The feature I'd like to request to fix this could take one of two forms:

1. Within the ""[+1]"" tag include the total number of votes given, e.g., ""[+5 / 7]"" would mean I have voted on that user's content seven times, for a total net gain of +5 karma (meaning one of those votes was a downvote), or;

2. Beside the username show the total number of upvotes given and the total number of downvotes given, in much the same way that is currently done for posts, e.g., ""NotJarslow (6|1)"" would mean I've voted seven times--six times up and one time down--for a net gain of +5. In this situation I imagine the first number colored orange for upvotes and the second colored blue for downvotes.

I should note that I greatly prefer the first option. While both allow the same information to be seen or calculated, option one shows the **net gain of karma** more directly, and that's probably the most important figure to have here. The **total number of votes** (which is the second number in option one) is what I would consider the second most important figure out of those given here, followed by **total upvotes** and **total downvotes**. Since the second option highlights **total upvotes** and **total downvotes** more directly than **net karma** and **total votes**, I'd judge it inferior to the first option. It helps that option one looks more elegant and less cluttered to me.

1296238114.0,72,self.Enhancement,fav19,"[TEASER] Reddit Enhancement Suite - persistent settings, new features, and a note from the developer...",77,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/fav19/teaser_reddit_enhancement_suite_persistent/,"Okay everybody... I've been busting my ass and racking my brain on this, and I've come up with something I think many of you will be excited about, although for ""The Big Kahuna"", there's a CPU cost...

**What's the big kahuna?!**

Well, the big kahuna is: I've spent some laborious hours devising a way to use each separate browsers' various data storage mechanism's independently so that when you clear your private data, RES settings don't go away!

- In Firefox: moving from localStorage to GM_setValue, which stores the data ""in Greasemonkey's settings data"", and shouldn't be cleared when you delete private data.

- In Chrome: Still using localStorage, but using the localStorage of the ""extension background page"", which shouldn't be lost when you clear private data. (NOTE: There is a CPU cost on every page load because now RES has to copy all of that data from the ""extension background page"" to the ""foreground page"" because of how Chrome works)

- In Safari: Same as Chrome.  Technically I could get around the copying situation that Chrome suffers from because Safari does offer some synchronous message passing.  However, the cost / benefit in my opinion isn't there yet.  The delay (to me, anyway) isn't noticeable even on my underpowered laptop.

- In Opera: Same as above.  Opera's in the same situation as Chrome is - no synchronous message passing, so data all must be ""copied"".. 


**What else is coming?**

- betteReddit will have some new features, including an editable top bar (your subreddit listing) with drag/drop sorting, etc.

- new module: comment navigator.  you'll see :)

- Inline Image Viewer: major update that fixes a number of little annoyances.  Also: thumbnail preview on hover.

- Some contributed code from semanticist to allow you to see the exact time/date a post was made when you hover over the tagline

- some other smaller additions, and the usual slew of bugfixes...

Now, a note:

The reason I've killed myself to get persistent settings has to do with the forthcoming RES Pro that I'm working on.  As many of you know (and a few of you have been helping test), I'm working on a way to sync your preferences to a server.

This will cost money, because servers cost money and because I've worked my ass off to provide this to people who've demanded it.

However, I really didn't feel right suggesting a paid-for service as a way to get around losing settings when you clear your private data.  I felt it would look like I was ""trapping"" people into having to use RES Pro or live with RES losing settings all the time when they cleared data.

Obviously, my intent isn't to give you crippleware and make you pay for it just to get it to function in a ""reasonably expected"" fashion.

On the flip side of that coin, I've worked my ass off to provide this because people have asked.  If you appreciate it, but still aren't interested in syncing your settings across computers, etc, a [donation](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/about) would be appreciated...",,False,,t5_2s10b,False,,resauthor,True,t3_fav19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/fav19/teaser_reddit_enhancement_suite_persistent/,moderator

I am ""older"" as far as programmers go.  I come from the world of CVS, and then SVN.  Therefore, I'm likely going to screw something up or have stupid questions as people first start making pull requests, etc.

Please understand a couple of things up front:

- I would prefer that under the ""Reddit Enhancement Suite"" name, distribution be handled through my server so that I can manage simultaneous release schedules for all 4 major browsers.  I can't legally stop you from doing your own thing, I'm just making a hopeful request.  If you want to branch it off on your own and distribute it - I just ask that you please, please change the name to something that can't be confused with RES.

- Please do understand that not all submissions may make it in to the distribution. RES is huge as is, and ""bloat"" is a concern. Subreddit specific modules, for example (i.e. rage face modules) are probably not something that would get put back into the master.  However, I'm working on a way for people to selectively ""add in"" modules without packing them in the RES distributable.

Thanks!  I hope this github thing works out... I know many of you have clamored for it, and I know I've been slow to get RES up there.

If you are skilled in javascript, but new to extension development, please feel free to ping me with questions.  I've learned a good bit about the nuances of each browser's various extension architectures and I may be able to help!

**2.** In this console type:

A window will pop up like [this](http://i.imgur.com/1aokC.png).  

**3.** Select all and copy.  Open up your favorite non-word-wrapping text editor (I used gvim) and paste this into there. This is your backup of all of your current tags if something goes wrong.  Save it.

**4.** Copy your friends code. (They will have done the same as you so far, and sent you their backup file. Copy the text in that file)

**5.** In your RES tab, scroll to the bottom of the list of tags until you see two end curly braces next to each other.  Position your cursor in between them.  Like [this](http://i.imgur.com/oiJrw.png). **Add a comma.**  Then paste *after* the comma but before the last }.  *Make sure that everything is now on one line.*

**6.** Save. you now have all your old tags plus all your friends tags!

I've had this 100% cpu problem for more than 6 months with all released FF versions up to FF 16.0.2. It wipes out a laptop battery.

    Open reddit.com in a tab with 100 titles (and make the images visible)
    Open more than 5 of the comment threads in new (hidden) tabs until FF uses &gt;700 MB of RAM (I have 4 GB)
    CPU goes to 100 % forever until I move away from the reddit.com tab to any other tab.

If I go back to the main reddit.com it will most likely go back again to 100% cpu as I scroll down. To stop it I have to go away from this main reddit.com tab.

edit: This seems to apply only with the main reddit.com page. (also with reddit.com/top/)

This also happens with a new profile with only the addons mentioned here.

Especially when there are a lot child comments and the parent comment isn't on screen anymore. Hovering on ""parent"" helps, but it's annoying to have to do it all the time.

So here's my suggestion. When scrolling through comments the parent comments of the comment you're at should stay at the top of your screen even though you've already scrolled past them. The stuck parent comments should disappear when you've scrolled past the thread they were parents in. It makes for quick looking back on the parent comments. Obviously this could take up a lot screen space. To fix that it could limit the stuck parent comments count limited to 3 (can be option for user) for example. So you only see the parent of the comment you're at and 2 levels outer of that. That's good for deep threads.

I'd love to have the ability to completely and utterly hide all signs of karma.  Now, I'm not asking for things to be reordered in that way -- in other words, still let 'best' and 'top' sorts and tabs exist, still let hide-by-karma work, and so on.  Just hide all incidences of karma everywhere, though.  My user profile, my little name in the corner, and everyone's comments everywhere.  Perhaps optionally offer the ability to turn off voting as well, but theoretically this feature would allow one to vote while still not seeing the karma.

Yes, I know the site runs on karma ... but most RES users are tweakers, and this is a tweak I've seen people want before.  I definitely want it.  Basically, the value I see in it is that it would encourage you more to be yourself, and not care so much about whether your comment is likely to get positive or negative karma.  Karma really can lend itself to groupthink ... it's a fundamental human need to have the approval of your peers, and that's what karma preys upon.

Haters gonna hate, spammers gonna spam, with or without this feature, so I don't see it as a particularly harmful-to-the-community feature.  It'd just be nice to turn off the reminders of groupthink.  That's not to say one can't be who one is even without this feature ... but it'd be a useful aid.

Anyway, my two cents.  Would LOVE to see the RES team be kind enough to take this ball and run with it.

**tl;dr Let users turn off karma, both with or without turning off voting, in order to (a) just allow people to view the site that way if they want, or, more philosophically, (b) to encourage honesty to self and discourage groupthink.**

The drag to resize feature in the Reddit Enhancement Suite is amazingly useful. Aside from inline image viewing, it is probably my favorite feature. Based on what I've read, it looks like a lot of people agree and wish that something similar was possible outside Reddit.

The suggestions usually include things such as Ctrl+scrollwheel, which is far from perfect (I don't always want everything on the page to get huge, and resizing everything is CPU-intensive).

Quite a bit of searching later, and I realized that there was no standalone drag-to-resize script or anything quite like it. But no matter! RES is GPL, so this problem has an easy solution: cut out everything else and widen scope to include everything.

That's exactly what I did. Almost none of the code is mine. I just chopped out the 8,000 lines of RES and wrote a little routine to mark every image as resizable. All creative credit goes to honestbleeps.

Because this script is configured to run everywhere by default, it will most likely break some web sites that use JavaScript to let you view or mess with images. It doesn't seem to conflict with RES.

If you find out this breaks some web site, let me know and I'll update the default excludes. If you missed it, the link is at the top.

*Also, if this isn't the best place to post this, let me know. It seemed appropriate, but I'm frequently wrong.*

*EDIT (2011-06-24 02:41 UTC):* The script now brings resized images to the front, above other page elements.

*EDIT (2011-06-25 00:29 UTC):* Added double-click to maximize and right-click to restore. (To make images which are links larger, first drag to resize them as this disables the link until restored.)

I think I need a break for a while.,78,23,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/osbdl/my_last_post_re_cpuram_hogging_was_a_false_alarm/,"I started off with [solid reason to follow up on msvcr/firefox failure.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713167) tl;dr: they hadn't linked msvcr80 in a way FF could fall back to their provided version if somebody uninstalled the official 2005 runtimes, causing issues with browsercomps.dll under rare conditions. I like how they made a couple of comments wondering how they could have missed that with all the testers reporting in.

I misunderstood what I was looking at when I ran 32-bit FF through 32-bit Dependency Walker via **64-bit** Process Explorer - doing it that way polluted the view in a way I wasn't expecting, leading me to think that all supported dlls associated with FF should run in a (mythical) ""64-bit-aware 32-bit mode"", because everything BUT firefox.exe and - you guessed it - msvcr80.dll were showing as 64-bit.

I theorized that those policies force-redirecting any program's attempted usage of msvcr80 version \*.762 to version \*.6195 was a possible reason for this ""failure"" to run in ""64-bit-compatible mode"". After all, it can't be good to DOWNGRADE a library when it's not expected, right?

Well, crap - no wonder I couldn't find any mentions of this forced-downgrade ""problem"", because it isn't. A downgrade. Or a problem (probably).

Microsoft minor versioning numbers just keeping adding together, so by their standard, .6195 IS newer than .762, whereas I, and apparently everyone else who doesn't intimately deal with Microsoft versioning, tend to think that "".7x"" is newer than "".6x""

My only consolation about this comedy of obvious-in-hindsight errors is that nobody has called me out on the versioning boo-boo, from which everything else flowed - I think from that that I could be forgiven for this wild goose chase - but it doesn't help my self-esteem to have fallen for it.

I methodically got myself into it, and - with the help of that sanity-checking - worked myself back out of it, but I pride myself on remembering even trivial things like that Microsoft minor versioning quirk (I recalled hearing about it 15 years or so ago and resolved to remember it in light of DLL Hell... but of course that particular problem has been lessened greatly since then...) and more serious errors (in terms of skewing results) like mixing 64-bit/32-bit environments while debugging.

I'm sorry for what turns out to have been wasted effort on y'all's behalf - the sanity-checking worked in ultimately helping me determine whether I was on the right track (nope), but not in the way I'd been expecting it to go (verifying the issue).

I've been hitting a lot of investigation avenues and doing a lot of on-the-fly spot education, and it's probably turned a bit obsessive. I keep incrementally improving RES response times through various tweaks, but they aren't satisfying general answers.

I'm going to take a break from this for a week or so, give myself time to digest everything from a less-immediate perspective, and resume with collating what I've done and reevaluating the data I've gathered to date.

It's not RES. It's not FF. The issues are too narrowly confined. The outside conditions that cause this are discoverable by programmers using their own methods and techies using *their* own methods. I'm a techie, and I'll be back.

But I do apologize most sincerely and thank you for your help. I hope my credibility hasn't been too damaged by this - I'm willing to be the leader from the techie point of view in data gathering and collation so that HB has solid data to work with, but I can't keep spending my time responding to challenges regarding my credentials and abilities.

If downvotes/responses to this post indicate that trust is gone, so be it. I'll work on in silence and send HB the results directly. I just thought it would be nice to keep those of us affected in the loop as to how I'm proceeding and spark the type of followups by others such as the one that led to gamerfreak writing code that helped reduce the issue quite in a bit for Chrome users.

I didn't see an issue like this in the first few pages of /r/RESissues, but someone commented on it in /r/Enhancement.

The image peeker button is a toggle.  If you click it once, it makes the image visible inline below the peeker button.  If you click it again, it hides the image.  However, it also has some strange ""smart scroll"" feature to try to get the whole peeked inline image into the browser's window.  This scrolling feature moves the page up or down, which moves the image peeker button relative to the user's mouse pointer.

If the peeker button is showing an IMGUR gallery, it also exposes some buttons for prior and next images.  The ""smart scroll"" feature is engaged every time you flip images, which is really bad if landscape/portrait images are alternated in the gallery.

I often click the peek button, see what I want to see, and try to toggle the image hidden again.  Maybe it's NSFW, maybe it ends up being unexpectedly gross.  Half the time, the toggle button has moved, so I end up hitting the inlined image itself by mistake, or some other link on the page, so rather than hiding the image, it opens it even larger on a new tab.

Moving a toggle button out from under the user's mouse pointer is bad.",,False,,t5_2s10b,False,,,True,t3_13dk1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/13dk1x/feature_request_dont_scroll_the_page_at_all_when/,

It doesn't.

The misconception is likely from the text ""RES Ignored Duplicate Image"" (or something like that). This text appears only when there are two identical image URLs on the same page.

Full disclaimer: As the creator of http://karmadecay.com I find this to be a particularly irritating misconception

**tl;dr**: The text ""RES Ignored Duplicate Image"" has no relevance to reposts. RES does not detect reposts at all.

**edit:** To make sure there is not a new miscommunication, let me reply up here to this question that I got:

&gt; I'm assuming that all this is because you feel that these misconceptions are having a negative impact on your site?

No. I'm sure there is virtually no impact. I just found it irritating to see such ignorance on multiple occasions. My association with my KD only causes me to be more acutely aware of what people are thinking or saying about reposts.

About two weeks ago my hard drive decided to die, which meant that I could only browse reddit when I had access to another computer, and said computer did not have RES installed. This was fine for the first little while as I was only browsing ""casually"" (apparently that's possible) so I didn't really want to install RES on a computer that isn't solely my own, especially for the quick browsing that I did for most of those days (it seemed pointless to install RES for just checking the homepage and another reddit or two).

Then last Thursday came around. I had a bit more free time and decided to visit [/r/f7u12](/r/f7u12) I think it was. By the end of the first page, I realized how much I missed RES's Never-Ending-Reddit and View Images features. Thankfully my new hard drive came in yesterday and now I can use RES again.

All I would like is a quick button (text or image, doesn't matter) in the top right corner where the rest of the RES features are located that will allow you to show/hide NSFW links.

I'll go ahead and address the other solutions people have proposed:

1) **Use filtereddit.**
The filtereddit feature is great when you want to *permanently* hide certain things, but it's a mild hassle to go to your preferences and change it every time you want to show/hide NSFW links

2) **Make a separate account.** Having an alternate account and using account switcher is certainly an option, but wouldn't it be **THAT** much nicer to be able to turn them on/off in one click?

3) **Bookmark the NSFW subreddits you like and don't +frontpage them** Another possible option, but still an inconvenience because you then have to view *exclusively* NSFW links, which makes it much less like casually browsing and much more like *just looking at porn*.


If I had any more experience with coding I would just try this myself, but unfortunately I am not.

I think it would need to be a subset of tags somehow, maybe based on a text prefix? And I'm not sure how you'd manage the combination of a personal tag and one I receive from a user I share with (unless I can use multiple tags per user?), but it would a fantastic modding feature!

1361710399.0,45,self.Enhancement,194prt,[tutorial] How to share RES data on dual-boot machines using Chrome/Chromium,58,13,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/194prt/tutorial_how_to_share_res_data_on_dualboot/,"Hi there. I recently installed a Debian-based distro on my computer which also has Windows 7 on it. I'm an avid RES user, as most of you, and I really wanted to be able to share all my saved stuff between OSs without much hassle. I'm using Chrome on W7 and Chromium on Linux Mint 14 MATE. Here's how to do it.

A. You are going to use the Windows' RES data on your Linux system. First you have to set your Linux OS so it mounts the W7 OS partition on startup. You need to install RES on both OSs before beginning. The way I do it is

1. Create a folder under /media (for instance, /media/windows), by
 opening a terminal and typing

    sudo mkdir /media/windows

2. Install blkid

    sudo aptitude install blkid

3. Run blkid and identify the Windows OS partition. You may need to use fdisk -l in order to learn which /dev/?d?n that partition is. If you don't get the right partition at first don't worry, you can try another one until you find it.

    sudo blkid

4. Your partition will be one of these lines, in my case:

    /dev/sda2: LABEL=""OS"" UUID=""XXXXXXXXXXX"" TYPE=""ntfs""

5. Great! Now we need to edit the /etc/fstab file by adding these lines

    UUID=XXXXXXXXXXX	/media/windows	ntfs-3g	defaults	0	0

6. You could also use /dev/?d?n (e.g. /dev/sda2) instead of the UUID, but it's advised not to.

7. Let's try this.

    sudo mount -a

8. Navigate to /media/windows and check that it's indeed the correct partition. If not, unmount it, edit /etc/fstab and try another ntfs UUID from the sudo blkid command.

B. If everything is OK up to this point, the last part is quite easy.

9. Graphically navigate to the folder

    /media/windows/Users/&lt;YourWindowsUser&gt;/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Local Storage

10. Identify the following files. These are the files that hold your RES data on W7 and the ones you're going to want to use on your Linux OS :

    chrome-extension_kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb_0.localstorage
    chrome-extension_kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb_0.localstorage-journal


11. Navigate to

    ~/.config/chromium/Default/Local Storage
which is the same as
    /home/&lt;YourLinuxUser&gt;/.config/chromium/Default/Local Storage

C. In this folder (B.3) you'll find the same files you located in B.1, granted you had already installed RES both on W7 and Linux.

12. This step now changes depending on which data, W7's or Linux's, you want to preserve and use. In my case I wanted  to keep my W7 data, so let's do it first that way.

13. On the folder from B.1, select both files, right click them and ""Make link"". Two new links will appear, one to each original file. Delete the files on the folder from B.3 and cut and paste your new created links there. After completely closing and reopening your browser, all your W7 RES data should be there, and any changes you make will also be visible on W7.

14. The only difference regarding C.2 is that you need to replace the files on B.1 folder with the ones on folder 11. (that is, overwritting your W7 files with your Linux files). Afterwards it's the same  as we did on C.2.

Now, if you're a bit Linux savvy you'll know that all we're doing is creating symbolic links (ln -s), which means you can create them that way if so you want it.

If you're using other OSs or you are using Chromium/Chrome on W7/Linux, you can check the folders where you will find the files [here](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/wiki/index.php?title=Where_is_RES'_data_stored%3F).

Ever since I switched from the greasemonkey version to the stand alone version, Firefox keeps freezing on me. It does it 1-5 times every couple of minutes and lasts from 1-15 seconds.

So keystrokes/clicks still happen, it's just delayed.  

 I'm also having a problem when clicking ""hide"" it is always slow and can take over ten seconds to actually hide the post. I use a greasemonkey script ""reddit don't like"" that hides things instantly.

&gt; Hey there!

&gt; It looks like you are submitting to /r/Enhancement. Are you submitting a bug report? If so, please consider the following:

&gt;    1. Have you searched /r/Enhancement to see if someone else has reported it?
   2. Have you checked the FAQ yet?
   3. Are you sure it's a bug with RES specifically? Do you have any other Reddit-related userscripts/extensions running?
   4. Okay - if you've answered ""yes"" to all of the above, go ahead and report it. Please be sure to specify your browser, operating system, anything showing up in your Javascript error console, and any special settings you may have that might help debug.

Despite that, people are still managing to remove that text without ever reading it, and posting really vague bug reports without specifying what browser they use, etc...

I'm torn...

Do I start just deleting these posts and asking people to re-post?

Do I solicit the help of some of you guys to moderate this subreddit and do that?

Do I add even more obtrusive code to RES to make people check a box before submitting ""bug reports"" that usually aren't bug reports?

I'm not sure... but it's getting difficult to keep up these days....

If you don't want to share it that's totally cool -- but I'd love to keep track of what reddit users have donated, especially because I'm working on something [minor! don't get too excited] for those few of you who've been kind enough. :-)

- Wow. We're over 500 subscribers!  That's still nothing compared to the install base of RES, but it's impressive.  By my (google analytics) count, several thousand people have installed it.  I never expected that.  It's really flattering to see.

- I'm trying, in my bits of spare time here and there, to get to all of your feature requests.  My sincerest apologies to those of you who I've left hanging for a long time.  My sincerest-er apologies to those of you who've requested features that I've chosen not to add to RES.  It's nothing personal, and most of the time it's not even that I don't like your idea -- I'm just trying to keep RES running as efficiently as I can, and avoid ""stylistic"" choices with RES whenever possible because they just differ so much between users.

Finally, thanks to all of you who have been supportive via emails, posts on here, etc.  It really means a lot.  Most of the time, especially before I created this subreddit, all I saw was ""eh I installed that thing and it was stupid"", or ""that thing is designed like crap"", or ""too Fing slow!"" when I was reading other threads where someone had mentioned RES.

I've noticed as of late that a few of you have been sort of 'ambassadors' for RES, and man do I appreciate it!  Thanks to all of you.

I updated to the new addon version of RES while I was using Greasemonkey before. The old version worked perfectly fine, and since updating I've noticed my browser hangs for a second or two out of every six seconds or so. This affects ALL webpages and not just Reddit. 

RES is also causing Firefox to use approximately 150MB more memory than the 3.x Greasemonkey version I was using did. When I close Firefox and RES is enabled it takes about 10 seconds to free all of its memory. If I disable RES addon then everything works at full speed as it should, Firefox uses significantly less RAM, and when it's closed the memory is freed immediately instead of taking several seconds.

Edit: The ui freezing seems to be correlated with Firefox's CPU usage. It's normally around 0-2% without RES enabled, with it it is at about 4-5% with brief spikes to 10-17% (17% = 1 core of my 6).

1310321380.0,48,self.Enhancement,ilq32,Block out head splinters and circle jerking using FilterReddit,58,10,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/ilq32/block_out_head_splinters_and_circle_jerking_using/,"Go into Configure Modules --&gt; FilterReddit and dump your filters so we can pick up any useful filters you have.

A **head splinter** is a word or phrase people add to their submissions' titles that forces people to read the title by knee-jerk reaction because it catches their eye.

The evolution of a head splinter goes like this:

1. A submission becomes incredibly popular seemingly for no reason.

2. Someone else posts a different submission with a similar title which also goes viral.

3. People begin to isolate the particular phrase in the submission title that catches the eye and over-use it to whore for karma.

At this point people are not upvoting or clicking submissions based on the content behind the link, they're upvoting because the submission title catches their eye.

For example, recently people have figured out that five is a magical number of items to use in a submission title that makes redditors think think ""this article gives me enough things to look at to keep me entertained for a while without triggering my attention deficit.""  So they have started adding ""five reasons why"" or ""five things you'll like about"" etc. to submission titles.  Don't believe me?  Try searching for the number five.

**Circle jerking** is where you use someone's affiliation with an idea that is close to their heart to game redditors' emotions to whore for karma.  As has been pointed out many times some people enjoy this sort of thing and [there's a subreddit for it](http://reddit.com/r/circlejerk).

For example:

* Does anyone else think this cat pic is adorable?

* Does anyone else remember Scooby Doo?

* HAE had a relative die from breast cancer?

* Anyone else remember waiting for Realaudio streams to rebuffer?

* Here is a picture of my uncle who died recently from complications related to Alzheimer's - he will be missed

Of course the knee-jerk reaction to this is going to be ""oh god my aunt died from breast cancer \* clicks upvote \* because their relative died from cancer, not because the link posted is interesting or provocative.

Of course people are going to update this poor redditor whose uncle died due to complications related to Alzheimer's.  He's had enough of a bad day already.

But the truth is, many of these posters never actually had the traumatic event they're posting about.  They're just going to Google Images, finding a random picture, re-hosting it on imgur and posting a sob story to get upboats.

I'm hoping we can identify and share some filters to use to block this stuff out.

___________________________________________
**EDIT:** my response to honestbleeps suggestion that this feature would be ""bad"" for reddit.

_____________________

Wow, that's a terrific point and I didn't even think about that.

However, I believe its a bit more complicated then to simply say that it ""should **not** be done"" because there would be a ""reduction of voting, and that's bad for reddit.""

I am just one user on this website, and my usage patterns are entirely subjective, so my desire for this feature comes from the fact that I surf /r/all a lot and I click many different links, When I don't like something I downvote it, and when I DO like something, I upvote it, the rest of the links I click that I want to AUTO-HIDE are usually ones that I am indifferent upon.

The majority of these posts already have thousands of votes, this is the result of perhaps a different ""class"" of users from my self, who look at **NEW** submissions on specific boards, or even /r/all /new (of course not to suggest that the class stays on ""new"" submissions, but whoever is looking at it at the time)

The AUTO-HIDE feature would certainly be Self-Defeating if it were allowed on the **NEW** sections of boards, but I would suggest that if you are surfing NEW submissions then you are probably voting on them.

For users, like me, who frequent the **TOP** sections of boards, the AUTO-HIDE feature isn't all too impactful as the Voting function of reddit has already done the major part of its job with the users who spend time in the bottom or NEW sections of boards sifting out the good content.

Further still, I think AUTO-HIDE **might actually be beneficial** to the voting system of reddit for user such as myself, consider the following:

With AUTO-HIDE enabled with all three features I suggested turned on, It would STILL allow me to vote on what I like or dislike and remove those posts, while simultaneously removing posts that I am indifferent on, where the ultimate result is that I am exposed to more posts that I can decide whether or not to vote on more easily **RATHER THAN** have a page full of fragmented links where I have to find the ones that I haven't already clicked or simply skip down to a fresh untouched page where I miss all the untouched content mixed with the content that would have been Automatically hidden.

As long as I still vote on the links I have an opinion on I still serve a slight function relative to the entire system, where if I use the embedded feature for auto-hiding I would probably end up down voting every link I was indifferent on rather than leaving it up to another user who actually had an opinion.....

Also, even if it did result in a drop in the amount of voting, as long as there was a ""mean"" difference in the amount of votes cast then all the content would remain the same, where there would simply be posts with only fewer votes. Then again, I would say when you consider how massive and integrated the system of reddit is, who the fuck knows whats going to happen when you add a single feature.... 

certainly though, to claim that adding this feature is ""bad for reddit"" is simply beyond the scope of what you or I are capable of entirely predicting when reddit is such an intricate system.

I'd say its at least worth a temporary implementation to take note of the effects... who knows, it could result in a far better user experience which I would suggest is the ultimate goal.

Now, allow me to add a few stipulations to my original post:

* Limit it to TOP and HOT

* Leave a Delay time for Image Preview clicks before its hidden to allow voting (even though there is a short delay anyway)

(comments section clicks should be irrelevant since you are going to the post anyway and can't vote on it there)

However, i can't find this option anywhere and figured i should post it and see if anybody else miss it. if it already exists and i've simply not found it, please point it out as well as redirect me to where i can find it.*

**FEATURE:** I'd like the ability for the redditer to be able to create a new tab and rename it to whatever the redditer likes. the redditer afterwards should be able to choose specifically what sub-reddit(s) he/she wants displayed in that tab.

**EXAMPLE:** i create a tab called ""Gaming"" since i play alot of computer/video games. i then choose to specifically and only display sub-reddits such as /r/gaming, and sub-reddits for some specific games. in my case it would involve /r/guildwars2, and /r/leagueoflegends.

i then create another tab called ""news"", and there i'll have sub-reddits such as /r/report.

**DISPLAY:** my suggestion of where these will be displayed for the redditer to find them are next to the other reddit-tabs on the frontpage. it will look something similar to this:

[hot] [new] [controlversial] [top] [saved] [**custom**] [**custom2**] etc.

another idea of where to display them is in /user/username, but then i'd rather have it where my previous suggestion is.

I've been messing around with /u/creesch 's moderator addons in /r/toolbox, and it occurred to me that it would make the lives of moderators much easier across Reddit if the report button did a little more.  

When a moderator hits remove while using the modtools scripts, a popup (configurable by the moderators) appears with a choice of pre-written messages to post as reasons for the removal. They pick one, and it is either posted or sent as a PM. 
 
If the standard ""report"" button had an option for users to pick which ""rule of the subreddit"" is being broken (configured by the mods in the subreddit wiki), and automatically generated a modmail explaining it, I think moderating large subreddits could be a lot easier. I know we've benefited hugely in /r/IAMA simply from having automoderator post a comment with easy links to prefilled modmail reports on questionable posts.  

I understand that this isn't necessarily helping ""general reddit users"", it's more targeted at the mods, but in order for this to be useful, unlike modtools, it has to be installed by a decent chunk of users - something that RES seems to have the best chance at accomplishing.

Thanks for considering this, and thanks for all your hard work.

- ~~RES Version: 4.0.3~~
- ~~Browser: Opera~~
- ~~Browser Version: 11.60~~

- ~~Platform: Windows 7 Home Premium~~

~~Opening any Reddit page - even those without submissions or comments to load, such as the [preferences](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) page - in Opera 11.60 with RES 4.0.3 causes Opera's memory usage to skyrocket to about 3GB. This does not happen on any other site, and it only happens on Reddit when RES is enabled. I am not able to enable or disable features of RES to troubleshoot because the memory leak renders Opera completely unusable.~~

~~Interestingly, I installed RES 4.0.3 last night, and did not have this issue until this morning. At the time the memory leak occurred, I was playing Team Fortress 2, and that application was downloading a new map. I alt-tabbed to Opera to surf a bit while waiting, which is when I noticed the leak.~~

~~RES makes it as far as applying the Night style to Reddit, but not as far as changing the top bar from subscribed subreddits to shortcut subreddits before the leak happens. I thought about trying to recreate this in a virtual machine, but the fact that the issue didn't occur until this morning, well after I had installed RES 4.0.3 and browsed Reddit with it a fair bit, leaves me stumped as to avenues to explore in troubleshooting. I obviously cannot run Team Fortress 2 in a virtual machine, so I can't accurately recreate the conditions with which the condition began.~~

  I followed the instructions I found here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/vicay/bug_i_put_rthelastairbender_on_my_filter_list_and/c7hin8a  and pared it down to around 5.1MB~.

* A has 10.000 subscribers. It's a fairly lively place and on any given day, the top submission gets about 600 points. The highest submission of the month has 1500.

* B has 1.300 subscribers. The typical top submission gets 70 points. The top submission of the month has 230.

* I find either subreddit to be equally interesting. What does this mean? There's several definitions you can use. You can say I tend to like top n submissions from A just as much as I like top n from B on any given day or time period. Or you can say that if I take the nth submission from A, it will be less interesting than about n submissions in B. Or you can say that after if I do a Mann-Whitney U-test[1] then A and B will come out as from the same sample... I doubt it changes the results much.

Every time I look on my frontpage, I have to go through all the submissions of A, even the really bad ones, until I get to the best submissions of B. If I rated how interesting each submission is in percents, my experience goes:

100%, 69%, 45%, 23%, 13%, 7%, 5%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 1%, 1%, ... 1%, , 98%, 78%, 56%, 32% and so on.

Obviously, the number of upvotes is dependent on the size of the subreddit, because only subscribers will make a uniform, significant impact on the average upvote count. And size isn't necessarily a good predictor for how much of that subreddit you want to see.

So to solve this, we could order submissions by a ""normalized score"", which represents ""how much a submission is upvoted"" in a subreddit size-independent manner. There are two possible ways of doing this normalization:

* Normalized points = score / subreddit size

* Normalized points = score / score of the top article for that month or year

To continue with the above example:

* With the first normalization, a typical submission to A would have a normalized score of 600/10.000 = 0.06. A typical submission to B would have a normalized score of 0.05. These are a lot closer to each other than 600 vs. 70 and best submissions of A would be near the top together with the best submissions of B.

* With the second normalization, using eg. 1 month as the window, a typical A submission gets 0.4. A typical B submission gets 0.3. Again, a more even representation and A doesn't crowd out B.

Would it be possible to show this information next to the save button? I *have* to look there because I have to click it, and if my username were bold or something it'd catch my eye and remind me so I hopefully would notice my mistake.

First, the good news/bad news/good news:

**The good news is that this seems to be addressable without the *need* for new hardware. You can do it with nothing but the help of free tools and your time.** The bad news is that the fixes require patience, technical ability and some risk of bombing applications or even the OS while the fixes are being applied.  The actual risk is through mistakes in execution, the theoretical risk depends on how your installed applications/OS handle the interim while fixes are being applied. The other good news is that once the fixes are in place, weird tough-to-reproduce hardware/software BSODS and other issues should diminish, giving your OS more stability.

Onward:

* I continue to believe (with much empirical proof when I give my final report) that much of the problem is not due to FF or RES - they only act as amplifiers of previously unsuspected problems outside the browser (with two exceptions). I'm making steady progress in greatly lessening the symptoms (proof in itself that FF/RES aren't the main cause) - some of which should be applicable for those who experience the problem on non-Windows OSes. 

* [""DLL Hell""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell) is alive and well in the XP/Vista/Win7 age. The measures Microsoft has taken to relieve the problem (using [Side By Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-by-side_assembly)) also masks the problem.

* Ironically, this reappearance of the problem is brought on by Microsoft itself in the form of the official Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 runtime redistributables (and possibly the .NET runtimes - that's being investigated as well). Even more ironically, the installation of Microsoft's WinDbg package - commonly used to troubleshoot BSODs - *requires* those runtimes.

So what's the problem? Firefox needs the 2005 MS C++ runtimes (MSCRT for short), among other custom DLLs, to run. Unfortunately, the MSCRT (a collection of 3 dlls - msvcr80.dll, msvcp80.dll, msvcm80.dll) has multiple *versions* (shared among the three files).

IOW, if I told you to look in two folders and tell me *based on filenames alone* which one had ""MSCRT 2005 version 8.0.50727.6195"" and which one had ""MSCRT 2005 version 8.0.50727.762"", you wouldn't be able to - both folders would contain the same-named files (msvcr80.dll, msvcp80.dll, msvcm80.dll). Only by looking at the file properties &gt; details tab for each of those files could you see that all three of them in folder A would show ""Version: 8.0.50727.762"" and all three in folder B would show ""Version: 8.0.50727.6195""

I'm not going into why this caused DLL Hell or the details of how Side By Side is supposed to address it - suffice it to say that FF is compiled to use the last version released for MSCRT 2005 - version 8.0.50727.762. It even includes them with the setup program with the expectation that it will use them after installation.

However, other programs on your system may have been compiled to use, say, version 8.0.50727.4053, and yet others may have been compiled to work on version 8.0.50727.42, etc.

To save on distribution size, they may not have included those three files, depending on them already existing in the user's operating system. If the files aren't there, the user is prompted to download and install the official ""Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable"" package from Microsoft.

Here's where it gets interesting. The official package always includes the last/latest version of the MSCRT available *at the time you downloaded/installed it*. In theory, the last/latest version should be backwards-compatible with all earlier versions of the MSCRT, with the bonus of fixing bugs found in those earlier versions.

So the official package sets a system-wide policy (using a ""publisher configuration file"") that *all* applications requiring MSCRT versions from the very first one up to the version the package provides will *only* use the version the package provides. If the package provides version 8.0.50727.6195, that's what all programs designed to use MSCRT will use.

The package is then maintained by Windows Update, installing newer versions of the MSCRT as they come along, and updating the policy to enforce using those newer versions.

Sounds good, right? All programs using MSCRT, no matter how old the original version of MSCRT they started with, end up using the latest and greatest bug-free (hah) version without having to update themselves.

Yeah. Except that somehow Windows Update did NOT update the official package from 8.0.50727.6195 to 8.0.50727.762 - currently the most recent version, the one FF *wants* and was *designed* to use.

Instead, .762 was included in ""Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 **SP1**"", a *separate* package that users need to get and download.

So the policy was redirecting even ""unknown"" versions like .762 to use .6195

It gets even more complicated when you are using Windows 64-bit and innocently install the x86 version of the original package when directed to do so by a program (or installer of a program).

So, that's the minimum I can explain things right now. What do I need help in?

If you're running 64-bit Windows (whether IA64 or AMD64) and *have* the FF issue, can you please verify:

* whether you have the official **32-bit** ""Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable"" installed in Programs and Features? The entry will **not** say ""(x64)"", though you may have some updates that mention ""(x86)"".

You may or may not have a separate ""Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable - (x64)"" entry as well. Both entries will look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/t4q1z.png).

* If so, do you know if you also installed SP1 of either of the above? As the screenshot shows, there's no *direct* indication after installation if you have SP1 or not. However, if you somehow did install it later on without uninstalling the original package, you will see *two* identically-named entries (along with the x64 entry, if also installed). If you uninstalled the original x86 package before installing the x86 SP1 package, then the SP1 package will *appear* as if it's just the original package, leaving you with the same entries per my screenshot.

Are you confused yet? Welcome to New DLL Hell.

* Next, 32-bit Windows users should also verify whether they have the package installed as well. I have Vista 32-bit on another machine, but haven't gotten around to verifying whether original package+SP1 also equals two entries, or if installing SP1 without uninstalling the original package simply ""overwrites"" the single entry - or even if it is a second entry but actually indicates that it is SP1.

I am *not* asking users (of either x86 or x64) to get and install SP1 right now - if you have the FF problem, doing so may complicate matters even further without knowing the whole picture. I just want to know if you have the package installed, and *when* it was installed.

Dang it, even this ""short"" version is too long, I'm running out of time: it's bowling night and I *need* a break.

I'll come back and edit this tonight with better step-by-step instructions, but the next thing I need checked is which MSCRT is *actually* being used **while FF is running.**

The easiest way to find out (for FF and for other running programs) is to download Microsoft's (formerly sysinternal's) Process Explorer utility, run it, Press Ctrl-L, then Ctrl-D, (to enable the lower pane view and set it to show dlls associated with a process) leave it running, and run FF.

Once FF is running, return to Process Explorer and you'll see firefox.exe show up in the list of processes. Single-click it to select it. Now scroll down the lower pane and please report the **full paths** of mscvp80.dll, mscvr80.dll and comctl32.dll.

You can find the path of each dll by right-click &gt; Properties, you'll see it and be able to select and copy/paste it here. Repeat for the other two DLLs.

The pattern of your reports of whether the official MSCRT runtimes are installed, when they were installed, whether the SP1 updates were installed, whether you are running 32 or 64-bit windows and the dlls that end up being used after all that will go a long way to helping me determine how I actually write this up and what other measures need to be taken besides fixing the mess caused by dll hell.

I've been periodically getting this every day or two.  Clicking a link and then pressing back loads a cached page for me, instead of the page I was at.

Here's a screencap of a screen I *JUST* got from pressing back after viewing a link.  [Link](http://puu.sh/d9LD)

I clicked comments on one of these threads to show you guys that it's actually a day or two old.  [Link](http://puu.sh/d9LK)

Unrelated to this bug but occasionally I find that RES gives up loading the next page, saying reddit is overloaded.  Clicking or forcing it to load again never fixes it, but I can refresh and start back at page 1 just fine... reddit immediately loads.

I suppose I deserve the downvotes - I practice safe browsing, don't do warez/filesharing, have tons of antimalware, scan religiously, lock down my systems pretty tightly, and still didn't put two and two together until far too long a time.  
Over-confidence is a bitch. I chose to retract my mistakes and put out this warning despite the embarrassment so others hopefully won't fall into the same trap - or at least make the minimal effort to check event logs with a different POV.**

Gaddommit! Not sure what variant(s), but definitely infected. 

Check your event logs for errors in manifests, particularly if you're running Microsoft Security Essentials and Spybot S&amp;D.

MSE will also show occasional errors like:

Session ""Microsoft Security Client OOBE"" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D

Wireshark is showing traffic going to unexpected places - with many of those packets obfuscated.

Monitoring scans by Hijack This/Spybot/MSE/MBAM and others with Process Monitor shows brief directory locks/unlocks interrupting their scans, and more.

Basic ComboFix scanning has one of its modules blocked from boot loading due to ""incompatibility"" and another part of it is prevented from user interaction after reboot. It *did* delete some things on first pass (before reboot) - FWIW, they were:

c:\programdata\ntuser.dat

c:\users\\*user*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\index (2).dat

c:\users\\*user*\Documents\Readiris.DUS

c:\windows\UA000091.DLL

Which suggests that at least one infection was a variant of Win32/Alureon.H - but as I said, most normal cleanup attempts are being interrupted, so there's more going on.

I'm thinking my Verizon Actiontec router was the breach, as all four computers have similar symptoms but I haven't used two of them directly in months - and only briefly at that - and the other two are new (purchased in November) and haven't been much used for browsing.

If you're curious about my normal precautions and habits, I'll post a comment with the details so you can satisfy yourself as to whether I'm downplaying how seriously I take my security or not - but that point is moot, really. What man can do (to protect himself), man (hackers) can undo. Holy wars over which precautions and software in use ""works best"" isn't the point - the point is to doublecheck whether **you've** been equally breached no matter how confident you are that your existing methods work.

Fortunately (from a reinstalling point of view), none of the systems have programs I'd hate to lose, so I'm not bothering with further cleanup attempts - this behavior is rootkit-like, and even successful cleanups leave systems unstable more often than not. 

I'm off for secure wipes/reinstalls and lots of account password changes, plus rebuilding a PC for a backup Ubuntu firewall and seeing if I can configure Samba for certificate-based wireless authentication of a NON-Actiontec dd-wrt-modded router. :)

See y'all in a week or so!

I'm subscribed to subreddits like BuyItForLife, GetMotivated, and UniversityofReddit as life-improvement efforts.

I'm subscribed to subreddits like f7u12, shittyadvice and WTF for humor.

I'm subscribed to subreddits like news and worldnews for, well, news.

I'm subscribed to subreddits like Irvine, UCI, and California because of where my IRL communities are.

And I'm subscribed to subreddits like SubredditDrama, reddit.com, and circlejerk for meta reasons.

However, I feel like the current front page setup blasts posts from all these subreddits to me at once, and sometimes I gloss over certain posts that I'm not currently interested in, when at other times I would have loved to follow where that post takes me for an hour or more.

This is why I propose that **RES include a Module to switch between different named groups of subreddits/different ""front pages"".** This way, redditors will be able to view their content in a more organized, and timed manner, directly related to their current moods, wants, and needs. Redditors would be able to create, name, and organize their own *FrontPages*, each organized to suit a certain need or mood.

(I'd say this is very similar to ""playlists"" on iPods and such--sometimes I don't want to listen to sad music, but at other times it's just what I need.)

Let me know what you think of my suggestion!

TL;DR: I suggest that RES include a Module that enables redditors to switch between different ""FrontPages"", each FrontPage with its own theme for the subreddits the user organizes into it.

**EDIT: The Subreddit Bar at the top of the page does just this! HA! Awesome :) Just click on the + all the way to the top right of your page, put in a name for the subreddits heading, and then double-click on the name that pops up in the bar to change the name or start putting in the subreddits that show up under it, separated with +'s (example: Gifs+WTF+MyLittlePony).**

**P.S. Keep text backups for each heading for now, since they might get deleted if you reorder them due to a glitch that is currently being solved by this awesome team!**

* The night/day toggle works
* the drop-down button next to the user-name shows up (However, no saved log-ins appear, even after opening **+add account** and verifying there are saved log-ins).
* Comment karma appears next to link karma
* Color-coded up/downvote count show next to topic/title
* [RES] preference dialog pops up as a pop-up window
* Inline images works, and will open and allow for resizing

On other pages, such as the front page, or r/gifs:

* Comment karma shows, but both numbers are gray
* No comment karma # (just link karma #), or drop-down arrow next to user name
* No day/night toggle
* In-images do not show-up, though in-line videos do. 
* When I click on [RES] to open the dialog, it looks as though I have never-ending reddit open and it loads more at the bottom of the page. Actually, the preference dialog opens at the very bottom, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/X9mvu.jpg).

- You can tag users by clicking the (_) link next to them
- If you're on subreddits that you'd like called out on your homepage, use the Subreddit Tagger module to prefix them (for example, you could prefix all Pics posts with [Pics])...

Most people have been great, and maybe I'm being oversensitive, but now that RES has a ton more users I'm getting a lot more complaints -- both via email and via posts here.  If you make a post like ""this feature is [horrible/ugly/terrible/obnoxious]"" here, I'm probably just not going to respond.  There's a big difference between ""I don't like the way this works"" and ""this thing sucks""...

Have some consideration.  I realize you don't owe me anything just because you're using ""my"" software -- but I also don't owe you anything.  I put in most features that people request, and on the rare occasion that I don't - I spend time to explain why.

Also: Holy crap - referral from a /r/pics thread caused 7500+ visits!,42,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/dggat/announcement_stuff_coming_soon_also_holy_crap/,"Thanks to a few comments in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dfn1t/reddit_i_love_the_triangle_button_for_videos_can/), RES has doubled its user base.

I didn't start counting upgrades as separate from installations until recently, so these stats are a wee bit inflated, but not too much considering the vast majority of installs are new.

- Nearly 7,500 users have installed RES in Firefox.
- Nearly 6,500 users have installed RES in Chrome.
- 302 users have installed RES in Opera.
- 85 users have installed RES in Safari.

Looks like all that effort I put into making RES work in Opera and Safari may have been for a pretty small number of people... but hopefully they are enjoying it :-)

Anyway, on to updates:

I've been too busy as of late to work on RES, but I just wanted to let you all know that I'm still chugging along.

Next release:

- I'll be focusing on making the inline image viewer a little bit better

- I hope to make more features ""play nice"" with Never Ending Reddit

- There will be a number of bug fixes, as per usual...

- There's a new surprise feature that I think will be pretty divided in terms of audience. Some people will LOVE it. Others will quickly turn it off.


For the future:

Something I'm still thinking about / planning is making some of the modules handle their work in a completely different way.  For example, if 4 different modules all do stuff to comments - trying to have a way of making this more efficient.  It's unfortunately a lot trickier than it sounds, but making RES run more efficiently is a big goal of mine, and large comment pages really cause it headaches (in Firefox, at least... Chrome seems way more efficient!)...

I have not offered an explanation of what I did because I don't want to teach ""RES bad habits"".  My code is below, look at it and if you have questions about what I did then comment below or message me.  Newbie questions welcome, though if you're a newbie it's probably better to work through the author's stuff instead.

------
Adds the ability to pause and restart the the never-ending-reddit subfunction of the RES with a mouse click.  

Works on Firefox 5 (what I'm using).

Edit: BUSTED BY THE AUTHOR!  Somebody went and told on me.  I could have got a lot of karma for this but I got caught.  Good thing I'm not a crybaby.

On the other hand, I can't get my criticism from a better place than the original author. Turns out this feature was already in the works, which means I was right to think that it's something that other folks want too.

I like the size and location of my pause link and I hope honestbleeps uses that location in the final version.  More than that, I look forward to seeing the ""real"" implementation and finding out how it ""should have been done"" to fit into the existing framework.  I know ""not much"" about Javascript but it's time I learned some.

For any of you that have never tried to work on someone else's code, I would not even have bothered if the original script was not as well written as it is.  Don't even think I'm comparing my quick 24-hour hack with the excellent work done by honestbleeps (and whoever else was involved).  Just want to make that clear.

**Debugging** edit: I wasted some time just figuring out how to try things, so here is my ""hack debugging"" method:

**Debugging edit 2**: Quickly find the RES script on your system. The Greasemonkey installation puts a little monkey face in the toolbar, for me it is in the upper right corner.  From the drop-down select ""Manage User Scripts"", which opens the ""Add-ons Manager"".  Right-click on the RES selection and select ""Show Containing Folder"".  There it is.

-----

First, don't change the script name, it just says ""file corrupted"".  Maybe honestbleeps can explain that, but for casual hacking just edit the script right where it is and keep the same name.

Make changes to the .js file and reload Reddit.  If RES disappears (won't load), you did something bad.  You can re-edit your file to fix it, but I just keep the original script link in another tab and with a couple clicks I have the original RES back.  Rinse and repeat.  This seems pretty safe to me, it seems to be hard to do permanent damage to yourself.

If you get something to work, MAKE A COPY OF THAT VERSION.  It's frustrating to have to re-trace your steps, better to just reload a previous version.

That's it.  If you're curious, try it.  Even if you don't have anything particular in mind, it's informative to see how things break as long as you can reverse the damage easily.

 edit: sentence structure

earlier post
-----------
Just a few small modifications to the ""RES"".js file did the trick.  I'd like some feedback before sending it to the author for possible inclusion in the RES.

Edit: Here's the [script](http://cobaltcrystal.com/redditstuff/reddit_enhancement_suite.user.js).

Edit2: it looks like you can install it directly from the link if you want.  I haven't tried that.

If you don't know what to do, just copy this over the installed script in your Firefox profile where the Greasemonkey scripts are.  Reload reddit and the script is effective immediately.

You can save your existing script if you like but it's faster to just reinstall RES if you want the old version back.

Search for 'NERPauseLink' and 'nerpause' to find the areas I added code.  I'll do a better explanation later or tomorrow.

The pause is located right next to the [RES] at the top right.  The new script puts a '@' with a link, and a small asterisk that changes color to tell you if it's paused or not (red means paused).

1320905327.0,35,self.Enhancement,m74wr,[Announcement] Attention Firefox users (who upgraded from 3.4) - a word on your data...,41,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/m74wr/announcement_attention_firefox_users_who_upgraded/,"Okay... so the upgrade process went smoothly for a large number of RES users upgrading from the Greasemonkey 3.4 script to the native Firefox 4.0 script -- but it didn't go smoothly for everyone.  For that, I am sorry.

I had what I wrongly *thought* was a pretty simple process, but I believe my extreme familiarity with browser addons may have given me a false impression.  Lots of people got confused and either aborted the process or broke it altogether...

Often times, uninstalling a plugin or userscript deletes all associated data, and unfortunately, some panicked users did that without thinking / realizing this would happen.

So here's what you need to know:

1) Unless you went into greasemonkey and uninstalled Reddit Enhancement Suite, your old settings / data are more than likely still stored somewhere.

2) I'm working on a new script as well as a very quick screencast / tutorial on how to migrate your settings for those of you who are still stuck.  I hope to have it ready sometime tomorrow, but it may take more time.  I have a full time job and obligations outside of that as well...

3) If you're REALLY anxious, and just want to know if your data is lost forever or not, search your hard drive for a file called [prefs.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Prefs.js_file).  You can open this in a text editor and search for RES related settings... you'll see entries like RESoptions.betteReddit, etc...  If you see those things -- your data still exists, and is recoverable!

There's upteem gazillion subreddits, and the 'browse reddits' part of the site isn't really all that useful unless you're willing to spend lots of time dedicated to seeking subreddits.

Another challenge for me personally is that the large Reddits feel like (again my opinion) they have devolved into a large forum instead of a gathering of interesting bits of information. I don't really care who had a baby, or made a 20 panel rage comic, or for photos of your corgi, so when I set up my Reddit selections, I avoided those reddits.

Yet for some reason, I kept checking ""/r/All"" because there would always be at least a little content I wanted to see and was missing in my limited reddit selection. 

Enter RES and Filterreddit. Now I just go to /r/all and then use RES to filter out the reddits that I don't find funny, or too facebooky, or whatever.

1. So, basically the top navigation bar, follows you as you scroll down the page. While browsing link and while reading comments. Like **[this](http://i.imgur.com/p6NJ4.jpg)**. With your subreddits account info and what not. Then when looking at content it can also take the link and voting arrows as you scroll. 

2. An extension/add-on market if you will. Which consists of simple scripts that can run via the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com). The scripts should be  easily accessible through RES author website for easier finding. User submitted scripts that would be too small to implement over all the versions of reddit enhancement suite and maybe browser unique(note sure how that would work).  Maybe work in a voting system like reddit for usefulness.

3. Just a fast way to link rage faces or some reaction gifs/jpegs. I see this being implemented like how the subreddits come up. Instead of doing [/r/](/r/) it would be activated with i/ or // then as you type, different choices come up like in the subreddit menu. It links to an image host site like imgur or something reliable.   
 Maybe something like this could be found on the add-on page.

      a). More ideas for a scripts or features, would be to add more emoticons like the table flip guy or maybe to change the formatting inserts of the comment box to suit you better. Maybe like having odd characters that you can't seem to remember the alt code for. Or links to response/reaction pics you use often.


I didn't mean to make this into a wall of text but I just wanted this out there. The first one is the one I would rather see implemented into RES than the others. The other 3, were mainly food for thought but I still think they would be useful to some users. Hypothetically speaking, if the add-on page/market (w.e) was available, users would seek out add-ons to fit their individual taste. 

Finally, I can't say much on the programming side of how difficult it would be to implement some of these. Like having it all work across all browsers. Or making the scripts work as a feature inside RES. Also, I don't know if there are willing programmers besides the author who would like to add to RES ""market"". Let alone honestbleeps willingness to even consider adding an add-on ""market"", which kind of seems like a huge task to take on.

Here's what I got so far:

* In findImages with the other isIMAGEHOST vars, add the following var and include it to the if check (with the other isIMAGEHOST checks)

    var isDA = ((checkhref.indexOf('deviantart.com') &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (checkhref.indexOf('/art/') &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (href.indexOf('#') &lt; 0));

* In checkElementForImage with the other isIMAGEHOST vars, add this line and include it in the if check

    isDA = ((checkhref.indexOf('deviantart.com') &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (checkhref.indexOf('/art/') &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (href.indexOf('#') &lt; 0));

* Then in revealImage, right after the flickr injection and right before the last else, add the code found [here](http://pastebin.com/11VxY3Gi)

This stuff works for me, and it's just something I whipped up really quick awhile back (and I decided to contribute a patch), I'm not sure if it fits with your coding style or whatever, but feel free to make any tweaks.

Just a suggestion, thanks for RES!

Oh, also: This will only work if the person submits the image using the Reddit share button on a deviantArt page, which will normally not show the deviantArt image. With this code, it will.

Obviously, it's best to always check to see if the regular expression returns an array that has a length of 2 so that you can save yourself from an undefined/null id. Though, to be honest, I'm not sure what you would want to do in that case.

Also, here's a [test url](http://ponycrafter.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-212150336) and [another](http://ponycrafter.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-213818247?q=gallery%3Aponycrafter%2F30710796&amp;qo=6).

I have an idea for a feature that I would like to see in RES. How about some buttons placed over the right hand side of the page (to the left of the browswer scroll bar) once a user has browsed to the text comments (below the sub info, mods etc) displaying buttons to click that will allow skipping to top of current thread + start of next top level comment.

They could be colour coded, perhaps one shade for the up button and indicating everything realating to current thread and set the bg of that thread on button:hover. Same goes goes for down button and next thread, natch.

I've probably described this fairly poorly, but perhaps it can be the basis from which a discussion regarding top-level comment skipping, as its a feature I'd dearly love to see.

I can code but havent poked around in your source yet, if you want to tell me to just submit a patch that's cool too.

The RES Preference on-off toggle switch interface items are pretty and clean.  However, their indication of their current option state is more confusing than a simple checkbox or radio button.  However, they could be improved very simply to benefit the ease-of-use.

The toggle option switches are displayed for me as a metaphorical horizontal sliding switch, utilizing three colors, (Gray, Red, Blue) and two words (On, Off) to communicate with the user.

There are many issues with this control that would not be such a problem, in fact, many could be a positive feature if they weren't all concurrently present at once.

Current behavior of the control:

1.  Clicking anywhere on the switch will toggle it's state, regardless of which side you click on. 

2. The Off side displays as Red or Gray.

3. The On side displays as  Blue or Gray.

4. The On and Off text labels remain present regardless of which state is being indicated.

5. There is no intermediate state change progression visual animation to assist the user in learning to interpret the visual cues of the control

Problems with the current behaviors:

Improvements suggested:

Behavior 1.: Do not toggle the switch when any area is clicked, set the switch to the state of the side where the user clicked.   This action produces immediate feedback that consistently teaches the user immediately what the switch visual state means within two or three clicks.  [could skip this change if other solutions are implemented]

Behaviors 2. and 3.: The tri-color state change does not make sense - when combined with persistent on/off text labels in the switch slide regions it breaks the intuitive metaphor of a sliding switch.  If both on/off text labels remain present and stationary for both state indications, then the color of the active switch area should be the same color regardless of whether the active switch area is the 'on' or the 'off'.  The non-active side should look de-activated, i.e. the gray background.

Behavior 5.: The real slide switches that this control is styled after provide a successful visual cue to the user by physically displaying only one of the two text labels at a time.  This is typically the CURRENT state of the physical switch control.  Industrial and electrical design has pretty consistently implemented this, so western people (american and canadian anyway) already have a subconscious understanding of how to interpret the user interface control state when only one label is displayed.  Possible ways to improve behavior 5: 1. Display only the text label on the active state, on the inactive side leave it blank gray. 2. Animate the text sliding in and out of view under the switch frame as the switch toggle slides, as iOS settings do.  

Color choice:

Using the color red indicates generally (to american/canadian audiences anyway) that something is dangerous, important, requires careful thought before choosing, or the option that is not typically chosen.  The red color being on the OFF side of every single preference switch provides this information inappropriately - the OFF side is not the side that everyone always wants to avoid.  I don't think most of the switches even represent preference that have any recommended state.  Thus the three-color approach using red provides the user with subtle superfluous information that slows comprehension of the switch function and relative preference importance.

Conclusion:

Individually most of the behaviors are fine, however when these particular ones are combined, the control/indicator provides state information to the user that does not match their learned interpretation of the switch.  The user will try to learn how to interpret the state of the control by testing it's operation.  The control's multiple visual feedback behaviors provide information that is conflicting and and unfamiliar.  The user may have to explore external effects of the preferences to match the actual option state to the peculiar visual feedback of the control.

Changing just one or two of the behaviors will markedly improve the experience and usability of the preferences screens.",,False,,t5_2s10b,False,,,True,t3_11r7u9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/11r7u9/feature_request_toggle_switch_ui_is_very/,

Here's how to add a RES ad to your sidebar, only visible to people who don't have RES installed:

####1. Save one of these images to your desktop:

  - http://imgur.com/2X9yD (transparent background)

####2. Edit your subreddit's sidebar and add this link:

    [](http://www.redditenhancementsuite.com)

  - This will not show up yet!

####3. Go the the stylesheet page and upload your image. Name the image ""res"".

####4. Add the following code:

#

    /*RES ad originally by Raerth, update by noahjk*/
    body:not(.res) a[href=""http://www.redditenhancementsuite.com""]::after {
        position: relative;

  - The user can solve a math problem by simply copy pasting the problem into Google and letting its calculator solve it.
  - Puzzles can be fun. Math problems are not.
  - We will have to keep the math problems simple so they are approachable for all reddit users, which will downgrade their usablity.

* I think making them solve a puzzle **BEFORE** they make a comment or post would be more effective because, by the time you have gone through the trouble of typing in a post, you are _relatively_ more committed to seeing it published.

* **Why?** Because any habitual drinker redditor knows what happens when you post drunk.

Also, gmail has similar functionality in a Labs component that can be activated optionally. This component starts operation automatically based on the time of day - assuming that most drinking happens after the typical work time. This RES component could also work this way, instead of requiring the user to explicitly start the functionality by clicking a button. 

I am a game developer, and I could write the puzzle component if somebody can help me with wrapping it into the RES.

For me, the tagging/nickname/downvote-count features are the reason I use RES, and when recent tags/votes are deleted/reset I feel as if I've lost something I can't recover; imagine if your newest comments were all deleted every few days, and that's basically how I feel.

I've searched around this subreddit and found no mention of it so far, so I thought I would bring it up. Am I doing something wrong? Is my browser? What can I do about it? And what can you? 

Thanks!

**EDIT** I've downloaded the new RES and successfully transferred settings, but I'm still wondering if this problem of settings sometimes not saving will persist. Was this a *known* problem in the old version? I haven't seen it listed as one of the fixes for 4.0.2.

Perhaps we can add something like a ""/nn"" command to specify ""New posts - sorted by new"".

The highlighted line is not part of RES, it is part of r/Askreddit's new design.  When skipping child comments, I look for the line on the far left to break, and start again, so that I know where the next parent comment begins.  That line on the far left totally throws me off though, and I scroll down half the comments section wondering why the top comment has so many child comments.  Is anyone else experiencing this?  Is it possible for RES to provide a workaround, or is this something that should be taken up with r/askreddit?

Maybe I'm the one dummy that's had a problem with this, but it's *really* throwing me off.

Thanks!
