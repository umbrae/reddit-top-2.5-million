In a time in which one would could get away with murder much more easily than now it would seem wise for everyone to carry a weapon for personal defense but, as far as I know, there are no depictions of citizens being armed.

I found a copy of the Code Justinian and it mentions, quite ambiguously, that people are not allow to carry weapons. However, this is a much newer code, dated around 440CE I believe, at which points the Roman Empire was falling apart. My thought pertains more to the Rome of the Triumvirate.

I guess my initial question can be added upon with the following: Were Romans allowed to carry weapons while going about their daily business in a city? If so, what kind of weapons would they have carried? Did they have weapons in the home? If they were or weren't allowed, how did this affect crime rate?

Story in comments.,22,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/1b2qeu/i_inherited_this_knife_from_my_father_today_can/,"The story. (The events surrounding my grandfather's acquiring the knife were told to my by my father today)

Everyone on my dad's side of the family was born in Indonesia, back when it was still the Dutch East Indies. (All except for my uncle Ranci, who was named after the boat he was born on). Grandpa was with the Dutch Army during WWII. During this time he was captured by the Japanese and worked on the Bridge on the River Kwai, if you've heard of it. (They made a movie about it, which he hated.) My grandmother and aunt were living in a hut at the time, and also were captured by the Japanese as well and sent to a different camp. Both camps were later liberated by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and grandma, grandpa, and aunt were reunited. (Grandpa weighed about 70 pounds by that time and grandma didn't recognize him at first.)

They continued living in Indonesia and then the war for independence broke out, which my grandfather also fought in. Grandpa was stationed some distance away from his family when he was (erroneously) informed by the American Red Cross that his wife and daughter had been killed by Indonesian rebels.

My grandfather at that time decided he would kill 300 rebels to avenge them, 200 for grandma and 100 for his daughter. (Don't know his reasoning on that). So one night he was walking and spotted three rebels, one with a rifle. He crouched down and first shot the man with the rifle. That man fell and the second one grabbed the rifle and tried to figure out where the shot came from. Grandpa killed him also. The third man ran over an embankment and then peered above it, when he caught another of my grandfather's bullets in the head. Grandpa then went to examine the bodies and took this knife off the third man.
Later, the Indonesians won their independence from the Dutch and my grandparents and aunt were forced to leave. Grandpa did not reach his goal of 300 kills by the time he found out the news of his families death was false. He made it to 88.

This is quite a piece of history and I plan on passing it to my son some years down the road.

The man was truly the greatest conqueror the world has ever seen.  And when stacked up against the likes of Alexander the Great, Augustus Caesar, Cyrus the Great, Charlemagne, Xerxes the Great, Napoleon, and any others the world has produced Genghis Khan still stands tall.
Genghis Khan set up the largest nation the world had ever seen at that point; the only larger nation in human history would be the Mongol nation under the control of his descendants.  And though his early life is quite interesting (going from a slave to a person the entire planet will remember forever is quite an achievement), I would like to examine his later life, specifically what made him a great conqueror in this thread.  So I’ll share my limited knowledge of the man, and please fill in any holes, but for now I posit the question: What made Genghis Khan the greatest conqueror of all time?

1: The right man in the right place
	When Genghis Khan came to power in Mongolia, uniting the once independent tribes of the country, the world was ripe for the picking so to speak.  When Genghis Khan started invading neighboring countries it was nearly 1200 AD.  The Chinese were his first target, previously a strong enemy they currently were divided into three dynasties all vying for power: The Song dynasty, Xia dynasty, and the Jin dynasty.
	Genghis invaded the two weakest (Xia and Jin) dynasties first, killing those who resisted him, and assimilating the rest.  The Song dynasty would eventually fall to his sword as well, but they were still too large for his army to attack directly for the moment.  After increasing the size of his army with Chinese troop, and Chinese technology he drove through many countries including Western China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, ultimately to modern day Iran, Turkey, and beyond.
	Like the original Chinese invasion Genghis’ campaign was aided by a fracture in the west, namely the Crusades.  The Europeans had been invading the Middle East for nearly 150 years by the time the Mongol army reached the Middle East.  This left both the Europeans and the Middle East incredibly weak, as well as fatigued.  By the time the Khan showed up his army was able to tear through the already war torn nations.

2: Acceptance
	In my opinion, what made Genghis’ army so dangerous is unlike the armies in the Middle East and Europe he was fighting, Genghis was accepting of outsiders.  His tactics were brutal (basically join me or die), but joining him actually wasn’t so bad.  If you joined him you would have food, and land that you your family were permitted to have.  If you were good at your job he would promote you based on merit.
	Just let that sink in for a minute: You could get promoted based on merit in the year 1200 AD.  Most of the world at that time was either a slave or a serf, in all nations.  Most people weren’t allowed to own land.  Whatever job you were born into you would do the rest of your life.  If a noble didn’t like you he could kill you with no repercussions.  Then one day an army invades and takes you over, but instead of kill you they have you join them.  They give you land, food, a place for your family, and you can get promoted and become an upper class person yourself.
	Not only that but your new leader thinks that your religion is fine, he says he doesn’t care what god you pray to as long as you follow his orders.  His three top generals even all practice three different religions.

3: Technology
	Genghis wasn’t just accepting of different cultures and people, he was accepting of new technology.  He saw use for whatever he could take and make his own.  His early invasion of the Xia and Jin dynasties serves as a great example.  He took gunpowder, new catapults, and advanced Chinese iron and implemented them.  Also the traditional Mongolian curved bow was more powerful, more accurate, and could go further than the traditional long bows used by most of the world in that time period.

4: Tactics
	And we come to the heart of the issue, many conquerors have had superior technology, and larger armies in history, but without a proper tactician it will just be lambs to the slaughter.  And Genghis may very well be unmatched as a military tactician.
	There are many examples of his tactical expertise, and I’m sure you all realize that of him before you ever read this, but I would like to share one of his specific tactics he employed which he called “Slow Slow Quick Quick,” and how he used it on the nation of Khwarezm.
1.	Slow: Genghis wanted the nation, but they had great fortresses built so a direct invasion would have cost many lives.  So Genghis sent an emissary to offend the Shah who controlled this nation.  His emissaries were to buy nice things from the nation, the same kind of things the Shah himself would have in his palace.  This did offend the Shah, and the Shah had his emissary killed.  In return Genghis men kidnapped a caravan of some of the Shah’s men.
2.	Slow: The Shah and his men thought they were technologically superior, and of course they just thought they were stronger in general.  The Shah also knew he was well protected by nature, a nearly impassible desert to his north, and a mountain range to his south that takes at least a month on horse to get around.  He knew Genghis would come from the east so he sent his son with an army to east.  The Shah’s son came across an unprepared and ill-equipped Mongol army, which they easily dispatched.  The Shah felt the Mongols were not as strong as he had heard, so he then sent more troops to the east.
3.	Quick: The Mongols real attack came next, with most of the Shah’s army to the east the Mongols attacked from the north and the south.  The caravan they had kidnapped included a guide who knew of oases through the desert, which meant they could now cross it.  And the mountain that takes at least a month to get around?  It took his men a little over a week.  He accomplished this by giving each man two horses, when one would get tired the man would switch to the other horse.  If the horse was too tired to go on the Mongols would kill and eat it, meaning they didn’t need a supply line for food anymore.  These two armies from the south and north devastated cities, and were nearing the Shah’s capital.
4.	Quick: At this point the Shah had realized he had lost and decided he must abandon his nation.  His army was to the east, if they were still alive they would be surrounded on all sides by the Mongolians.  So he took what remained of his army and fled to the friendly nation to his west.  He didn’t get far though, it turns out Genghis had been VERY busy.  While two forces closed in from the south and north he had taken the main force of his army around Khwarezm and taken the country to their west.  When the Shah retreated he actually retreated into the main force of Genghis’ army.  This is still widely considered to be greatest surprise attack in history.

In closing I hope you enjoyed what turned out to be a much longer read than I had intended it to be.  The man fascinates me, and I hope you find these things I dug up across the internet to be informative.  I also hope you find something I left out or misstated, so reddit what did I forget?

There are also accounts of entire military divisions armed primarily with firearms used to great effectiveness during the Yuan and Ming dynasties along with stories of Mongols using Chinese guns to aid them in their empire expansions.

Yet, during the age of imperialism, I frequently hear people attribute China's failures in defending itself against European nations to the lack of guns. China fought with spears against muskets. Where did their guns go?

&gt; According to modern historians genuine firearms appeared to have been invented first in China in the 13th century

How were the blades maintained under the wear and tear of battle?  Or, put another way, what would be the typical life of a high-ranking soldier's sword?

I'm thinking that even the finest steel blades would be subject to notches, dents, and gouges in the course of smashing into armor, shields, and other swords.  This makes me think a given sword wouldn't last long in heavy fighting.  OTOH, I imagine such a sword was expensive and took a long time to make.  And I'm not sure how often in a pitched battle one would expect a real blade-to-blade strike that would cause a notch.

So were sword treated like, say, tennis racquets?  Meaning that while expensive and thus expected to be somewhat durable, ultimately disposable for someone like a tour pro, while a random amateur who plays twice a year might use just one for 15 years?  

It may be too many fantasy novels, but it seems like swords were of immense importance to warrior societies.  Is that just a romanticization of what would in reality just have been a tool, or is not crazy to imagine a sword passed down through generations of warriors using it on the field?

So I was reading about certain archeological sites and how experts deduce what type of city it was (port, trade hub, residence) from the relics found. They can also tell how long the city lasted and when it started. Some last a few hundred years, others a few thousand.

Also, ancient texts are studied to get a picture of life back then. 

This led me to wonder if our age will ever be studied in the same manner as those cities. Cities now seem virtually unstoppable and are growing constantly, and made of sturdy materials. Out texts are online, so are our videos and the internet is constantly on.

Given this, will it ever happen that a city like New York will be dug up by some people and people will look at relics and whatever literature there is to construct what happened? Or will they simply download old videos of NY from the internet or whatever? Infact, will a city like NY ever be in ruins?

Not sure if this fits in well in askhistory, as it's asking for some strategic advice, but it could also inspire discussion so here goes.

I'm going to be in a Model UN conference soon in a historical committee emulating Japanese Unification. I'm playing Ii Naomasa, one of Tokugawa's generals. The committee starts in the year 1570, and this seems to be the ""mission"":

&gt;It is your duty to help him [Oda Nobunaga] achieve that goal [unifying Japan] and bring prosperity to the Japanese people.

I was also given these ""questions to consider"":

&gt;1.
Where
should
Oda
Nobunaga
look
to
expand
next?

&gt;2.
Would
it
benefit
Japan
to
be
administered
under
one
ruler?

&gt;3.
What
role
does
religion
play?

&gt;4.
Are
there
any
changes
to
the
economic
or
administrative
systems
that
you
would
like
to
see
implemented?

&gt;5.
Do
you
think
the
Portuguese
should
be
allowed
to
stay
and
is
their
religion
acceptable?

&gt;6.
Do
you
agree
with
the
arming
of
villages?

&gt;7.
What
are
common
Japanese
tactics
and
can
you
devise
your
own?

I'd appreciate any help you can give me on this, and I can answer more about what information I was given. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2sa8i,False,,,True,t3_18dcvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/18dcvl/japanese_unification_questions/,

I guess what I really want to know is if the Germans have made any diplomatic attempts to take back the land or settle their people there.  I'd have to imagine a lot of German people are upset that a land that was, historically, very German and a valuable seaport is being kept from them.  If anyone can give me either a political summary, a Russian or German person's (an East Prussian or Polish person's word on the matter would be a good insight too) opinion of the area, or just the post USSR events of the land, then I would be really grateful.  I assure you that you won't bore me with any amount of reading or lecturing.

I understand that the Russians culturally assimilated the shit out of the areas they acquired after WW2 so the chances of the remaining people in Kaliningrad being even remotely German is unlikely.

This subreddit came to mind immediately, and I went in expecting to read all these amazing facts I wasn't aware of.

I came across this particular post about the Civil War

""There are many myths or misinformation about the American civil war. 

The war was fought over slavery 
Actually many of the Union states still praticied slavery and the Emanicaption Proclamation did not free the slaves in the USA only in the CSA which was a forign country and out of the power of Lincoln. Less then 3 percent of southerners owned slaves it was about as common as owning a lamberguni is today. Besides that nobody would fight for another mans property. The only reason Slavery was mentioned was to justify the war in hopes of keeping Britain and France out of the war. 

The Union army was the ""good guys"" 
Actually the Union terrorized the south by starvation. They burned crops, homes and towns everywhere they went. The US has never treated an invaded land as harshly as they treate the southern states. Sherman's march to the sea left a path of death and destruction on the civilian population. 

The Confederates were racist and should be on the same level as Nazis 
Well in this time period nearly everyone was racist in America. The underground railroad went to Canada not the Union states. Nearly all confederate soldiers were fighting off a forign invasion of their homeland. They where fighting for independence and their right for representation. The South was fighting for the beliefs of our founding fathers that power is derived from the local and state level not an overwhelming central government. 

If the south had won there would still be slavery 
False on multiple accounts. Robert E Lee ( commander of the Confederate Army) would have been the next president and he was an avid abolishinest. Besides that our European trade partners would have strongly encouraged an end to the practice and technology would have phased ou the new for slavery.""

I can describe the kinds of things I'm looking for, but I'm not sure even what I should start Google searching... So here's some of the kinds of things I want to read about:

* When medieval soldiers were storming an enemy fortress, how did they plan for the engagement?  They surely planned ahead farther than just ""let's break through the gates and see what happens after that.""
* How were mounted infantry soldiers used in different points in time (e.g. 1500s vs 1800s)?  What was different? Strategies? Types of horses?
* Given a single ""troop"" of pikemen, why would they choose to, say, form in a row side-by-side instead of in a loose huddle?  Would that troop of pikemen ever leave the rest of their troops and scout out?  What would be the recommended strategy for pikemen who are marching at the bottom of a hill and then find themselves coming under a barrage of arrows.  How would they react?  Would they just have to run?  Would they react differently if they were on a patrol of their own territory vs. if they were invading?

I don't expect any specific answers to any of the above questions (I wouldn't turn them down, though); I was hoping that explains the general idea of the type of things I'm interested in learning about.  

Do the kind of things I asked fit in a single ""area"" of history?  When I search Google for pikemen, e.g., I see some articles that give details about the ""what"", but I feel like I'm not seeing the ""why"".  From the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_(weapon)): 

&gt; The peasant ""pikemen"" armed with these crude instruments played a pivotal role in securing a near impossible victory against a far larger and better equipped Russian army at the Battle of Racławice on April 4 of that year.

Why was it pikemen and not something else, like archers?  For a scenario like that, if you could replace the pikemen with another military troop of that time, would you  have chosen something else?

""The ruler who preceded me did not believe that it was impossible to reach the extremity of the ocean that encircles the earth (meaning the Atlantic). He wanted to reach that (end) and was determined to pursue his plan. So he equipped two hundred boats full of men, and many others full of gold, water and provisions sufficient for several years. He ordered the captain not to return until they had reached the other end of the ocean, or until he had exhausted the provisions and water. So they set out on their journey. They were absent for a long period, and, at last just one boat returned. When questioned the captain replied: 'O Prince, we navigated for a long period, until we saw in the midst of the ocean a great river which flowing massively. My boat was the last one; others were ahead of me, and they were drowned in the great whirlpool and never came out again. I sailed back to escape this current.' But the Sultan would not believe him. He ordered two thousand boats to be equipped for him and his men, and one thousand more for water and provisions. Then he conferred the regency on me for the term of his absence, and departed with his men, never to return nor to give a sign of life.""

Obviously, in the public eye, he had immeasurable power over his people. But in the back chambers of the castle, was he the one with the final say? Did he run the meetings and councils? Or was he just a puppet to his advisors and other people of lesser fame but more relevant importance? 

There must have been Kings more interested in feasting, wine and women than the intricacies of politics and warfare. Were those Kings allowed by their council to make big (and potentially fatal) decisions? By all rights, the King should have the final say. But if the King's an idiot, would his council accept his demands? Or would they calmly and humbly coach him as to why an unacceptable decision is unacceptable? Would they just ignore what the King wanted, ignore his threats?

It seems as though all that power resting on one often sheltered, spoiled young man's shoulders would have been devastating considering the magnitude of the results their decisions may have. 

Of course, the people who could get into the council were *excellent* at gaining political advantages. That's how they got into the councils. It seems to me that they would be the type of people very capable of subtly wresting the power from the King's hands if necessary. It would also probably be better for the nation if a man who was only King because his great-grandfather won a war didn't wield the full reins of power; just because his great-grandfather made a brilliant and respected general, doesn't mean he is automatically good at running a country. The people who truly understood the consequences of power would surely be the ones who advised, ignored, or forced the hand of the King, while the King sat relatively powerless in their midst.

If this is true, then the King was little more than a puppet, a figurehead of imagined power for the public to respect and fear (&amp; loathe while political decisions hurt the poor), while in reality the *council* had the decision-making power. This would allow the council to exist quietly in the background, enjoying a life of wealth and power while reaping none of the consequences (such as infamy, blame, and the threat of one's safety) which inherently come with that kind of power. It's logical.

Of course, because of that last point, it would also be incredibly difficult today to decipher whether or not the King did have the power they are purported to have. The King certainly wouldn't record that fact in writing, and the council are unlikely to, because the point of it was secrecy.

This article by Thomas J. DiLorenzo isn't exactly short, but I feel he leaves out many aspects of the history of **Standard Oil** that makes the article a confirmation for libertarians rather than a persuasion for those less than enthusiastic about capitalism. 

#1) The early part of the history when Rockefeller helps to create the [South Improvement Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Improvement_Company).  The wiki entry seems to be less bias than the [pbs article](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/rockefellers-south/) that is sources from. The wikipedia article describes the following as the contract that Rockefeller, South Improvement Company and the three railroads were creating:

&gt;  The result of these secret negotiations were as follows: (1) The official rate per barrel from Cleveland to New York would be $2.56, but South Improvement would receive a $1.06 rebate; (2) The railroads would also pay South Improvement $1.06 per barrel of oil shipped that was not produced by South; (3) The railroads would also give reports of the shipping destinations, costs, and dates of all of South's competitors; (4) The commerce would be divided evenly among the railroads, with a double share going to Pennsylvania Railroad; and (5) South would provide tank cars and loading facilities. The secret concessions would have helped lessen the ""vicious"" competition among the railroad lines by giving a steady, standardized flow of commerce.

unfortunately this portion of the wikipedia entry doesn't have a source. Was this a common practice? and if so why wouldn't other customers create contracts forbidding their information from being shared? 

Since Rockefeller is being singled out as an example of a non-robber barron in the Mises.org article it seems that these types of occurances during the period of Standard Oil should be addressed and not skipped over. This example is one that many worry about with unfettered freed-markets where they expect collusion, back-door deals, and monopolization would be common and expected. 

#2) The Mises.org article briefly mentions the special trust organization that was used during the Standard Oil dominating years but seemingly credits it for the efficiency in Rockefeller's empire. 

&gt; The mere fact that Standard Oil had organized some thirty separate divisions under one consolidated management structure (a trust) was sufficient reason to label it a monopoly and force the company to break up into a number of smaller units.

&gt; In other words, the organizational structure that was responsible for the company's great efficiencies and decades-long price cutting and product improving was seriously damaged. 

There is no discussion of the effectiveness of this Trust structure anywhere else in the Mises.org article. The [wikipedia entry on Standard Oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_oil) hints at what this trust structure looked like. 

&gt;  Eventually, the state of New Jersey changed its incorporation laws to allow a company to hold shares in other companies in any state. So, in 1899, the Standard Oil Trust, based at 26 Broadway in New York, was legally reborn as a holding company, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (SOCNJ), which held stock in 41 other companies, which controlled other companies, which in turn controlled yet other companies. This conglomerate was seen by the public as all-pervasive, controlled by a select group of directors, and completely unaccountable.

This does not feel like a laissez-faire economic system. I've read more about the trust structure that was used for Standard Oil but at quick look I can't find it in wikipedia. 

**TL;DR:** I don't intend this discussion to defend the actions of the US Government and those that sued using newly created antitrust legislation or Standard Oil. I merely want to understand more about Standard Oil and try to understand why the author of the Mises.org paper skipped some seemingly important historical events that might paint Rockefeller as a ""Robber Barron"".",,False,,t5_2sa8i,False,,,True,t3_1e6nl0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/1e6nl0/standard_oil_truth_about_the_robber_barons/,

For an assignment at my uni I have to write an elaborate analysis of [this US WWII propaganda poster](http://i.imgur.com/lzreQ.jpg).

Of course I'm not asking you to do my assignment for me, but if you feel like I missed anything, please let me know in the comments. Thanks!

I have compiled the following points so far:

1. Black smoke in front of clear sky.
2. Torn American flag hung halfway up the flag pole.
3. The quote is from Lincoln's speech known as 'The Gettysburg Address', adressing the civil war.
4. December 7th is the central date, the Japanese attack on Pearl Habor in 1941.
5. Poster made in 1942 by Allen Russell Saalburg. Printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office. Exact date unknown.

Some points to work on:

- 1 &amp; 2 clearly symbol a defeated U.S. The flag is torn, its halfway up the pole, black smoke. Is this all referring to the same symbolism or am I missing something?

- 'REMEMBER DEC. 7th!' is clearly meant as a resonating slogan, which often plays an important role in propaganda. (O'Shaughnessy)

- How does this quote play in? I'm not familair with Lincoln's speech. What role did this speech play in history? Does it seek to remind the reader of the poster of an important facet of history that is similar to the Pearl Harbor attack?

- What is the direct GOAL of the poster? Recruitment? Or simply to promote nationalism?

I'm no historian, so I might be wrong on certain facts, but I do know that society wasn't always as we know it now.


If I'm not mistaken, there wasn't always huge cities with a population of thousands, especially before the invention of notions such as centralized government, law, or even alphabet (which I believe led to the creation of said law and government). So I suppose that at some times in early societies, small villages with a population of a few hundred people was maybe the norm, and huge cities the exception.


Therefor I was wondering if privacy existed in such circumstances, and if so, in which form. It looks kinda hard to have any privacy in a town where you know (almost) everyone, and you see them (almost) everyday. If I take the example of my ex's parents, they live in a small village of 40 people, and everyone knows almost everything about everyone else.


So I was curious about that. When did the concept of invasion of privacy developed ? When did it became so important to protect that at all cost ? Is this a recent ""invention"" ? Is this a fundamental trait in human race that can be dated back to our roots ?

Yet when you read of earlier rites such as the Eleusinian Mysteries, or devotion to the oracles, it seems they were (at least early on) very serious about their worship. It seems to be the same case with the Egyptians -- early on they were quite sincere. Then as time went on, their religions became more a backdrop for satire, comedy and social commentary.

I am curious, though, about what happens in Western Europe and the Americas with England's fleet utterly defeated in their first battle. As I understand it (with a bit of google/wiki-fu) Phillip II of Spain wanted to depose Elizabeth I as her England was Protestant and his Spain, Catholic. I'm also aware that Spain was THE world superpower in the 16th century, and the defeat of the Armada signified that end, and their replacement by Great Britain. 

So, theoretically speaking, on July 19 1588, Medina Sidonia goes against Phillip II orders and sails the entire Armada (as in the 6 ships were never forced to leave) with the tide into Plymouth Harbor. Despite being outnumbered ~130 to ~200, England is completely trapped. Spain loses only 30 ships while sinking ~100, damaging ~50 more, and capturing most everyone and everything present.

What happens directly after this battle? What actions are taken on both sides? Where does the still-strong fleet go with its prisoners? Afterwords, is England as a whole defeated? Could Spain lose its sea superiority anyway? If Spain maintains their sea superiority, what do the Americas and other English colonies look like with greater Spanish influence? How do France and other European countries respond? Are there any other peoples/countries/empires/whatever that I'm neglecting to mention that would become significantly different?

1360113084.0,1,self.AskHistory,17yx7t,Have conservatives always been in the minority in intellectual circles?,13,12,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/17yx7t/have_conservatives_always_been_in_the_minority_in/,"I've been wondering about this for a while . . . has it always been the case that the intellectual class (artists, writers, political theorists, scientists, etc) within society has largely gravitated to leftist-progressive-liberal attitudes? Have rightist-conservative-illiberal intellectuals always been comparatively few?  Or is this a relatively new phenomenon? 

The current intellectual elite (I mean serious intellectuals, not Michael Moore or Ann Coulter) in the United States is obviously left-leaning, and I get the impression it's like that elsewhere. Go back a few decades anywhere in the West, and in much of the East, and you'd find large numbers of Marxists and quasi-Marxists. Go back even further, and you find anti-monarchists, anti-clericalists, etc. 

Rightist-traditionalist-conservative intellectuals seem to be pretty few and far between at present. At present they're barely visible in American media and culture . . . there are people like David Brooks, Ross Douthat, the folks at [The American Conservative](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/), etc. I can't think of any serious conservative artists or scientists. Go back a few decades and there seems to be similar low visibility . . . there are folks like Burke or the various anti-Marxists, but they seem to have done a lot less to shape their societies and intellectual cultures than the Robespierres and Lenins. There does seem to be conservatism in art and culture in the past, though . . . Nietzsche is traditionally classed as a rightist, as is Wagner, but even then there's a case to be made that the Romantic influence on politics wasn't really left or right, that Romantic movements like fascism were influenced by left and right alike. 

I feel like there has to have been a turn at some point, since intellectuals in the past might also be members of a social elite or clients of the elite, and thus would be likely to hold rightist views. Maybe the emergence of the middle class? Maybe the rise of the Enlightenment? 

And what of the non-Western intellectual world? China, for instance, had liberals, but they were hardly the major intellectual force.",,False,,t5_2sa8i,False,,,True,t3_17yx7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/17yx7t/have_conservatives_always_been_in_the_minority_in/,
