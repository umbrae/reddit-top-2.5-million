My suggestion to your fanbase is find a way to make the Georgia Dome rock like it has never before.  If you were to go back &amp; look at the 49ers game in Seattle week 16, you will see a Colin Kaepernick that was lost, confused, and any other synonym you want to throw in there.  
  
The crowd noise disrupted him, his play call ability, his thinking ability &amp; nullified any athleticism he brought to play.  
  
Good Luck! &amp; Beat the living hell out of the 49ers!

The Falcons were playing the Chargers that weekend, and we were staying at the same hotel they were. Every now and then you would see a sea of black and red come out of the lobby or waiting around the elevators.

The night before the game, another chaperon and I were taking two kids to the bathroom before heading up to the room. It was like maybe 9pm, not late. As we walk through the lobby, one of the kids spots Roddy White sitting at the hotel bar with two other guys. They didn't know it, but one of the other guys was Michael Turner. The third was a staff member. I think he was a trainer. Older bald white guy.

So of course the kid turns to me and says (luckily quietly) ""Hey that's Roddy White! Can we go over there?""

He was clearly starstruck and to be honest, I was going to say no. I didn't want to bother them. Before I had the chance to, the chaperon who was with me (also clearly starstruck, recognizing both White and Turner) said ""Of course!""

They all practically skip to the table. I begrudgingly trudge behind.

When the first of the kids reaches the table, he simply says in one hasted breath, *""Ihopeyouguyswin.""* The second just says ""Roddy White!""

They chuckled. Roddy White made a comment about it being weird that an eleven year old kid knows who he is. When the kids asked for autographs, both happily agreed, but we had nothing of worth for them to sign.

My fellow chaperon suggested signing the kid's shirts (We were all wearing them, we got them from the convention) but Turner said that wouldn't do.

He turned to the trainer and asked him to open his bag. They pulled out two brand new youth sized Atlanta Falcons draft hats, signed them, and then put them on the kids' heads.

""I hope we win too, little man."" White said. Then they shook the kids' hands.

One kid came from a Raiders family, the other a Broncos family. Because of this, however, both of those kids are die-hard Falcons fans to this day.

Looking back, I'm really glad I wasn't the douche who said they couldn't go over.

We played terribly at the start and didn't have the gas at the end to fuel a major come-from-behind victory that we're know for doing. Carolina came to play. Their season is lost and they wanted to make the statement that their record isn't representative of the team's talent, and they did.
We are 11-2, as of week 14. I knew, after locking up the NFC south, that we would drop a couple games at the end of the season. I knew that the Falcons will do what was necessary to lock up the #1 or #2 seed and then start getting in the post-season mind set. The perfect season is gone, and a 11-5 record isn't bad at all. These remaining games have very little importance to what every player in our locker room is hungry for. No one talks about a team's record, after they've won the Super Bowl. The Giants 9-7 record was nothing to celebrate, but their determination and ferocity that they showed in the post-season was what we all attribute to their team now.
Roddy White mentioned, in an interview last week, that Atlanta and Carolina are in two different positions. Carolina is trying to save the rest of their season and prove that they will contend next season, while Atlanta is more focused on making a strong play-off run.
We have NYG next week, at home. You can bet your ass that we will be playing hard ball in this game, because it has meaning. We need to show that we have what it takes to beat a contender. Losing to the 4-9 Panthers is not nearly as bad as losing to a contending team. If we can go into the Dome next weekend and play strongly against the defending champions, we have a shot at building some mad steam for the play-offs. This is one of the games that I expected a lackluster performance. Don't expect to see anything like this against the Giants.
We're where we need to be for the Play-off seeding. After the Giants game, we won't be as concerned with the remaining regular season games as we are with proving the nation wrong and hoisting that Lombardi trophy high above our heads.
Don't let this game instill you with doubt or embarrassment. Every team in the league has lost more games and some even more costly ones, at that. We are the 11-2 Atlanta Falcons. We have the weapons and coaching to get to where we want to be. You know that every player on our roster knows that playing your hardest against a team that has 0 effect on your post-season position is not as ideal as getting in the mindset and position to bring respect and a championship to the Atlanta Falcons.
Grieve until you feel better, but I'm still Rising Up. This is our year. We are the top dog of the NFC, and a force to be reckoned with. We're 2012 NFC South Champs, and it's time to focus on the NFC Championship, and move on to claiming that prestigious prize of being Super Bowl Champions.
Rise the fuck Up, and never lose faith in this team. This team is going to make some noise. Any talking head that disagrees is in for a world of embarrassment when Tony Gonzalez hoists that trophy and brings respect to this organization.",,False,self,t5_2ql17,False,,falcons,True,t3_14knlk,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/14knlk/dont_panicrise_up/,

She is one of the more knowledgeable regulars and actually can have decent conversation about free agents and such. Shocking because she is a middle aged woman. She tells me that she actually worked concessions this past year at the Dome and was showing me some photos on her cell. After scrolling through a few, I see a picture that made my jaw drop.....

Apparently after the NFC Title game, she was told to take a few trays of food down to the locker room to the players. She went in and said there were a few players gathered around Tony G. He was still in his uniform and was crying like a baby. She snapped a quick photo of it and you can see Turner and Roddy sitting beside him with their hands on his back. She said that she was in there about 15 minutes and told me that he was crying and kept saying, ""Man, I just don't want to take it off...."" in reference to his uniform. She told me that Turner kept telling him, ""You don't have to....this is your choice.""

I know its completely terrible internet etiquette to not have said photo posted with but I felt like would be unprofessional to ask her to send me the photo since she was a customer but it crossed my mind.

After hearing the story, it just made me even more excited for the season. It sounded like Tony G had his mind made up that he was retiring but he sees something special in this team. This team is hungry and the team is going to feed on Tony Gs passion and drive for a title. I believe 100% we are going to bring Lombardi to Atlanta this season! Rise Up!

I've been busy the last few years so this was my first trip since the saints SB season. Things have changed drastically. 

These were my seats- http://i.imgur.com/I6kq4.jpg

Not bad at all right? Bought them off stubhub and believe they are from a season ticket holder. Let me preface this with a positive- had a great time in the city last night wearing falcons gear , trash talk, friendly banter but no problems. The Saints fans in our section were ok, couple bad apples got called out. I was with 3 others, we all wore our falcons gear. We cheered for our team and made small talk but were not disrespectful. 

However the fans on the way into the stadium, and when we went into the bathroom and on the way out were the worst I've ever witnessed. I've been to away games in Philly (NFC champ game), Tampa, NYC, and even Foxboro and this was the single worst experience of my life. 

Highlights- 
walk in bathroom, get screamed obscenities , whatever, go to pee in a stall and a guy starts peeing on the floor in the stall next to me trying to get if on me, sayin ""lick my piss falcons"" , almost get into a fight. 

Walking back to seats- big black dude blocks our way saying we are in his house and need to pay the toll. I laugh it off and he's like ""give me your beer"", try to walk past and he knocks full beer out of my hands. I'm just standing there like really and looking for security. Don't see any around so he sits back down and I leave. He's about 4 rows behind me and his group is yelling at us, threatening us, etc. 

We texted the fan behavior to
Report him and that's when things got out of hand. They came to talk to him and left. Things got worse from there. The saints fans next to us apologized and we decided to leave mid 4th quarter ( it wasn't fun anymore and things had gotten heated) 

As we are leaving another saints fans, throws his beer at our group and calls the one girl in our group a cunt. 

We left and are now at the airport. Fuck you saints fans and your pathetic excuse for security. This is a game, and you need to keep your humanity.

Any suggestions or advice? Im wondering if there is a way to file a complaint with the NFL for a franchise not bring able to control their fan base. This is a game, and it has gotten out of hand there.

Every bar in Tokyo was claimed by multiple army platoons or marine platoons or whatever the equivalent is for sailors and airmen.  There would always be different groups of US servicemen in the same bar.

If a fight broke out between a sailor and an airman, say, or between a soldier and a marine, it quickly turned into a free-for-all.

If a fight broke out between a sailor and a marine, though, that was different.  All the other sailors and marines would gather around and let the two combatants fight it out.  And if anybody from the other two branches of the service tried to horn in, the sailors and marines standing around would gang up on whoever was intruding.  Because a fight between a sailor and a marine is a *family* matter.

And I don't know how true that is.  He might be pulling my leg.  But even if he was, the scenario he describes pretty much sums up how I feel about the Falcons.

I'm mainly talking about those marginally big plays, 15yd+ plus plays. You *rarely* see a Falcons' offensive play maker get up after achieving a first down and perform some type of self-indulged first down/big yard celebration. 

I know we all noticed how awful Carolina was about celebrating on a lot of their first downs (especially if it was Cam running the ball). I saw Woodhead from NE do this a few times yesterday with his awkward slow walk, then the signal forward for a first down. Of course I can't forget about Jimmy Graham, that guy seems to make it known every time he puts his shoes on without help.

All of that being said, the majority of the time the Falcons' just seem to get up and toss the ball to the ref, or just return to the huddle. They seem to save it for the touchdown, which is expected/sensible. They're playing this season with such a quiet confidence and I think it really makes our team look like the real deal when they're not out there running around like a bunch of clowns after every first down.

After moving to America, I never had interest in football. Only time I would watch a game would've been a super bowl. Even then, I would watch it for the funny commercials and BBQ. It was really hard getting into Football because being in LA with no Pro football team makes it very hard to be hyped up about the game itself.

For about first 10 years of my life in Los Angeles, I was team-less.

My close cousin moved out to Atlanta, GA while ago. When I was visiting him about 4 years ago, he gave me a present. It had big number 2 on the back and ""Ryan"". I thought it was someone's first name. My cousin explained that to me that Matt Ryan is Atlanta Falcon's QB. I asked him if he's good. He said, ""so so"" (he was still suffering from Michael Vick incident)

When I came back to LA, I naturally became Falcons fan. Since then, I've been the very few Falcons fan in LA, and of course none of my friends were. With lack of football knowledge and experience, I wasn't really a 'loud fan' of Falcons. I watched few games every season, but never really got into it. It's hard to fully engage with the team, when my emotion wasn't really there.

Before this season started, I got pumped. When this season's schedule came out, I noticed that Falcons were coming to Southern California to play San Diego Chargers. I saved up as much money as possible and got a pair of tickets to watch Falcons rise up in Southern California. (I took  my die hard Chargers fan friend.) It was awesome. I was surrounded by many Falcons fan, cheering their heart out. It was freaking hot, and I was mess. But the intensity of all Falcons fan and their energy just kept me going. On top of all that, the boys played an amazing game. 

This sure was a big turning point for my relationship with Falcons. 
Only at this moment, I could honestly say that I was Falcons fan and loved Falcons.

This season was great. We did have ups and downs, but at the end we came up on top. Maybe it's because I live in West Coast, but I was very troubled by how little attention Falcons was getting. It didn't matter how great we played, how we prevailed tough times, how we have an awesome kicker who saved our asses multiple times, how our QB made some clutch TD throws, how our receivers were catching impossible passes, it just didn't seem to matter. 

It sucked big times.

But I found refugee in this sub-reddit. I talked with my cousin quite often, and cheer each other up. 

ATL fans, you guys are awesome. Even out here in west coast, we recognize each other quick. Whenever someone saw my Falcons hat or jersey, they always came up to me and say ""rise up!"". The positive energy and support for our team is just admirable (compare to millions of Lakers fan in LA).

So, Thank you.
Thank you, Falcons. for an amazing season. Yes, we lost, but we fought hard.
Thank you, fans.  For being one of the best group of fans any professional sports team can have.
Thank you, Falcons sub-reddit. For keeping me in good spirit and being there for each other.

Next season, we will rise up for sure. Higher than this season.

Anyway, with the pickup of S. Jax and Tony returning this year I'm just way too freakin anxious for the season to start up again.

I remember when I first started watching football back in 2004 when Vick started(only because my dad turned on the fox channel and I had never watched football before). My 13 year old mind thought, this is pretty damn cool! When the Falcons swithced to the red jerseys as the default uniform.

Oh god dont remind me of the ***lost*** season either... 2007? ugh. Asshole Bobby Petrino. I hated him so fucking much.

Wow, I was rambling. Sorry I was drinking and got carried away. but the point is, I love my beloved Atlanta Falcons. Every game is almost life or death for me, haha.

1363371144.0,43,self.falcons,1ad2kl,ESPN Insider: How Steven Jackson helps Atlanta (in case anybody wants to read),48,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1ad2kl/espn_insider_how_steven_jackson_helps_atlanta_in/,"The release of Michael Turner last week confirmed what anyone with eyes knew: The Atlanta Falcons needed a new bell cow in their backfield. After finishing 29th in rushing DVOA in 2012, Atlanta had to replace Turner, who had morphed from a punishing back to a dump truck incapable of getting any burst over the past few seasons. (DVOA is Football Outsiders' defense-adjusted value over average metric, explained here.) Turner ranked 37th out of 43 backs by DVOA, and was saved from ranking worse only by the fact that the Falcons gave more of his carries to Jacquizz Rodgers over the second half of the season, spotting Turner extra rest and more favorable situations.

To fix this problem, the Falcons have reportedly signed Steven Jackson to a three-year contract. How will he upgrade Atlanta's offense?

The interesting thing about the direction the Falcons chose to go in was that they did the exact opposite of what they did in acquiring Turner in the first place. When general manager Thomas Dimitroff signed Turner in free agency prior to the 2008 season, he was a relative unknown as LaDainian Tomlinson's backup in San Diego. Turner had never had as many as 80 carries in a season. In Jackson, the Falcons have landed a workhorse back who hasn't had fewer than 230 carries since his rookie season. Signing Jackson to a three-year deal is an illustration of the shifting economics at play in the NFL -- teams are much more aware of the relative importance of a running back than they once were, and that helped drag down Jackson's price to the point where Atlanta could afford to take a chance on him.

Let's set the record straight: Jackson is not the player he once was, but he's still a very solid running back. Some reasons to be a little wary about this deal include the fact that he'll be 30 before the season starts, and that he has seen his carries and catches decline each of the past two years. Most telling has been the huge decline in his broken tackles since the 2009 season. He broke 50 tackles that year, 28 in 2010, 20 in 2011 and 19 in 2012. His burst has mostly remained intact, but old running backs tend to crater fast, and there is a good chance that he declines like Turner did before him.

However, from a scouting perspective, Jackson should be an ideal fit in Atlanta's offense next season. He's used to running from the single-back sets that the Falcons prefer to run, and he has worked hard to become a solid pass-catching back out of the backfield, so he won't have to be replaced by Rodgers if Atlanta goes into a hurry-up offense or is running a two-minute drill. Jackson had negative DVOAs in 2010 and 2011, but under Jeff Fisher in 2012 he bounced back to a 5.3 percent DVOA, which was 11th among qualifying backs. Rodgers would likely return to more of a secondary role, though he wouldn't necessarily have to lose many carries because (a) the Falcons could cut Jason Snelling out of the pecking order and (b) the Falcons could conceivably run the ball more if they are trying to bleed more clock next season. Rodgers' skill set calls for that sort of role anyway, and he could still play a defined role on third downs with his 25.7 percent receiving DVOA, which was fourth among running backs last year.

Moreover, Atlanta's biggest weakness last season was its red zone rushing attack. The Falcons finished with the fifth-worst rushing DVOA in the red zone, at minus-21.2 percent DVOA, and 18 of their 37 carries in goal-to-go situations went for zero or negative yards. Jackson actually got better in the red zone last season, improving to an 8.2 percent DVOA. While he has been fairly up-and-down with this over the course of his career, he should still be a big improvement over Turner and the ground game that had trouble getting an inch last season.

Jackson is not going to be a superstar. And he's probably not going to rush for 1,500 yards again. But on a team with Matt Ryan, Roddy White, Tony Gonzalez and Julio Jones, he's going to get a chance to be the player whom defenses forget about. The Falcons shouldn't go emphasizing a ground game with Jackson over their star-studded passing attack, but his addition will make their offense much more well-rounded, and should provide benefits in the playoffs and in the red zone by letting the Falcons stay balanced.",,False,self,t5_2ql17,False,,falcons,True,t3_1ad2kl,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1ad2kl/espn_insider_how_steven_jackson_helps_atlanta_in/,

I've been a lifelong Braves fan, and my natural affinity has always been towards all Atlanta teams, though I never really payed much attention. A few years ago a friend of mine started a fantasy football league and that caused me to watch the NFL compulsively, and that caused me to pay attention to the Falcons every week. I followed closely this year and was basically running around my house screaming after the Seattle game. I have a couple of friends who are season ticket holders, and convinced me to spend money I didn't really have to buy a ticket and come to the game. I did, and it has completely changed my outlook on football. I'll admit that the atmosphere at SEC games is loud, raucous and daunting, but it's not the same. I felt connected to every fan in the Dome yesterday in a way I've never felt before. The atmosphere both inside and outside the stadium was phenomenal and in my opinion, without compare (I was at the SEC CG this year). I can only hope that this Spring I get a job closer to the city (I'm 7 hours away now) so that I can become a season ticket holder. Either way, I'm a different football fan now, and damn proud of it.

1348789359.0,36,self.falcons,10labc,Looking back at the 2008 NFL Draft,41,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10labc/looking_back_at_the_2008_nfl_draft/,"I'm sure this has been done to death, but it fully registered with me today. It's no secret that following the 2007 season, the Falcons were in dire straits as a franchise. We fired Jim Mora, Jr. We hired Bobby Petrino, who quit with three games left in the season. We went 4-12 after a patchwork of quarterbacks that included Joey Harrington, Byron Leftwich, and Chris Redman took the field for us. Why? Because our franchise quarterback got arrested and sent to jail for two years. 

We lost defensive anchor Pat Kerney to the Seattle Seahawks, but we were able to bring in Ovie Mughelli and Joe Horn to help the offense out. The problem was that we couldn't find a head coach. We were linked to, then rebuffed by, several candidates, and were slipping further and further into laughingstock territory. Along the way, though, we landed Thomas Dimitroff, the former director of Patriots scouting, as our new general manager. Mike Smith, defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, was named head coach. Mike Mularkey, former head coach for the Bills, would be our offensive coordinator. It indicated that there was about to be a culture change. 

On February 15, TE Alge Crumpler, QB Byron Leftwich, T Wayne Gandy, CB Lewis Sanders, WR Jamin Elliott, LB Marcus Wilkins and DT Rod Coleman were all released. Some had openly supported Vick, some were in decline, and all retained the stench of the previous season. More releases would come, but this was the first sign that the culture in the Atlanta Falcons locker room was about to change. 

Going into the draft, there was a three way tie between Atlanta, Oakland, and Kansas City for the #3 pick. It came down to a coin flip. The Falcons won, maybe the first real lucky break they had caught in 18 months. There was serious debate between Matt Ryan, a quarterback out of Boston College, and Glenn Dorsey, a defensive end out of LSU. When I say serious debate, I mean experts were split down the middle. Unable to resist the lure of a potential franchise quarterback, the Falcons selected Matt Ryan. It turned out to be a good choice. To date, Glenn Dorsey has recorded 237 tackles, with only 4 sacks, and 1 forced fumble in 65 games. 

The fun didn't stop there, though. Here's a list of the significant pieces the Falcons added in the 2008 draft:

Matt Ryan, QB

Sam Baker: A talented but frustrating LT who has started 44 games for the Falcons and continues to improve marginally.

Curtis Lofton: A 4 year presence at linebacker for the Falcons who racked up three consecutive 100+ tackle seasons.

Harry Douglas: A slot receiver in his fourth active season with the Falcons, who appears to be realizing some of his much talked about potential.

Thomas DeCoud: A starting safety with 11 INT's and 4 forced fumbles in 61 career games with Atlanta, and flourishing under Mike Nolan.

Kroy Biermann: Has appeared in every game since the Falcons drafted him, and has become a key part of the defensive line rotation.

That's five key players, four of whom are still with us. One of them happens to be a franchise quarterback. The Falcons turned things around unbelievably quickly, going 11-5 the following year. Under Dimitroff, the Falcons have drafted well (Julio Jones) and signed valuable free agents (Tony Gonzalez). The draft could have played out much differently, though. 

When Matt Ryan was taken in the first round, there was the debate about Glenn Dorsey raging. Darren McFadden and Vernon Gholston were also both high on everyone's list of college prospects. 

The Falcons traded up to get Sam Baker. Had they not pulled the trigger on that trade, they would have had three second round picks. The players chosen with the two picks they traded were Devin Thomas, WR and John Carlson, TE. They used their remaining second round pick on Curtis Lofton, but future NFL starters Tracy Porter, Ray Rice, Matt Forte, and Jamaal Charles remained on the board. Also, had they not selected Matt Ryan at QB in the first round, options such as Brian Brohm and Chad Henne were available.

The only other team that had an even comparable draft in hindsight were the Baltimore Ravens, drafting Flacco and Rice in the first two rounds. All said, I'm glad things broke the way they did for us and that the decisions that were made were the ones made. If the 2008 draft isn't the high point in Falcons history, it's in the top 3 easily.

He did so much for the Rams, it's really hard to convey how important he truly was. Over the last decade when you would think Rams, the only positive you could come up with was Steven. 



I want to show you these two plays from the Week 11 tie game against the 49ers last year (I use these because fuck the 49ers). [Here he is going the extra mile to get the first down with Patrick Willis on his back the whole time.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mive23kPM-E)
[Later in the game we were trailing 21-17 when Steven delivered this incredible block allowing Bradford the TD pass to Pettis.](http://www.abload.de/img/stuff-willhapkb.gif) Last season the Rams were kryptonite to the 49ers and I hope Steven brings that trait with him to the Falcons.


Looking forward forward to seeing you guys in week 2, and then hopefully in the post season (fingers crossed.)

Not only did they beat a hot Saints and Giants team, the defense confused the Manning brothers and Brees. The defense, with the exception of Grimes, is the healthy for the first time since week 12. Moore, leading the team in tackles when he went down, coming back is huge.

The Seahawks haven't faced a group like White, Jones, Gonzalez and Douglas. Turner is healthy and fresh, first time in playoffs he won't be hurt, and the Falcons have been very effective in the screen game. The Falcons offensive success will force the Seahawks to change their offensive scheme from a read option to a more typical pass offense.

The Falcons average 18.7 a game, but on average, the opponents they have faced score 23 PPG, meaning that on average they held their opponents 4.3 points below their standard PPG. 

SF averages 17.1, but the opponents they have faced score on average 22.8 a game, meaning SF holds their opponents to 5.7 less than their average scores. 

Atlanta scores 26.2 per game, should the Niners hold them like they have their average opponent, Atlanta will score 20.5. 

San Fransisco scores 24.8 per game, should Atlanta hold them like they have their average opponent, San Fransisco will score 20.5.

First of all, a Vikings win guarantees us a matchup for Sunday the 13th with the Falcons. This would give us more time to prepare for the game, as we know that Vikings are the lowest seed. I feel confident that we can beat the Vikings as most of their attack comes on the run. I know we can stop Christan Ponder if we needed to, and we know that we can shut down any QB.. aka Drew Bree's 5 INT night, Peyton Manning, the list goes on and on.

Second of all, it comes out as a good chance for us to win. I know we shouldn't take anything for granted, but playing the Seahawks would be difficult as it is, and the Redskins are on fire. A team like Minnesota would be prime for the Falcons to exploit. This could be the potential matchup we have been waiting for years. 

All in all, I think the Falcons would fare best with the Vikings as it would be the lowest seed. The Vikings present more of a running challenge than a passing one. The Minnesota secondary hasn't been fantastic, and I think Ryan has the firepower to torch it. I know this is biased, but I think it'd be a great matchup for the Falcons.

He basically said that the Atlanta Falcons are Gods team. Jesus has chosen the Falcons to be the greatest team in the world and that his ""God given talent"" is not being used by ""Owner Blank"". He said he can motivate NFL players better than any coach. He went on to say that Jesus died on the cross at age 33....we went to Super Bowl 33. There are 66 books in the Bible.....we were founded in 19....wait for it....66. He also stated that he has personal coversations with Roddy White and Matt Ryan in the locker rooms.

I've heard it all.  ""We are 9-1 be happy!"" and ""You aren't a real fan just shut up already!"" and ""We are the best team in the league!"" an d""A win is a win!"".  Seriously, I've heard it all.  

I'm tired of this crap.  Seriously.  I'm tired of watching this team barely play to the skill level of our opponent.  Was Mularkey calling the plays against Arizona?  Are we going to run the ball at all?

I'm tired of my blood pressure boiling watching this offense.  An offense that should make ANY defense in the league shake in their little space boots.  An offense that should, literally, give defenses nightmares.  White, Jones, Gonzales, Ryan,....Turner?  What the hell is wrong with this anemic team that can't string a damn thing together?

There are 30 other NFL teams that would have clobber-knockered us yesterday.  We could easily be sitting at a 5-5 record this year.  Does ANYONE else not see what's happening?  2008?  2010?  2011?  ANYONE?  This is the EXACT same thing.  We have great records stemming from a soft schedule only to be sucker-punched in the first game of the playoffs.  

I'm a Falcons fan 'til I die.  I've sat through a Superbowl loss, A Joey Harrington led season, a coach jumping ship, a 13-3 season.  There is nothing that can make me stop being a Falcons fan and that's why I am so pissed off.  I have missed maybe 2 games in the past 4 years.  I watch this team every weekend.  I don't pretend I don't see the problems and you can't either.  This team has real issues, and while we are virtual locks for the playoffs, this team is going nowhere once we get there.

Something has to be done and it has to be done fast.  Line play on both sides of the ball has to improve (it won't.  We haven't had a D-line for 5+ years, why would we all of the sudden have one now?), we have to find a run game (we might), we need to tackle (we won't), and we need to stop the run (we might).  

I apologize for the rant, and I expect it to be downvoted.  I don't care.  I'm just so tired of seeing this team play at extreme levels below what they are capable of.  I want to believe this team will make, and win, the Super Bowl.  As a fan that watches every play of every game we have, I'm being realistic.  We aren't going to get it done.  

I'm not going to act like we are the best team.  I'm preparing myself for the worst, so anything else is a pleasant surprise.  Here's to hoping Smith and Thomas Dimitroff prove me wrong and get this team playing at the elite level they are capable of.",,False,self,t5_2ql17,False,,falcons,True,t3_13gaeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/13gaeq/mentally_preparing_myself_for_another_one_and/,
1353046971.0,25,self.falcons,13acrv,Can we shape up a bit?,33,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/13acrv/can_we_shape_up_a_bit/,"I just wanted to openly discuss something I've seen in the past couple weeks here. /r/falcons has never been a big subreddit, probably one of the smallest NFL subreddits out there. It means that there are fewer posts and comments, but better conversations with users you can recognize.

We're 8-1 to start the season-our best start ever. Ever. With the victories, I'm sure the number of users in here has risen. I've also seen it at thefalcoholic with ""long time lurker, first time poster."" We're winning games, and we're going to get bandwagon fans. More people supporting the team, more people out on /r/nfl with falcon flair. That can be good, but it can also be bad. There are a couple things I want to discuss right now.

1. The media. 

I know that Atlanta isn't getting the publicity a team like the Packers would be getting if they were 8-1. In the beginning of the season, I don't think we were getting enough respect from analysts and the media. But as of now, I think we're doing fine. It's a lot better than it was. I'm seeing segments and commercials with Roddy, Ryan, even Douglas. And other people see that too. So when fans are saying that we don't get enough airtime, other people are starting to think that we're just whiny complainers. For now, just keep quiet like the players are doing, and let their play do the talking.

2. Saints rivalry.

These teams have always been rivals, but it's been getting heated in the past five or so years. These teams have both been winning games recently, which means better rivalry games. Two top ten quarterbacks, overtimes, 4th and 1's, it doesn't get much better than this. 

I know it stung losing our first game of the season. Especially considering it was our biggest rival. But we cannot wallow in it. We can't take every opportunity we get to talk about last weeks game and bash them. Bringing it up gets old. Bringing up how nasty they've been since Katrina gets old. Same for the bounty system. Part of it's true, I've been on the receiving end from riled up Saints fans. But some have also been respectful. We cannot start calling out these guys just because they started it. It's just stupid, no matter how big this rivalry is. People see this too. The last thing I want is to be considered part of a disrespectful, arrogant fanbase.

Since Vick left, the team has been put in the best position of franchise history. It hasn't just been talent though. When do you see Matt Ryan say the wrong thing? When has Mike Smith pulled a Rex Ryan? Our team is full of smart, hard working players that the organization has decided to keep around instead of pure athleticism. I think we as fans need to follow suit. I am damn proud of how far the Falcons have come in just the last 5 years, and I want to be proud of the fanbase as well.


Just to make my point clear, whenever you post something on /r/falcons, or /r/nfl, realize everybody else on the other 31 teams view you as a representative of the Atlanta Falcons. Keep that in mind.

Giant fan here with good news for you!,28,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/14m0pt/hey_rfalcons_giant_fan_here_with_good_news_for_you/,"NY Expat living in ATL reporting in.  Love the Falcons, except for this week.  I've been here for nearly 10 years now, and it's been fun to watch the team get built.  I've never seen a fan base so unhappy about an 11-2 record before, it's kinda funny.  

Anyways, I thought I'd drop in and give you something to look forward to this weekend.

1.  We're not totally desperate yet.  We still have the division lead, and while our backs are up against the wall for sure, we're not losing the division yet, so you might get a respite from the desperate Giants everyone fears so much.  We're not really good at putting two great offensive games together, so I wouldn't expect us to come out and have a great offensive game.  Our defense was pretty shitty yesterday, with the exception of some great turnovers, and that's been about par for the course for us this year.

2.  This week will be a great time to get your running game going again.  Turner, Quiz, anyone really.  We can't stop anyone on the ground without our #1 safety Kenny Phillips healthy.  Without him, we can't do our 3 safety look nearly as well, and the run defense suffers greatly from it.

3.  Pass the football too!  We suck equally at defending the pass.  Really, just throw the ball to whoever is up against Corey Webster, and you'll be fine.  Especially if you try for really long passes.  We're spectacularly inept at defending those plays.  You have the horses.  I'm fearful.

Along with those blessings for you, a word of advice.

1.  Don't turn the ball over.  We've been pretty good at turning those events into points, so try and hold onto the ball.

2.  Special teams.  Holy cow, we've got a kick returner now.  Make sure and tackle him, or better yet, kick the ball through the endzone.

3.  Don't be winning by less than 8 with under two minutes to go and punt to us.  As good as Matt Ryan is in those situations, Eli loves it.  But you knew that already.

4.  We might have a running back.  We're not sure yet, but Wilson had a great game yesterday, and will surely get some more carries this week.  So, be aware of him.  He also has a fumble problem that everyone is convinced he has fixed, but you know...probably not.  Also, he can't pass block for shit, so if he's in there, we're probably running, or throwing quick slants.

5.  Nicks is getting healthy.  You should double him and leave Cruz 1-on-1 with whoever.  Disregard our #3 completely because Eli shouldn't be using him at all.

6.  Black unicorn.  Cover him too.  


One special warning.  There is no way to break down the Giants play on the field.  They are completely inconsistent and are a different team each week.  Different strengths, different weaknesses, different attitude, different everything pretty much.  You could beat us by 50 or we could shut you out.  You never know, and that's what makes the games so incredibly hard to watch as a Giant fan.

I will be attending this game from a Suite, which is sweet.  I've got a parking pass to the red international deck.  Sounds covered, anyone know if you can BBQ on that deck?

If you have any requests for new ones, please reply to this thread with the picture you think would be good.  Please upvote this for visibility.  As this is a self post I gain no karma.

To use them put brackets like this   []
and then directly after put the code for whichever face you want to use (its just like making a link but you use the picture you want as the link).  You can also add alt text to a comment face like this :


(/matt ""Are you kidding me?"") makes [](/matt ""Are you kidding me?"")

It was a little scary, right? Well, I'm here to tell you that it was absolutely the right decision. Here's why:

With the sixth pick, we nabbed Julio Jones. Cleveland dropped down to our 27th pick, added two picks in the 2011 draft, and two picks in the 2012 draft. Here's how that went:

2011 #27 overall: Phillip Taylor, DT. 59 tackles, 4 sacks, 1 FF, and started 2012 on the PUP list.

2011 #59 overall: Greg Little, WR. A total of 75 catches, 878 yards, lots of drops, and an attitude problem through 22 games.

2011 #124 overall: Owen Marcacic, FB. He's a fullback. Has appeared in 14 games.

2012 #22 overall: Brandon Weeden, QB. Jury is still out, but personally I'd rather have Colt McCoy under center if I'm a Cleveland fan. Also, a 29 year old rookie QB for a dynamic vertical threat WR? I'll make that trade straight up every time if I get the WR.

2012 #118 overall: Traded to the Vikings. Jarius Wright, WR. Had a big game with six catches, 122 yards, and a touchdown in week 4....of the preseason. Yet to catch a pass this season. 

So if Cleveland called and offered Brandon Weeden, Phillip Taylor, Greg Little, and Owen Marcacic for Julio Jones, would the Falcons even listen? For a second? Would the sentence even be completed before Dimitroff hung up the phone? 

Even if we had held on to the first round pick for 2012, impact options would have been limited at the #22 spot. Courtney Upshaw, Donta Hightower, Coby Fleener, David DeCastro, and Kevin Zeitler were all on the board but I can't say that I'm heartbroken that we didn't get any of those guys. 

Now, I'm not sure a lot of people were questioning this trade to begin with, at least within our fan base. I have had people question me, though, about whether or not I thought we gave up too much to get him.

He disappeared in the last 6 games of the season.",28,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1ebco2/guys_i_love_the_predator_as_much_as_you_but_dont/,"I love John Abraham as much as the next. He was my favorite player when I first following the Falcons when I began to watch football. I just turned 23 and I started the 2009 season. I had to teach my self the rules by watching the game and asking friends. As the only guy in the house and my father never watching a game it took me forever to get into it. So it's a tad more special for me. 


But let's be honest. Abe is old. And yes he did have 10 sacks. But what you don't know is that number is inflated. 3 came from the Oakland game alone. 30% came in one game agains the ***Raiders***. And 2 came against *Arizona*. That's 20%. So 50% of Abe's sacks came against less than stellar teams.

 In the last 4 Games: Carolina, New York, NO, TB. He recorded 0. I repeat zero sacks. And you can't blame injury, that happened in TB. Last game.

In the last 6 games of the season he had 1 sack and that was against NO.


And he also had 0 in the postseason. But I'm not really counting that because of the injury.

EDIT: Forgot to cite my source [John Abraham](http://www.nfl.com/player/johnabraham/2504171/gamelogs)
EDIT2: Oh, and 60% of his sacks came before the bye week. 0 against teams with winning records Washington and Denver

Since the season began, Subscriptions have doubled from around 800 to the current 2,016.  Not only that, but traffic has [skyrocketed](http://i.imgur.com/Ue9Mr.jpg). Last month alone we had almost 80,000 page views.  What that means is /r/falcons has become more active than ever.  

Take a look back at some of the more memorable posts and moments from the regular season:



* [The spectacular throw from week 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10q6au/what_a_throw/)

* [And the now somewhat infamous GIF that came out of the aftermath](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10q635/matt_ryan_says/)

* [5-0 for the first time in franchise history!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/113nd3/50_for_the_first_time_in_franchise_history/) 

* [Julio gets his first milestone](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/14y7xz/julio_jones_first_1000_yard_season/)

* [Locking up the division in November](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1468ip/the_falcons_are_nfc_south_champions/)

* [And of course the Double Spoon](http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/10274p/the_double_spoooon/)

If you have any other posts that help tell the story of /r/falcons in 2012 and the Falcons season as a whole, post them here.

And finally, I believe I speak for the entire mod team when I say ""Thank you"".

I expect the defense to possibly even improve on the red zone stops next season.

Looking at our roster, we addressed the CB issues early in the draft which was expected. DE upgrade with Osi and draft. However we haven't added any viable depth to DT or LB (even only a few college free agent signings), but I think what's even more interesting are the picks spent on 2 safeties in the 7th round. My guess is that, based on Vernon Davis gashing us (NFC title game) with catches running up the seam, we will feature a more 4-2-5 look now, with DBs moving all over the place as hybrids. Also trying to generate more interceptions but trying to contain qbs and having DBs all over (Broncos game). 


I'm excited to see how this plays out, but I also fear a large outside running attack destroying us if we don't tackle well (THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR) and blown coverages (Dunta  always gave such large cushions, I hope our new CBs don't), anyone else have thoughts?

The Falcons deserve better than this. ,21,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/obs70/seriously_guys_the_falcons_deserve_better_than/,"In response to the video of that ""fan"" and all the hate the birds have been getting on here lately, let me first say that I hate this guy and all the ""fans"" like him. I've loved the birds since the early 80's. I have stuck with the team through the bad years. Which lets face it, were almost all of them. The last four years, while heartbreaking at times, have been great. Mike Smith and Matt Ryan have taken a team that has **NEVER** won back to back seasons and has had four winning seasons in a row. That alone is reason enough to not turn on them like this guy has done. 

While I don't agree with the style of defense that BVG has been running and while I don't like the fact that we gave so much for Julio Jones rather than beefing up our weak sauce O line, the fact remains we had *another* winning season.

Moving forward. Here is what I'd like to see: Mike Smith come out and admit that we gave too much for Jones. I'd like to see him be honest with the fact that we need to beef up our O line and that this, plus fixing our Defense is not going to be an easy task and may take a few seasons. I would like to see him organize the team in the way that the Pats, Packers and Saints are organized. I want to see our players working together on and off the field. When they say that they believe in our team we should all know it. I want each and every Falcon to have the same passion in their eyes and voice that Samuel L Jackson has when he speaks about his love for our team. Mike Smith has to do this if we want to win and I know he can. 

Bottom line, I believe in Mike Smith, Arthur Blank and the Atlanta Falcons. I think we have a bunch of talent and that we can be top contenders with a few minor adjustments. So don't give up hope Atlanta. The team needs us and who would we be if we abandoned them now?

(Re-posted from my comment on r/NFL 32 Greatest Players in 32 days thread)
I would argue that Matt Ryan is better for Atlanta than Deion was. Sure, Deion put the Falcons on ""Primetime"", but he didn't stay too long, and did his best work elsewhere. 
Matt, on the other hand, came into the organization at arguably the worst time in team history. We flat out cut some productive talent on the roster that year (Deangelo, Alge, Dunn, etc.), and everyone still pegged us as the worst team in the league and predicted a dismal 1-15 record for us that year. 
What did Matt Ryan do? He put his head down and got to work, and since then he's broken single season records for Att, Comp, Yds, TDs, Comp. Pct, he's the highest rated passer in the history of the team, and has a chance to break career franchise records for Att, Comp, and Yds in only his 6th season (records Bartkowski set in a 10 yr Falcon tenure). Not to mention he's taken us to the playoffs 4 out of 5 years (BTW we've only been to the playoffs 12 times), all while recording back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history 2.5 times over. He's orchestrated 22 game winning drives in the 4th qtr or overtime, the most by any QB in his 1st 5 years, and has the best regular season record by a QB in his 1st 5. He has notched wins vs 28 of the other 31 teams in the NFL, and is undefeated vs. 19 teams in the regular season. 
Bottom line. He's the best player on the team during the most successful run in team history. That's why he's the greatest IMHO",,False,self,t5_2ql17,1363982483.0,,matty,True,t3_1athdc,http://www.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/1athdc/my_argument_for_matt_ryan_being_the_best_player/,

Also, Mike Nolan has been as good as advertised. Any coordinator who can draw up a game plan that can confuse Peyton Manning really knows what he's doing.

2 requirements - No mobile devices and must use Chrome

Download an extension called Hola Unblocker. Go to gamepass.nfl.com. Once there, click on the extension up top (flame head guy) and change the country to Netherlands. It will refresh your page and all games will be available. Click on the game you want to watch and it will open an address. Copy and paste that into a new tab. Once you do that, change the country back to US....and the game will start playing. 

They have EVERY game live. Preseason, Regular Season, Playoffs, and Superbowl. You can go back and watch every game thats been played since 2009. It gives you DVR features as well like pause, rewind, and fast forward. Its the most amazing thing.

I know some of you guys live abroad and never catch a game or some of you live in other markets that rarely show the Falcons. Here is your way to watch it on your computer.

If you have any questions, id be happy to help. It really does work, I am watching the Chiefs game from last week as I type this.

**EDIT** - I closed my browsers and disabled Hola Unblocker and went back to gamepass.nfl.com to do a walkthrough with photos and [this](http://imgur.com/tMopZHR) is what I saw.

I went to the Falcons Week 17 game and the atmosphere in the Dome was...shall I say...lacking. Lots of empty seats, and a general malaise in the air, with halfhearted attempts at making noise on third down at best. 

Now, I went to the Skins/Seahawks game the other day, and THAT was loud. A packed house in an open-air stadium with no fancy overhangs or anything like Seattle has, and the crowd was consistently louder on 1st down than the Dome was on 3rd. It didn't decide the game in the end, but Seattle certainly looked uncomfortable on offense for most of the first half.

I know the Dome can get louder than Landover can for sure, and as loud as Seattle gets, they're real quiet when the Seahawks are on offense. Bring drums, cymbals, horns, vuvuzelas, I don't care. Shout until you're hoarse, because if we win, you can point to your lack of voice with pride on Monday, and if we lose, you'll have nothing to be ashamed of and you won't want to talk to anyone on Monday anyways.

For the past two years I've been the representative for the Falcons in the NFL Power rankings that /r/nfl performs every week during the NFL regular season. I have a lot on my plate right now and would like to pass the torch to one of you to lighten my responsibilities.

For those of you not familiar with the power rankings, I will give you a little bit of a summary. Each NFL team has a representative in /r/nfl, and all of those representatives congregate in a private subreddit. There, each representative ranks the 32 NFL teams each week, and all power ranker rankings are compiled into a master ranking. Each representative is also responsible for providing a short blurb (2-6 sentences on average I would imagine) each week during the regular season mentioning the state of their team. The results are posted to /r/nfl for all to discuss.

These are the basics. Feel free to volunteer in this thread by stating your interest and why you would be a good representative for the Falcons, and after 2 or 3 days I will choose who I think would represent us best. For those of you familiar with Reddit Enhancement Suite, it tracks how many net upvotes you've given each person. Perhaps that will be one of the major things I will note in choosing.

Whomever is chosen, I'll be sure to help guide you along on what to do for the first little while, and/or you can seek help from your (future) fellow power rankers. It can be a fun experience talking football with that group of people, and I think whomever is chosen will enjoy it.

Edit: I'm going to hand over the responsibilities to someone ~~tomorrow (Friday, August 17)~~ today (Saturday, August 18). Once I choose someone, I will make note of it here. So, if you're interested, there's still time to throw your name in for consideration.

Edit #2: Mattyice318 has been chosen to represent us. This will sound cliche, but I mean it when I say I wanted to choose all of you, but there can only be one. Mattyice318 has the 2nd highest upvotes from me (of those who wanted the responsibility), and if I recall, the highest amount of comment karma. That was enough to put him on top. He's also related to the Falcons rookie center and has a Falcons based username.

We currently have a great (if not the best) receiving core in the NFL with Roddy, Julio, and even Harry Douglass. Along with the best TE of all time.  We have a monster of a running back (The only active over 10,000 rushing yards).  We have another running back  in Jacquizz Rodgers who has shown glimpses of greatness and is ready to unleash his full potential.  And of course, we have a great QB in Matt Ryan (Possibly the best in franchise history- maybe in the top 5 of the league currently)

I wouldn't trade a single player on our offense for anything.

Analysts argue the only thing that could thwart our quest to glory is the O-line.  However, it seems as though Dimitroff has prepared for this and I trust him 100%.  I see no problem with Konz at center and I think we have multiple players with the ability to step up at guard.  If all else fails, we have a great additional blocker in Quizz.

Been to dozens of games in the Swamp and on the road. Never miss a game. I am however a bigger fan of NFL football than college. 

The ""fan"" that I went to the game with is a die hard UGA fan. He told me after the game that this loss didn't hurt anywhere nearly as bad as the way UGA lost to Bama. It blew my mind. I literally could not grasp thinking that. I have Falcons seasons tickets and never miss a game. I love this team and felt so invested in it. 

My friend claims that football in the state of Georgia is all about UGA and that the Falcons aren't anywhere nearly as important as UGA. 

My point is that college football is not on the same level as NFL. They have computers and analyst decide their national champion every year. The scheduling is completely bias. The media absolutely has a bias towards certain programs (bama, ND, USC, Mich, Ohio St) and they are the ones that determine so much. 

My other point about the two losses is that UGA wasn't supposed to be competitive in that game. They opened in vegas as a 9.5 point underdog. ATL opened as a 2.5 dog. UGA also got dominated over the course of the game. Bama gave up a special teams TD and had one more turnover and still won. UGA was lucky to even be in a position to win that game. UGA winning that game would have shocked the world. ATL beating SF would have shocked a few people but most people would have just said, we were wrong....they were 13-3 and had the best record in the NFL for a reason.

My brother and I (as well as a rotation of friends) have been going to the same sports bar in Birmingham, AL for the past 7 years to watch the Falcons. Virtually every game, winning or losing, we're there and yelling.

I got engaged last winter, and when she decided on a January wedding, I insisted that it be on the 26th, so that it wouldn't interfere with my Falcons watching during the NFC Championship or the Super Bowl. She's a Broncos fan, which I have forgiven, but she's risen up and bought a #2 jersey and hopped on the bandwagon at the bar every week.

Anyway, this past weekend was my bachelor party weekend. We drove home from the casinos in Tunica, just in time to catch kickoff. I had a bottle of champagne chilling behind the bar, and the game started off so well. Drinks were flowing, and our joy was contagious to the staff and other patrons.

Now, if you knew us, you would understand that we each enjoy teasing the others teams, so she felt comfortable with what came next...

As the third quarter came to a close, I yelled (as I am known to do), ""WHAT DO FALCONS DO?""

Her: ""CHOKE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER!""

*record scratch*

Everything going on in the room came to a halt. My friend and roommate just shook his head and said, ""Dude, not cool.""

The clock ticked down, and as the score got closer and closer, her anxiety level rose exponentially.

In my defense, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have called off the wedding...

When Lynch scored, and the PAT made it 28-27, I looked around and told everyone who would listen that we were going to win this game. 

My friends called for the champagne as I explained that we didn't need 34 seconds, as 11 seconds is all Matty Ice needs.

I paced the room, clutching the Falcons mardi-gras beads I bought in New Orleans the day after Sean Payton was suspended like a rosary (actually I refer to them as the Red-Zone Rosary) as Pete Carroll tried to ice Bryant.

As I paced, my fiance had buried her head in her hands, incapable of watching.

I screamed ""MONEY!"" as the kick sailed through the uprights and the champagne cork shot across the bar, and my marriage was saved before it ever began.

After seeing the complete domination of the 49ers in Seattle, I was thinking to myself what if we could be that loud in the Divisional game against whomever we play?

http://www.nfl.com/videos/san-francisco-49ers/0ap2000000115980/How-loud-is-the-12th-man

That's just a video, of the game last night. If we get that atmosphere and noise going down in the Georgia Dome, it'd be a HUGE distraction to the opposing team. As you saw, they tried audibles with a few seconds remaining on the clock, and it was just horrible every time. The Crowd makes a huge difference, which is exactly what we need in the Dome!

We need all the help we can get in the playoff game on the 12th or 13th. And it starts off with us, fans. We need to be loud as possible for that game. Not saying that the Georgia Dome is quiet or anything, but we need to be loud as possible.

Hopefully the Georgia Dome is **LOUD**. We definitely need to get as much noise going there. Let's start something new in ATLANTA. Make opponents shit their pants whenever they walk through this Dome.

We have a QB who is certainly one of the top 10 who has shown flashes of true elite status.

We have a great set of linebackers, and when healthy our secondary can create turnovers that will turn a game around.

Yet all I hear people talk about is how much they want to win a playoff game. Screw that, this team should be better than that. You know who doesn't care about winning a playoff game? Green Bay, New York, New England. Why? Because they are quality franchises who think that every year they should win the Superbowl, and anything less is a failure.

We may never have a better chance at getting to a Super Bowl with this current group of players than this season. Next year we will be rebuilding our OL, trying to find a replacement for the greatest tight end in history, looking for a new running back, and our best pass rusher will be 35 years old, plus we have a brutal schedule. With an easy path to home field advantage laid out in front of us and a NFC where every team is flawed, just winning a playoff game is not enough, it's time to take the next step towards becoming a perennial contender, and the only way to do that is if we make it to the Superbowl.

Game 1 - 
@ NOLA Close game but Falcons always have trouble meeting the Saints passion at home, especially since this is their home opener, Peyton is back, etc. 
Falcons lose late and close. 0-1. 

Game 2 - 
V RAMS- Home Opener - SJAX on fire, scores 3 touchdowns and picks up over 100 yards. Falcons win big 10+. 1-1. 

Game 3 - 
@ Miami - 
 One of those 2013 type games like v OAK. Falcons struggle early, can't do anything right, but end up winning. 2-1. 

Game 4- 
V New England - Worst game of the season, an absolute blowout. Falcons just don't show up. All of us go into panic mode. 2-2 

Game 5 
@ NYJ - Falcons play a complete game on offense and defense, never behind and route the Jets, it is never even close. 3-2. 

Game 6 
V TB - Typical TB game, Falcons play lazy, down to their competition, stay behind until the end of the game when they decide to turn it up and win by a FG. 4-2 

Game 7 - 
@ Arizona -For some reason I have a bad feeling about this game. It is one of those classic trap games where it should be an easy victory but something goes wrong and now falcons are faced with two tough games and sitting 4-3. 

Game 8 - 
@ Carolina - road game at Carolina is close. Falcons have trouble stopping Cam Newton but his mistakes and the panthers lack of defense keep ATL in the game. It is close until the 4th quarter. Falcons keep an 6 point lead on a defensive stand. 5-3. 

Game 9 
V Seattle- 
Falcons figure out Wilson and destroy Seattle, getting back some respect and momentum.  A 10+ point victory. 6-3. 


Game 10 - 
@ Tampa Bay
I've been to enough games at TB to know for a fact they water down the field before the Falcons come to town. It is always slow and sloppy. However, Freeman is an awful QB and while their secondary is improved, the DLINE and LB are mediocre at best. Falcons win a close game late, 7-3 

Game 11
V New Orleans - 
Revenge game for the Falcons who have had this on their lockers since opening week. Saints are a game ahead in the playoff race and this evens things up. Brees fights back late but can't make the plays. Falcons win on defense - 8-3. 

Game 12 - 
@ Toronto  V Buffalo 
I'll be at this game and it will be a nice little blowout. One of those fun games where everything is pretty much wrapped up in a bow by mid 3rd quarter and I get to go drink and party with Canadians. 
9-3 

Game 13 - 
@ Green Bay- 
Green Bay in December? Falcons fall late due to the referees love affair with Aaron Rogers. Some sort of BS call pisses us all off and we swear we are done with the NFL. 
9-4 

Game 14- 
V Washington - 
RG3 is injured and it is an easy bounce back win for the birds. 
10-4

Game 15-  
@ San Francisco 
Playoff implications here as both teams are vying for their division and a first round bye. Both teams are hesitant to bring out the playbook since they knew they will probably meet again soon.  Falcons play too conservative, fall to 10-5. 

Game 16 
Carolina- 
Must win game for the Falcons to seal the division and a #2 seed. Intense game with Newton racking up big numbers, Falcons blow a good lead to have Newton come back in 4th quarter, force overtime. 
Newton makes a mistake to lose the game for CAR, Falcons improve to 11-5, win the division due to Conference record (tied with NOLA). 

PLAYOFFS 
Saints / Cowboys / Packers / Giants 

Bye - #1 49ers, #2 Falcons 

Saints beat the Cowboys 
Packers beat the Giants 

Divisional Round - Falcons V Saints 
The only reason the Falcons win this game is the home crowd. The pure crystal clear hatred of the Saints makes the noise unbearable. A few penalties cost the Saints the game, they miss a FG because they got backed up or something. Falcons advance 

49ers clean the Packers clock again. 

NFCCG - @ San Fran 
REVENGE. Falcons DOMINATE the game. Some D player goes crazy and gets 4 sacks, falcons intercept a ball for a Touchdown, Falcons injure both the starting QB and his replacement. EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER WANT TO HAPPEN TO THE 49ERS does. For real, Im not being a homer (see below) I think we finally get to the promised land playing a complete playoff game. 

SUPERBOWL XLVIII
vs BRONCOS 
Hey, guess what? We play the FREAKING BRONCOS with a FREAKING HOF QB on his last leg again. Sound familiar?  Oh and BTW it is OUTSIDE IN NEW JERSEY IN FEBRUARY. AKA the Falcons get screwed again except for instead of Eugene Robinson it is a combination of Mother Nature and Peyton Manning. Sorry guys, we put up a good fight, but go down hard to the Manning face. 

Whew. Check back in 2014 to make fun of me or if I'm right again, we all need to bet in 2015.

Six years from now Tony Gonzalez will be in Canton, Ohio. He'll be delivering his Hall of Fame induction speech, and he'll be wearing a super bowl ring on his finger. He'll talk about his Super Bowl winning season with the Atlanta Falcons in the 2013 season. He's going to say how humble he was that every member of that team used him as a motivation and inspiration to give it their all that year. Being the humble guy he is, he'll say how he appreciated how welcomed he was into the Falcons franchise in 2009 and that he wouldn't be standing there without us..

Of course, this is but a prediction of things to come in the coming years and is by far just speculation by an adoring fan, but, is this really that far-fetched? It could easily be reality if the Falcons can make it in the big one this year.

But what if it doesn't? Tony said that this would absolutely be his last season in the NFL. It's all or nothing this year. Does this change his legacy? Probably not, he'll still probably go down as one of the best tight ends ever. However, what kind of disappointment will that bring to him, everyone of his teammates and all of us as fans? What I'm trying to highlight is the fact that this is going to be emotional year for us no matter what happens. We love the man, hell, we even have a picture of him on our sidebar. We will care about him no matter what.

So much is riding on this year. As a fan, it makes me a bit scared. Like many of you, I'm very emotionally invested in this franchise and I really don't want another heartbreak like how last season ended. I know Atlanta sports, doomed to fail, get used to it, blah blah blah, always choking. Seriously though, look at our team and how much talent we have. Look at our coaching staff and what they've already accomplished. I feel like we are the best we've ever been in team history. We have as good of shot as anyone else in the NFL, if not better to win the Superbowl, so why the hell not us? We just might see Mr. Gonzalez with a ring on his finger.

I bought them again in 2010 and have upgraded each season. This past year we upgraded to 4 seats in the 200 levels. It changed the cost of my seats so it changed our monthly costs. We just made $700 dollar payments. The last payment was due June 3rd. The balance after may was $752. The June monthly payment was made to finish it up. It left a balance of $52 out of the $2795 that was the total costs. I called my rep a week ago to clear that up the balance because I saw an email that said the ""deadline"" had passed. My rep was no longer employed there so I called the general number and got a voicemail. I left a voicemail. A few days go by and I never got a call back. Meanwhile, I was getting emails about Falcons events addressed to my season ticket account. Decided to call back today and got the voicemail again so I leave another message....

Tonight I decided to log into my account and see what the deal was because I figured I could just pay it over the PC.....

No balance. No invoice. No previous invoices. Nothing. My account is blank.

Basically the falcons released those 4 seats and after reading something on the FAQs, all money paid into those seats (a little over $2700) is non-refundable and apparently just a donation to the Falcons.

I never expected, in a million years, for the Falcons to treat a really loyal season ticket holder like that. Not one phone call from them.

First and foremost, night mode has been completely optimized, from head to toe, everything is now very readable including the sidebar and flair.  As I stated in a comment earlier this week it has been on my list for a while, and I needed to make sure I could do it the way I wanted.  I think I accomplished that, and I hope everyone who uses night mode can enjoy it.  Having said that, I may have missed a few spots.  If you find a page or part of a page that isn't showing up in a readable way, click on [this link](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=cjdimino&amp;subject=Falcons%20CSS%20bug)(It's in the sidebar as well), and send me a message about what is wrong.  

While I was working on night mode, it came to my attention that currently, /r/falcons doesnt display visited links differently from unvisited links.  I don't know what works better, so if you guys want to give me suggestions in the comments, that'd be great.

Secondly, I have added FLAIR TEXT for the ""jersey number"" flairs and the falcons logos and helmets.  The ""Jersey number"" flairs are locked into the players name, while the logos and helmets are open for any message.  Hopefully these wont get out of hand, and i think they'll be fun.  

I'm still getting around to fulfilling all the flair requests, due to summer classes.  Look for those to roll out in the next month.  

Thats all folks.

Rise Up,
