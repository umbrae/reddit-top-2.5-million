Unfortunately the donate version of Baconit didn't get approved for the update, so you won't see the April Fools joke in it. It failed the marketplace certification due to content and I didn't have enough time to  send it through again before April 1st. 

Also, if you have been posing in /r/Baconit or /r/WindowsPhone about the joke the mods at /r/WindowsPhone and I were removing the reddit posts so the joke wouldn't be spoiled for anyone. I didn't quite get the time zones right, so the joke started to show up a bit earlier than I intended. :)

The next big update is still in the works. I will let you know more when I know more. :)

Happy April Fools!

It took a long time (longer than I wanted it to) but this has been a major milestone for Baconit. This update introduces a long overdue rewrite of the backend to be much more robust and preform better. What this means for the future is that releases should be more stable and easier for me to make, which should be good news for you and me. This update also brings the new code update Baconit to WP8 and make it look nice on high res devices. 

[Teaser image of the new start tiles!](http://imgur.com/kLNgP)


Change Log

 * Windows Phone 8 Support!
 * Lock screen wallpaper from any subreddit
 * Lock screen notifications
 * New live tiles for Windows Phone 8
 * Tap + Send support
 * New social network sharing
 * New animations
 * High resolution images
 * Fixes to flip view to use less memory and have better performance 
 * Completely rewritten back end which improves performance of entire app

[Full change log can be found here](http://www.quinndamerell.com/Baconit/ChangeList.html)

HOWEVER it should be noted that this is kind of a “beta” release of Baconit for WP8. There is a lot of new code and while beta testers have been great with WP7, I don't really have a good way of getting beta testers for WP8. Therefore it has really only been tested by me and my girlfriend, which is not as large of an audience as I normally like to have. 

Make sure to [follow Baconit on Twitter](http://twitter.com/BaconitWP), and [like Baconit on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Baconit) so you know the second the update hits!

I hope you're all enjoying your new Windows Phone 8 devices! I now am the proud owner of a red Lumia 920 and it's amazing. For all of you 7.x users, your update will be next. :)

Baconit 2.6 Donate failed due to a theming bug that they caught in their certification tests. I have fixed it and resubmitted it, but it might take a week or so to get certified.

Ninja Update! I also sent out an update for Baconit and Baconit – Donate to bump them to 2.6.4.1. This version fixes the theme bug and also introduces a cool feature were the application bar goes into mini mode when you scroll the comment like the title bar. I think it makes quite a cool effect, and you can also turn it off in the settings if you don't want it.

After a short break from developing, I will be working on an update for 7.5 and 7.8 (I am not sure how that works, if a 7.8 app can run on 7.5 or not.) So that might be in a few weeks. :)

Two quick updates:

1) Just to say this again, for now I am not planning on making a Windows 8 version of Baconit. I work on Baconit alone and I simply don't think I will have enough time to make and update a Windows 8 app as well as making updates for Baconit WP. I would rather focus on Baconit for Windows Phone so I can keep adding features and making it amazing. :D 

I have seen a number of good looking reddit apps for Win8 already, and I am sure that is just the tip of the ice burg. But I also think if anyone was thinking of making a reddit app for Win8, now is the perfect time to start. Windows 8 is a big playing flied, and everyone is starting on the ground floor. Even if you have never written an app in your life, Windows 8 is a place were you can do well. I didn't have a whole bunch of experience on Windows Phone when I started making Baconit, but look where it is today. I would strongly encourage anyone thinking about it to give it a shot. :)

Speaking of Win8, if you are planning on writing a Windows 8 app I would like to offer you the ability to add BaconSync into your app so you app can sync with Baconit and the browser. This would be completely free of course, with no cost to you or the users. I just want to have all of my clients sync nicely. :) If you are interested, PM me and I will send you the details, the API is really simple and easy to use. 

2) If you are experiencing any trouble with BaconSync still, please let me know. There seems to be some bug that some people are having with syncing and I would like to fix it ASAP. :)


**Edit: These are the Windows 8 Apps I know of thus far. Go support them!**

I cannot really figure out whether this is really the image not updating or baconit it just keeps choosing the same picture as wallpaper. I somewhat doubt it is the first since it updates just fine in periods. I therefore suspect that it is the selection algorithm deciding the same picture repeatedly. Further supporting this I’ve found that the less active a subreddit is, the worse the problem gets – maybe due to the same pictures ranking high for a longer period of times.

straight away want to say please don't mind the incredibly long post, apologies. 

I am a new WP user and just got a Lumia 620 10 days back and loving everything about it and the platform. 

Being a redditor Baconit was the obvious choice.

I've been compiling this list since i got the device, I am aware that some points might be lack of insight on my part, some might have been dealt with in prior months on this sub or mentioned by the dev, or some might not be implementable due to WP or reddit API limitations.  
But still i think i had to share this and apologies for any redundant content.

I am coming from a AlienBlue, now before you get your pitchforks, i think its fair to appreciate  someone doing quality work, due to its long maturation period it has gotten a lot better over the years, Its not a bad thing to take cues from it and improve our own product.

So here it goes. 

*  Custom sub arrangement
*  A White theme 
*  Pocket (formerly Read it Later) support (Custom/pocket web-optimizer/rendered of pages in addition to readability)
* Option to remove items from hidden, there are no actions available for a Hidden story. 
* Author flair view (comments on subs like r/soccer can at times be unintelligible because the context gets lost due to the absence of user's club flair)
* Alien Blue Canvas like system, a view where images and images alone(4-6-8 at a time) are shown in a grid fullscreen and scrolled through.  
Few standalone apps already do this in WP, like one for wallbase, one for 500px, etc 
* Flip-view Full screen swiping of stories(something related a bit to the previous point in a way as well)
* Cache cleaning option. 
* Remove(or contract) top bar(and/or bottom) when scrolling through a sub, only 4 odd stories are visible at a time currently, the comment scrolling behaviors where the top bar contracts is incredibly helpful in vacating precious screen space for content.  
A possible solution for sub stories scrolling should be implemented for more content to be seen at a single viewing. 
* Comments view improvement, its sometimes difficult to follow OP and reply over long comment threads. 
In some accent colors like yellow the color hue and saturation make it easier to follow comments hierarchy than something like blue or cobalt (I think its possibly a OS and color reproduction issue not much fault of the app but I think few tweaks here and there on spacing can make the experience a bit better I think)  
* Comment clicking behavior  
 Why can't we have formatted text(italics, etc) with clickable links be seen right away. 
 Additionally Alien Blue even has comment inline image viewing support (able to click/close and see images within the comment view screen)  This could be a WP issues but there has got be a workaround.

* Cant scroll up on comment context view sometimes (this could be a bug and it happens occasionally when going from New messages to new message-reply context screen). 
 Something [like this example ](http://i.imgur.com/o4DZR3n.jpg)

* Unsaving requires manual refresh for story to be removed from on screen view

* Why not Update and look for new messages under the *account* panel while browsing in and out of threads and sub even when *Account information and messages* is set to 1 day(or of such long duration) or Update subreddit stories every 10 min(I am describing my personal custom setting situation for this as example, I think the app should still look for new messages while stories are being browsed and app is being used for 10-20+ minutes anyway.)

* Mod module with full functionality as much as Reddit API permits 

* Show the subreddits sidebar options like content, links, etc (possibly in a separate box/windows that appears if it must), with clickable/copy-able links, that works in smart bar as well, e.g. link of combo subs, etc.

* Laggy performance in app opened web-pages on some pages sometimes (this is very vague from me i know, will update if i can pinpoint or reproduce this consistently)

Few questions 

* What is the *Show top system information bar* option in General settings for?

* Search for- Himalayas (just an example), 
go to- a story/thread in r/travel from results, 
How to go up a level to main r/travel?


Baconit doesn't really have any competition on WP, which can be a tricky situation for the developer and can lead to stagnation without a competitive rival offering. 

Before i buy the app i just wanted to give my feedback and listen to what the dev Quinn has to say on the future of the app. 

There are a lot of thing i listed which can be made into a Pro offering of the app as well. 

Things like Mod module support, A Canvas like system, Author flair view, Full screen Flip-view, Discover Subreddits (Alien Blue like custom list of numerous subs categorized based on context)etc, these features don't break the current usability of the app and thus a app version free of them would still be incredibly effective reddit tool.  

But with them you can offer something extra and people will be willing to pay, WP is a growing platform, things can only go up. Why not provide an extra incentive for people to buy and inturn offer something extra as well. It can't hurt anyone now can it?  

Wouldn't mind Beta testing these features as well.",,False,self,t5_2rfk9,False,,,True,t3_1c2kod,http://www.reddit.com/r/baconit/comments/1c2kod/feedback_and_feature_request_plus_a_few_queries/,

It essentially creates a lot of empty space which does nothing on threads which have a short title. 

Would it be possible to somehow enable it in the setting for it to span across the whole line and not just where the text is? 

This is even egregarious on threads which have an image. Since you essentially have an example of a to hit area like this.

I asked Quinn if I could shamelessly plug the Windows 8 Metro reddit reader that I've been working on for the past couple months.

The reader, which is named Narwhal, is getting close to completion, and represents more hours and late nights than I like to remember.  As we reach launch date for Windows 8, I am in need of a few people that are able and willing to beta test the application and to provide detailed feedback.

I've set up a subreddit for Narwhal at http://www.reddit.com/r/narwhalw8 and a website that highlights a few features at http://narwhal.azurewebsites.net .  I look forward to your feedback on our effort.

First off, I love Baconit, I actually realized it was available in my market when writing out a dejected comment  on /r/windowsphone about how I can't get it.

I've been using it for a week now, and am just amazed at what a quality app it is, this is the kind of stuff that doesn't make me feel like I'm a second class citizen for being on WP, and to show my appreciation I got the 'donate' version right off the bat (and was more than happy with my leap of faith).

**The issue**

I have a few niggles with the app, mostly stuff I'm just going to have to get used to.
But I was wondering, is there anyway to filter what tiles come up under recent?

 As it is, it works as it should, but I'd like a bit more control. Ideally, it'd be great if I could long press on something that I don't want there and unpin it, but I could live with a complete resetting of all the items under 'recent'.

There are measures in place to handle parser crashes, but sometimes even those can go wrong. :)

It could also be that I wrote an entire new subreddit backend for 2.4, since the subreddit manager completely changed. It should import your old subreddit list into the new one, but upgrading code is hard to test so there might be a bug in there.

1) I've set my Windows Phone Backgournd Image to baconit and the subreddit ""/r/WPLockscreens"" now; there are some lockscreens which I really don't like. So if I downvote a lockscreen I'd not like to have it set as a lockscreen. I know at this point it does and to me that doesn't make sense. Could you add the check if the logged in user downvoted the post that it isn't selected in the Lockscreen settings?

""Error:
We can't load the subreddits list right now, make sure you have an internet connection and try again later.""

It would happen on the initial screen after launch or resuming, when resuming the front page, and on links I had open when resuming. The error would show on both WiFi and 4G connections, and it would actually continue to work just fine, I only had to click through the error while it loaded everything it was supposed to.

However, I wanted to see if a reinstall would fix the issue, so I removed it and resinstalled from the link in my email (I'm using the 2.3.1 beta).

Now, I'm still getting the error, and after logging into Baconit, it no longer loads my account's subreddits, and the Subreddit Manager is useless. I can't check off any subreddits (account or local) on the list (incorrect for my account) that comes up. I can go to Add Subreddit, enter a subreddit name, check off account or local for it, and when hitting the back button it hangs on Loading New Data. I can back out of that but the subreddit list remains unchanged.

I've tried logging out and back in several times, checking on my PC to make sure reddit is available and my account looks correct from that side, and uninstalling/reinstalling again.

I'm on a Lumia 900 (also tried rebooting it several times).

Let me know if there's anything else I should try or any more info that would be helpful.

Edit: Some more info: It's like the main subreddit list is the only thing acting this way. When I actually view the Front Page it looks like my front page.

The only real problem I see with it isn't really a problem with the lock-screen image feature itself, but more so the general nature of how most images are formatted.  This problem is that most images have a much more landscape-friendly aspect ratio than portrait-friendly.  The example I'm going to use is r/carporn.  I wanted to use images from that subreddit on my lockscreen, but due to it being mostly landscape photos of a wide subject (cars), most images crop way too much out and you're left with things like a picture of a chunk of the car between the wheels where the entire front and back of the car are cut off.

The first option I've thought of to try and alleviate this is pretty simple.  Allow an option to display the lockscreen image in landscape orientation instead of portrait.  Obviously this isn't very ideal because then you're looking at a landscape image, but all of your lock-screen text is portrait oriented, and that could be annoying to some people.  Another alternative to that might be to look at the aspect ratio of the next image you want to display, and if it's closer to a portrait orientation image, display it portrait, if it's closer to landscape, display it landscape.  The downside to that is that it may annoy some people if they keep getting images with a random orientation popping up on their lock screen.

The second option is a little more complex, but should be possible I think.  I also believe this is a better solution.  Basically, instead of just pulling in whatever image is chosen and displaying it, take a pool of images and look at all of their resolutions.  For each image, use the resolution to calculate the aspect ratio, and then somehow weight all of the potential images by their aspect ratio.  The idea I'm having here is to make it where Baconit favors images that are closer to the 9:16 or 9:15 portrait orientations of the phones than images that are wider.  The big downside I can see to this is if you have to download each image in order to determine its resolution, that's a lot of wasted data as well as processor time just to ultimately display one image.  If it's somehow possible to tell the resolution of an image without fully downloading it though, then it wouldn't be too bad.

Anyway, these are just a couple of ideas I had.  The first one is kind of clunky from a UI perspective since a landscape oriented image with portrait oriented text would be annoying, but it would be really easy to implement.  The second idea is much better I think, but more difficult to implement.  Feel free to tell me I'm crazy and nitpicking here, cause I am.  :)",,False,self,t5_2rfk9,False,,,True,t3_1405o2,http://www.reddit.com/r/baconit/comments/1405o2/featureoption_suggestions_for_lockscreen_images/,
