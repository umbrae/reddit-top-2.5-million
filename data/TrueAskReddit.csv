1369783936.0,540,self.TrueAskReddit,1f8e0t,"Houston, we have a problem.",652,112,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1f8e0t/houston_we_have_a_problem/,"With our numerous new subscribers (welcome, by the way) subreddit quality is not all that it could be. Now while we *do* remove comments and posts we can't maintain the subreddit's quality alone and we can't do it by just removing substandard comments/posts. We need your help.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1f5uso/what_work_of_literature_changed_how_you_looked_at/ca751yx?context=1) highlights the issue pretty nicely. A one 'word' answer was upvoted approximately 80 times and was the top 3rd comment of one of our larger posts. No elaboration. No interesting discussion formed as a result - people were upvoting simply because they like the book. We have a little message that pops up when you hover your mouse over the downvote button but it seems that downvoting is not the problem! (**Edit:** The comment simply said ""1984"" and nothing more)

Now, I *could* remove that comment. In fact, I have an extension which allows me to remove a whole comment tree with only two clicks but that isn't going to solve our problems any more. Removing these comments is anonymous (i.e. the poster will still see their comment there and everybody else won't know if the poster deleted it or I did) and it simply hides the issue. As it is we (the mod team) are essentially janitors, clearing up the mess so everything else is nicely presented. This does not bode well for the long-term future and this is what you all need to start doing:

* Downvote comments like the one I linked to and explain why you feel that it is unsatisfactory. Remember not to downvote because you disagree (and remember where the line between facts and personal opinions lies) but to downvote because the comment does not contribute, because the author did not try to actually say something worthwhile. If the comment is particularly bad then go ahead and report it so a moderator will find it faster.

* Don't post these comments in the first place. Think about your comments before you post - does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? Have I said enough or am I simply making a statement with little to no explanation? If you can't think of a few sentences to add about what you're saying then consider not posting the comment at all.

The road ahead is a difficult one for us all. Some of you may begin to find the subreddit tiresome as you see things from other subreddits leaking in and you may decide to leave (e.g. [""relevant xkcd""](http://xkcd.com/810/ ""Spammers = people posting crappy comments"")) and to that I say only this:

Do not give up or you are partly to blame for the degradation in quality. If people who contribute meaningfully, even if it is just by voting in an intelligent matter, leave then we'll end up with more people who don't contribute than those who do which also means that there will be fewer people to assist in quality control. This is a vital time for the subreddit and we (the other mods and I) cannot do this alone. We can remove all the substandard comments/posts but this is just treating the cause and not the symptom.

If you look at the sidebar you'll see that we don't actually have rules yet. The reason for this is that our moderation is subjective on a regular basis and each mod will often have to remove/approve based on their own opinion of what contributes and what does not. Because of this it makes it very difficult for us to lay out a set of rules for the community to follow regarding contributing positively. I'm open to suggestions of what rules we could officially lay out but at the moment it is down to how we mods feel and it would be better to be more objective than that.

Want to do more? We're looking for more mods right now and there are four positions available. To apply just send me a PM detailing your moderating experience so far (not required but nice to have), where you live (what timezone) and why you want to moderate the subreddit. Those with a good comment history in this subreddit and others will be favoured.

Until we next meet,

Suggestions?,524,88,221,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1cpfjh/roommate_installed_a_keylogger_suggestions/,"Alright, so I have a roommate who several months ago installed Cain and Abel on my computer and made it a slave. Then, he would fuck with me occasionally and I didn't realize that it was him, but I knew it was somebody and not some automated thing because the mouse would move  occasionally when I wasn't controlling it. I ask him and my other roommate if they know anything about it, and they both swear up and down they know nothing.  

  As somebody who is relatively familiar with computers, I unplug my computer from the router, and run TDSS Killer, AVG Free, and Avast to try and clean up whatever program was fucking with my shit. Every day or so after connecting to the router with a cleaned computer, I end up getting the virus/.exe back. Well about the third time, I'm considering just completely reloading my computer, I reach behind my computer to unplug the cat5 cable, and... oh look a thumb drive. After looking at the files on it, it's the fucking cain and able program and some files that show the flash drive belongs to one of my roommates. I flip shit on him, yelling and saying that if I ever catch him on my computer again, I'll beat the life from his body. 

  Flash forward a few months, upgraded from Vista to Win 7, using Firefox, with browser clearer every time I close the browser. Finally switch over to Chrome, and have been using it for a few months. Second roommate informs me about how the roommate who fucked with me before, now has installed a key-logger on firefox.... months ago... when I was still using it. 

I'm beside myself, I am so livid and all I can think to do is grievous bodily harm to him, which obviously isn't a smart thing to do given that I'm a senior in college, and have a lot to lose. So what the hell should I do? How should I react? 

  **TL;DR** Roommate has (for a second time) installed malicious software. This time, he has seen everything from the small stuff like my FB login credentials, to the big stuff, like my online banking credentials.

  Also, being in college means I don't have money for a lawyer, and don't have time for small claims court as I'm going to school year round. 


**EDIT** FAQ:

* How do you know he installed a keylogger?
  I know he did because it showed up as an add-on in my firefox addons/extensions.

* OP is a faggot and will never update or will you?
  I know that I get busy, but I plan on updating. 

* What kind of action are you thinking of taking? 
  I'll probably threaten him with the idea of ruining his life since he's now a felon, but I may just force him to format everything, the night that I decide to confront him, otherwise I'll just call the police and file a report.

I think one of the biggest objections towards gay marriage is the confusion regarding names.

For some people, marriage has nothing to do with religions. It simply means that your government approves your relationship and commitment, and rewards it with tax benefits. (Why and if they should do this is another topic)

For others, it is purely religious. Whichever god in question approves your relationship and commitments, and rewards it with whatever the faith includes. Government takes their part as well, but that is secondary although positive.

My premise is that religious people won't give in, because their version of marriage is god-given and thus unchangeable (inherent fallacies ignored).

Further, pro gay marriage people seem to care less about the exact name.

And last, I have yet to encounter a sound secular argument against gay marriage.

Thus, if all government-approved marriages were changed in name only to civil unions, **would this make acceptance of gay marriage easier?**

*Edit*:

Thanks everyone for your insights. To give another viewpoint: I'm from switzerland. Here there is one huge difference in marriage compared to the USA. Every person who gets married has to do so on a ""Standesamt"", which translates to civil registry. There you get married, and this is for everyone no matter what religion or sexuality (although the sexuality bit is quite new and not yet implemented in some districts).

Additionally people can ""marry"" in a church. But the priest can do nothing with any legal weight. His ceremony does not matter at all on a legal level. Many people do not marry with a religious institution, and the freethinkers even offer a secular ceremony if you want something in addition to the civil registry.

So in a way, what I'm proposing is already in effect, but we still use the same word for both of them. I know the question is more one of semantics, but heavily loaded, so I was interested to hear other opinions.

What would you do, Reddit?",340,60,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1eryez/im_considering_leading_a_coup_within_my_company/,"Throwaway just in case.

My company has a history of bouncing payroll checks.  This has happened four times in the last two years.  Each time, it's explained away as a ""banking error"".  I am a member of the executive staff so I'm fully aware that this is not the case.  It's a mis-mangement of funds by our COO and CFO.  However, I don't have access to the books to be able to ""prove"" this  (I've only been involved with conversations to this effect).  

As you might imagine, each time this occurs, our employees panic.  Car payments are late, mortgage payments bounce, the works.  As a member of senior management, it's guys like me that deal with the angry and tearful phone calls wondering when they're going to get paid and what is the true future of this company.  With the job market so stagnant, most of them feel that they have nowhere else to go.  They shouldn't have to suck this up.

But our COO refuses to address the issue.  I had to force him to have a company-wide conference call explaining this most recent mess and during that call he effectively blamed our employees for the lack of payroll funds due to poor sales performance.  He took zero responsibility for the problem and lashed out at the staff instead.

Couple the payroll issues with our COO just being really awful at his job and we are truly facing collapse sometime soon, I would predict.

I was once very tight with the CEO  (who is mostly absent at this point since the COO took over).  I feel I could call him and tell him what's going on.  In doing so, I'd be going over my boss's head.  I report to the COO.  This could go one of three ways:  1)  I get fired, which I can't afford right now  2) The COO is in hot water and eventually is forced to resign  3)  Nothing happens and I have gone on record that I have no confidence in the COO.

Everyone who reports to me is up in arms and they're waiting for me to do *something*.  It's reached critical mass to the point that should I do nothing, I believe *I* may be the one facing a rebellion.

1. College debt is out of control, and it's going to affect the [future of our economy.](http://qz.com/78889/student-borrowing-bubble-in-17-charts/)

2. College is expensive because the institutions are [competing for students](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecohen/2012/08/28/oh-so-thats-why-college-is-so-expensive/), not because the product has substantially improved.

3. The unemployment rate for recent graduates is high. In large part, this isn't because they're under-educated, but rather improperly educated for the [jobs currently available](http://www.manpowergroup.us/campaigns/talent-shortage-2012/).


My conclusion (and this will make some people angry)- Our primary schools need to do a better job of directing students towards the areas they are most likely to succeed. College is not for everyone, particularly those that aim to make money quickly and don't have the capital or parents to pay for a college degree. More young people should be going to trade/vocational schools or seeking apprenticeships. If this practice took off, many universities would close, and I don't think that's such a bad thing.

So I've been trying my best to weigh my options here but have conflicting feelings of nagging guilt and selfish opportunism. 2 weeks ago I finally bit the bullet and made a long-planned purchase of a computer device (unnamed company in case there are any employees here). This was a purchase of over $4,000 so needless to say it was a purchase that my wife and I vetted pretty heavily before diving in.

I got two shipping confirmations the next day, one was cancelled but the other was fine so I thought nothing of it. Later that week I received my package, set it up and everything was good. Later that night we went out to dinner with friends and I came home to find... another package sitting at my front door containing a lower model of the same device that retails for $3,500. It had my name on it but after checking my credit card statement, I was never charged for this extra device.

My question is... what are my options here and how much of a bad person am I for trying to keep it? A week has passed and they've made no attempt to contact me but I would want to wait for at least a couple of months before doing anything with it. My thinking was that if I don't hear from them after that, that I would sell it to a buddy for half-price... somewhat lessoning the negative wave of karma napalm that will surely spread over my life.

My biggest guilt/fear is that this missing package might result in someone at the manufacturing plant losing their job. Is this a realistic concern?

I've done a bit of Googling on the matter and from what I can tell, there's not really a lot of legal recourse the company can take to retrieve the device.

I know it may come across as me rationalizing being a terrible person... and honestly, that may not be too far from the truth. Still - before I call them up and ask them how they'd like to handle it, I'd love to hear the hivemind's thoughts. Thanks in advance for your feedback!

**EDIT** - Thanks to everyone for your thoughtful and well researched advice. I do find it interesting how many people brought up the notion of me seeking moral decisions based on Reddit's democratic comment system. Certainly caused some soul searching. I think the nagging guilt will have the final say here and I will try contacting the company through writing or phone and let them know what happened. Who knows how they'll want to handle it but I agree with many people here that whatever short term gain might be had by keeping the device, it will in time be lost  to me feeling like a bad guy.

However, when it comes to groups of people in unfortunate circumstances, reddit will often use the previously mentioned belief as a way of placing responsibility on that group, in a way that can seem unempathetic and vengeful.

[In this TrueReddit thread about the unemployment rate for black teen dropouts](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1hqw4w/jobless_rate_for_poor_black_teen_dropouts_try_95/). A common theme was dismissal of the issue, and a strong desire to blame the individuals in that group for the situation.

[In this TR thread regarding obesity](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1gndvs/on_obesity_in_fact_its_a_paradigm_shift_if_the/), we see the same theme. People looking to use the cries of individuality and free will to blame the individuals in that group, often refusing to acknowledge perspectives that make their belief less warranted.

However, only a small fraction of those movements have achieved true success and, please correct me if I'm wrong, only because the cause they stood for rallied an important fraction of the population with clear enemies on their sights: Mubarak and Gaddafi come to mind.

On the other hand we have Turkey and Brazil as examples of quite legitimate complaints being met with police brutality and ignored by the local media. The resulting stalemate, seems to me, will always favor the large centralized resources of the government, which can easily sustain a war of attrition against individuals with jobs and families to care for.

Even worse is the scenario presented by the US in the face of the NSA scandal. In spite of clear cut proof about the complete disconnect between government action and public interest, the effective response relative to the magnitude of the allegations have been minimal. And this would not be the first time: AFAIK, no one has been held accountable for all the civilians killed overseas; nobody's head rolled after Iraq's so-called WMDs were proven to be a blatant lie and the apathy towards police brutality and militarization is appalling.

A little background:

My kid is 5 years and a half, she's supposed to begin the first grade about the time she turns 6. She has always been very inquisitive, I'll give you a couple of examples: She learned to read basically on her own (in Spanish) when she was four and she is quite profficient at it. She has great language skills in general. This is also true for math, she's learning to add and subtract by herself, one day she counted from on to a hundred and asked me what followed, so I explained the hundreds and she went on to count to a thousand as if it was the natural thing to do. 

We just had a meeting with a school counselor at her school on behalf of her pree-school teacher who told us she would make an assesment based on interviews (to us, the teacher and to my kid as well) and some tests I think. On of the probable outcomes is that she skips a grade. My wife concerns have to do with her emotional adaptation and the fact that she won't be studying with her classmates from last year and having to make new friends. She told me to ask those people in the site that you like to surf.

Another probable outcome is that the councelor recommends another school for kids with special needs - in which case we might have to see first how to round up our budget, but we're not worrying about that right now.

Do you think it is worth it that she skips a grade? how can we complement her education to make it more challenging? I skipped first grade myself because I bored to death and so told my teacher then, and afterwards I was always one of the youngest / smallest kids in my class. 

EDIT - Thanks to everyone for your input, you have given my wife and me lots to think about. I'd never had so many messages in my inbox, I'll take some time to try to answer everyone maybe tomorrow. Thanks again.

I watched the film Earthlings last month and after seeingthe ""horrors"" that go on in the meat industry I decided that I may as well add my support to the cause by boycotting meat products. The problem with that is I've never been a particularly impressionable person and the effects of watching Earthlings is definitely wearing off. Right now the only reason I'm still vegetarian is because I know the meat I would regularly eat is pumped full of hormones and chemicals and I never really aspired to be a human test subject for the big corporations. (Can't afford ""organic"" foods)

So basically I'd like to get everyone's opinion on vegetarianism and the meat industry in general so I can make an informed decision on whether or not to continue my exploits in the world of vegetarianism. Just please keep in mind that I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals, so quoting or suggesting  shock films like Earthlings and Food Inc. isn't the best course of action. 

May logic and statistics prevail!

*Second Edit: Just for clarification, watching Earthlings didn't shock me into vegetarianism at all. After watching it I realized that the conditions that animals were being slaughtered under (at least in America) was pretty bad so I decided ""Hey, it's not right to just claim something is bad and not do anything about it"". This is why I took up vegetarianism, as a way to protest silently. I just reasoned myself into vegetarianism and obviously I wasn't very convincing otherwise I wouldn't be here.

To better portray my current standing here's an example: in your daily routine you go to work, browse the Internet at work, reddit, Facebook, whatever. Then go home and do the same. What happens to your data? They're most likely sent to a computer to be scanned or triggers and key words. At this point they're most likely disregarded but let's say they're not (after all we all have those days when we accidentally what 9/11 conspiracy videos or end up in weird subs) so they will most likely be sent for human judgment and what happens after that? They get disregarded right? That's my guess.

So now that we have the premise of why happens to our data, let's think about the reaction to it. Honestly who cares about your data. As long as you're not doing something illegal then I doubt anyone will care. You don't know the reviewer and the reviewer doesn't know you so is harmed in this process?

________
Nearly always a point is made that: ''It was part of the time, everyone was in awe of nazicism, it was normal back then'' 
However I am more and more having a harder time to buy that so easily. *Mostly* because I feel it undermines the great number of people who were **against** the nazi party from the start, even tough they had the same information available to them as those who
sympathized with/accepted them.
_____

I know it might seem 'harsh' to put people at the wall, but in the end it was - just as racism - these people who stood by and watch it happen. And trying to normalize it; ''what were they supposed to do? Everyone did it'' neglects all of those who *actively stood up*. 

But to ask their grandfather or grandmother the question ''why didn't you stand up to them?'' is impossible unless you have the brutal honesty akin that of a fiveyear old. 

Do you think we should be normalize it in an acceptive manner regarding those who were affiliated yet did not act. Or does that neglect those who **acted against it** and alas thus makes them only heroes, when they were those who were normal decent people?


It might seem I am overreacting but I feel very strongly about this as of late, very much because of our situation today. What moral ground do I have if I do not actively act against the wrongdoings of my government? Is it accepted just like the nazi who had mein kampf ready to read at anytime to know what the nazis wanted?

2) An ""I agree/disagree"" vote, or something similar.

I was thinking about vote type 2 because of numerous discussions regarding the ""hivemind,"" which whilst not a new point of discussion, always bears some thinking about.

Upvotes and downvotes are generally, although not always, used to agree or disagree with an opinion instead of promoting discourse. There are subreddits created to try and deal with this problem, point in case: the various ""true"" reddits; as well as some which function more-or-less as intended through their moderator's influence, e.g. askscience. However the comments in the majority of subreddits leave something to be desired. If a minority opinion is voiced it is usually quashed, not necessarily preventing discussion but making it more difficult to follow. 

Instead of a single vote which determines the place of a comment in the field. Why not have two? Even if the first type was still the only kind to alter the standing of a comment, if people are able to accept discussion but also show they disagree with it do you think it would help negate the ""hivemind?"" I was thinking of something along the lines of a ""like"" button, akin to facebook, and a ""dislike"" button. A comment could then be upvoted because it is interesting and insightful, whilst also showing the opinion of the general public. It has been proven that reddit is skewed towards creating bite-sized, ""flash"" posts that are easily digestible and do not require a lot of thought. Comments are often similar. People do not often give a lot of thought to how the comment adds to discussion, they might read a sentence or two, see the low score it has recieved and click to downvote. The system I propose would allow them to do so, but also enable discussion to continue. Talking about things is the only way we develop more complex ideas. (Wow, there's a line that will never make it into literature.)

An alternate I was thinking of would be to force voters to give a reason for downvotes. 
Some pre-given options such as: trolling, unwelcome/inappropriate joke/remark, harrasment, etc. But also the option to write a comment reply so interesting comments aren't buried in downvotes without a response.


These are just some ideas I had rushing through my head after reading comment after comment deriding the hivemind and reddit in general. Whilst I feel like there really is no better place to go online, it isn't perfect and can always be improved.

I'm a 29-year-old white guy. 5'6"", 220 lbs (working on bringing this down w/ keto diet, but progress is slow). I graduated high school a decade ago, and not having money (or the grades) for college, went directly into the workforce, working my way up from a lowly technician to NOC manager for a Nasdaq-listed corporation. I had a couple of intense relationships from 18-22, but literally have not had a girlfriend since then. I did nothing else during the intervening years but work. Seriously, my work ethic is incredible.

A couple of years ago I quit work and went back to school to get a two-year degree in nanoscience technology. I'm nearly done with it now, and am the best student in my class. I have a job offer for when I graduate in May, and will be returning to normal work then.

But I missed out on *everything*. Nearly a decade of my life during which I didn't date or even get laid. I keep hearing from reliable sources that your 20s are the best years of your life, and it's all downhill from there. And I didn't even get to experience them.

This didn't used to bother me. There was one woman I was more or less waiting for (we moved to different towns but always said we were ""soul-mates"" and would get back together). I never felt obligated to play the usual dating games or try to appeal to anyone else, because I thought this was a 100% sure thing. Problem is, I realized earlier this year that she's long since moved on. She's lived with her boyfriend for years, and this only recently occurred to me. That's the degree of how delusional I've been.

Now I'm a 29-year-old single guy who's short, overweight, has very little money, and hasn't had a girlfriend for seven years. *How the fuck do I get out of this rut?* I've always suffered from some level of depression, but the sheer *enormity* of what I'm up against now is blowing me out of the water. I'm seriously staying at home most nights and just crying because I feel like I can never catch back up to my peers, or my ex-girlfriends who are now married and will soon have children. What woman wants a guy who's been out of the game for that long? Tonight it occurred to me that suicide might be a legitimate mechanism used by natural selection to weed out defectives like me.

tl;dr: 29 years old, haven't had a girlfriend for seven years, feel completely worthless and unwanted, don't know how to get back to living a ""normal"" life for my age, very worried I've missed all my chances and can't ever fix things.

But I think putting rape at least in relation to other physical violations could even help rape victims - when they're raped by someone they know, it would probably not even happen, because they think of rape as physical fight and will more probably try to fight back - or afterwards be sure that this person wanted to hurt her and not fal back into ""was it rape?

In any case, I want critique/support/your own opinion on this most relevant topic. I apologise if you think I am going out on tangents all the time, but I feel they are all relevant points to the argument and surveillance in general.

Anyway, this is the backstory: I was on a psychology class when one of my classmates observed that I was using Bing (instead of Google). I responded that I didn't like their privacy policy (that they log your search results etc. etc.), so I stopped using their services.  

This evolved into a discussion of surveillance and she, as you might surmise, cracked the argument. At first I was flabbergasted - I had never thought anyone would seriously use the argument, least of all someone close to me, and came with some lame response like ""We probably shouldn't discuss it now."" to get time to think (luckily, our teacher just came to hush us so people could actually work).  
The rest of that lesson, I spent thinking on why I *hate* surveillance, and afterwards I presented, in a rough shape, my main bones of contention (since then I've thought about them and refined them somewhat). These are:  

The mentality. This is probably the most used argument against surveillance; most legal systems are based on a principle of innocent until proven guilty, yet when you are being watched, and things about you are being logged just because you *might* do something, you are being treated as guilty even before performing the hypothetical action.
  
According to my view of democracy, I'd also say that surveillance and democracy are incompatible. The word democracy comes from Greek words demos (people) and krati (reign): the people's reign. The power is in the hands of the people. When the people are watched, by the government or whomever, you are giving them knowledge about us. As the very famous proverb says, knowledge is power, suddenly snatched from us.  
Now, I'm not saying that I believe that there would always be someone watching your every action. I really don't. Not this generation at least, but what the next will deem okay is anyone's guess. No, my problem is the *possibilty* that they can.  

My last bone of contention is as cliché as the original argument, the only difference is that this one actually holds water: who will watch the watchers? Because ultimately, it's about trust, and who to trust. The people, or the group of persons with the power of surveillance in their hands (however they were chosen, by the government or the people)?

**The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.**

The reason I ask this is that on Reddit, it's often taken as a given that NSA surveillance is a violation of the Constitution. But doesn't that depend on your interpretation of the amendment? If one person thinks the surveillance is not ""unreasonable"", would they be correct to say it doesn't violate the amendment?

I'm just confused by the certainty that people on Reddit seem to have on the issue. No one, in favor or against, seems to show how they arrive at their conclusion. That can be frustrating to someone like me, who doesn't know how they feel about it.

I'd say some of us who are old enough to understand this might still be young enough to have genetically engineered children when the technology becomes available.

I'm basically talking variations of the themes addressed in [Gattaca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca), if you've seen that movie.

What are your views on the whole process? Do you feel eugenics should become a mandatory thing, where only the best of the best who are classified as 'breeding stock' should be allowed (or even forced) to have children?  I really can't see any argument against this not being in the best interest of the human race, other than it really sucks for the few generations where we have a majority of 'non-breeders'.  After a few generations, everyone would be descended from the 'breeding stock', so reproductive regulations could be loosened, and we'd have a society of smarter, stronger, healthier people for it.  I suppose reducing the size of the gene pool and reducing variation would make us more prone to wide spread genetic diseases, but I feel those could be fixed as long as they're caught early, and as long as our starting pool is somewhere in the range of a million people, the diversity should be enough.

Or do you think it should be an optional thing, where you can choose to have your children improved if you want to? Should it only be used to remove dispositions to genetic diseases?  Here I suppose the issue is that it will create even more disparity between the rich and the poor, as the rich can have 'super children', while the poor still have to do it the old fashioned way.  These 'super children' would have huge advantages over their peers, perhaps to the point that their biologically natural peers can't even realistically compete anymore.  Sports would have to be segregated or basketball could easily become dominated by 8 foot tall physicists (I personally think that would be more interesting to watch though).

Or should it be banned outright?  I personally don't like this option at all.  I feel holding back the human race from reaching it's true potential is something we just can't afford to do.  There will come a time when we can decide our evolutionary path.  I'm very afraid of 'regression towards the mean' creating an [Idiocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) just because those who we can't take the along to genetic enlightenment won't let the rest of humanity leave them behind.

I realize because the first major push for eugenics was by Hitler, that the whole process has forever been tainted with a negative view.

I'm not saying we should cull the weak.  Just that perhaps we should stem them.  I feel the majority of society, even the scientific community, would take my views as monsterous.

Edit:  I've realized from the initial responses that I accidentally went off topic to genetic modification.  I've also taken up a very simplistic view of genetics and assumed that all the things I've proposed would actually be able to done.

They're *always* about the same points. Always. Every single one. We have:

* I only pirate to try and then buy

* I pirate because I can't afford it

* I pirate because it's not available

* I pirate because fuck copyright/ hail free speech etc etc

* Piracy does not equate to lost money

On the other end, we have:

* Piracy is stealing (usually countered by piracy is not stealing)

* Would you steal a car? (Ironically, or not)

* If you can't afford it, don't consume it

* If it's not available, don't consume it

* If you want to try it out, buy and issue a refund if you don't like it

* Piracy equates to lost money

Frankly, there's no reconciling the two sides. People will believe what they believe.

However, a far more important discussion I personally have never seen is: where do we go from here? 

The concept of paying for a piece of recorded music, or recorded performances (movies) is a fairly new one. Capitalism, coupled with technology led to society accepting the system that musicians and moviemakers make media, and the public pays for access to it. That became the norm, and we built laws around it. Fair enough.

However, now we're in the digital age, and it is possible to build infinite copies of media for free, thousands of copies in seconds. This has led, predictably, to anarchy. Millions of people are consuming movies, music and games without paying for them. Industries are trying their best to hold on to the old model, but it's not working. It will never work. You can't beat free. 

My point is: *Piracy is here to stay*. Whether you like it or not, it's going to be a very important part of laws and media for the next century. So what do we do about it? Naturally, media producers have to be compensated for their work somehow. And the old business model is lost forever. That ship has long sailed. We are *never* going to go back to the era of everyone paying for every piece of media they consume. So what do we do? Where do we, as a society, go from here?

I'd love to hear your views, but *please* don't make this about morality. That is entirely subjective, and not the point of this. Whether you think piracy is moral or not is immaterial, it's not going away despite your views.

&gt;Hey buster,
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to talk about an old, hurtful subject. Today was my breaking point, don't know how you've coped with [name redacted], but, I'd like to talk about it.  If you're willing, if not, we don't ever have to speak about it again.  But I still recall the first time it all happened to me like it was yesterday. All our parents got together, my brother and I were the last to get there. We walk up to [name redacted]'s room, you, [my younger brother's name], everything.  Today, I found out my brother never dealt with it, for the sake of it never happening again to someone -- that behavior which may or may not still be there, the forceful nature of it all for at least me... Look I'll leave it at that, I don't like sending this sorta stuff over facebook, but, the options is writing a letter to an address I do not know &amp; a response time I don't care much for.  Anyway, I'd like to talk about it, if you can't get at what I'm pushing for -- charges against him.

I'll let my response to my old friend speak for itself:

&gt;Hey [friend]. I saw this message early this evening and haven't had a chance to respond until just now. This has been on my mind all night and I've been racking my brain, but to be completely honest, I have no memories of the event you're referring to. I'm absolutely willing to discuss this further but you have to understand that from my point of view nothing out of the ordinary ever occurred in relation to [name redacted]. I sincerely hope we can get to the bottom of this.

For the sake of clarity I will refer to the person who's name I have redacted as Carl. It seems clear that my old friend remembers some sort of abuse from Carl, who was another child that I would estimate as being between 3 and 7 years older than me. I really have no memories at all of any of this, but I'm willing to entertain the idea that something traumatic happened that I repressed. Is this even possible? I estimate the time-frame for whatever might have occurred to be between 15 and 20 years ago and although my childhood memories are hazy, I feel like I would remember if I was abused in any way by Carl.

If they'd been implemented singularly and over a longer period of time I probably wouldn't have bothered but since there's so much I figured I'd share with you all!

First things first, we now have /u/AutoModerator working for us! This is a very handy little mod bot who does all kinds of wacky (i.e. incredibly useful and time-saving) things. Big props to /u/Deimorz, the creator! If you want to find out more about the bot then just go to /r/AutoModerator and all the information is readily available to you.

We have new rules! I've always found rules in this subreddit tough because of the subjective nature of the content it's just been easier to moderate without them. However, /u/exoendo wrote 'em up for us and they are now viewable from the sidebar right over there ------------------&gt;  
(Note: Our moderating isn't going to change as a result, it's just something for you all to use as guidelines for how to post)

The nice little message you see when you go to reply to somebody's post! Many thanks to the /r/AskHistorians guys for sharing their nifty CSS with us and for the idea itself! It's a *little* bit buggy (start typing and then click next to the text field and the message reappears) but it isn't the end of the world.

New mods! We had dozens of applications and I have decided on three new moderators who will begin a trial run of two weeks with limited permissions.

Please welcome /u/Feyle, /u/jqrd4n and /u/Frozenshades. Mr. Shades is away in Germany (IIRC) so I'll be starting his two weeks when he gets back, on the 10th.

One last change is how aggressive (probably a bad word to use but it's the only one that comes to mind right now) we are in our moderation. You can go to my [overview](http://www.reddit.com/user/WellEndowedMod) and you'll see a fair few distinguished comments. We're being pretty stringent now so be sure to check the sidebar before you submit and honestly ask yourself ""Does this *really* contribute?""

If anybody has any queries then please feel free to ask here, via modmail or even PM if you please (this being a mod account I don't really mind).

In my opinion, he's absolutely not a patriot.  If he was a true patriot, he would not have run away to HK to tell them what the US was doing.  I am not saying that the US spying on the citizens of HK and China is right.  However, the fact that the US was spying on the citizens of another country is in and of itself an act of aggression.  To then rat your own country out to the target country is an act of treason.  

In doing so, he has not only harmed China/US relations, but has irrevocably damaged the US's self-described reputation as being the moral compass of the world (I'd like to add a caveat and say that the rest of the world already knows how two-faced the US is, but up until now the US has sort of been able to cling to the high ground).

Whatever his reasons were for going to HK in the first place is irrelevant.  However, the fact that he would continue fleeing and to hold his information hostage just makes me think he's a huge douche who has a sense of righteous indignation.  If he was a true patriot, he would have leaked all the info he felt was relevant to the **American** people, then gone back to his home country to face the consequences of his actions. If he was a true patriot, he would not be doing this shit of fucking up the US's diplomatic relations.

So, is he a patriot, traitor, whistleblower, or all of the above?

edit-

I'd like to address one point that some redditors seem to harp on, namely why aren't we discussing PRISM, Patriot Act, etc.  We can talk about this stuff until we're blue in the face, and it STILL won't change a damn thing.

It's hubris to think that being armchair debaters can effect any tangible change in the real world.  You and I are not in charge of anything related to the gov't, and I seriously doubt that people who are actually in a position to effect change are on reddit, or even have time for reddit.  I'm sorry if you find this offensive, but for myself, I try not to be offended by the truth.

I know many people live for happiness, beautiful weather, the wonders of a world... but i'm not looking for why you don't hate life. It all boils down for to a few *reasons* for living. Here's mine.


1. My Mom's father committed suicide when she was 40. He was living at our house because he was real sick. My mom found him dead. He had shot himself. I can't kill myself, that would completely destroy her. 


2. My big brother is my hero.  I was one of those weird introverted overweight kids that played WoW all day growing up. And because of him i don't have anxiety anymore and i owe any happiness i've ever had to him. I couldn't throw away all he's done for me as long as he's alive.



3. I'm an aspiring musician. I play guitar and i sing. I've written a couple of songs and i personally think they are good enough to be on the radio (all modesty aside, anonymous right?). I'm talented enough that i really want to see how my attempt at making a living doing music goes. I don't want to die before i at least attempt to make my mark on the world. 

4. I'm 20 years old and i've never kissed a girl. Never been on a date, or really had any significant interaction with a female. I would like to experience those emotions at some point. They are so foreign to me, i would just really like to know before i die.

So, I'd like to run through what I personally wish for this subreddit and I'd like you all to give me feedback on how you feel about that, how you feel about the current state of affairs and what changes (if any) you'd like to see made.

**My vision for /r/TrueAskReddit:**

I took over here as a long-time AskRedditor because I wanted to see interesting questions being asked and interesting comments in response. A worthy cause, I think. So far I have been generally happy with this subreddit. It's not perfect (to be expected) but it has grown quite nicely and is self-sustaining, I don't need to plug it because [you lot already do that.](http://metareddit.com/monitor/otWG5/TrueAskReddit)

While this is great and all, I think we need to focus on quality control. Poor submissions are generally downvoted into obscurity, so that's not an issue, but I think we can still do better on the comments front. Take [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/vmvhs/what_truths_have_you_discovered_over_the_years/), for example. A good discussion could very well occur but it's a relatively typical AskReddit submission and isn't particularly original. Some comments are decent enough but others, well, not so much. Short statements of opinion that have absolutely no elaboration whatsoever. I don't mind short statements so much but I do when it isn't expanded on.

I don't want to dwell on this but what I'd like to see is more careful voting and more careful posting. Think before you comment ""How much does this contribute? Can I elaborate any more?"" and before you vote ""How much has this contributed? Is it really TrueAskReddit material?""

This is a question that has been bugging me. In this hypothetical scenario, assume that the important woman (though, yes, it could be a man, but let's say woman here, because it's more stereotypical) of your life has been raped. Also assume that it has (understandably) shaken her up, and she has (also fairly common/understandably, from what I've read) some lasting mental troubles. If you give them time, they still don't seem to go away.

I don't want to concentrate on the ""justice"" side of the question (i.e., ""what would you do to the guy who did it?""), but rather on how you would react, and how a guy ""should"" react.

I believe society's opinion is that, as the guy, you should be there for her, comfort her, and of course not ever bother her for sex again (until she felt ready for it, if ever). Basically, the obvious 'decent' things to do.

I like to think I'd be that guy. I like to think that I'd accept the sacrifices that needed to be made, to try and help her, because I love her. But I'm very afraid I would try this...but then have doubts start to creep in. 

Assuming she was still fairly messed up from the ordeal after a while, and sex still traumatic for her, I'm afraid I would start to think in terms of self preservation. I'm afraid I'd think ""she's wrecked in this respect, but why should I have to be? I'm young and this doesn't have to be my life."" Which seems like a terrible, terrible, selfish way to think. 

And I like to think I wouldn't think this way, but what would be reasonable? Would it be unreasonable to say ""listen, I'll be here for you as a friend, but I need something different than this in terms of my love life""?

(I should also clarify: this isn't at all based in reality or anything for me, I've never been in this situation. I was just thinking about it and it bugged me.)

Yesterday marked Xavier's 6th month of being in the hospital. He is doing amazingly well post-transplant, and is expected to be going home soon.

Me: purely, no. I can argue the preservation of life, but I dont see that as inherent selfishness. And then it gets sticky because there are a number of social situations that may or may not be affected by ones subconscious predispositions towards what self preservation entails. People are attracted to the things and people they are attracted to not just for their social value, but for the inherent sustainability that thing or person can provide them.

It is hard to argue that behaviour as selfish when it is something genetically wired into a person. But, decisions will be made that could come across as selfish. I think it comes down to if it affects the other person's well being, and you have to be able to disassociate your own well being from a myriad of expectations that involved people and things outside one's control. Basically, it is selfish to label someone else as selfish - you are essentially saying that person, thing, or organisation is hurting you because they aren't doing what you want them to do. That, to me, is selfish, and is different from if their choices directly hurt you without your participation. That's where it differs - your participation, and then participation itself comes down to an ENDLESS number of possible social constructs.

So, your thoughts? When does something truly become selfish? What are things people view as selfish that you think really aren't?

Through a long learning process and combined with sophisticated algorithms, this app knows your tastes and preferences perfectly. Better than you do!

It's only Friday but it already knows that you're overdue to hang out with Kyle, so it suggests hitting up your favorite bar tomorrow night. Your favorite band is rolling into town on Sunday and it booked you tickets before you knew to ask for it. It has your wardrobe picked out for your coffee date on Tuesday.

If you ever don't like a decision it makes, you provide it feedback, and the algorithm adjusts. If you don't follow through with a decision, it records that, too, and figures out better decisions that match your enthusiasm level, or comes up with other ways to coax you into action.

Basically, this cuts out all the hemming and hawing about what you should do on a particular night, what television show you should watch to unwind after work, what social activity you should plan for Wednesday. Maybe it even tells you what time you should clock into work, then calculates when your diminishing returns hits a certain point and tells you when to clock out, too.

It tells you when to sleep, when and what to eat, when to wake up, what clothes to wear, where to shop for your son's birthday present.

And maybe it sounds creepy to you to outsource your decisions, but given the way the model is constructed, everything is based on *your* preferences. You never do anything you don't really want to do and eventually the model gets so good that you almost never find yourself shooting it negative feedback.

Your life's better than ever and you're cutting out all the bullshit time you used to spend making a decision, because the software is making those decisions but better AND faster.

I'm sort of at a crossroads.  I will be graduating high school in about 2 weeks, and I've somehow been accepted into a decent school, even with my less than stellar grades.  All the time I hear about how people go to college, and their major doesn't work out for them, and they are back to living with their parents with a student loan debt up to their heads.  I don't want to be in that kind of situation.  I've been fed the idea that not going to college would result in me becoming homeless, or in prison.  I know this is an exaggeration, and I've been considering skipping college altogether and working minimum wage, (or possibly learning a trade), and budgeting/saving wisely.  Has anyone been in a situation similar to mine, and if so, what advice can you give to a 17 year old on the verge of adulthood?

Illegal file-sharing is wrong from a legal standpoint, and a moral standpoint. I find it hard to have this viewpoint on Reddit because so many people are champions of The Pirate Bay; but I don't think a reasonable person could argue differently. As a group they seem to.

Can you argue differently? You're taking a creative work that was created by an individual or group of individuals. This group or individual is subsequently deprived of income. It doesn't really matter if it's a big music company that refuses to change it's business model, does it?

Does it matter that the same companies take people to court to get back their losses? Does that make it more right the next time you pirate something?

My point is that there's a lot of arguments that don't seem to address the moral aspect of stealing from someone. At some point in the line, an individual has been deprived of income, even if it's an individual who will never get a job as a sound-engineer at Sony because Sony doesn't make as much money as they used to.

I am still not 100% happy with the phrasing I chose, but it's the closest I have come to expressing what I want to ask.

Ever so often lately I hear about laws passing (or the threat of certain laws passing) that not only is it obvious they aren't serving the greater populace, they are in fact actively infringing on citizens' rights and trampling on basic freedoms. 

More and more news talk about governments demanding access to personal data and communication information. I read about police brutality, excessive force and illegal searches a few times per month. Laws pass around the world strengthening political immunity, giving politicians the ability to evade reprimanding even when their actions are punishable by law. Governments pass laws that protect themselves even when they're in the wrong, massive corruption goes unpunished, and the ones that pay the price are the people. 

The worst part of this is, a great percentage of those people aren't even aware, or concerned, or able to understand how these laws and mandates *can and will turn against us.* More and more citizens sink into a numb acceptance state of hopelessness, and the unnerving phrase heard more and more often lately is ""what difference will anything I do make?""

So I am here to ask, what can I, and you, and any and all of us do about it? Elections don't seem to work, since to even be considered a candidate for any political position, one needs the support of a deep pocket - which then, of course, has them on a leash. The media world-wide is also controlled by a select few, manipulating and forming public opinion to make-or-break anything. TV channels, radio stations and newspapers aren't as free to report the pure, simple facts as we'd like to think; as far as I'm concerned, the internet is the last frontier, and the battle for its free flow of information has already begun.

I'm studying computer science and do *decently* well in it. I've had a couple internships and all that jazz, I play bass guitar and love to play dems videogames. But i've recently come to a fairly shocking realization: I'm not motivated to do **anything**. Literally anything at all.

 It's gotten to a point where the amount of effort it takes to get myself to class everday is just absurd. I've stopped playing bass for the most part (that was  a long time in the process, though). I don't really even play videogames all that much anymore, somehow the joy of it has just dissipated. When I do play some of my favorite games I get the feeling that I'm just going through the motions, desperately trying to regain that old nostalgic feeling.

I've tried to motivate myself to work on some projects, like design my own app or software or something to that tune, but all that ends up happening is I stare at a blank text editor, maybe define a factorial function (because why not, right?) and then save it and close it ""to be worked on at some other point"", which obviously never happens.

My lack of motivation/laziness has gotten so intense that I don't even smoke weed anymore. **That's right**, I've become so lazy that I don't even bother getting high. I didn't know that was something that could happen, it's like I've transcended stoner and reached some sort of meta-stoner levels of laziness. 

Simply put, nothing seems particularly appealing. I don't feel specifically depressed, I'm not in a dark hole of misery or anything along those lines, I just feel very bland. I don't really want to do much of anything, and when I do go out and ""do"" stuff it feels very forced. It's sort of like I'm making a deal with myself - ""If I go out tonight, then I can stay in and watch re-runs I've seen dozens of times without feeling guilty tomorrow night"".

Ok second example, less 'stuff' in the cardboard: [cat stuff (effing cat!) in cardboard, last year](http://www.vetepet.com/images/feliway_refill_48ml_xl.jpg). And new packaging, [clear plastic with what look like inserts for the labeling, but is actually some kind of coating.](http://www.petco.com/assets/product_images/0/039079056922C.jpg)

A few days ago my dad was taken to hospital where it was later determined he had GBS.  Long story short, it's unlikely (2-3%) to be fatal, but it leaves him paralyzed from the neck down.  It also affects the muscles for breathing, so tonight or tomorrow they're hooking him up to a ventilator and he won't be able to talk anymore.

I live 1000 miles away, but we're going to visit very soon (a trip that was already planned before the whole GBS thing happened).  

My dad loves to read.  He read to us as kids, and I'd love to be able to return the favor, since when we visit he probably won't be able to talk, he'll just be able to listen.

I know next to nothing about books.  I know he's enjoyed reading Stephen Hawking stuff, and I don't know what that implies about his taste in reading...  I'm sure he'd enjoy some lighter material.  Nothing super fluffy though.  I wish I could give you more to go on, but I'm really coming up blank on ways to guide you in the right direction.

My dad's extremely kind and easy going, he's been involved in musical productions (one of which was scheduled to happen during our visit, but obviously won't happen anymore), he's a Christian (a pretty lax one, though - he's fine with swearing, violence, mild nudity, etc), he adores a good scotch..  Hopefully that helps.

I'd say I'm most interested in doing Photography for a living, but I don't see that working in the long term. I enjoy video games, but I feel I don't know enough about the field. I can see myself going into IT, but I don't feel I'd enjoy it as much as the former two, but I still like it.

I am pretty comfortable with Photography, I want to the Governor's School for the Arts for photography and I've had a few Cooper Union graduates tell me I should apply, although considering I've been working a minimum of 40 hours a week my portfolio is what I would considered too outdated to be of use now. The only school I had look at my portfolio for review was MICA, which they accepted although its been 4 years since then.

Worse yet, because I was out of school I never took my SAT. I would definitely need to do a SAT prep class before considering taking it, but at this point I've had a few people recommend just going to community college and transferring out. I consider that the easier option, but since I would not be going to school for another 9 months I don't know if I should just use my small amount of free time to study.

He's 21 and in college. He does **absolutely nothing** wrong. He has no honest motivation to drink, smoke, fight - nothing of the sort. He doesn't party or waste away his time and effort on chasing girls or acting a fool with his friends. He doesn't feed off of welfare, steal, mooch or whine about his shitty position in life. He's probably one of the brightest and most understanding people I know. He wants to be a scientist. He's going places, with or without political sanction.

A few nights ago I got a text from him. ""Honestly, it's hell. I can't legally drive, own property, WORK... all I want to do is be free. I love existence, with a passion that burns, and I'm being punished for it - and why? Because I had the unfortunate luck to be born South of the border? I'm a political criminal who refuses to act like an existential one. I feel like I'm being shackled because I love life and refuse to waste a second of it. Mexico is a disgraceful excuse for a country and I'm terrified of any possibility of going back.""

It kills me sometimes to be able to do nothing but offer an ear and help him financially when I can. He loves to work, but the job he has (under the table) is disgusting - he deserves to be in a lab as an assistant, not washing cars under the pressure of do-or-don't-eat and the hot sun.

Apparently the phenomena is quite normal here (speaking as a Californian). I've researched a bit and so far everything he's told me holds true: there's pretty much *nothing* he can do to a) become a legal resident/citizen within anything short of a year (most websites I'm finding say it can take as long as 10 years) and b) do so without leaving the only life he's ever known and being forced to go back. Also, most require profoundly insane amounts of cash - amounts which are extremely beyond his reach.

to give you some context, Fish is a games developer and has for a long time reacted badly to things online and has said things publicly which have blown up. In this case he and another dev refused to answer certain questions about rumours and were railed upon by people I like to call ""industry critics"" because they so often don't even talk about the games themselves but instead focus on drama and other such issues. So these guys are like a bunch of dicks/cunts which causes Fish to lash out and then to end his involvement in the Games industry and to end development on Fez 2, a highly anticipated gamed.

Now at about 1:50 in he starts to talk about his own experiences with people online. I remember when I first saw a video of his I didn't really like him much but people in the reddit comments *hated him*. I thought nothing of it and moved on. In the video he describes how it'd get to the point where his daily routine included him wondering what insults he'd log onto that day. If somebody would refer to his weight, threaten his family, that sort of thing.

This is where I paused the video and started typing this up because is this really acceptable? This person  creates content about a popular form of entertainment and some people like him and others don't. Except that some people *really* don't like him. They go out of their way to target *this* person specifically for whatever reason (I assure you that it's not likely a good one) and he quite literally ""sucks it up"". He considers leaving the industry but doesn't, lives, learns and is still there today in a situation that may not have changed a whole lot.

You also see this with reddit. People will track you down and threaten you and your family because of something you said or did on a website. Remember when the **creator** of /r/IAmA shut down the subreddit? Did his family deserve the fallout from that? Did he deserve to be put in that situation? No. It's totally unacceptable and **totally unavoidable** at this time. A similar example of fucking with the lives of others would be the Boston Bomber suspect that reddit harassed.

Countless examples of anonymity on the internet being completely and utterly abused. Now Jim and the /r/IAmA creator are people who know the internet and know the score but I don't doubt that they've had experiences that have shaken them to the core.

Why is there no accountability on the popular sections of the internet? I understand that people want privacy, heck why do you think I use this mod account? I don't want the stigma that comes with who I am in real life (and my other online personas) to interfere. I understand the want/need for anonymity but there has to be some compromise.  Innocent people are hurt and harassed and it's appalling. Something has to be done, in my opinion because it gives the internet a bad name.

I phrased my title as such because of an idea that I had when I started typing which has just come back to me:

In order to post **anything** on websites like reddit/youtube/whatever you must be accountable somehow. If you don't like it then lurk.

Self-immolations have been in the news for a while now but I recently realized that I don't know why they are happening. Whenever it appears in the media the reason given is always something vague: to protest a lack of ""freedoms"" or to protest ""government policies."" The Chinese government accuses the Dalai Lama of fomenting this practice.

[Here is a link to a recent article about the issue in the New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/asia/tibetan-teens-die-in-double-self-immolation.html)

My question is, what are some specific reasons why Tibetans are resorting to self-immolations as a form of protest? I know the knee-jerk response is to condemn China for being authoritarian and oppressive, but lighting yourself on fire still seems to be an extreme step to take.

My question is, is this possible given the environmental impact of the average person in such a society? 

For example - Sweden has some of the lowest CO2 emissions in Europe, at 5.3 metric tonnes per capita in 2008. India is at around 1.5 mtpc, so with an increase in living to the standard of Sweden, carbon emissions would more than triple. With over a billion people, that's obviously a huge increase. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is coming up to a billion people also. 

This is an extremely simplistic example, but it seems that as developing/pre-industrial countries move to a standard of living more in line with western standards (as Japan and Korea had done in the mid 20th century), there will be some real challenges surrounding the environmental impact of such a move.

I'm 31 and I don't even live with them but they still treat me like a child and a recent event has pushed me over the edge.  After I give you fellow Redditors a little insight, I propose the question ""how do I go about this as gently as possible?""

My mother has a plethora of psych issues she is in denial over due to a traumatic childhood.  She refuses to get help bc she doesn't think she's wrong.  She is a functioning alcoholic as well.  Her choices whilst raising me have affected my progress in life and while I am cognitant enough to recognize how and work at fixing them, she continues to be a negative influence in my life.

She treats me like an idiot despite my college education and that I am very socio/political/economically aware.  If anyone is familiar with Brittany Murphy's relationship with her mother, it's a bit like that.  My mother never learned how to love so she attempts to buy it.  She's doing that with my son now and I am not ok with her cycle of bullshit.  She is rarely coherant or rational but believes she's better than most people.  She's a hypocrit and she has an overwhelming sense of entitlement.  She berates my parenting despite her choice to leave me in the care of a pedo when I was a child and my college education in ECE.  She has sabotaged my relationships, made fun.of me, talked a lot of shit about me to people, been unsupportive about important issues and overopinionated about ones that don't matter.

Enough is enough.  The tax return scandal, as I call it, is the last straw.  For the last year I have been unemployed due to minor physical disability that I am now in a program to get assistance for so I can get back in the workforce.  She holds this over my head constantly, by the way, both parents do.  So when she filed her taxes this year she decided to get a little more money out of it than she was entitled to.

I was at my boyfriend's house working on my life's acheivement, my novel, which is how I spend most of my time until rejoining the workforce.  She texted me and asked for my ssn.  I asked why she wanted it.  She said she was going to file her taxes and claim me as a dependent.  I facepalmed first and then informed her that she can't do that, it's illegal.  As far as I am aware, to claim a dependent that person must reside with the filer for 6 months and the filer must be responsible for their bills.  If this is wrong, I'm sorry, I must have been misinformed.  Anyhow, I told her why it was illegal.  I stayed with her 4 months last year until moving out.  I tried Tennessee for 2 months with a friend, wasn't a fan.  I ended up moving in with my boyfriend for the remaining 6 months of last year.  She never paid my bills.  I sold off my avante garde painting collection to stay on top of my bills.  She has no right to claim me.  I explained all this and she responded with ""nevermind, I will look up your ssn.""  I texted back and said ""I am not comfortable with you filing me as a dependent, I don't meet those qualifications and it's tax fraud.  I don't want to be a part of it.""  She ignored me for about an hour and finally responded to say ""I already filed with you as a dependent.""

At this point I was irate.  I lied and told her my boyfriend had already filed last week and claimed me because I lived there for 6 months and he took over my bills (in exchange for helping him around the house and acting as his chef).  I informed her that her greed would result in a flag in the IRS system and we'd all be audited.  My boyfriend and I are just two 30 somethings trying to make an honest life, we don't need an audit.  She texted back that she doesn't care.

For years she has destroyed my self worth and hindered any progress toward being on my own.  She does the same to my younger brother, then turns on us.  I simply can't live this way and I refuse to do it anymore.  

Because of their childhood, my mom is close with her sisters and I'm worried that my choice to wash my hands of my parents will result in some backlash.  I suppose I am seeking some well spoken advice about how to gently cut my mother out of my life and not get drowned in a wave of retaliation.  

Consider holidays and family get togethers.  This decision is going to strain an entire family dynamic and I just want some quality advice on how to handle this quietly.

I know I'll never be completely normal according to that scale, but I have the impression that there may be things I can do in order to improve my ability to let  emotion into my life.

I'm just not sure what I could do that would help.   Any ideas?  I figure on a website full of intelligent analytical types,  there must be some people in similar situations...

I'm young, an excellent typist, and generally quite good with English.  I have no relevant formal education, but I would very much like to figure out a way to make small amounts of money (as little as $10-15/day) online.  I want the practice to be legitimate, and I don't want to waste time with the ""Make eight-figure checks every month working from home!"" scams, of which there are certainly many.

I recently spent some time Couchsurfing with a professional online poker player who made rather quite a good living for himself, and while I found what he did intriguing and attractive, I lack his 12+ years of poker experience (and I generally avoid gambling).  I do not feel that is the appropriate route for me!  However, I feel certain there must be another way to generate revenue without putting a huge number of unpaid hours into getting the ball rolling (creating a website, etc.)

This is because statistically, they have more health problems. The opposite is true for the automotive insurance companies. While women are more likely to cause accidents, they are usually minor. Men on the other hand are far more likely to be in fatal accidents. Basically, while women are getting involved in more fender benders, men are totaling cars. As a result, men pay more for their auto insurance.

The truth is that both sides (feminists and mras alike) argue that they are sexist policies. To men, auto insurance discriminates against them just as health insurance discriminates against women.

From any standpoint, it makes business sense to make bigger liabilities pay more. But, you could also say the same thing in regards to making someone with an actual health complication start paying more, yet people would rightfully claim that it's unfair to get price hikes when their insurance actually has to start paying money to support their life.

I suppose you could use the same argument for auto insurance, but the difference lies in that healthcare problems are typically out of your control, whereas automotive accidents are almost entirely preventable by paying attention to the road. In that case, when someone becomes a bigger liability, it's due to their own inattentiveness instead of factors outside of their control.

How I've been moderating as of late has been relatively laissez faire in terms of what submissions I allow, few posts are removed despite my being tempted to, such as [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1cd47d/god_tier_albums_and_why/).

Regarding *comments*, however, I've been stricter. What I do is every so often I open the bigger posts and I go from top to bottom looking for low-effort comments, comments that contribute nothing (e.g. ""hurr, send me the pics"" type comments from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1cfqqz/i_found_a_girl_i_know_on_gw_the_thing_is_she_is/)).

What do you all think of how I'm doing things (the other mods mostly remove/approve posts and we get so few that they don't see much action, so to speak) at the moment? Any criticism? Suggestions?

Also, are you happy with the current state of the subreddit as a whole? The content you see? Now is the time to let your voice be heard about *anything at all* regarding this subreddit.

Also, if you want to get a hold of me for something then please **send me a private message.** Ordinarily moderators prefer the modmail, which I also prefer, but I'm unlikely to see your message due to the huge amounts of modmail I get from /r/funny.

Finally, I am looking to possibly bring some more moderators onto the team. As it is I don't really have an issue with things as they are but I'm a believer of having lots of moderators who all contribute collectively. Please make a comment responding to this post saying why you want to be a mod, what you can bring to the table, what your moderating philosophy is and what country you live in.

I'm not necessarily looking for specific texts about libertarianism or anarchism (I'm still absolutely open to other philosophies, those were just examples), but just *how* I might go about finding out what books or websites or whatever. Of course, I'm also interested in specific texts.

For example, I recently educated myself more in depth about Objectivism and Ayn Rand's philosophies, and while I don't agree with all of her and Objectivist's beliefs, *Atlas Shrugged* will probably be on the lists of books I buy. 

I don't know if this is too vague or unclear, and if it is I apologize.

I saw [this article](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2012/08/a-software-entrepreneur-on-the-madness-of-software-patents-and-trolls.html) and as a hobbyist programmer it really infuriated me. I don't understand how trolls can sue for something that is based on the intended use of the programming language itself.

&gt;We are being sued for having a UI connected to a server connected to a mobile device.  And get this- data goes back and forth between the UI and the mobile device. Break through, right? Yes, according to the Patent Office.

There could be more to the situation than what they're telling us, but connecting to the server via a mobile device is exactly what the programming language is intended to do. Unless they're using someone's API I don't see how this is possible. That's like suing Ford because I made a door that lets people in and out of something, and they have doors on their cars. 

[Here's another example](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/a-new-low-for-patent-trolls-targeting-cash-strapped-cities/). Some patent trolls suing on a queuing system. Really, how can they claim that they invented queuing? Haven't airlines been doing this...forever?

**edit -I want to clarify one thing for non-programmers.**

&gt;connecting to the server via a mobile device is exactly what the programming language is intended to do

I meant that Apple (assuming they're using an iPhone) created the Objective C language (well, it predates them with Steve Jobs popularizing it when he was at NeXT) and gave it the ability to connect to servers. Essentially, these trolls are suing the app developers who use Apple's technology because they’re using it exactly what it’s intended to do.

1) How do you determine negligence? What if there aren't cameras of other witnesses?

2) Do prosecutors take into consideration the background of someone before trying to lay them out with the maximum sentence? (My background in law pretty much consists of Law and Order episodes where ""Life in Prison"" seems to be all the want to charge people with)

3) What penalties are there for involuntary vehicular manslaughter? Even if it's found to be completely at the fault of the pedestrian, are there any repercussions for the driver?

4) I always hear that pedestrians always have the right of way. Is this true? The other night I saw some guy wearing all black and walking on the side of the freeway where there were no lights. What would happen if he was hit? Isn't it illegal to walk on the side of a freeway where cars are going 70 mph? I always pay super close attention and I barely saw him.

I think they very much misinterpreted my question, although back then I had asked it somewhat differently.

In this modern world, many of us are atheists and empiricists. We (we referring to atheists and empiricists, especially the latter) no longer see an after life, and realize that the ultimate point of life is not for any greater meaning than to perpetuate itself. While this is fine and logical, there is something that has been bothering me of late: eliminating God and spirituality from our lives; seeing only what is actually there to the best of our abilities - do these things not eliminate a certain element of happiness from our lives?

An elucidation: happiness can derive from more than just religion and spirituality for a certainty. There are still things to live for, such as love and family - i.e., the perpetuation of life. However, it seems to me that there's an emptiness remaining. Before we do find love and family, what is there? A frantic search for a life partner? We can't even objectively prove that humans are monogamous creatures overall, and on top of that the functioning human relationships we hold seem to forbear and sort of actual objectivity.

Perhaps I've answered my own question in my head as I wrote this, but I'm interested to hear all of your thoughts.

I am **not** interested in hearing ""life having no meaning implies that we can create our own meaning."" If that's your answer, you interpreted my intentions incorrectly.

**Edit:** I think some of you are under the impression I'm a disenfranchised religious follower. For clarity, I have never had a religion nor have I had an inclination towards it. It is actually because of this that I ask this question - it seems people who have religion in their lives have something to turn to when there's nothing else.

In the US, as the baby boomers retire there will be a sizable increase in high level, high paying jobs available to the ""up and comers"".",42,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1kb6ls/is_there_any_validity_to_this_line_of_thinking_in/,"Fact: Unemployment rates are rather high and its tough to get a job out there. 

My thought: High level Cxx (CEO, CTO, COO... ect.) type jobs will be unmanned as the baby boomers leave their posts and retire. In effect this would create a ripple down all levels as the next in line gets promoted on up, opening their position to the next in line, so on and so forth, until the entry level positions open up again for the newly graduated. 

With all of these open positions there will be a focus on obtaining the most qualified person at first until its slim pickings. This, in part, can, and I assume (with no facts to back up my claim), will lead to a higher standard of hiring new employees. 

While in the short term the new regime may lead to companies failing due to lack of leadership, knowledge, experience, and/or drive, it can push for those individuals on the teetering edge (complacent individuals satisfied with the status quo) to make real change for the future of the companies they work for. Whether they step up to the challenge themselves, or recognize their faults and hire new employees with the hope they can make a difference, it's my belief that this is for the overall betterment of society. 

All that being said, I truly feel that there is too much stock taken in a persons diploma that the major factors of doing well in any particular job are looked over. I feel there needs to be a focus the critical thinking of any one individual as opposed to what classes they've passed in college.

* Newspaper Writer/Designer: this one applies to me. Would it be better to have someone who can cough perfection onto the page with little effort and no motivation, or have someone who loves writing but needs a little help editing every now and then.

* Teaching: I've had teachers who were so smart they actually could not understand why the class was having trouble with things. While other teachers may not have the test scores as some, they enjoy enlightening the minds of young people.

Case in point, the most recent article about the [police officer who tasered a kid because he refused to wash his car.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1fomnn/til_a_cop_in_new_mexico_tased_a_10_year_old_on_a/) In reality, the cop just made a dumb mistake and accidentally left the cartridge in when he was showing the kids his taser. Also, many of the ""politics"" articles are about sensationalist and about the stupidity of Republicans and Democrats, and there is no discussion of actual politics. 

Now, is this not what news stations do? They take a story bend the truth and sentionalize it to draw viewers.

I've come to you guys to find out what you think about it.

If WWII didn't occur, we wouldn't have the type of world government we have now (the United Nations). It's reasonable to think that this world confederation has served as a deterrent for war between nations. NATO and the Security Council often step in to try to resolve conflicts before they escalate to having mass casualties (when respect for sovereignty is decided to be less important than the lives saved). The majority of the nations of the world actively support efforts to maintain peace in foreign countries by imposing sanctions or supplying troops to peacekeeping missions. This level of international cooperation never existed before WWII.

Without this added deterrent, it's possible that we could be sitting in WWII right now, due to any number of possible political conflicts (capitalism v communism, [Mussolini's fascism seeking to expand](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/mussolini-fascism.asp), continued US colonialism into the Americas drawing in other foreign powers seeking to expand their influence, etc). I'm not here to argue how it could happen just that it's possible.

I think it's also reasonable to think that a world war now would be orders of magnitude more devastating than a world war from 70 years ago. The weapons that we have now, the level of globalism, and [the world being 3 times as populous as it was in 1940](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates). Although all of these many not be the same in this scenario as they are in real life due to the lack of WWII, the trends that caused them would still be there. If the nuclear weapon had been developed, it's possible that it would be used a lot more extensively in a modern world war than it was in WWII.

Also, the Holocaust greatly spread awareness of possible crimes against humanity. Without it we wouldn't have had the Nuremberg Trials, which set the stage for even the existence of human rights. The terms genocide, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace never existed until the Allies tried to find a way to prosecute Germans in charge of the Holocaust. Without the awareness we have now about the possible atrocities that can occur under the worst of circumstances, a modern day Holocaust would be much more devastating for the same reasons that a war would be deadlier.

Also, please note that I'm not trying to say that I'm glad that WWII and the Holocaust happened. I'm simply trying to envision a world in which we would have been worse off without the knowledge that WWII taught us. Those events were obvious tragedies, but if given the chance to go back and reverse them, I wouldn't. The world is intact and relatively peaceful now, compared to how it was before the creation of the somewhat powerful world confederation we have now (as compared to the League of Nations).

What is happiness exactly?  Is it momentary or permanent? 

Is it achieving the goals you set in your life?  I'd have to say no.  In my experience while achieving your goals feels good, it doesn't take long before a new goal is set.  

Is there happiness in pursuing our goals?  I'd say desire covers that better.  

Is there something to the fickle nature of happiness and it's relationship with desire? This is where what I like to call the ""drive cycle"" happens.

When we begin our independent lives we're told to do what will make us happy, but knowing what will sooth all your angst now and in the future is a fools bet.  So we choose.  If we're lucky we chose something logical and can at least maintain our independence.  If we're unlucky we choose inline with our passions and often end up back at our parents to regroup. I suppose there are the few that do find a purpose and allows the purpose to drive them. This isn't for them.

Both the lucky and unlucky will find themselves wanting something more and the cycle starts over.

Introspection &gt; Desire &gt; Determination &gt; Accomplishment &gt; Discontent &gt; Introspection 

This cycle is the result of the Idea that happiness needs to be pursued.  If this sounds like fun to you by all means carry on.

If it doesn't then another strategy is needed to get there.  Problem is ""get there"" is another pursuit. 

 Instead of touch and go happy maybe there would be more content people if peace was paramount.  I would say you're at peace when your essential needs are met and you can observe the present.

I am an Australian, currently completing my last year of secondary school. I have just over a semester to go, and in the past two months, my motivation levels have just plummeted. I never used to be like this, up until now I used to be a dedicated and diligent student. I'm not the smartest student you will come across, but I feel as if there are expectations for me do VERY well at the end of the year. 

Anyway, a little more on the lack of motivation. Here are some examples.

* I can't bear to study for more than 15 minutes at a time, often with large gaps in between 
* The amount of time school takes up gives me little to no time to pursue my passion (playing guitar) 
* I see no point in trying hard or spending any extra time of my day in order to get the results of my entire 13 years of school summed up into one number that doesn't even mean a single thing in regard to the university course i wish to undertake
* After deciding to take a year off after finishing this year, I am beginning to realise that the only thing that is really important is that I do what makes me happy without becoming detrimental to others or myself, which is certainly not working at an office or at a desk - it is exploring and learning more about the world through experiences 

As you can probably see, I am at a bit of a loss here as to what to do. I KNOW that i should care about my grades and doing well, and deep down, I think I do to some extent, but I feel like I have prematurely given everything I possibly can effort wise, and from here, it is just turning into a downward spiral. 

So, my request is a simple one, motivate me! 

tl;dr:

r/TrueAskreddit, motivate me so much that I want to fight a fully grown silverback gorilla

This sounds a bit silly, but a couple months ago my left testicle started to hurt suddenly, like a dull ache that would come and go. Immediately I was flooded with thoughts of cancer, hospital beds, and eventually death. After getting an ultrasound on my scrote it turns out I have a completely benign condition affecting the flow of blood in my nut (called a varicocele) so I can live to troll another day.

But the craziest things happened to my brain during this ordeal. Laying in bed alone one night (before having seen a doctor and admittedly super blazed) I started having these visions of my corpse laying on a metal board being slowly pushed into a fire for cremation. I had a vivid experience of my flesh burning off and my bones turning to ash and, needless to say, I wigged out a bit. My life felt like a sand castle built near a quickly rising tide, I felt like a very small, insignificant, fragile animal on a spinning ball of (beautiful) rock.

When I was in the throes of this ""life is ending"" thought, it was like my consciousness started to get fuzzy, my reception to the outside world was really distorted. It's hard to find accurate words for this, but everything started to feel very dreamlike and fleeting. I became shockingly aware of my existence and my place in the universe, I realized that as surely as I was born I am going to die one day (like the first drop at the beginning of a roller coaster when you think 'maybe I don't want to do this'). One of the funnier highlights of my experience was a revulsion to the words 'die,' 'death,' or 'kill.' I was trying to play a game in my Steam library called Orcs Must Die and freaked out at the name and turned the game off (it's a fucking silly cartoon game where you lay traps to commit genocide upon braindead orcs).

I've had other, uh, 'visions' since then. One night after laying my head down on a pillow I felt as though I was in a hospital room waiting to take my final breaths. I saw my grandmother die this way, she was a very spiteful and bitter woman who died with fear in her eyes and a lot of regrets. I've also experienced a little fear at the thought of decomposing or being buried as well. I'm an atheist and I believe death to be a lot like the time before our birth - a lack of existence. But sometimes I ask myself how the fuck my conscious being came to be pulled out of this great void and willed into existence... if that can happen once, can it happen twice? Has it happened twice? The idea of life starts to really blow my mind, it's like a dream you would deny you ever had after your death. It makes the idea of 'permanence' seem almost pointlessly abstract, it also made me question the value of physical possessions over experiences and memories.

On one hand I felt tremendous fear, but on the other I felt more appreciative of this weird gift called life. It's incredible to consider that it took 14 billion years for your life to pop into existence and for all we know we'll be dead for another 14 billion. It makes me feel really close to everyone on this planet, all the issues that tend to divide people seem paper thin. If everybody on earth spent 10 minutes a day meditating on death we'd probably live quite a bit differently. What do you think?

To do this a lot of these companies don’t offer great employee policies, pay average wages, release people from positions etc in order to cut costs, stay competitive in the market and have a good share price. As that’s what the shareholder wants – a good share price: money.
I’m not saying I agree or disagree with this, I really just wanted some other people’s opinion so I can see what some other people's perspective.

My father has just passed away at a relatively young age. I have had very little contact with him for the past 15 years, and he has lived in another country (where my family comes from) for most of that time. Other than a trip I took to Europe 5 years ago, I haven't seen him in this time. I also have a sister ten years younger that hasn't had any contact with him since she was just starting grade school. My parents had a messy divorce and my mother did not want to have him in her life, but never precluded us from seeing him. He did very little to maintain contact with my sister and I over the years even though he had a means to.

Having heard of his failing health from relatives I did call him this past week and spoke to him twice before he went to the hospital. This was the first time speaking to him on the phone in years and our only communication was a few emails here and there. He said he was in bad health but did not allude to the fact that he was dying. He had a history of alcoholism which contributed to his poor health.

I guess I'm looking for other's with similar experiences. I'm feeling more confused than sad about this situation. I don't know how to feel. Even after all this time I still resent him for not being there, especially for my little sister. At the same time he is my father, and I can no longer blame him for his alcoholism like I did in my childhood. What can I do to help my sister through this situation as well. I have never talked to her about my father, but my mother has told me that even though she doesn't like showing it, she's still very hurt from him not being there for her.

In the next week or two I will be flying to Europe for the funeral and to deal with his apartment and other things. My mother hasn't shown interest in going, but did ask my sister if she wants to. Currently she says she doesn't know, and we're letting her make the decision as she is a college aged adult, but I don't know if maybe she will regret one day not going.

1365180389.0,19,self.TrueAskReddit,1bqqns,Would you adopt this model of funding online content?,25,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1bqqns/would_you_adopt_this_model_of_funding_online/,"**TLDR: Would you pay a tiny amount of money ($0.15 / £0.15) to fund online content you enjoyed instead of seeing adverts?**

Hey everyone,

I thought we could start a discussion about how online content is currently funded and why advertising is the wrong model.

Firstly, [this article: *Why advertising is failing on the internet*](http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/22/why-advertising-is-failing-on-the-internet/) from Tech Crunch explains all the main reasons why the current advertising model doesn't suit online content.

I highly advise you read that article, but ultimately advertising fails because of these 3 reasons:


1 - Consumers do not trust advertising

2 - Consumers do not want to view advertising

3 - Consumers do not need advertising


This view is supported by stats on browser ad blocking extensions:

- Firefox adblock - Over 197 million downloads ([link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/statistics/?last=30))
- Google Chrome adblock, two popular extensions - Over 20 million downloads ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/adblock?hl=EN))

This was brought up by the Vlog brothers (two popular youtubers) who asked the community to suggest alternative funding options. That thread can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1adkeb/hanks_discussion_content_and_how_to_fund_it/)

To summarise, people were talking about the idea of micro transactions using bitcoins. For example, say you watch a youtube video and thought it provided a lot of value / made you laugh / etc, you could then send that youtuber 10p / 10 cents worth of bitcoins for that video. The reason why it must be bitcoin is because of the extremely low transaction fees of sending money (think it is 5 cents atm but might be lower in the future). If you aren't familiar with Bitcoins, check out [this video](https://www.weusecoins.com/) that explains them, and or check out the bitcoin sub reddit: /r/bitcoin

Also Mozilla made a blog post yesterday about introducing web payments in browsers. [Link to article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/introducing-navigator-mozpay-for-web-payments/)

Small amounts of money isn't a lot for one user, but added up it has the potential for a large sum of money for the content creator.

I started thinking how awesome it would be if websites / youtube channels had absolutely no adverts / networks, but one box somewhere on the page where users can send 15 cents (or whatever) at the click of a button. 

Some benefits of this include:

- Creates a better user experience because there are no distractions / interruptions of consuming the content
- Encourages content creators to focus on value rather than ad impressions (as people will be more inclined to pay if the content has value)
- Improves the design of the internet. For example it would stop random adverts placed between content
- Means people who use adblock have an alternative way to financially contribute to the content they consume

Now all of this depends on the consumer behaviour of people using bitcoins online and the ease of sending micro transactions. However I am willing to bet that people are willing to pay 15 cents for a month's content for a website / youtube channel. Especially if that content isn't negatively affected by advertisement. But not only that, I want to find out if people would tip random content they find (articles / videos) if they enjoyed it. So say a video is linked on Reddit and it's really funny, I would happily give that video creator 15p.

The key is that the micro transaction has to be extremely easy to setup and use, something that although isn't done just yet, people are actively trying to fix (check out bitcoin sub reddit and search it a bit, some have already made facebook apps).

1346519337.0,22,self.TrueAskReddit,z6v96,How does one support gay marriage and oppose incestuous marriage?,48,26,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/z6v96/how_does_one_support_gay_marriage_and_oppose/,"First off I'd like to say that I wholeheartedly support gay marriage, and this is not a thread about the merits of that institution. Rather it is for those that already support it. I also do not feel any sort of attraction towards my siblings, this is a theoretical exercise.

Also note that it is not a ""slippery slope"" argument. It's absolutely ridiculous to suggest that allowing consenting adults to marry will lead to men marrying cats and cats marrying dogs, as you sometimes see espoused by nutcases. But there-in lies the crux of the matter, with the phrase ""consenting adults"". If we accept that two consenting adults of the same gender can experience love just as validly as any heterosexual couple, and that they should be afforded the right to the legal protection of marriage as-well as the chance to express their love, then why not a brother and sister.

There are few counter-arguments that immediately spring to mind, and I'd like to address them. First is the argument that the laws against incestuous marriage are there to protect the vulnerable, because oftentimes incestuous relationships are abusive in nature. However this exact same argument has been used to oppress homosexuals for decades. In Britain one of the oft-quoted reasons for the banning of homosexuality was that all homosexual relationships consisted of older perverts corrupting the youth into one-sided relationships, and this continued even after legalization in the disparity between the ages of consent, 21 for homosexuals and 18 for heterosexuals. I don't know if there have been any large scale studies done on the subject, but I know I have encountered in the news examples of incestuous relationships that were obviously NOT abusive or exploitative in nature, between two consenting adults of similar age. And so although there may be some cases of abusive relationships, it is obvious that not ALL of them are.

The second is that it somehow defiles the sanctity of marriage, or that it goes against the laws of nature. Well, anyone who has followed the story of gay marriage will probably know the arguments against this, I don't have time to go into, but briefly speaking the idea of ""marriage"" is a loose construct that has changed drastically over the centuries, from the polygamous ownership of women, to a institution only for couples of the same race, and then only for those of different genders. The idea of marriage having some inherent set of rules for sanctity is often based on religion, and that's a whole other barrel of discrimination.

Thirdly is the idea that it doesn't happen often enough to warrant changing the rules. Incestuous relationships are relatively rare, so why bother legalizing it? Well exactly the same argument could be made against homosexual marriage, and surely it is the minorities of our society that need the protection of equality and freedom the most?

Lastly is the fact that incestuous coupling leads to children with birth defects. Well, firstly, marriage is not necessarily all about procreation (see: couples that are infertile, homosexual couples.) By legalizing incestuous marriage you also don't necessarily have to condone incestuous childbirth, and surely if two siblings are in love they're going to have a baby if the want one anyway, marriage or no marriage. However this strays into the realities of law and it's execution in the real world, and this is intended more as a moral argument. Secondly, older women who give birth are more likely to have children with genetic disorders or birth defects, but the idea of banning them from having children is unthinkable, and essentially the foundation of eugenics.

The poster provides evidence to suggest that feminism, or more specifically, the breakdown of the family unit was a primary factor in the collapse of Rome.

It is evident that many western countries are following this same path - therefore I was wondering, do you think the poster's conclusions are correct?

I am inclined to think he is correct, especially revealing is this part of the comment:

&gt;~1-2 century AD: The family unit is destroyed. Men refuse to marry and the government tries to revive marriage with a ""bachelor tax"", to no avail. Children are growing up without fathers, Roman women show little interest in raising their own children and frequently use nannies. The wealth and power of women grows very fast, while men become increasingly demotivated and engage in prostitution and vice. Prostitution and homosexuality become widespread.

Another poster replied with the following:

&gt;So, what I'm getting at is men need motivation to channel their energies into building things. And there exists only one thing in the whole wide world which can motivate enough men to work together: having their own families. No amount of shaming or monetary rewards can motivate enough men to voluntarily slave their lives away in soul-crushing jobs. We are at a stage where the government is actually forcing men to work (child support, alimony, etc), but all those with eyes open know that this is SLAVERY and will not work in the long term. Feminism strips men of their families, thus strips them of their motivation to build civilization. It does not really matter if you call it ""feminism"", the relevant point is that any (political) movement which destroys families destroys civilization as well. You must be either blind to not realize this or evil if you don't care - even moreso if all this is pointed out to you in black and white. It's not some fake conservative whining about ""values"", this is how the world works. And rest assured, if men begin to ""slack"" in vast numbers, women will NOT grab the shovel and do the dirty work. This is why matriarchal civilizations collapse.

I am a disabled veteran, I served in the United States Marine Corp.  I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.  While this term is widely recognized as too broad and will be redefined in the DSM-V.  I am a poster child for this disease.

Because of my illness I am unable to manage my own finances.  As such family typically takes on the role of payee (federal fiduciary.)  I received a ""back pay"" check to the tune of almost $40,000.  This money is in an account that I have no access to it.  I also must have approval from the VA to have any of the money spent.  As such I have limits placed on my expenses.  Such as, when starting a new house with my wife a $2000 limit was placed on furniture purchases, when all we had was a couch, and my daughters bed.  I am an avid gamer, however I am not allowed to have money to replace it, because it runs Windows 7 which to the VA means that it is new enough, even though it will barely run modern games.

Today I learned that my step-grandmother (47 years old), was allowed to withdraw $6000 from this account, because I lived with her and my grandfather (77 years old.)  I lived with them for almost a year, and for half of that time I paid them $300 a month, which is what the VA representative said would be a fair amount to both parties.  I live in Hannibal, MO.  where rent is fairly cheap.  My grandparents in no way were placed in financial burden because I and my 3 year old daughter lived with them.

As an added cost to living in the house, I and my daughter were forced to go to church, every time the church doors opened.  I am an atheist.  I never spent less than $500 a month on fast food, avoiding her meals, that is if she even deemed it necessary to have a meal.  Sometimes, she would call ahead, and say she was bringing home dinner.  For instance, if she went to taco bell, I got a taco, my daughter got a taco, my grandfather got a taco, she got 3 burritos, and her 12 year old son got 3 burritos and a quesadilla.

While rules to living in a house are normal and acceptable, I lived with rules and they were never a problem.  Rules like, no beer.  However rules of forcing you to go to church, not so cool.

I lived in that house, and accepted the rules as necessary to provide a stable house for my daughter.  I do not regret this.

However, my grandmother taking $6000 of my money, is beyond reprehensible.  I wanted to buy an engagement ring and a wedding band for my wife, guess how much I got?  $400.  My grandmother gets $6000 plus the $1800 I paid her, plus another $300 I was forced to pay her when I hadn't even lived in her house for a month.  What am I left with, what can I do.  $7800 for a year staying with family.  I am just blown away.  I don't know what to do.  I don't want the money given to me so I can spend it.  What I want is for her to be punished, and that money put back into my account, where it is available, should I need it.

I know all of you are awesome, wonderful, intelligent people.  Please spend a few minutes of your time to help me out.  Even just a ""hang in there"" comment will help.

As of now, my belief system includes the fact that every thought is worth having because it shapes you in relation to that thought. This also accounts for positive and negative outcomes of that ""reshaping"" process. The fact is that *Change* occurs, whether it be good or bad, ""forward"" or ""backward,"" and stagnation does not.  
 
However, both a student of mine and my roommate disagreed with the idea, saying that just as much as an idea/thought shapes you and changes you, it also does not account for *true* change. ""Everything is nothing"" or ""Nothing is everything"" battle.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but both seem to fall back to the optimistic/pessimistic outlooks on life. I still feel that having a(ny) thought is better than to claim a thought ""worthless.""

I have been reading a lot of ancient works recently, and I am intrigued by how I see little hints and glimmers of very modern ideas and concepts floating around in works written thousands of years ago.  Over the last few months I have read the following books trying to get a good sampling of major schools of thoughts: *Book of Mencius* (Confucianism), Lao Tzu *Tao Te Ching* (Taoism), Plato's *Dialogues* (Platonism), Lucretius *On the Nature of Things*(Epicureanism), the *Bhagavad Gita* (Hinduism), *Questions of King Milinda* (Buddhism), Hui-Neng *Platform Sutra* (Zen Buddhism), Plotinous (Neoplatonism), Augustine *Confessions* (Christianity), Ibn Tufail *Hayy Ibn Yaqzan* (Islamic Sufism), then I got a little tired of metaphysics and read Newton *Principia* (Deductive Rationalism) and Darwin *Origin of Species* and *Descent of Man* (Inductive Rationalism).  [On a side note, feel free to suggest any other schools of thought you think I might have overlooked in my sampling and preferably a good example of said school. Adam Smith *Wealth of Nations* is on my list, but I haven't gotten to it yet.]

I am taking an economics course and my brain is desperately seeking out consequences of ancient thought on modern economics, but I have come to an impasse.

Probably the most obvious answers lie in religious traditions forcing people to act against their own economic best interest (tithing, alms giving, etc.).  Taoism provides insight into the spontaneous nature of the market and the effects of intervention.

I have an explanation for this view. My view is that government is too large. My agreements with the libertarian view come from my agreements with less taxation, smaller government, and leaving more up to the people, and less up to our ""rulers"". In saying that I want a lot of these things, like our imperialistic military to face the chopping block, I also inadvertently put disability and welfare programs on the chopping block as well. I understand why you view this as hypocritical. I believe that a government-mandated, no-opt-out method of caring for the disabled and less fortunate in our society is the wrong way of addressing the problem. Even if I currently benefit from that system, even if it is the current best fit, I would like to see something better in its place. Something based on the decency of society, not the taxation of society.**

I also posted this in askreddit but I think this might be a more appropriate place to ask it.

From a very young age I was stricken with physical illness. Unable to go to public school, and even unable to tolerate freshly printed materials and schoolbooks, we started on the process of homeschooling.

I learned how to read with a stick in the dirt in my front yard.
I got my first computer at age 4, enabling me to finally read things other than extremely old, aired-out copies of things.
By the time I was six I was reading 20 year old+ aired out copies of tolkien, and doing algebra. When I was eight my parents couldn't really teach me much more, and I took my education into my own hands.

At ten I finished high school, took the SAT, and scored well enough to be shipped off to nerd-camp, also known as the Johns Hopkins University center for talented youth program, for a few weeks a year, for two years in a row. Even the short trips that I made stretched the financial ability of my family as far as it could be stretched, and although I saw incredible gains in my health during the short period of time that I was in california, at UCSC, santa cruz, I could not afford to live there in permanence.

I had three attempts at attending public school, grades three, four, and six. When I was placed in these grades, it was always by the basis of being near peers of my age, not peers of my education level. Apathetically cruising through the material, I never learned much, and invariably there would be some event like a kid dropping a bottle of cologne in the hallway; I miss a lot of class, I drop out. Back to the homeschooled/self taught drawing board, when that happened.

With the exception of the trips to santa cruz, CA, and the brief attempts at public school, the rest of my education came solely from the assignments my parents gave me as a young child, and more importantly the self-study I did once I had computers and the internet available to me.

In my years of illness and sleepless solitude, my unquenchable delirious quest for knowledge, I didn't have the normal set of peers to draw self-definition from, through comparison. This is something that most people take for granted. In many cases what may be a socially or religiously learned concept will have much less weight with me than it will with others. I'm not about tradition, I'm about cartesian doubt.

I have delved very far into the subjects that interest me: philosophy, psychology, physics, theology, meditation, perception, solipsism, etc.
I see a fundamental flaw with the way most higher education is conducted in our universities, this is the tendency to only teach what is considered directly related to your profession. We quote the long-dead renaissance minds that gifted us with notions of such strength that we still use them today as the foundations of reason, yet we fail to recognize that each of these men tried to do something more than just learn one field. They tried to learn everything, they tried to make it all unified and make sense, they tried to explain the world in a satistfactory way.

My belief is that the pursuit and spread of free, empowering knowledge is the highest moral pursuit available to a man. I may be disabled, so my utility to society in terms of physical labor is nearly nonexistent, but this only further reinforces me on the path of education. The practice that my mind is most suited towards is asking these deep philosophical questions, in my opinion, and because it is a rarity to have the ability to ponder them in such a way, I believe there is at least some form of responsibility for me to see what my mind may produce for the benefit of the society which is supporting me.

I do not want to come off as egotistical in that last sentence, so I'll clarify; what I mean by ability is not necessarily an advantage of cognitive ability, but an advantage in having a monthly disability check, removing me comfortably enough from the daily struggle for food and shelter that others must deal with.

I'm making this post because, although I have come very far, it is a very intellectually lonely path I have chosen. In the state of kansas where I currently live, there is noone who really wants to talk to a libertarian, humanistic buddhist like myself. There's no real accreditation or certification of my countless hours of study to be earned; the notion that my ideas will only carry weight when I have invested enough money for my scroll of paper is alien to me.

In the pursuit of the goals I have already set out upon, what is the best way forward? I have thought of moving to a college town with fresh air, trying to find a university with programs for cheap/free classes for the disabled, trying to find some form of intellectual kinship so that I can advance my ideas and have anyone to bounce thoughts off of.. even if this means dealing with the flaws I view as inherent in our education system as it is today.

1351523158.0,15,self.TrueAskReddit,12a00v,Is there a better way than FEMA to manage natural disasters? [Warning: wall of text],27,12,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/12a00v/is_there_a_better_way_than_fema_to_manage_natural/,"I should probably preface this by saying that I'm a liberal of the bleeding heart variety, although I prefer to consider myself ""politically moderate"" and that I happen to side with democrats on the vast majority of issues. I also happen to be studying for an actuarial exam that deals with the topic of disaster relief, so I thought it would be a good time to ask this.

I saw comments about Romney/Ryan wanting to defund FEMA, and it brought to mind something that I've been thinking about. Although I don't support defunding FEMA, I must admit that the program is kind of a mess and needs some serious reform. And so I began wondering what kind of system would ideally protect individuals from natural disasters while saving taxpayers money.

The issue is that people live in areas that are prone to hurricane and flood damage. For the purposes of this discussion, I'll consider flood damage, but this could apply to any natural disaster.

The federal government provides flood insurance (it's the only real flood insurer in the US) through the National Flood Insurance Program. The program was designed to try and save taxpayers money in a few ways:

1) People who have flood insurance won't need to draw on federal emergency aid to the same extent as those who are uninsured

2) The flood insurance program encourages individuals to mitigate their risk of flood damage by meeting certain building codes, building in places that aren't floodplains, etc. It gives grants for this purpose.

3) The program (through FEMA) does extensive mapping of flood plains to help individuals determine risk.

4) Theoretically, by providing lower insurance premiums for lower-risk individuals, people get an economic incentive to *become* lower-risk by undertaking loss mitigation activities or moving out of floodplains.

Communities are able to participate in the NFIP if they agree to follow certain zoning restrictions and undertake flood mitigation efforts.

Sounds good, right? In fact, studies have suggested that a dollar spent mitigating flood damage (preventative measures) saves $4 for taxpayers later!

But the problem is that participation is low. The government made it mandatory for individuals in high-risk areas to own flood insurance if they get a mortgage from a federally regulated lender, but as many as 50% of people in high-risk areas don't own flood insurance. Of those that do own it, 22% are receiving subsidized rates that don't reflect the actual expected damages from floods. What this means is that when a flood does occur, the taxpayer STILL foots the bill. Insured people collect from their insurance, but people who knowingly lived in a floodplain and DIDN'T get insurance still get compensated. And this means that there's very little incentive for them to purchase flood insurance unless they have to. And since there are high upfront costs to loss mitigation activities, people don't undertake them unless you pay them to do it. So although it's in the taxpayer's best interest for people to meet building codes, elevate or relocate their houses, etc, it doesn't happen because we give people little economic incentive to do so.

As you can see, in a way, federal disaster relief undermines the system of federal insurance that is intended to save taxpayer's money.

So what's the solution? This is where I get stuck.

Suppose you say ""flood insurance is mandatory for everyone in the US."" Well, if you charge everyone premium equal to their risk, first of all that's not affordable for low-income people, particularly in flood-prone areas. Second of all, you would provide incentives for poorer people to move away from coasts and richer people to move into coasts, which could create some unusual depressed areas and a whole host of potential other weird problems. Thirdly, how could you compel purchase? Who would crack down? And what if people get caught off-guard without insurance? If you then pay them using FEMA funds, doesn't that again undermine the requirement to buy insurance? But I'm under the opinion that the social safety net function is extremely important, particularly for affordability issues for lower-income buyers.

What if you had a socialized cost of flood insurance? Now you lose incentive to protect your house. People in low-risk areas are paying for people to live in high risk areas. It doesn't make sense, since the point is to provide incentives for people to mitigate their losses in the interest of the taxpayer. If the price you are charged isn't commensurate with the risk you pose to taxpayers, why would you have any incentive to change if it won't affect your costs?

Finally, if you had a hybrid system in which you charge an amount appropriate to the risk but provide subsidies to low-income buyers, then you may have issues where rich people mitigate losses but low-income individuals don't.

As you can see, FEMA is fairly inefficient - if you provide disaster relief without giving people an incentive to help prevent damage from disasters, you wind up spending 4x as much money. And everyone hurts because taxpayers foot the bill. But if you try to charge people amounts equal to their damage risk, then you get all kinds of weird problems with affordability and you lose many of the important social safety net functions that are so valuable.

What's the optimal solution that doesn't completely cut people loose but saves taxpayers money and is more efficient than FEMA?

Providing disaster relief directly may cost taxpayers a lot more than providing insurance for a fee, but it provides social safety net features that are important.**",,False,,t5_2s91q,False,,,True,t3_12a00v,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/12a00v/is_there_a_better_way_than_fema_to_manage_natural/,

I am 21, living in long island NY, my parent's moved in with my sister when she bought a mother/daughter house in 2005 (right before housing bubble exploded). I was signed out of high school in 2006 by my mom, who later in the year passed away suddenly to a brain aneurysm. 

My dad is on disability and has been since I was 2 years old. I took over my mom's job at the small company most of my family worked at, company was downsized and all new / cheaper employees were hired, everyone else was let go, this was in 2008.

In 2009 I got a new job that I still have, it's from home. I wasn't able to get my permit until recently due to my dad not having proper ID and me needing 6 points to verify my identity + being 21 or older.

Now that you have a small part of back story here is what I need advice on.

I have zero credit, my only work history was off the books, how can I build my credit? (Also note: asking for help from family isn't an option)
How can I go about getting car insurance, obviously after I get my license, that won't cost an arm and a leg.

I pay about $2,300 a month to live here (with my dad but his disability only provides $1000 a month). If I move out, my sister will most certainly lose this house as the mortgage company is already threatening to foreclose.

I am trying to get a customer service job from home hopefully to start after xmas / newyear. I have a good ok amount of experience in CS field (2-3 years). Does anyone know of a legit way to work from home?

I am hoping to be able to save up some money after I get 2nd job, but moving sooner than later would be fantastic. Unfortunately the only options I can find require 2-3 months security, good credit, just as expensive. Anywhere on long island NY would be my choice as I could get my dad to come with me, he doesn't want to move out of state because of grand children. I should also note that I have 2 cats and a small dog (cockapoo), I don't think I would be able to give them up, I have had my eldest cat since I was 13, I got my younger cat after my mom passed away, and my dog has helped me finally get help for my anxiety / get out of the house (agoraphobia is a bitch).

Will asking my employers for assistance help me or will it draw attention to my shortcomings?,17,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1efbp9/i_have_some_bad_workplace_habits_heavy_internet/,"**Background**

I work in a small accounting firm of around 20 people. I have my own office. Almost 100% of the work which I do is on my computer, which has 100% open access to any site on the internet. As far as I know, there is no tracking or monitoring of our internet usage. A few years ago, the bosses did implement a webfilter, but quickly removed it as they were uncomfortable viewing and controlling their employees web habits.


I have a long running issue with abusing my internet usage at work. I have timed my overall browsing and I average well over an hour or two per day. I have tried many different techniques including things like browser extensions like Siteblock or Stayfocused, but the issue is that I either break and disable the extension, or I just browse websites I haven't blocked, or simply use one of the other browsers on my computer.

I have also tried some other methods such as breathing techniques to try to curb my distractions, but ultimately the temptation of reading interesting things on the internet far outweighs the tedium that is being an accountant.

I am constantly racked with guilt. I feel that the quality and amount of my work is suffering due to the amount of time I spend browsing aimlessly. I really want to be a more productive worker. I want to learn more about my field rather than learning trivial or banal information from the internet. I want to be a less of a scatterbrain to improve my relationships with my workmates, friends and significant other. 
I have come to the conclusion that I will need to remove my use of the internet from browsing while at work to achieve this aims.
I think the best way to do this will be to ask for a filter that I cannot disable myself. I have had some success with using a browser based filter, but it is far too easy to bypass. 

**The issue**

I am uncertain about what the ramifications of asking for a voluntarily internet filter may be.  


 * Will my employer look favourably upon me for being pro-active with my problem? 
 * Or are they more likely to look back on my last few months internet usage? 
 * If I ask the question and they are unable or unwilling to help, have I then tipped my hand to my employers and they will now know I spend hours on their time not working? 
 * Will my position become untenable once my employers are aware of my usage?


I guess, in short, is it possible for me to ask my employers for help with my internet addiction, or am I just as likely to draw attention to my bad habits? I want to change, I know I will need help, but I am very afraid that my actions will only act to incriminating myself.

Looking at the definition of Fascism, Mussolini's Italy, not Nazi Germany, seems to be the most purely fascist country that has ever existed.

I've never been here before, but I wanted to open up a thread in light of events that took place today. My girlfriend was fired from her job at Babies'R'Us today, for an alleged theft of $42.79 on a gift card.

Their Corporate Asset Protections manager interviewed/interrogated her for about thirty minutes, got a testimony, then asked her to sign a form stating she would pay the store back the $42.79. She agreed, signed the form, and was terminated immediately afterward. She was never given a copy of that form, never told of the evidence they had against her, and was never informed of an investigation. She's never had a write-up with the corporation, and has been, in the words of her managers, a model employee. She was a keyholding manager for the last two months, and there was another incident with their HR that recently caused another termination. My thinking is they're related.

The reason I give you this backstory is so I can ask you what to do next. We are both unemployed, though I am getting a license in massage therapy within the next weeks.

What actions could she take against Babies'R'Us if they were proven wrong about her alleged theft? 

Would she be able to take unemployment benefits after working there for 2 years?

What would you recommend she do in this situation, given the information above?

I'm doing my best to comfort her and be with her, but there's only so much my words and arms can do. Hopefully you can share your stories about situations similar to this, and maybe through this thread we can find some solutions to the problems we're now facing.

Some background:

I'm 20, grew up in a suburban area, am currently in my 5th of a planned 9 semesters of college a state away from home that my parents are paying for. I'll admit before I start that I have a good life as it is.

Here are my problems:

**First:**

I didn't have a 'solid' group of friends until my senior year of high school, when chance brought me to the group I have now. These guys, before we all left for college, are people I would have trusted with anything. We'll call the closest ones S, T, and J. S went out of state for school, and T and J went to community colleges near where we live. S had to come back due to money issues after our freshman year. T moved downtown, about 30 minutes away, to be closer to school. J still lives at home. Recently, as I've been home on breaks, I've noticed that there is a distance growing between us. T and J both got in to relationships, while S has been in one for a while. S hasn't let his interfere, but T and J seem more focused on their girlfriends than on their friends to the point that it is injurious to our friendship. I want to make a change in this, but I'm not sure how. I'm really just worried that I'll lose friendships that I really value.

For the record, S and I are still on fine terms, and nothing has changed between us. I'm only concerned about the other two.

**Second:**

However, far more importantly, I'm simply very unhappy with my life as it is. That isn't to say that I'm unsatisfied with what I have. Rather, I feel like I don't have a direction. I am confident in my choice of majors, but I can't confidently say that my job prospects out of school would make me happy **in the long run**. Moreso, I started a business with another friend, A, over the summer, and I love it. I love working toward it because it has *always* been a dream of mine to own my own business. However, the progress we are making is starting to stagnate, and with a relatively busy schedule it's hard to keep up with school and my company as I need to. I would be more than happy to drop out of college for a year to get a foothold with the company, and then return to finish my degree, but my parents refuse to allow it in that I will be kicked out of my house and they will not pay for the remaining years to graduate. I know that would be a huge barrier to future progress, but I'm worried that as it is I want so much more to do well in that business than college that my performance would be severely hampered. On top of that, there are a lot of things I'm dealing with at school that I feel like I'm battling every day for no reason. Their existence is justified, and I brought them upon myself originally, but it's getting harder and harder to tell myself that I shouldn't just cut my losses and try my luck somewhere else.

In other words, I feel like my life is stagnant. I am not happy at my school and I feel as if I could better occupy myself with my business but I can't leave school without huge consequences for my future finances. I need advice on where I should go with this situation.

Do you personally believe there are situations where we should get rid of the responsibility to pay child support, or should separated parents always be responsible for providing financial support?

To get the discussion going I'll start with some examples:

1. A parent is (in court) denied shared custody, but still allowed some contact with the child.

2. A parent is denied shared custody as well as any contact with the child.

3. The custodial parent has a new spouse who acts as a stepfather/mother. 

4. A couple unwantedly conceive a child; eg. condom breaks, pill is forgotten or lied about, etc. The mother goes through with the birth against the father's will (no plan b or abortion).

5. A child is unwantedly conceived during a one night stand and the mother goes through with the birth against the father's will.

I've always been a huge fan of the source material, but I've noticed that above all of King's other works it seems to be remade the most. Is the Carrie story going to be one of those modern myths that's consistently revisited and reexamined or is it going to disappear eventually?

Why is the story still important to audiences? Is it the body horror aspect of a girl facing puberty? Does the story of a loner and high school bullying keep it alive? Is it the telekinesis (I doubt it's just that or we'd see versions of Matilda every ten years too)? Or does it have more to do with the success of King and the original DePalma film?

I'm curious to hear your opinions.

I consider the most essential resources to be food, water, shelter and leisure time/a source of dopamine or other endorphins. Basically, not only do you have to keep your body alive, but you also have to have something that you enjoy doing or that makes life worth living.

Because of this, I don't think that solving world hunger, for example, would be as momentous an achievement as is commonly claimed. Certainly, it would be a step in the right direction, but it isn't really an end in itself. If no one dies of hunger, ever, but some people have to work 14 hours a day in order not to starve, there's still work to be done.

As a result, I see education as a way to end poverty on a more permanent level. If people learn how to think and have access to critical thinking skills, there will be much more innovation and the quality of life will improve for everyone, not just the poor. How many potential scientists or engineers or doctors have died poor and uneducated because they were born into a situation which they had practically no chance of escaping? When I envision a world without poverty, I see a world in which everyone can fulfill his potential.

* When has the government (be it the US, the British Empire, USSR, etc.) ever not been intrusive/potentially oppressive? 

* When have the rich and powerful ever not been in control?

* How often to revolutions actually work out for the best? Of course there are some examples, but it seems like there's just as good  or better odds that you'll just replace one set of assholes with another.

Haiti democracy model is inefficient. The way the people elect their leaders, the way the government pass the bills are inefficient. Our democracy is a failure. Human rights, justice, healthcare, education, employment, welfare are utopian notions for the Haitian people. ""In corruption we trust"" seems to be the motto of all public or corporate institutions in the country. Corruption is in fact the right way to accomplish anything. While the world progress, Haiti is moving backward. For every step taken forward, we make 10 steps backward. The Haitian people might be the first black country independent but we never been so enslaved than we are now. Haitian dreams and opportunities are constantly drowned by corrupted politicians and their corrupted promises, policies and laws. Some people want to believe, think and live differently but a reality check is always too deceiving. Manipulated elections, international pressures, natural disasters, low access to quality education are just the tip of the iceberg formed by the Haitian chimera. Who can blame the Haitian who lost all hope? If you were born and raised in this country, you would understand that resignation might be the only way to cope with the struggles. If you are Haitian, you surely know that ""Bouche nen w, bwè dlo santi a"" (Pinch your nose, drink the stingy water) is what we've have been doing for the past 2 centuries. How can you blame the tamed horse after you made it believe that all resistance is futile? An history full of riots, coup d'état, assassinations and exiles had tamed the Haitian to surrender.  Surrender has been hardwired into our mind. The Haitian who still thinks about change nowadays is either a fool, a dreamer or both. This is the mental state of the average haitian; hopeless.

Take for example the situation in the film _Children of Men_: everyone in the world has become infertile, and no more babies are born at all.

EDIT: The point that people would be generally unhappy with forced infertility (due to the desire to have children as a life-fulfilling aspiration) is something I hadn't considered. In the _Children of Men_ case, therefore, I can see how it would be justifiable to try and discover a way to allow people to procreate again.

My thoughts and discussion inside.",15,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1h9em5/why_is_the_progressive_movement_proud_about_the/,"So since the DOMA ruling of 2013, Gay's have the right to get married, as long as the state allows it.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said, 
&gt; ""By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute violates the Constitution.""

This landmark court hearing has opened up a lot of doors never though of before! Seen as a landmark case for human rights. But what about those farther on the fringe of human inequality?
I'm talking about incest and polygamists.

Macklemore even said himself in the context of gay rights, 
&gt;""Its the same hate that's caused wars, from religion, gender to skin color. It's the same fight that's led people to walk-outs and sit-ins. It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference""

Think about that for a second. Human rights for EVERYBODY. So why is the progressive movement shunning incest and polygamy, if their movement is closely based on what Macklemore said. If the basis of the DOMA case has been pretty much, as long as you love each other and you are both consenting adults, you should be able to marry. Yet people who who fall under those two categories, incest and polygamists, are looked down upon not only by the heterosexual world, but by Gay rights activists as well!

So why is the progressive movement nit picking what movement it wants to support and what movement they look down upon? If they are truly a progressive movement, the only place left to go forward, is to go support the cause of people who prefer incest and polygamy.

Now, I know people are going to say that ""But incest and polygamy is against the law!"" Well, so was Gay marriages up until this week. ""But its weird and unnatural!"" Well, thats what people thought about gay marriage in the past as well. IMO, there should be no reason why the same people looking to have their rights confirmed by the SCOTUS, are hating polygamists and people who prefer incest. If anything you should support their unequal rights because they are in the same boat as you were in the past! If you believe otherwise, then you are just as bad as the people who sought to deny your right to equal marriage rights under the eyes of the law.

That's just my thoughts, comments? questions? discussion below!?

And as a afternote, I am in no way a polygamist or person who enjoys incest. This thread was solely made for discussion and thought. Apparently, other subreddits seem to downvote that kind of behavior, for thinking against the hivemind and norms of society. I probably didn't touch on some subjects or fallacies with my argument. Please discuss. **And for the love of god, read the damn reddiquette before you effin' downvote.** 
&gt;**Vote.** If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

&gt;**Dont Downvote** an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

**Tl;DR** - should incest and polygamy be included along with the SCOTUS case decision of DOMA 2013. It'd be better if you just read the whole damn text wall for discussion sake.

My second question is: If you think something about this subreddit should change, what might that be?

Now the DOJ is claiming that they can operate under laws that the US public does not need to know about.  Bush stated that he introduced the PRISM program to protect the United States, spying on its citizens in order to protect its citizens.  Now, without much information at all, the internet is up in arms over the NSA's transgressions.  But do we know that the spying and PRISM is a definitively bad thing?  

We are reportedly losing privacy because of the spying, but is there any way the public can know how many lives have been saved by the NSA's spy program? Do we know that the NSA hasn't prevented numerous terrorist attacks with their program?  And if they have, do the hypothetical lives saved potentially outweigh the breach of public privacy? 

Is the privacy breach really a big deal?  If the NSA is spying on the entirety of the American public, then they have to keep tabs on 300 million people.  I'm going to assume that they haven't planted cameras in my house and that they are spying through phone tapping and internet history.  Chances are, the NSA doesn't have a million people constantly listening in on conversations and reading through the porn sites we visit.  It probably all goes through a program that flags key-words and phrases to be reviewed later.  My point is, it's not like there is always somebody listening to our conversations 24/7.  Most of our phone conversations and internet history will likely never be seen by another person, only a computer program.  So how much is our privacy really being breached?  People aren't exactly disappearing into the night thanks to government agents, are they? 

Finally, why are many redditors deifying Snowden?  The guy broke the law, shouldn't he be tried?  How do we know that he really was leaking all of the information to help the US, and not simply to become the next Assange?  If he were operating in public interest, why release information through newspapers, and why release information regarding US cyber-attacks on Iran?  How do we know this guy isn't as crooked as the rest of them?  

Lot's of questions, I know, but I am genuinely interested in what you guys think.

My main argument is that human nature is competitive and assertive, and that nobody will be content with such equality. He refutes this by saying this is a capitalistic notion. I also implored that the ruling ""masses"" would eventually be corrupted. He refutes this, as he says they would have the  worlds best interests.

I also suggested that you just can't account for the unexpected, and that anything that could go wrong would go wrong. He says we would learn from these mistakes.

I'm sure many of you have seen the news of the recent knife attack in London, and probably also the subsequent video of the attacker. The UK media and government have all labelled this an act of terrorism, but this sits very uncomfortably with me. 

To me, the words 'terror attack' bring with them all sorts of connotations of a major, indiscriminate attack on the general public, but this situation looks like an isolated incident on a targeted individual. Calling it a terror attack only seems to be serving to stir people's fears.

It is a city with a downtown and suburbs and all that, although once you reach the ring road ([maps link](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=edmonton&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.540715,-113.425598&amp;spn=0.336632,0.891953&amp;sll=53.511735,-113.465424&amp;sspn=0.673724,1.783905&amp;gl=ca&amp;hnear=Edmonton,+Division+No.+11,+Alberta&amp;t=m&amp;z=11)) there is little else, relatively.

My question is basically, what is it like in a major urban centre like L.A. or New York City or any others? I have visited a few cities (L.A. for Disneyland, Orlando for Disneyworld, Manhattan on a school trip) and it just blows my mind how immense and urban it is. Along the highways I could see buildings for miles and miles, and was astonished to learn I had crossed multiple cities on the way from the airport to Anaheim, when it all looked like continuous development to me.

First question is economic. In Edmonton, a majority of the economy is based on the oil &amp; gas industry (for services, manufacturing of parts, engineering work, etc.). In somewhere like L.A., is it mostly based on tourism? Is the population so big that there are a vast variety of industries and such? Or where to generally most people work?

As well is it true people live in different cities and commute to other cities for an hour, two hours, more? There are small towns and such around Edmonton but most people will live close to or in the city, with probably an hour at most for commute. I live in the suburbs (still a part of the city) and I can get downtown in 20 to 30 minutes.

Another questions: is it possible to find true wildnerness in the 'states? I'm sure there are places to go hiking, camping, etc. to get away from the city, but I'm wondering if it is anything like here in Canada. Less than an hour outside of Edmonton I can be camping and hiking in a secluded forested trail, or a couple more hours and I can be in a vast &amp; almost empty forest of the foothills or actually in the rocky mountains of Jasper National Park. It is hard to describe the scale of emptiness, but I have been on ATV trips where you could spend days riding through the forest without running into people or settlements.

Yes, Romeo and Juliet was one of Shakespeare's most successful comedies, and one with more elements of romance than others. I know that.

I suppose the core of my question, is how has it maintained its status as the epitome of the romance genre. Romeo and Juliet is without a doubt one of the most recognizable love stories of literature, but am I the only one who feels that's a bestowment entirely out of character?

It seems that if there's any element absent in Romeo and Juliet, it's ""love"". Romeo and Juliet's families both hated each other, it was essentially this blind fury. That blind ignorance was so deep, their children had to go to exstensive lengths so that one day they may be together. Keeping that in mind, Romeo and Juliet's families essentially killed them. 

On another note, the side characters are no peaches either. Tybalt killed Mertrucio, because Tybalt (by today's definition) was bullying Romeo and Mertrucio stepped in to defend him. In response to that, Romeo later kills Tybalt. Even though Romeo avenging Mertrucio is actually understandable, Mertrucio was killed under the most shallow of reasons. It was a shallowness so much so, that it's plain right ridiculous. 

This is my opinion, but the more prevalent forces in Romeo and Juliet, were ignorance, and a deep seeded blind hatred. Maybe it's just because I'm a glass-half-empty guy, but with such recognizable connections of hate that follows the same formula of the fueds of ""Romeo and Juliet"", I find it a little baffling those emotions are so quickly disregarded given the plays reputation. Love, and Hate, are just as viable, and powerful as the other.

1361545620.0,2,self.TrueAskReddit,190ue9,Abortion and contraceptives are wrong and akin to murder... according to my Catholic friend. What are good topics to bring up to show different sides of the story?,4,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/190ue9/abortion_and_contraceptives_are_wrong_and_akin_to/,"My friend and I have gotten into a heated debate about abortion, and she just sent me a link explaining why contraceptives are wrong as well. 

Her stance is that every form of abortion, no matter what the reason is that it's murder and her reasoning boils down to pure emotion. 

The initial route trying to say that the woman has the choice was shot down by her because she said that it's murder and there is no justifiable reason to commit murder.

I have brought in factual evidence and cases where abortion is not only not murder, but extremely justified, such as rape, or in cases where it's guaranteed the child will be born with significant birth defects, diseases, or will be born into a family with no financial means to care for the child. 

She retorted that ""First off, congenital diseases are not common...and the ones that do have them, we don't know that the child is suffering. Who says that? Science cannot say that the disabled child is suffering. I've seen disabled children and their parents and they both seem happy."" 

I gave a specific example of congenital heart disease, the most common defect which affects 1 in 100 children. Most don't survive past one, and if they do, they will rarely reach adulthood. Those that do will deal with it as a life-long disease and have a much lower quality of life...especially since congenital heart disease is also linked with other defects, such as neurological ones as well. 

She basically said that it's still murdering the child and that they deserve a chance to try to live. Her stance is purely emotional.

For the sociological/economic reasons, she stated that the child can be put up for adoption if the parents strongly feel that they can't care for them. I replied by stating that, ""yes, it's true...they can join the other 150 million children who are orphaned and have no stable home. How is that a proper lifestyle? How is that fair to the majority that will never be raised and cared for by a proper, loving family? How about the huge economic impact this causes...here in the US, the costs of the orphaned children are covered by government subsidization and other social aid programs...which is ultimately paid for through taxation. (Note: I am pro these social aid programs)""

She then sent me a link about contraception and how it's wrong
http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dear-pro-lifer-is-there-any-way-to-prove-that-contraception-is-wrong

It discusses different forms, from condoms to chemical contraceptives, basically saying it's wrong and immoral because it breaks the link of intimacy because it prevents fertility, which is akin to murder.

I haven't started on tearing the article apart, but I will bring up points such that it reduces the risk of STD's, unwanted pregnancies, and has many other positive uses. I will also bring up points such as those who are infertile...masturbation and how animals do it, and simply how abstinence will also be wrong because it prevents fertility. 

Basically the entire argument on her side is based purely on emotion. Her arguments may hold some water if we lived in an absolutely perfect world where there is no pain or suffering or harm to others, etc...
What bugs me is that I can't seem to use any evidence-based logic as it doesn't work. Her education history consists of all homeschooling (since she moved around a lot as a child as her family is all former military and it was hard to change schools all the time).

In short, can anyone offer some different views and discussion points I can use?
